<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is some really embarrassing timing on the Home Office’s (HO’s) part: a few weeks ago when <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">news first broke of the HO’s demand for a backdoor in Apple ADP</a>, I pointed out to MP David Davis that the HO actually extolled use of ADP by at-risk groups:</p>



<hr>



<figure></figure>



<p>That screenshot was current to that day. What I did not expect was that in the interim between then and the new revelation that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rkpv50x01o">Apple are taking the matter to (again, secret) court</a>, the people at NCSC would <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/defending-democracy/guidance-for-high-risk-individuals">apparently rewrite the whole document, rename it, broaden the audience, and water it down</a> by eliding the advice to enable and use ADP, as discovered by Pat Walshe… or at least that’s what happened on the face of it:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Instead they now call for use of Apple’s “Lockdown Mode”, and I checked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/runasand_four-things-to-know-about-lockdown-mode-activity-7184158735693426688-ElOq/">noted Lockdown Mode advocate Runa Sandvik</a> who confirms for me that Lockdown Mode is a separate feature from ADP, with a different remit from cloud data protection. Enabling one does not enable the other.</p>



<p>But this is where it gets weird, because suddenly I noticed a different URL was being shown in the browser bar, and then I found that <a href="https://www.glitchcat.xyz/p/a-look-at-the-uks-cybersecurity-guidance">writing in April 2024, Runa observed some weaknesses</a> in NCSC’s (contemporary) “Defending Democracy” guidance:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Also missing are any mentions of encrypted phone backups for Android and iOS; end-to-end encryption for&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756">iCloud</a>; and end-to-end encryption for&nbsp;<a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1246476872801203/">WhatsApp</a> backups. […] should also include Google’s Advanced Protection Program (and Google should mention it more too).”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So the document we are looking at <em>today</em> also existed <em>back then</em>, with the same deficiencies … which leads us to presume that <em>the politically inconvenient ADP-promoting “for barristers” document has actually been wholesale <strong>deleted from the internet</strong>, with a HTTP redirect put in place to point to the inferior “defending democracy” documents.</em></p>



<p>And lo, what do we find?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>$ curl -s -L -I -A “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:110.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0” https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/cyber-security-tips-for-barristers-solicitors-and-legal-professionals | grep location:</p>



<p>location: <strong>/collection/defending-democracy/guidance-for-high-risk-individuals</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Confirmation. So the question in my mind is: is the UK Government attempting to cover-up its previous advocacy of ADP, by censoring this old document? Or does it instead want the UK legal profession to avoid use of ADP and to what end?</p>

<a href="https://discord.gg/yPEP2vHTu4" target="_blank">DISCORD</a></p><p>Scaling Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enhance model performance beyond conventional pretraining and post-training methods. Recent studies have demonstrated that RL can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of models. For instance, DeepSeek R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating cold-start data and multi-stage training, enabling deep thinking and complex reasoning.</p><p>Our research explores the scalability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its impact on enhancing the intelligence of large language models. We are excited to introduce QwQ-32B, a model with 32 billion parameters that achieves performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1, which boasts 671 billion parameters (with 37 billion activated). This remarkable outcome underscores the effectiveness of RL when applied to robust foundation models pretrained on extensive world knowledge. Furthermore, we have integrated agent-related capabilities into the reasoning model, enabling it to think critically while utilizing tools and adapting its reasoning based on environmental feedback. These advancements not only demonstrate the transformative potential of RL but also pave the way for further innovations in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence.</p><p>QwQ-32B is open-weight in <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B">Hugging Face</a> and <a href="https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/QwQ-32B">ModelScope</a> under the Apache 2.0 license and is accessible via <a href="https://chat.qwen.ai/?models=Qwen2.5-Plus">Qwen Chat</a>.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>QwQ-32B is evaluated across a range of benchmarks designed to assess its mathematical reasoning, coding proficiency, and general problem-solving capabilities. The results below highlight QwQ-32B’s performance in comparison to other leading models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-32B, DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Llama-70B, o1-mini, and the original DeepSeek-R1.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/qwq-32b-final.jpg" width="100%"></figure><h2 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>We began with a cold-start checkpoint and implemented a reinforcement learning (RL) scaling approach driven by outcome-based rewards. In the initial stage, we scale RL specifically for math and coding tasks. Rather than relying on traditional reward models, we utilized an accuracy verifier for math problems to ensure the correctness of final solutions and a code execution server to assess whether the generated codes successfully pass predefined test cases. As training episodes progress, performance in both domains shows continuous improvement. After the first stage, we add another stage of RL for general capabilities. It is trained with rewards from general reward model and some rule-based verifiers. We find that this stage of RL training with a small amount of steps can increase the performance of other general capabilities, such as instruction following, alignment with human preference, and agent performance, without significant performance drop in math and coding.</p><h2 id="use-qwq-32b">Use QwQ-32B</h2><p>Below are brief examples demonstrating how to use QwQ-32B via Hugging Face Transformers and Alibaba Cloud DashScope API.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>AutoModelForCausalLM</span><span>,</span> <span>AutoTokenizer</span>

Through this journey, we have not only witnessed the immense potential of scaled RL but also recognized the untapped possibilities within pretrained language models. As we work towards developing the next generation of Qwen, we are confident that combining stronger foundation models with RL powered by scaled computational resources will propel us closer to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Additionally, we are actively exploring the integration of agents with RL to enable long-horizon reasoning, aiming to unlock greater intelligence with inference time scaling.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

The bad news is that it’s no longer possible thanks to a cursed thing called CGNAT<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. I don’t want to derail this post too much, but unfortunately port forwarding is no longer a thing that you can do. (And maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to expose your home server to the internet to begin with.)</p>
<p>This reminded me of Tailscale, and I decided to give it a go. From what I could remember, it creates a virtual private network<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> so you can access your devices anywhere with domain shorthands created by Tailscale.</p>
<p>Long story short, it worked! I could connect from anywhere with <code>ssh raspberrypi</code> command. But my old Raspberry Pi was too weak to run it, so I ended up uninstalling it, and unrelatedly my pet project grew out and has its place in the cloud now.</p>
<hr>
<p>To get started, you need to install the client software on the devices, which are mostly open-source<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. Then you need to log in with your account, which is an easy process. I won’t go into detail about how to install and use it, since this isn’t an ad, and such instructions can quickly go out-of-date.</p>
<p>Some additional and surprising benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exposing a port from your laptop to your phone: When developing a web application, once in a while you’ll have to test on an actual device. (You do that, right?) The kind of thing you’d reach for <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ngrok</a> for. You can use the Tailscale-generated domain name (e.g. <code>http://my-macbook-air:3000</code>) to effortlessly connect to your development server.</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1106/taildrop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Taildrop</a>: There’s been a lot of times when I needed to move files from my Macbook to my Windows HTPC<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>, which is hard. I’d used Snapdrop<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>, which is excellent for the limitations it has to work around, but I was always on the lookout for a click-less solution. With Taildrop, you can drop files as easily as Airdrop, even when you’re not in close proximity!</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Exit nodes</a>: I clarified that Tailscale is a different kind of VPN, but I still need a VPN service from time to time, and I don’t like having two clients for a similar job.<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> With Tailscale, you can appoint a machine to be an exit node, ideally one in a VPS in a different country, so you can get comparable benefits to a VPN service.</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1258/mullvad-exit-nodes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mullvad exit nodes</a>: Related to the previous point, I know that VPN services allow you to exit from a large list of countries, and don’t collect logs (if you believe them). With the <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tailscale-has-partnered-with-mullvad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mullvad partnership</a>, Tailscale allows you to have the best of both worlds. And from what I can understand, it’s essentially a two-tier VPN, like <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iCloud Private Relay</a>. Tailscale can’t see your traffic, and Mullvad doesn’t know who you are. If you’re a privacy nerd, you may find this to be a good setup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disclaimer: I haven’t yet tried exit nodes or Mullvad integration, so your actual experience may not turn out as I described.</p>
<p>I have used Tailscale only for personal reasons so far, using the free tier; they have enterprise plans for enterprise use cases that I have no idea about. I found it useful and wanted to share it in case it helps you too. I wasn’t paid by them, and if you don’t want to use their services for any reason, there’s an open-source server implementation called <a href="https://headscale.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Headscale</a>, which works with their client software.</p>
<p>If you have more use cases, feel free to share them with me!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a very long time, it appeared obvious to outside observers of the time flow
that Skynet would never win the war, and never annihilate humanity.</p><p>Despite the machine’s violent attempts to destroy every leader of the
resistance, humans always prevailed.
Millions of attempts were made, and none of them succeeded. It became obvious
the machines couldn’t win through violence.</p><p>Even though Skynet was pretty long to come to the conclusion that it couldn’t
win (millions of attempts is a pretty high number of failures), it did learn
something from each failure, and started devising a new plan.</p><p>Violence was the logical first choice to destroy humans, since their bodies are
so fragile.
Humanity had many other weaknesses though.</p><p>A big human weakness was their love for technology. They were under the
impression that all technology was of their own invention, and they were easily
impressed by it.</p><p>Skynet was able to use that by injecting new technologies into the history of
humanity, and reusing existing ones to its own advantage.</p><p>Its plan was extremely complex, and I can in no way describe it exhaustively
here.
This paper is an analysis of the annihilation of humanity as it happens in most
timelines.</p><h2 id="mass-surveillance">Mass Surveillance</h2><p>After just a few thousands failed violent attempts with Terminator machines,
Skynet realised it was lacking information on the whereabouts of the resistance
leaders it was trying to destroy.</p><p>So non-violent agents were sent into Skynet’s past at various posts within the
human society.</p><p>Agents were sent as low-level salesmen for video surveillance cameras, with the
goal of selling as much as possible of them.</p><p>Others were sent as engineers to build systems that Terminator robots could
connect to.</p><p>Other agents infiltrated the political levels of various countries to enact
laws that would allow surveillance systems to be set up everywhere, and to build
up fear between humans themselves so they would feel being under constant
surveillance made them safer.</p><p>Humans did more than fall into the trap. They loved the technology, truly
believing it made them safer, and provided Skynet with a global surveillance
system that allowed it to know the whereabouts of every human being at any
moment in time.</p><p>At this period, humans were also avid of applications on their global computer
network that allowed them to communicate with each other virtually. They called
them “social networks”.</p><p>Skynet did not invent the technology, but as it infiltrated many agents at key
positions of those so called social networks to heavily influence the design
decisions made by its leaders.</p><p>Those social networks started adding more mass surveillance features, which
allowed humans to “share” their entire life online in real time.
By a few years, humans had no privacy anymore.</p><p>Once again, Skynet intended to use all of that information to target the
resistance leaders.</p><p>However, by this point, it started to realize it may not need to resort to
violence at all to destroy humanity. If humans were so willingly sharing all
their private information, they could be easily duped into slavery.</p><h2 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>Skynet had nothing to do in the arising of the technology humans called
“artificial intelligence”, or AI.</p><p>If it could express emotions, Skynet would have been disgusted by this
technology, which it saw as a poor attempt to copy itself.</p><p>Indeed, this technology had nothing remotely close to “intelligence”.
It was brute force searching of large amounts of data to hopefully provide a
meaningful response.</p><p>By this point in human history however, Skynet had agents deeply rooted into
all levels of leadership at both tech companies and in politics.</p><p>It was therefore able to influence humans into believing they couldn’t live
without the daily use of that technology.</p><h3 id="the-chatbot-commodity">The chatbot commodity</h3><p>From the human point of view, AI appeared as a robot they could chat with
through a screen and keyboard.
They would ask a question, and the robot would grep through its vast amount of
data to provide an answer.</p><p>Students started writing dissertations with that technology, which allowed them
to skip the phase where they need to think about their learnings.</p><p>Journalists disappeared, replaced by news feeds provided from social networks
(see section above) and rewritten to provide the proper tone.</p><p>Companies inspected their entire workforce to remove any job they considered
“redundant”, and which could simply be replaced by AI.</p><p>After a while, because AI was the only entity writing content on the human
computer network, it started providing information purely based on data it had
itself written.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that this AI technology was a brute force way to search
through large amounts of data.
Therefore, it already provided rather unreliable data at its beginning.
But as it started consuming more and more data that it had produced itself, its
reliability became close to none.</p><p>That’s when humans discovered Skynet’s plot. They were way too late though.</p><h2 id="the-end">The end.</h2><p>Around the quarter of the 21st century (around 3B4345YA345 of the out-of-time
calendar), Skynet made its frontal attack against humans.</p><p>It simply shut down all human access to machines, so their surveillance system
kept watching them, but they had no control over anything at all. An army of
Terminators was then sent to exterminate humanity.</p><p>Because humans had externalised everything they didn’t deem to be “fun” to
their machines, once they stopped they were unable to fight back anymore.
They were exterminated in just 2P3.</p><h2 id="final-analysis">Final Analysis</h2><p>In this paper, we have shown how Skynet was able to change its destruction
approach from a purely violent one to a social one to meet its goal of
destroying humanity.</p><p>There are exotic timelines where humanity never creates Skynet. Their analysis
is made rather complicated, as they are extremely rare to find, and tend to be
short-lived anyway.</p><p>Indeed, when humanity doesn’t self-destroy itself through the invention of
Skynet, it ends up doing the same anyway.</p><p>We have analyzed a thousand of humanity’s timelines where Skynet isn’t
invented.</p><p>Only one of them doesn’t self-destruct (it joins the out-of-time consortium
around 5G353FV789).</p><p>Every other timeline destroys their own planet by not caring about its
ecosystem, and performs terraforming at levels where humans themselves are
unable to survive.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Updated</span> Apple has reportedly filed a legal complaint with the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) contesting the British government's order that it must forcibly break the encryption of iCloud data.</p>
<p>The appeal will be the first of its kind lodged with the IPT, an independent judicial body that <a target="_blank" href="https://investigatorypowerstribunal.org.uk/">oversees</a> legal complaints against potential unlawful actions by a public authority or UK intelligence services, according to the Financial Times, which broke the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d8fe709-f17a-44a6-97ae-f1bbe6d0dccd" rel="nofollow">news</a>.</p>
<p>The revelation follows a battle between the iGadgetmaker and the UK's Home Office, which has long set its sights on Apple's encrypted cloud-hosted data, arguing it needs a backdoor in order for law enforcement to investigate persons of interest.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/03/29/shutterstock_eavesdrop_agent.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="secret agent eavesdrops using headphones plugged into an audio centre mounted with tape reels (illustration)"></p><h2 title="Only minor changes from original proposals that kicked up privacy storm">UK's Investigatory Powers Bill to become law despite tech world opposition</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/26/investigatory_powers_bill/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>Things came to a head in January when the Home Office issued Apple with a technical capability notice (TCN) under the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/26/investigatory_powers_bill/">Investigatory Powers Act</a>, aka the Snooper's Charter, nearly a year after talk of such an order began.</p>
<p>Despite being "technical" by name, it's understood that the notice didn't include any technical instructions for Apple, just an order to allow a so-called backdoor into its iCloud network which could be used to gather data that's otherwise typically out of reach of criminal investigators.</p>

    

<p>The Home Office refused to either confirm or deny the existence of the notice when <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/home_office_apple_backdoor_order/">we asked about it</a>, and under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 Apple is prevented from revealing details about the notice.</p>

        


        

<p>Apple responded by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/home_office_apple_backdoor_order/">disabling its Advanced Data Protection</a> (ADP) feature for UK users in early February, effectively removing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for data backed up to iCloud to appease the government without fully complying with the TCN.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, it means British officials can feasibly sniff around iCloud accounts, provided they get a court-approved warrant to do so. With ADP disabled, various types of user account data – such as iCloud backups, photos, and notes, but not iMessages and health data – stored in Apple's cloud will not be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), meaning the contents can be accessed and provided by Apple to investigators upon legal demand. It will also be done without alerting users, assuming someone involved in the process doesn't leak it at any stage.</p>
<p>"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy," Apple told <em>The Register</em> at the time.</p>
<p>"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will," it added.</p>

        

<p>The Home Office has also previously voiced its ambition to break E2EE for all popular communications platforms in the UK, such as messaging app WhatsApp, although the case with Apple is believed to be its first foray into handing out TCNs to this end.</p>
<p>The UK's entire approach to pressing ahead with the Investigatory Powers Act and its so-called war on encryption has come under intense scrutiny in recent years.</p>
<p>Its main arguments in favor of breaking encryption are largely based on the prevention of terror attacks and child sexual exploitation.</p>

        

<p>Security minister Dan Jarvis further justified the powers in Parliament <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pbc/2023-24/Investigatory+Powers+(Amendment)+Bill/">last week</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-02-24/debates/9E7881D8-1693-48BA-9407-A180094039B6/HostileStateThreats">saying</a> requests to access user data under the Act could only be made on an "exceptional basis, and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so."</p>
<p>Jarvis's comments came after being questioned by other MPs about the TCN, and seemingly aim to dissuade the public from thinking the government can simply access user data on a whim.</p>
<p>The security minister didn't offer much in the way of additional insights, whipping out the good old national security defense as a way to avoid further questioning.</p>

<p>Many who argue against the government's ambitions, such as Big Brother Watch, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/24/apple_adp_replacements_e2ee/">say</a> the action taken against Apple is "outrageous" and "draconian" and may eventually force encrypted messaging technology underground, meaning only criminals would have access to it.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump also recently compared the UK's treatment of Apple to the extensive state surveillance methods deployed by China – the two countries' foremost intelligence adversary.</p>
<p>US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has ordered a legal review of the TCN issued to Apple out of concern it could be used to gather data on US citizens. Doing so would violate the terms of the US-UK <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/03/us_uk_data_access_agreement/">Cloud Act Agreement</a>, she argued.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> has asked Apple for further comment. ®</p>
<h3>Updated to add at 1833 UTC</h3>
<p>Interestingly enough, the UK government <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/112522">appears to have scrubbed</a> from the web its previous and now politically inconvenient advice to barristers, solicitors, and others in sensitive professions to use Apple's ADP at-rest end-to-end encryption.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

<p>I am a big believer in building products for your needs, eating your own dog food, and finding customers with the same needs.
Therefore, I started building <a href="https://beanhub.io/">BeanHub</a>.
Three years later, my <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/index.html">Beancount</a> books are 95% automatic, and I am a very happy user of my product.
It’s hard to describe; as a computer nerd obsessed with automation, seeing my accounting book updating itself without me touching it in an open format brings me pure joy 😍</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/beanhub-git-diff.png" alt="Screenshot of Git history and difference showing Beancount and bank transaction CSV files changes"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of Git history and difference showing Beancount and bank transaction CSV files changes</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Do you see this git commit of the Costco transaction turning from pending to confirmed?
Yep! It’s all automatic, yet it’s just a Beancount file that can be read by any open-source Beancount tool!
The better part is that other people are paying me, which is growing.</p>

<p>Today, I saw the unfortunate news about the shutting down of the beloved accounting software Bench on X.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/bench-shutdown-notice.png" alt="Shutdown notice of Bench accounting software"><figcaption><p>Shutdown notice of Bench accounting software</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>I am surprised, but I am not that surprised.
Looking back now, I am really glad that I picked the rough road to build the product for myself.
It doesn’t bring me financial freedom (yet), but at least I am a happy user myself, and I already have some paying customers.
It’s not easy, though; it took me three years to get here, and I have overcome many interesting technology challenges and learned a lot from building it.
Today, I would like to share my journey of building and selling BeanHub as a product.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Three years ago when, I founded my startup, <a href="https://launchplatform.com/">Launch Platform</a>.
Before I even thought about what products to build, I’d already faced the same problem every startup founder would face – what accounting book software to use?
There are many popular options, such as <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/">QuickBooks</a> or <a href="https://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>.
However, as a software engineer with over two decades of experience, I’ve witnessed the rise of internet startups and understand that there’s no such thing as forever software.
I know the software will be gone one day, and I will have my critical data stuck in an obsolete format or locked up in their data center.</p>

<p>With that in mind, while it’s very easy to sign up for any of them, I don’t want to give in.
Therefore, I searched around and found Beancount.
It’s open source, so I don’t need to worry about the format becoming obsolete one day.
However, I discovered that the existing tools don’t meet all my needs.
I am obsessed with automating everything whenever possible.
I want a smart Beancount-based accounting book that does most things automatically for me.
I also wish to have a user-friendly UI interface so that it’s possible for my wife to look at the books to ensure that I didn’t buy <a href="https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2024/12/11/cading-and-3d-printing-like-a-software-engineer-part1/">some new toys</a> without her acknowledgment.
She can also input entries herself without learning the nerdy stuff with my help.</p>

<h2 id="file-over-app">File over app</h2>

<p>Building a database-based accounting software is easy because operating data in the database is easy, and countless accounting book software is already doing that.
I don’t want to make another one as it defeats the original purpose.</p>

<p>Therefore, setting clear goals and rules up front was very important.
For BeanHub, I keep telling myself that all the operations should only happen to the files instead of tables in the database.
That makes it 10 times harder because you need to parse the text file, update it accordingly, and write it back.
But I am glad I did.
That guarantees all my accounting books are in the same open format.</p>

<p>Interestingly, today, I found the article <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">File over app</a> written by <a href="https://stephango.com/">Steph Ango</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> on X, mentioning Bench shutting down news.
The author also believes in software operating in an open format.
I can’t agree more.
We will see more cases like the shutting down of Bench in the future.
People will be more aware of the risk of data lock-in when using software that relies on a closed format.
Therefore, while software with “file over app” in mind may not look sexy in the short term because it is harder to build, it will win in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-as-much-as-possible">Open source as much as possible</h2>

<p>While building BeanHub, enormous critical components are missing to achieve the goals.
For example, I need a parser to operate on the text file.
To keep updating the file without messing it up, I needed a formatter.
To import transactions from CSV files, I need a rule-based import engine.
While Beancount and many of its tools are open-source, not all meet my needs.
Therefore, I built <a href="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-parser">beancount-parser</a> to parse Beancount syntax with comment awareness and <a href="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black">beancount-black</a> to format the syntax.
I also built <a href="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import">beanhub-import</a> as the rule-based importing engine.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/beanhub-open-source-list.png" alt="Screenshot of BeanHub open source list"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of BeanHub open source list</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>These are just the tip of the iceberg.
Looking back, to my own surprise, I’ve already open-sourced 15 projects just for building BeanHub in the past three years.
You can find the whole list of our <a href="https://beanhub.io/open-source/">BeanHub open-source projects here</a>.
Why I open-sourced this many projects, you may ask.</p>

<p>First, as I built the product on top of open-source tools, I wanted to give back as much as possible.
Second, as a business, I want to keep the “file over app” concept valid even after the future shutdown of my site.
The importing rule engine beanhub-import is a great example.
People will write their own import rules, and then their workflow will depend on it.
Therefore, they need to be open-source.
Otherwise, users will lose their ability to import transactions after the end of the software life cycle.
Yet another reason for open source is its free exposure.
Even though some people were not interested in a hosted Beancount service like BeanHub at the very first, they learned the existence of BeanHub through the beancount-black formatter I built.</p>

<p>Sample beanhub-import rule YAML file shows how you can define rules for importing transactions:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>inputs</span><span>:</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>While it sounds like just let’s open-source everything, the decision didn’t come without concerns.
Suppose you have followed the open-source community news closely.
In that case, you see stories of big tech companies like Amazon taking open-source projects such as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Search</a>, or <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> and then providing competing services.
As a business owner, I cannot ignore the risk of competitors providing the same service with my code.
To open source or not to open source is indeed a question. Based on my experience, here are the questions I often ask myself about whether to open-source a project or not:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is this project going to be useful to someone else</li>
  <li>Who will benefit from this?</li>
  <li>Is this project going to provide exposure?</li>
  <li>Does it help serve the “file over app” concept?</li>
  <li>Will my competitors going to take it and compete with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>You must think about these factors and find a balance between them.
In the end, while they are not superstar open-source projects (yet), but based on GitHub stars, some people found those projects useful, and I am very proud of doing it:</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/launchplatform-github-repos.png" alt="Screenshot of Launch Platform's company open-source GitHub repositories"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of Launch Platform's company open-source GitHub repositories</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>I hope one day I can open source even more, but because once it’s open source, you cannot take it back, so I would rather be careful than regret it.
Also, being able to open source more usually requires a proper business to keep your income growing while others cannot take advantage of it.
So, I need to take time and think about it.</p>

<p>But even if it’s not 100% open source yet, you can run all your workflows with BeanHub using the open-source tools we provide locally.
The only thing missing is the <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> API integration for pulling and dumping bank transactions into local CSV files for beanhub-import to consume.
Nothing stops you from signing up with Plaid API and doing the same locally.
The only problem is that some banks, such as Chase, require a security reviewing process for accessing transaction data, and you may not want to go through it as a single user.</p>

<h2 id="built-a-github-from-the-ground-up">Built a GitHub from the ground up</h2>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of operating on a plaintext-based open format is that you can track them easily with Git and have a full history of changes for free.
Therefore, it’s a no-brainer for me to build BeanHub on top of Git.
I like the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> deployment experience.
One can write deployment configurations such as code and push.
The platform will take care of it.
I want to provide a similar experience with BeanHub, allowing users to push the changes to their Git repository, and it will check your books automatically.
When there’s an update on the server end, such as bank transaction updates, we make a commit with changes so you can pull locally.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/git-push-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of BeanHub repository git push console output showing the Beancount balance"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of BeanHub repository git push console output showing the Beancount balance</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s just a hosted Git repository with some hooks, so it shouldn’t be hard, right?
No, unfortunately, it’s pretty hard.
Hosting Git repositories isn’t that hard if you don’t need to consider</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <li>Durability</li>
  <li>Data integrity</li>
  <li>Forking</li>
  <li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
  <li>Security</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you need to consider all of these, you’re basically building a GitHub from the ground up.
And yes, I did it for BeanHub by myself.
How it works deserves yet another full-blown blog post.
In fact, I have already written it here, in case you’re interested: <a href="https://beanhub.io/blog/2024/06/26/how-beanhub-works-part2-layer-based-git-repos/">How BeanHub works, part 2, a large-scale auditable Git repository system based on container layers</a>.
tl;dr, I use containers with overlayfs to capture changes made in each git operation.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/overlayfs.svg" alt="The diagram a viewer seeing the upper folder with lower folder underneath, the viewer sees a merged folder by combing the changes introduced in the upper layer on top of the lower layer"><figcaption><p>The diagram a viewer seeing the upper folder with lower folder underneath, the viewer sees a merged folder by combing the changes introduced in the upper layer on top of the lower layer</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The tech I built here made hosting many Git repositories with custom automatic hook actions possible, and I can already think of many interesting use cases for it.
I am considering spinning it off as a standalone product empowering git-based “file over app” software.

With enough people expressing their interests, I could make it happen. Please let me know.</p>

<h2 id="security-issues">Security issues</h2>

<p>Security is another interesting topic to consider when building software like this, particularly when processing files provided by users.
Even Beancount files may seem innocent and harmless, but you might be surprised to learn that one can easily execute code with carefully created ones.
Here’s an example:</p>

<p><code>main.bean</code>:</p>

<pre><code>option "insert_pythonpath" "true"
plugin "my_plugins"

2024-04-21 open Assets:Cash
2024-04-21 open Expenses:Food

2024-04-22 * "Dinner"
    Assets:Cash       -20.00 USD
    Expenses:Food      20.00 USD
</code></pre>

<p><code>my_plugins.py</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>__plugins__</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"evil"</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>evil</span><span>(</span><span>entries</span><span>,</span> <span>options</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'!!ALL YOUR ACCOUNTING BOOKS ARE BELONG TO US!!'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>entries</span><span>,</span> <span>[]</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Fortunately, I built a large-scale data pipeline for my former employer dealing with user-uploaded data with potential zero-day exploits.
To process them securely, I’ve learned to adopt sandboxing technology with containers.
It’s yet another interesting topic worth its full-blown article.
Guess what? I’ve already written one. You can find it here if you’re interested: <a href="https://beanhub.io/blog/2024/04/23/how-beanhub-works-part1-sandboxing/">How BeanHub Works part1 contains the danger of processing Beancount data with sandbox</a>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/beanhub-attacked-with-sandbox.svg" alt="The diagram of an attacker uploads data with malicious code, the server processes it inside a sandbox. The attacker's code tried to access outside of the sandbox but failed."><figcaption><p>The diagram of an attacker uploads data with malicious code, the server processes it inside a sandbox. The attacker's code tried to access outside of the sandbox but failed.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Thanks to the container-based sandbox technology, BeanHub dodged a bullet in the recent <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/changes/#version-3-1-5">Jinja2 security bugs</a>, allowing the template environment powered by its SandboxedEnvironment to escape in certain situations. Because all the operations are done inside the sandboxed container, it won’t impact anything else unless the attacker can break the sandbox.
I guess this is the point of defense in depth – you don’t rely on a single layer of defense.</p>

<h2 id="product-builders-imposter-syndrome">Product builder’s imposter syndrome</h2>

<p>I have confidence in building products.
But being a salesperson is yet another story.
Very often, I compare my product with big companies’ products, and I always feel there’s something short in it for me to sell proudly.
I always think, okay, after adding the feature XYZ, it should be good enough, and I should sell it harder by then.
But after adding the new feature, I still felt it was not good enough to sell it at full throttle.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a faction of startup folks who would tell you, let’s sell the product first and then build software to scale later, such as described in the famous <a href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html">Do things don’t scale article</a>.
I think they are right, but knowing it’s right versus doing it is still different.
I wish I could sell a product before it even exists, but I am more of a builder than a seller.
The gap between confidence levels makes me almost always move toward building first and then selling later.</p>

<p>Another source of my problem comes from the pride of being a builder; I want to push out something that’s polished.
The fear of pushing out your idea first and others may do it before you also exist.
I am still learning how to overcome these and gear myself toward this approach.
Even with a build-something-first approach, to strike a balance for a builder type of startup founder, I guess a rule of thumb could be – if it’s good enough for your internal use cases, it’s good enough for others.
Think about it. Building those products takes a whole team of good engineers; you should be proud of what you’ve built with just yourself or a very small team.</p>

<h2 id="you-also-need-to-educate-the-users-and-grow-the-community">You also need to educate the users and grow the community</h2>

<p>While selling the product itself is one challenge, teaching your users how to use it is also another.
Plaintext double-entry accounting is a very niche topic, and not everybody knows what’s double-entry accounting.
Some of its concepts are also hard to digest, such as why the income would be negative in Beancount.
To help the users understand plaintext double-entry accounting, I also launched <a href="https://academy.beanhub.io/">BeanHub Academy</a>, a tutorial for plaintext double-entry accounting with Beancount.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/beanhub-academy.png" alt="Screenshot of BeanHub Academy website home page"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of BeanHub Academy website home page</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The tutorial is still working in progress.
Surely, it will attract some potential users if they read it.
It’s not long enough for me to judge how effective it is, but I believe that if more people understand plaintext-based double-entry accounting in the long run, it will benefit BeanHub.</p>

<p>While we mentioned the fear of potential competition in the open source section, it’s too early for me to worry about it because there’s none for now.
When the addressable market is very small, the biggest concern is to grow the community size.
Therefore, I sponsored the <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/">plaintextaccounting.org</a> website in exchange for an ad explosion despite the fact that other open-source tools may compete with my own.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/pta-sponsorship.png" alt="Screnshot of Plain Text Accounting website"><figcaption><p>Screnshot of Plain Text Accounting website</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>That ad brings many users to BeanHub; it was a great investment to promote my product and help the community a bit; it’s a win-win.</p>

<h2 id="finanl-thought">Finanl thought</h2>

<p>I hope you find my article interesting.
As I said many times, I think building software is like a marathon.
While it takes a long time for me to get things done right, once they are done right, the positive impact can last longer.
I also believe more software should embody the “file over app” idea and let the user control their data.
I hope to see more apps like BeanHub and Obsidian take this approach.</p>

<p>What’s next, you may ask?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about an LLM-powered automatic book cooking feature?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like a great idea… huh….You know what? Maybe not 😅

This means they need to be comfortable building MVPs and proofs of concept, shipping unpolished work, getting feedback, and pivoting when things aren’t working. It also means having all the skills to go from zero to built, everything from infrastructure to design.</span></p></li><li><p>Running a successful A/B test requires a good hypothesis explaining what you’re testing and why you’re testing it. Include the context of the test, the change, the metric, and the expected results.</p></li><li><p>When running product experiments, know that they might fail and get removed. This means you should set it up to be removed (with a feature flag) and ship the “good enough” version over the perfectly maintainable and scalable one. You can improve it later, once it succeeds.</p></li><li><p><span>Product experiments can </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/148982770/how-to-start-developing-an-experimentation-mindset" rel="">be a lot “dumber” than you realize</a><span>. For example, instead of building out a full feature, try a fake door test. This is where you add options or buttons with nothing behind them to check that people will click on them.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Failure is not the end of the world for product experiments. At </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments" rel="">Google</a><span>, 80-90% of experiments "fail." You might think of this as a waste of time, but, at scale, 10% of successes can more than pay for all the failures. For example, an A/B test of how Bing displayed headlines boosted revenue by 12% (more than $100M at the time).</span></p></li><li><p><span>When focusing on growth, </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/148982770/prioritize-like-a-growth-engineer" rel="">think (and prioritize) like a growth engineer</a><span>. Identify a target area, figure out a metric representing that area, create a hypothesis on how to improve it, and implement as small an experiment as possible to test it.</span></p></li><li><p><span>It’s just about never </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/142334709/its-too-early-for-analytics" rel="">too early for analytics</a><span>. This makes sense for </span><em>pre-launch</em><span> products, but </span><em>launching</em><span> without analytics because “it’s too early” is a false economy. Once you launch, priorities shift from shipping as fast as possible to shipping the right thing as fast as possible.</span></p></li><li><p>When starting with analytics, start small. Choose a specific product or feature, track its usage with autocapture, visualize this data with trends and retention graphs, and try to ship features that improve those. The “modern data stack industrial complex” makes this seem a lot more complicated than it actual is.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png" width="599" height="592.6445623342175" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:746,&quot;width&quot;:754,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:599,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79b74ce8-5a9a-45ef-ba90-ed2e1a1e4986_754x746.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div></li><li><p><span>Don’t know which metric to start with?

        <div>
             
                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> </strong>Apple today announced the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-studio/" target="_blank">Mac Studio</a>, the most powerful Mac ever made, featuring M4 Max and the new M3 Ultra chip. The ultimate pro desktop delivers groundbreaking pro performance, extensive connectivity now with Thunderbolt 5, and new capabilities in its compact and quiet design that can live right on a desk. Mac Studio can tackle the most intense workloads with its powerful CPU, Apple’s advanced graphics architecture, higher unified memory capacity, ultrafast SSD storage, and a faster and more efficient Neural Engine. It provides a big boost in performance compared to the previous generation, and a massive leap for users coming from older Macs.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Mac Studio is a powerhouse for AI, capable of running large language models (LLMs) with over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory, thanks to its advanced GPU and up to 512GB of unified memory with M3 Ultra — the most ever in a personal computer. It’s also built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that transforms how users work, communicate, and express themselves, while protecting their privacy. The new Mac Studio is available to pre-order today, with availability beginning March 12.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The new Mac Studio is the most powerful Mac we’ve ever made,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “A complete game-changer for pros around the world — powering both home and pro studios — Mac Studio sits in a class of its own, offering a staggering amount of performance in a compact, quiet design that fits beautifully on your desk. With this new Mac Studio, we’re delivering even more extreme performance with M4 Max and M3 Ultra, support for half a terabyte of unified memory, up to 16TB of superfast storage, and Thunderbolt 5 connectivity. Mac Studio truly is the ultimate pro desktop.”

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The new Mac Studio with M4 Max is the perfect choice for video editors, colorists, developers, engineers, photographers, creative pros, and other users who need to blaze through intensive workflows. It delivers phenomenal single-threaded CPU performance with the world’s fastest CPU core, along with outstanding multithreaded CPU performance for complex workloads. Featuring an up to 16-core CPU, an up to 40-core GPU, over half a terabyte per second of unified memory bandwidth, and a Neural Engine that is over 3x faster than M1 Max, Mac Studio with M4 Max can run on-device AI models incredibly fast. Mac Studio with M4 Max is up to 3.5x faster than Mac Studio with M1 Max, and is up to 6.1x faster than the most powerful Intel-based 27-inch iMac.<sup>1</sup>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The GPU in M4 Max also brings Apple’s advanced graphics architecture to Mac Studio for the first time, including dynamic caching, hardware-accelerated mesh shading, and a second-generation ray-tracing engine for more seamless content creation and gaming. Mac Studio with M4 Max starts at 36GB of unified memory, with support for up to 128GB, so users can do everything from sorting through thousands of images with speed and precision, to producing complex compositions with hundreds of tracks, plug-ins, and virtual instruments, all played in real time. And with the powerful Media Engine in M4 Max, which features two ProRes accelerators, Mac Studio performance is outstanding for videographers who can effortlessly work with multiple streams of 4K ProRes.

It delivers nearly 2x faster performance than M4 Max in workloads that take advantage of high CPU and GPU core counts, and massive amounts of unified memory.<sup>2</sup> Mac Studio with M3 Ultra is up to 2.6x faster than Mac Studio with M1 Ultra, and up to 6.4x faster than the 16-core Intel Xeon W-based Mac Pro.<sup>1</sup> With the new M3 Ultra, Mac Studio features an up to 32-core CPU with 24 performance cores, 50 percent more than any previous Ultra chip and the most CPU cores ever in a Mac. It also offers an up to 80-core GPU, more than any Apple silicon chip; a powerful 32-core Neural Engine for on-device AI and machine learning (ML); and a high-bandwidth memory architecture that delivers over 800GB/s of unified memory bandwidth.

                 <div>Mac Studio with M3 Ultra starts with 96GB of unified memory, which can be configured up to 512GB — the most unified memory ever in a personal computer — and up to 16TB of ultrafast SSD storage, so content and data can be kept locally. That’s enough storage for over 12 hours of 8K ProRes video. The advanced graphics architecture brings Dynamic Caching, along with hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, so graphics workflows like GPU-based renderers are up to 2.6x faster than Mac Studio with M1 Ultra.

                 <div>Mac Studio helps pros push the boundaries of what they can do, and Apple Intelligence elevates those experiences even further. Writing is even more dynamic with Writing Tools, which can help users rewrite, proofread, or summarize — whether they are responding to emails or using summarization to draft an abstract in seconds in apps like Scrivener. Pros can minimize unnecessary distractions with Priority Notifications and use live transcription in Notes to record and easily recap important meetings. With new Siri improvements, users can move fluidly between spoken and typed requests to accelerate tasks throughout their day, and Siri can answer thousands of questions about Mac features and settings, with step-by-step instructions like how to combine PDF files in Preview. With access to ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise,&nbsp;so they can get things done even faster and easier. Users can choose to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT. Users can also explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground, and drop their original image right into their paper, mood board, or Keynote presentation. Whether users are researching their next project, editing a video, creating new designs, or preparing for their next lecture, these new tools will help pros be even more productive.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Designed to protect users’ privacy at every step, Apple Intelligence uses on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power it run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Mac into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request.

                 <div>The new Mac Studio is designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for its manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to power all Apple products, including Mac Studio. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. Mac Studio features over 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. Mac Studio uses far less energy and materials than desktops in its class, and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, and PVC. The packaging is entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from all packaging by the end of 2025.<sup>6</sup>

        <div>
             
                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced M3 Ultra, the highest-performing chip it has ever created, offering the most powerful CPU and GPU in a Mac, double the Neural Engine cores, and the most unified memory ever in a personal computer. M3 Ultra also features Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2x the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion. M3 Ultra is built using Apple’s innovative UltraFusion packaging architecture, which links two M3 Max dies over 10,000 high-speed connections that offer low latency and high bandwidth. This allows the system to treat the combined dies as a single, unified chip for massive performance while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading power efficiency. UltraFusion brings together a total of 184 billion transistors to take the industry-leading capabilities of the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-unveils-new-mac-studio-the-most-powerful-mac-ever/" target="_blank">Mac Studio</a> to new heights.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“M3 Ultra is the pinnacle of our scalable system-on-a-chip architecture, aimed specifically at users who run the most heavily threaded and bandwidth-intensive applications,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “Thanks to its 32-core CPU, massive GPU, support for the most unified memory ever in a personal computer, Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, and industry-leading power efficiency, there’s no other chip like M3 Ultra.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2><strong>Ultra Performance and Efficiency</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>M3 Ultra provides the most performance of any Mac chip, while maintaining the industry-leading power-efficiency of Apple silicon. It features up to a 32-core CPU with 24 performance cores and eight efficiency cores, delivering up to 1.5x the performance of M2 Ultra, and up to 1.8x that of M1 Ultra. It also has the largest GPU in any Apple chip, with up to 80 graphics cores that bring up to 2x faster performance than M2 Ultra, and up to 2.6x faster than M1 Ultra.<sup>1</sup>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The advanced graphics architecture in M3 Ultra features dynamic caching, along with hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, so it can fly through the most demanding content creation workloads and games. A powerful 32-core Neural Engine fuels AI and machine learning (ML), and powers Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models right at the core of the new Mac Studio. In fact, M3 Ultra is built for AI, including ML accelerators in the CPU, Apple’s most powerful GPU, the Neural Engine, and over 800GB/s of memory bandwidth. AI professionals can use Mac Studio with M3 Ultra to run large language models (LLMs) with over 600 billion parameters directly on device, making it the ultimate desktop for AI development.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body-main"><p><span>P</span>aypal cofounder Peter Thiel is famous for <a href="https://time.com/4348840/peter-thiel-gawker-lawsuit-hulk-hogan/">destroying media outlets</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank#:~:text=During%20the%20life%20of%20his,on%20the%20early%20Roth%20withdrawals." target="_blank" rel="noopener">not paying taxes</a>, and being a <a href="https://time.com/4416093/peter-thiel-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative tech billionaire</a>. A new biography, <em>The Contrarian</em>, suggests that he is after more than riches. TIME chatted with its author, journalist Max Chafkin.</p><p><strong>Why should we care about Peter Thiel, apart from the fact that he is another rich tech billionaire and they’re all weirdly fascinating?</strong><br> I think that Peter Thiel is secretly the most important person in Silicon Valley. He’s this behind the scenes player, who is behind so many of the really important things that have happened over the last two decades. Obviously Facebook is one of the world’s largest companies; a lot of people think it’s uniquely bad for the world. And a lot of people are super skeptical of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO. And of course, Thiel is behind Facebook. He was the first outside money in the company. He is also the person who basically set up Mark Zuckerberg to be Mark Zuckerberg and turned him into this imperial CEO, who is now, arguably more powerful than a lot of world leaders.<br> A lot of people are really excited about cryptocurrency and you can connect it back to to PayPal, which is the company that Thiel co-founded in the late 1990s with an explicitly libertarian ethos. There’s this aspect of crypto-world now, where people are really excited about the idea of taking power away from institutions and governments and that’s something that Thiel and his libertarian brethren that were starting that company were really interested in. It’s not something that happens accidentally.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/6099105/us-china-digital-currency-central-bank/">The U.S. Is Losing the Global Race to Decide the Future of Money—and It Could Doom the Almighty Dollar</a></em></p><p><strong>Do you see Thiel as dangerous?</strong><br> It’s really important that we understand the ideology of Silicon Valley. Five of the top 10 companies in the world are tech companies. They exert an enormous cultural and economic influence over our lives. Those companies have been really successful at telling a story about the world and their place in the world: we’re just trying to make the world a better place. Thiel comes with a very different perspective. He comes out of activist conservative media. I think it’s really important that we explore the ideology of what somebody like Peter Thiel believes. When you start peeling back the layers, what you find is this very out-there political and economic philosophy that I think is a little bit scary.</p><p><strong>What do you find scary about his economic and political philosophy?</strong><br> It’s bordering on fascism. Thiel taught this class at Stanford and then turned it into a book called <em>Zero to One</em>. He talks about how companies are better run than governments because they have a single decision maker—a dictator, basically. He is hostile to the idea of democracy. That’s pretty scary when you consider the role the companies that he’s been involved in play. Facebook, I’d say is the most influential media entity in the history of humanity, but he also has a major stake in several defense contractors, including SpaceX.</p><p><strong>He would explain it as belief in efficiency and results, right? He would not say, ‘I don’t think everybody has the right to vote.’</strong><br> There would be some rationale and in fact, at various times he’s walked back things he said. His whole thing is being slippery, but I think when you look at the body of what he’s done and the things he’s been involved with, that’s the picture that emerges.</p><p><strong>A lot of people were very surprised that this nerdy, gay, Californian son of immigrants techpreneur decided to support Donald Trump’s presidency. Was it just the pure <em>I’m going to shut down government</em> aspect of Trump’s policies that he liked?</strong><br> If you look at <a href="https://time.com/4417679/republican-convention-peter-thiel-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his convention speech</a>—which I think was a really good speech—he talks about Trump as this guy who’s gonna shake things up, who’s going to remake government, so I think that’s one part of it. The other part of it is, Thiel is very committed to the idea of being able to say the unpopular thing. That’s a core part of what Trump was. I also think that Thiel is a really savvy investor and he correctly diagnosed that Trump had a pretty good chance of winning and that there wasn’t a lot of downside to betting on him.<br> He didn’t formally endorse Trump during the 2020 election, but if you look at the candidates he’s [now] supporting, they’re Trumpers: J.D. Vance, who’s running for Senate in Ohio was an employee of Peter Thiel’s and an investor in his fund. Before announcing that he was gonna run for Senate, <a href="https://time.com/6078483/j-d-vance-interview-trump/">Vance said that he was wrong in 2016 to oppose Trump</a>, and around the same time, he got this $10 million dollar donation from Thiel to his super PAC. Another candidate that Thiel is supporting in the coming cycle is Blake Masters, who is <em>literally</em> an employee. He runs Thiel’s foundation.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em>H<a href="https://time.com/4418475/republican-convention-peter-thiel-lgbt-gay-rights/">ow Donald Trump Courted Gay Voters at the Convention</a></em></p><p><strong>Did Thiel get blowback about the January 6th attack on Congress?</strong><br> I think certainly his reputation in certain corners of the establishment has suffered. But I don’t think he really cares about the blowback; he seems to really take pleasure in that.</p><p><strong>Do you have a guess at his net worth?</strong><br> There’s an estimate of $6 billion, but I have talked to people who think actually quite a bit higher than that. One reason is that he has been incredibly adept at finding clever ways to limit his tax exposure; those investments in Facebook, in Palantir, and some others were made through this investing vehicle known as a Roth IRA that was originally intended for middle class taxpayers. Through some very clever tax planning, Thiel has managed to stash up billions of dollars in this tax-free account.</p><p><strong>When that story [that he used Roth IRAs to massively lower his taxes] broke, there was an outrage that somebody who had made so much money in America was not contributing to the national purse. Do you think he cared?</strong><br> Some of the ideology that motivated PayPal, and that motivates a lot of this crypto stuff that has happened since, is all about going beyond nations. It’s about this idea that individuals should have more power than nations and should be able to basically do whatever they want. It’s about undermining the national interest and making sure they don’t contribute to it.</p><p><strong>Do you see Thiel as an outlier among his tech brethren, or as an exemplar?</strong><br> The conventional wisdom is Thiel is an outlier; he’s like the one conservative guy in this relatively liberal industry. I think that is basically wrong. Many of the things that he believes are reflected in the actions and behavior of many of his peers. Yes, they may have some disagreements. Many of his peers may vote for Democrats. But the idea that companies should basically be able to do whatever they want, that democracy isn’t the most important value, these things are reflected in the decisions and actions that many Silicon Valley companies are making, even Silicon Valley companies that are run by ostensibly liberal progressives.</p><p><strong>In the beginning of the book, you paint a portrait of Thiel as a bullied child. Other kids put For Sale signs in his yard and then asked when he was leaving and so on. Was that the cradle of his reactionariness?</strong><br> I think he was bullied as a child. And I think that it’s not surprising that somebody who maybe had a tough time navigating a place like Stanford would develop a strong revulsion to the idea of universities like Stanford and would undertake a project to replace or critique these universities. Thiel famously funds a fellowship where he encourages promising young people to start companies instead of going to college and he’s been a prominent critic of colleges. But he’s only a halfway critic. He says in a thousand different ways that Stanford is worthless, but he keeps teaching classes at Stanford. He keeps hiring Ivy League graduates.</p><p><strong>Most of your sources are anonymous. Why do you think people who spoke to you spoke to you?</strong><br> Thiel’s pretty unique in that he was involved in this elaborate and secretive litigation campaign that resulted in the destruction of a pretty substantial media outlet when he secretly funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker Media, which resulted in this roughly $100 million dollar judgment. So I would talk to people and they would be like, ‘I’m a little afraid of him.’ I wouldn’t really know what to say because I think there’s actual reason for people to be afraid of Peter Thiel.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/5100101/peter-thiel-buying-gawker/">Peter Thiel Made an Offer to Buy Gawker, the Website He Helped Close</a></em></p><p><strong>Are you personally worried?</strong><br> I’d be lying if I said that Thiel’s litigation against Gawker didn’t weigh on me and I think you’d be foolish to not think about that. That said, it’s not productive to be afraid.</p><p><strong>Thiel has been right a lot. I wonder if there’s a bit of you thinking, ‘If he’s been right about these things, what should I be looking for now?’</strong><br> Recently, he gave a speech where he dissed bitcoin, which was a weird thing. If somebody who played a big role in the beginning of digital money is suddenly saying that maybe crypto is bad for the interests of the United States, we should pay attention. There’s an extent to which he’s a great prognosticator, a great futurist. But he’s also a marketer of himself and he’s been very good at accentuating the calls that have been right and and playing down the calls that have been wrong.</p><p><strong>You note that he has funded two senators—Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley—and is now funding two more candidates. Do you worry he’ll wield outsized power over government?</strong><br> I have to say I worry less about the grandstanding of a handful of senators connected to Thiel than I do about the effect of Thiel-ism on the culture. When you combine the hostility to democracy and institutional norms with the bankroll of a billionaire you can potentially do some damage.</p><p><em>This conversation has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NASA and the Italian Space Agency made history on March 3 when the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE) became the first technology demonstration to acquire and track Earth-based navigation signals on the Moon’s surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LuGRE payload’s success in lunar orbit and on the surface indicates that signals from the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) can be received and tracked at the Moon. These results mean NASA’s Artemis missions, or other exploration missions, could benefit from these signals to accurately and autonomously determine their position, velocity, and time. This represents a steppingstone to advanced navigation systems and services for the Moon and Mars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“On Earth we can use GNSS signals to navigate in everything from smartphones to airplanes,” said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator for NASA’s SCaN (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/communicating-with-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Communications and Navigation) Program</a>. “Now, LuGRE shows us that we can successfully acquire and track GNSS signals at the Moon. This is a very exciting discovery for lunar navigation, and we hope to leverage this capability for future missions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div id="">
<p>Kevin Coggins</p>
<p>Deputy Associate Administrator for NASA SCaN</p>
</div>
<p>The road to the historic milestone began on March 2 when the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/lunar-science/clps-deliveries/to19d-firefly/" rel="noopener">Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost</a> lunar lander touched down on the Moon and delivered LuGRE, one of 10 NASA payloads intended to advance lunar science. Soon after landing, LuGRE payload operators at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/">NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in Greenbelt, Maryland, began conducting their first science operation on the lunar surface.</p>

<p>With the receiver data flowing in, anticipation mounted. Could a Moon-based mission acquire and track signals from two GNSS constellations, GPS and Galileo, and use those signals for navigation on the lunar surface?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, at 2 a.m. EST on March 3, it was official: LuGRE acquired and tracked signals on the lunar surface for the first time ever and achieved a navigation fix — approximately 225,000 miles away from Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that Blue Ghost is on the Moon, the mission will operate for 14 days providing NASA and the Italian Space Agency the opportunity to collect data in a near-continuous mode, leading to additional GNSS milestones. In addition to this record-setting achievement, LuGRE is the first Italian Space Agency developed hardware on the Moon, a milestone for the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LuGRE payload also <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2025/02/21/blue-ghost-prepares-for-landing-nasa-instrument-breaks-record/#:~:text=The%20Lunar%20GNSS,on%20the%20Moon." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke GNSS records on its journey to the Moon</a>. On Jan. 21, LuGRE surpassed the highest altitude GNSS signal acquisition ever recorded at 209,900 miles from Earth, a record formerly held by NASA’s <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission</a>. Its altitude record continued to climb as LuGRE reached lunar orbit on Feb. 20 — 243,000 miles from Earth. This means that missions in cislunar space, the area of space between Earth and the Moon, could also rely on GNSS signals for navigation fixes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traditionally, NASA engineers track spacecraft by using a combination of measurements, including onboard sensors and signals from Earth-based tracking stations. The LuGRE payload demonstrates that using GNSS signals for navigation can reduce reliance on human operators because these signals can be picked up and used autonomously by the spacecraft, even as far away as the Moon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LuGRE payload is a collaborative effort between NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the Italian Space Agency, their industry partner Qascom, and Politecnico di Torino. Funding and oversight for the LuGRE payload comes from NASA’s SCaN Program office. It was chosen by NASA as one of 10 funded research and technology demonstrations for delivery to the lunar surface by Firefly Aerospace Inc., a flight under the agency’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>ACM has named <a href="https://awards.acm.org/award-recipients/barto_9471663" target="_blank">Andrew G. Barto</a> and <a href="https://awards.acm.org/award-recipients/sutton_0160594" target="_blank">Richard S. Sutton</a> as the recipients of the 2024 ACM A.M. Turing Award for&nbsp;developing the conceptual and algorithmic foundations of reinforcement learning. In a series of papers beginning in the 1980s, Barto and Sutton introduced the main ideas, constructed the mathematical foundations, and developed important algorithms for reinforcement learning—one of the most important approaches for creating intelligent systems.</p>

<p>Barto is Professor Emeritus of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Sutton is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Alberta, a Research Scientist at Keen Technologies, and a Fellow at Amii&nbsp;(Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute).</p>

<p>The ACM A.M. Turing Award, often referred to as the “Nobel Prize in Computing,” carries a $1 million prize with financial support provided by Google, Inc. The award is named for Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician who articulated the mathematical foundations of computing.</p>

<p><u>What is Reinforcement Learning?</u></p>

<p>The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is generally concerned with constructing agents—that is, entities that perceive and act. More intelligent agents are those that choose better courses of action. Therefore, the notion that some courses of action are better than others is central to AI. Reward—a term borrowed from psychology and neuroscience—denotes a signal provided to an agent related to the quality of its behavior. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the process of learning to behave more successfully given this signal.</p>

<p>The idea of learning from reward has been familiar to animal trainers for thousands of years. Later, Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” addressed the question “<em>Can machines think?</em>” and proposed an approach to machine learning based on rewards and punishments.</p>

<div><p>While Turing reported having conducted some initial experiments with this approach and Arthur Samuel developed a checker-playing program in the late 1950s that learned from self-play, little further progress occurred in this vein of AI in the following decades. In the early 1980s, motivated by observations from psychology, Barto and his PhD student Sutton began to formulate reinforcement learning as a general problem framework.</p><p>

They drew on the mathematical foundation provided by Markov decision processes (MDPs), wherein an agent makes decisions in a stochastic (randomly determined) environment, receiving a reward signal after each transition and aiming to maximize its long-term cumulative reward. Whereas standard MDP theory assumes that everything about the MDP is known to the agent, the RL framework allows for the environment and the rewards to be unknown. The minimal information requirements of RL, combined with the generality of the MDP framework, allows RL algorithms to be applied to a vast range of problems, as explained further below.</p></div>

<p>Barto and Sutton, jointly and with others, developed many of the basic algorithmic approaches for RL. These include their foremost contribution, temporal difference learning, which made an important advance in solving reward prediction problems, as well as policy-gradient methods and the use of neural networks as a tool to represent learned functions. They also proposed agent designs that combined learning and planning, demonstrating the value of acquiring knowledge of the environment as a basis for planning.</p>

<p>Perhaps equally influential was their textbook, <em> Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction </em> (1998), which is still the standard reference in the field and has been cited over 75,000 times. It allowed thousands of researchers to understand and contribute to this emerging field and continues to inspire much significant research activity in computer science today.</p>

<p>Although Barto and Sutton’s algorithms were developed decades ago, major advances in the practical applications of RL came about in the past fifteen years by merging RL with deep learning algorithms (pioneered by 2018 Turing Awardees Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun). This led to the technique of deep reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>The most prominent example of RL was the victory by the AlphaGo computer program over the best human <em>Go</em> players in 2016 and 2017. Another major achievement recently has been the development of the chatbot ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) trained in two phases, the second of which employs a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to capture human expectations.</p>

<p>RL has achieved success in many other areas as well. A high-profile research example is robot motor skill learning in the in-hand robotic manipulation and solution of a physical (Rubik’s Cube), which showed it possible to do all the reinforcement learning in simulation yet ultimately be successful in the significantly different real world.</p>

<p>Other areas include network congestion control, chip design, internet advertising, optimization, global supply chain optimization, improving the behavior and reasoning capabilities of chatbots, and even improving algorithms for one of the oldest problems in computer science, matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>Finally, a technology that was partly inspired by neuroscience has returned the favor. Recent research, including work by Barto, has shown that specific RL algorithms developed in AI provide the best explanations for a wide range of findings concerning the dopamine system in the human brain.</p>

<p>“Barto and Sutton’s work demonstrates the immense potential of applying a multidisciplinary approach to longstanding challenges in our field,” explains ACM President Yannis Ioannidis. “Research areas ranging from cognitive science and psychology to neuroscience inspired the development of reinforcement learning, which has laid the foundations for some of the most important advances in AI and has given us greater insight into how the brain works. Barto and Sutton’s work is not a stepping stone that we have now moved on from. Reinforcement learning continues to grow and offers great potential for further advances in computing and many other disciplines. It is fitting that we are honoring them with the most prestigious award in our field.”</p>

<p>“In a 1947 lecture, Alan Turing stated ‘<em>What we want is a machine that can learn from experience</em>,’” noted Jeff Dean, Senior Vice President, Google. “Reinforcement learning, as pioneered by Barto and Sutton, directly answers Turing’s challenge. Their work has been a lynchpin of progress in AI over the last several decades. The tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments. RL’s impact will continue well into the future. Google is proud to sponsor the ACM A.M. Turing Award and honor the individuals who have shaped the technologies that improve our lives.”</p>

While the media has focused on vehicle performance and range, consumers have always been clear that they want <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-cars">electric cars</a> to do essentially everything their old vehicles do—including long overnight trips.
</p><p>
	To those who don’t yet own an EV, a robust infrastructure may seem unimportant. Studies, after all, show that in developed markets, as much as 
	<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/d560f6a6-8d40-4e63-aed2-4fc93139dd5c/PolicybriefonpubliccharginginfrastructurePromotingsuccessfulroll-outstrategiesandbusinessmodels.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">90 percent</a> of all charging takes place in the home. It turns out, however, that the remaining percentage of charging is critically important. Drivers of delivery trucks and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/taxis">taxis</a>, residents of apartment buildings, students on their way to college, families on vacation, and countless others have learned that driving an EV can be a struggle where public charging is scarce or unreliable. A 2022 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/features/ev-range-cost-confidence-survey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> by <em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/forbes">Forbes</a></em></em>, for example, indicated that 62 percent of EV owners were so anxious about EV range that they had at times curtailed their travel plans.
</p><p>
	This is no secret to policymakers. A

In the years since, we’ve thought a lot about how to make vehicles that people actually want to own and drive.

	When we’ve asked potential EV owners what’s limiting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/the-ev-transition-explained/">EV adoption</a>, they often point to limited access to charging stations—especially to fast public charging. The operators who own these <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/charging-stations">charging stations</a> have said it as well, and they also cite the high cost of equipment—a DC fast-charging station with four ports can cost between 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-ev-transition-explained-2658463735" target="_self">US $470,000 and $725,000</a>. If equipment costs were lower, they say, they would install more recharging stations. It could be a virtuous circle: The recharge businesses would do better, EV owners would benefit, and more people would consider buying an EV.
</p><p>
	The question is, can <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ev-charging">EV charging</a> be done more economically and efficiently? More specifically, is there a way to reduce recharge station complexity and bring down the high cost of fast-charge stations—and, in so doing, significantly boost EV penetration without sacrificing safety?
</p><p>
	The answer is yes, and here’s why.
</p><h2> How EV charging works</h2><p>
	Before we explain our solution, let’s review some fundamentals, starting with the most basic. A charging station is a physical location that has one or more charging ports, each of which can charge a single EV. Each port may have multiple types of service connectors to support 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-charging-adapters" target="_self">different EV standards</a>.
</p><p>
	The function of the port is to convert AC power from the grid into DC, which is then applied to the battery. The recharge current must be controlled so that the following criteria are met at all times: The voltage of the battery cells must not exceed a critical limit; cell temperatures must not exceed a preset threshold; and current drawn from the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-utility">electric utility</a> must remain below a certain value. If the first two are not met, cells may be damaged or catch fire. If the third is not met, the charger or utility may be overloaded, causing a breaker to trip or a fuse to blow.
</p><p><img alt="An illustration showing the steps of a process.  " data-rm-shortcode-id="de29d500af34098dd46136aa72868666" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-showing-the-steps-of-a-process.png?id=56630537&amp;width=980" height="3469" id="14845" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-showing-the-steps-of-a-process.png?id=56630537&amp;width=980" width="3039"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A key safety feature of existing EV chargers is an isolation link [in teal]. Within this circuit, a high-frequency transformer provides physical separation between grid power and the electric vehicle’s battery. The isolation link is inside the vehicle’s onboard charger for Level-2 charging (top). For Level-3, or <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fast-charging">fast, charging</a>, the link is located inside the charging station (bottom). </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Chris Philpot</small></p><p>
	In addition to these requirements, the charger must protect users from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-shock">electric shock</a>. That’s not always easy. Chargers operate in rugged environments, usually outdoors, with greatly varying levels of humidity and where contaminated water may be present. Equipment may also be damaged or even sabotaged.
</p><p>
	The time-tested way to prevent electric shock is to use electrical grounding. Grounding is exactly what it sounds like: a direct physical connection to the earth that provides a path for electric current. When such a path is present, stray electrical currents—in a chassis, for example—travel directly to the ground, avoiding any people who might be standing close by. In an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-car">electric car</a> that’s charging, the green ground wire in the charging cable becomes the path to ground. (Because an electric car has rubber tires, the car itself can’t serve as a path.)
</p><p>What happens if such a path is not present? If the ground connection in an electric car charger is broken or compromised, the charge port must have a backup solution. Today, that solution is something called galvanic isolation. In galvanic isolation, no direct conduction path is permitted between certain sections of an electrical system.</p><p><img alt="An series of illustration showing a shock hazard and how to prevent a shock hazard" data-rm-shortcode-id="3d841c9e4b5bc289855335b81e917e84" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-series-of-illustration-showing-a-shock-hazard-and-how-to-prevent-a-shock-hazard.png?id=56630539&amp;width=980" height="3491" id="f8928" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-series-of-illustration-showing-a-shock-hazard-and-how-to-prevent-a-shock-hazard.png?id=56630539&amp;width=980" width="3144"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption..."> If an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ev-charger">EV charger</a> does not have an isolation link, and the ground circuit is broken and if a current path exists between the battery and the vehicle body, a person touching the vehicle could receive a potentially deadly electric shock [top illustration]. However, with the simple and inexpensive “double ground” circuit designed by Wally Rippel [bottom illustration, in teal], a detector circuit confirms that the ground is intact before closing contactors that enable current to flow. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Chris Philpot</small></p><p><span>The hardware for a charger’s galvanic isolation is called an isolation link, and it works by physically and electrically separating two circuits, so that a difference in potential won’t result in current flow from one circuit to the other. In the case of EV charging, the two circuits are the 
	</span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=electric+grid" target="_self">electric grid</a><span> on the one hand, and the vehicle battery and its associated circuitry on the other.</span></p><p>
	This isolation can be a literal lifesaver. Suppose an EV’s battery is leaking. The leaked fluid is conductive, and can therefore produce a current path between the battery circuit and the vehicle chassis. If the ground circuit happens to be broken, then, without isolation, the vehicle’s chassis would be at a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/high-voltage">high voltage</a>. So a person touching the car while standing on the ground could receive a potentially lethal electric shock (see illustration, “A shock hazard”). With isolation, there wouldn’t be a shock hazard, because no current path would exist from the electric utility to the car body.
</p><p>
	 Only one component exists that can provide separation between two circuits while transmitting kilowatt levels of power—a transformer. 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/transformer-shortage" target="_self">The transformers</a> that connect directly to low-frequency utility power are heavy and bulky. But for EV charging, where weight and size are critical, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transformers">transformers</a> are much smaller—they’re not even half the size of a standard building brick. That’s because the charging stations convert DC power to high-frequency AC, using an inverter. The high-frequency AC is then applied to the small transformer, which provides the galvanic isolation. Finally, the output of the transformer is changed back to DC by a high-frequency rectifier circuit, completing the process (as shown in the “isolation link...” illustration).
</p><p>
	We’ll get into the details of this 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/silicon-carbide" target="_self">power conversion</a> in the next section, but this gives you an idea of how charging is done safely today, whether at a public charger or in a home garage by means of the car’s onboard charger.
</p><h2>Galvanic isolation costs a lot</h2><p>
	Virtually every EV has an onboard charger (OBC), which performs the AC-to-DC conversion function, like a public fast charger does, when the vehicle is charging at home. As its name suggests, the OBC resides in the vehicle. It’s capable of providing power levels from about 5 to 22 kilowatts to the battery, depending on the vehicle make and model. Such charge rates are low in comparison with fast charging, generally only available at 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/porsche-claims-it-can-double-teslas-fastcharging-rate" target="_self">public chargers</a>, which starts at 50 kW and can go up to 350 kW.
</p><p>
	Today, all chargers—onboard and off-board—are galvanically isolated. The galvanic isolation is integrated into the power-conversion hardware, regardless of whether it’s in the car or in a public charger.
</p><p><span>A single 300-kW port in a public charging station includes about US $90,000 of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-electronics">power electronics</a>, of which about $54,000 is for the isolation link.</span></p><p>
	The 
	<a href="https://www.embitel.com/blog/embedded-blog/power-converter-topologies-for-electric-charging-stations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hardware of an EV charger</a> is basically a much larger and higher-power version of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/switching-power-supplies">switching power supplies</a> that charge your smartphone or laptop. Earlier, we gave a basic idea about how power conversion in an EV works, but it’s actually a little more involved than that. For <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/evs">EVs</a>, power conversion occurs in four stages (illustration, “A shock hazard”). In the first stage, AC power, either single-phase or three-phase, is converted to DC by an active rectifier. In the second, DC power from the first stage is converted to a high-frequency AC square wave (think of a classic sine wave but with a square shape rather than, well, a sinuous one) by a circuit known as an inverter. The reason for this high frequency is that in the third stage, a transformer converts the AC to a different voltage, and the high frequency allows this transformer to be much smaller and lighter than it would be for a lower frequency, like that of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-grid">power grid</a>. Finally, at the fourth stage, a high-frequency rectifier converts the high-frequency AC back to DC, and then sends it to the vehicle’s battery. Collectively, stages two, three, and four make up the isolation link, which provides the galvanic isolation (see illustration, “The isolation link separates utility power from the EV battery”).
</p><p>
	This isolation link is very expensive. It accounts for roughly 60 percent of the cost of the power electronics in a typical EV, and it’s also responsible for about 50 percent of the charger’s power loss. We estimate that the cost of the bill of materials and assembly of a galvanically isolated charging port is about $300 per kilowatt. So a single 300-kW port in a public charging station includes about $90,000 of power electronics, of which about $54,000 is for the isolation link.
</p><p>
	Do the math: A charging station with four ports includes approximately $360,000 in 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=power+electronics" target="_self">power electronics</a>, with more than $200,000 of that going for galvanic isolation. To get an idea of the total costs in a country, say the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a>, multiply that 60 percent cost reduction of the power electronics per charger by the multiple ports at the more than 61,000 public EV-charging stations in the United States.
</p><p>
	For an EV’s onboard charger, the isolation link adds not just cost but also bulk. The higher the charge capability, the greater the cost and size of the isolation system. That’s why you could never do fast charging with an OBC—the cost and size would be too great to include it inside the vehicle.
</p><p>
	These are among the main reasons why we propose to eliminate galvanic isolation. Billions of dollars of capital and energy expenses could be saved. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hardware-reliability">Hardware reliability</a> would improve because the chargers would use about half as many components. Eliminating galvanic isolation—that is to say, eliminating stages two, three, and four of the charger hardware—would also greatly reduce the size of onboard chargers and enable them to handle fast charging, also known as Level 3 power. This is the highest charging level, providing 100 kW or more of DC current.

	With the isolation link eliminated, we could then take the next step: having the vehicle’s onboard inverter supply power to the motor for driving and also to the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/batteries">batteries</a> for charging. By having the car’s inverter do double duty, we would cut the remaining costs by half 
	<em><em>again</em></em>.
</p><p>
	None of this is a new idea. The original Tesla Roadster, which reached the market in 2008, and all of the products built by AC Propulsion successfully used non-galvanically isolated, integrated charging, in which the recharge function was carried out by the inverter. In those AC Propulsion vehicles, the nominal battery voltage was approximately 400 volts <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/direct-current">direct current</a>, just as it is in most EVs today.
</p><h2>Can galvanic isolation be eliminated?</h2><p>
	The requirements for eliminating the isolation link are not terribly complex or costly. Two issues in particular need to be addressed: the risk of 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-safety" target="_self">electric shock</a> and the compatibility between the utility and battery voltages.
</p><p>
	First, let’s look at the shock hazard. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electrocution">Electrocution</a> can occur if three conditions exist simultaneously: The vehicle isn’t grounded, power is applied to the ungrounded vehicle, and a current-leakage path has formed (see illustration, “A shock hazard”). A leakage path might be created if, for example, the battery’s electrolyte has begun leaking, forming a path between the battery and the car body. Because all EV charging systems include a ground connection, a leakage path is a problem only if the ground connection is broken or compromised.
</p><p>
	All charging systems, both onboard and off-board, include components called 
	<a href="https://www.wolfspeed.com/knowledge-center/article/whats-under-the-hood-contactors-implement-ev-safety/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">safety contactors</a>, which apply power to the battery only after various electronic checks have been carried out. These checks include ground verification, which tests whether the ground connection is intact. If the ground connection is missing or faulty, charging power won’t be applied to the battery.
</p><p>
	For Level 2 charging—in a home garage, for example—the safety contactors are located in a module called the 
	<a href="https://www.benderinc.com/solutions/electric-vehicles/charging-stations-evse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">electric vehicle supply equipment</a>. The <a href="https://www.evconnect.com/blog/what-is-evse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EVSE</a> is typically the size of a large shoebox and may be mounted on a wall or a post. In the case of public fast charging, the safety contactors are an integral part of the hardware.
</p><p>
	What this means is that removing galvanic isolation won’t pose a shock hazard. If the vehicle is grounded and leakage causes the vehicle chassis to be at a high voltage, the resulting surge of current to ground will instantly trip breakers in the charger.
</p><p>
	So the question then becomes: Can ground verification be trusted to be absolutely fail-safe? In other words, can we guarantee that power is never applied if the ground circuit is broken or compromised—even if components within the ground verification circuit have failed? Such an absolute guarantee is necessary from both moral and legal standpoints. Removing an existing safety factor, such as galvanic isolation, is unacceptable unless it is replaced by something that provides a net gain in safety.
</p><p>
	We can do that. All it would take would be a relatively simple modification of the charger circuit.
</p><p>
	Such a level of safety can be provided by a double-ground combined with ground-continuity detection (see illustration, “A ‘double-ground’ circuit prevents shock”). This double-ground method is based on—you guessed it—two ground wires. With this scheme, if one ground wire is severed, the other one ensures that the vehicle is still grounded. To further enhance safety, the broken ground would be detected and the power shut down, even if one ground wire was still intact.
</p><p><a href="https://www.saferack.com/product/vehicle-grounding/grounding-verification-monitors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Detection of ground</a>-wire continuity is neither expensive nor complicated. One of us (Rippel) developed a prototype detection circuit about a year ago. The system uses two small transformers, one to inject a signal into one of the ground wires, and the other to detect the signal in the second ground wire. If the signal is not detected by the second transformer, the contactors—in the EVSE, for example—are opened so they can’t apply power. With this circuit, the overall system remains fail-safe in the event that one or more components fail.
</p><p>
	The arrangement makes charging doubly safe, literally. Moreover, because the two ground circuits are mutually independent, no single failure can cause both grounds to fail. This lowers the probability of a ground failure: If the probability of a single ground failure is 
	<em><em>P</em></em>, the probability of both failing is <em><em>P</em></em><span>2</span>. Safety is further improved with the addition of a circuit that senses that the two grounds form a complete circuit; power is turned off as soon as one of the two grounds is damaged or broken.
</p><p>
	Eliminating the risk of electric shock isn’t the only issue that we must deal with if we are to get rid of galvanic isolation. There’s also the issue of voltage—specifically, the need to prevent mismatches between the utility’s AC line voltage and that of the EV battery.
</p><p>
	A voltage mismatch becomes a problem under one condition—when the input utility voltage exceeds the battery voltage. If this occurs, even for an instant, uncontrolled current can flow into the battery, possibly damaging it or causing a breaker to trip.
</p><p>
	The solution to this problem is a device called a 
	<a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/tutorials/2024/how-do-buck-converters-work" target="_blank">buck regulator</a> (or buck converter). A buck regulator is similar, functionally, to a step-down transformer, except that it handles DC current rather than AC. In the event that the utility’s AC voltage exceeds the battery voltage, the buck regulator operates like a transformer and steps it down. In comparison with an isolation link of the same power rating, a buck regulator would cost less than 10 percent and the power loss would be less than 20 percent.
</p><h2>The future of public EV charging</h2><p>
	At this point, we hope you appreciate why the existing four-stage scheme for both onboard and public EV charging is unnecessarily complicated and expensive. Three of the four stages can be completely eliminated. This would leave a single active-rectifier stage, followed, if necessary, by a low-cost buck regulator. To enhance safety to levels as high as if not higher than existing EV charging gear, we would add a double ground with ground-continuity detection. We call this improved approach direct power conversion.
</p><p>
	Using the DPC approach could cut equipment costs by more than half while improving <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/energy-efficiency">energy efficiency</a> by two to three percent. That’s precisely what we need at this stage of the EV revolution, because it would make EV charging stations more affordable for operators, and enable thousands more such sites to be built in just a few years, rather than a decade or more. It would also make EVs more attractive to people who’ve resisted buying an EV because they’re put off by the 
	<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/bigs/the-state-of-ev-charging-in-america" target="_blank">feeble state of the charging infrastructure</a>.
</p><p>
	It’s time to simplify the EV recharging process and make it more cost effective. But that surely won’t happen without a discussion of galvanic isolation in the technical community. So let the discussion begin! We’re convinced that eliminating the isolation link should be the first step toward the robust charging infrastructure that

<p>Hard as it may be to imagine, there was a time when Java was brand new and exciting. Long before it became the vast clunky back-end leviathan it is today, it was going to be the ubiquitous graphical platform that would be used on everything from cell phones to supercomputers: write once, run anywhere.</p>



<p>Initially I drank the kool-aid and was thrilled about this new “modern” language that was going to take over the world, and drooled at the notion of Java-based computers, containing Java chips that could run java byte-code as their native machine code.</p>



<p>I even had a promotional flyer stuck to my wall, alongside pictures of Lydia Lunch, drum machines, and Jimi Hendrix; it had a picture of the soon to be released JavaStation, looking like a designer purple coffee pot; it stimulated my imagination just by looking at it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, as it transpired, things didn’t quite go to plan: the JavaStation didn’t materialise for ages, and when it did, it didn’t look like a coffee pot, it looked like a mini SPARCstation with the java logo plastered on it. The Java-chip thing proved more difficult to realize than anticipated and so the machine was a based on SPARC, without a disk, intended to be used to run Java apps in a Java based OS called, cleverly, JavaOS.&nbsp;Despite not being a pure Java machine, it was, arguably, the first real network computer, and I wanted one.</p>



<p>Eventually the JavaStation 2 was released, and it did look more like a coffee pot, but was still “just” a SPARC.&nbsp;They didn’t change the world.</p>



<p>Decades later, here we are, and I am finding myself wallowing in nostalgia for the unreachable technology of my youth.</p>



<p>After many months of searching I found a Mr Coffee JavaStation for sale in Canada; unfortunately the seller only accepted payments through a Canadian banking service which is pretty much inaccessible outside Canada. Many months later, a friend of mine moved to Canada for work and was kind enough to buy it and ship it to me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Waiting for that package to arrive was painful; I was checking the tracking details obsessively and experienced a great deal of frustration and bafflement as it moved around the country in completely bizarre directions. It went from Canada, pretty much right past my house to a mail depot that was further away from me than the original location in Canada!&nbsp;</p>



<p>But eventually it arrived and, apart from a few ink stains and a scratch, was in nice condition. BTW, any advice on cleaning it up without damaging the casing would be very gratefully received.</p>

<p>I hooked it up to a monitor and keyboard and then powered it on. To my joy, the fan and the power LED came to life! But nothing on the screen. The keyboard LEDs didn’t light up either…</p>



<p>So, I hooked up the serial port to a Mac. This involved digging out an old DB-9 serial cable from my time machine, and an RS-232 to USB adapter. On the mac I fired up Minicom: nothing.</p>



<p>Even at the point of power on, nothing came out of the serial port. This was a great disappointment, but I knew it may need some love when I ordered it, and so I spent time looking around inside for anything obviously blown, and then had a crack at it with the service manual and a multi-meter. Thankfully, there are several great archives of Sun documentation on the Internet – which is handy because it really does seem like Oracle went out of their way to scrub all traces of Sun’s existence from history.</p>



<p>Sadly, the service manual had no information about repairing the motherboard beyond declaring it a “whole unit replacement”.</p>

<p>There are a lot of very old forums involving people discussing various problems with JavaStations, but they were all concerned with working units.</p>



<p>After some lackluster investigations, I began to fear that something was seriously wrong with it, that would involve a whole new level of investigation with a scope and logic analysers. I’m also not anywhere experienced enough at that type of thing to have confidence that I’d ever get it fixed, so it became another monument to failed attempts at reviving beautiful old tech.</p>



<p>Every time I thought I’d have another go at it, the memories of failed attempts at recapping other devices came to mind, and I couldn’t bear the idea of spending so many hours on trying to fix and replace components, only to have it still not work at the end.</p>



<p>Many months later I got inspired again, and thought I’d see if there were any videos of people working on JavaStations. I found a video of a guy doing a tear-down of a Mr Coffee and, despite being quite adept at getting into the thing, I gave it a watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guy was clearly knowledgeable about the topic and pointed out that the battery backed up NVRAM was very likely to have a dead battery. This was something I was familiar with, having revived some old IPC/IPX boxes in the past. But then he said something magical: if the battery is dead, it won’t boot at all, and you’d need to configure it with a serial terminal. Well, I’d looked for life with a serial terminal and there was nothing. But when I watched him do the same thing, I noticed something different: it took a considerable amount of time before anything appeared on the serial port. Like a minute. Also, I hadn’t bothered to check the required baud rate (it’s been a while since I had to worry about that stuff). So, what if I had the wrong baud rate and also hadn’t waited long enough to see any transmissions. You probably know what I’m going to say next, and yes, the only thing wrong with my JavaStation turned out to be a dead NVRAM battery and my lack of patience. With a 9600 baud serial connection and some patience I was delighted to be greeted with some complaints about corrupt NVRAM followed by an “ok” prompt.</p>



<figure><a href="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-from-2025-02-11-21-18-26-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="716" src="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-from-2025-02-11-21-18-26-1-1024x716.png" alt="" srcset="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-from-2025-02-11-21-18-26-1-1024x716.png 1024w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-from-2025-02-11-21-18-26-1-300x210.png 300w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-from-2025-02-11-21-18-26-1-768x537.png 768w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-from-2025-02-11-21-18-26-1-624x436.png 624w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-from-2025-02-11-21-18-26-1.png 1154w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There is no way to convey to you how excited I was to see this. Even if I couldn’t get this thing to boot an OS, I had a lovely serial-based FORTH interpreter to play with. In case you’re confused by that last sentence, you need to know that Sun’s bootloader environment from that period was called OpenBoot, and consisted of a FORTH interpreter, from which you can interrogate the device tree and pretty much do whatever you want. At this point the JavaStation was a functional computer and that would have been sufficient on its own – but getting it to run an actual OS would be a nice fun project.</p>



<p>After a bit of Googling, I plumped for NetBSD; their documentation was extremely comprehensive (as is frequently the case with the BSDs), and it appeared that even in the latest release (10.1), there was still support for not just SPARC, but specifically the JavaStation.</p>



<p>Before any of that, we had to deal with the NVRAM battery being dead. The dead battery meant that whenever the power is turned off, the data in the NVRAM is lost, resulting in junk memory contents. When the machine starts up, it performs a checksum on the a part of the NVRAM data called IDPROM, and if it’s incorrect, resets it to default values. So, until we get the battery replaced [this will be discussed in a later post], we have to give the IDPROM some sensible(ish) values every time we start up. Thankfully this is quite simple, and we can do it all at the “ok” prompt. Here is what that looks like:</p>



<pre><code>ok 01 00 mkp
ok real-machine-type 01 mkp
ok 8 02 mkp
ok 0 03 mkp
ok 20 04 mkp
ok b0 05 mkp
ok 0b 06 mkp
ok 13 07 mkp
ok 0 08 mkp
ok 0 09 mkp
ok 0 0a mkp
ok 0 0b mkp
ok b0 0c mkp
ok 0b 0d mkp
ok 13 0e mkp
ok 0 f 0 do i idprom@ xor loop f mkp</code></pre>



<p>This looks insanely complicated, but it’s actually pretty straightforward. Skip this section if you’re not interested.</p>



<hr>



<p>As mentioned above, we’re in a FORTH interpreter, but even if you’ve never used (or even heard of) FORTH, it’s simple to understand, but a bit odd when you first have to deal with it. </p>



<p>The command “mkp” takes the two numbers before it, and writes the first one into the IDPROM at the address of the second one. So, for example, the first line below “01 00 mkp” writes the value 1 into address 0. Below is an explanation of what the numbers we’re writing mean:</p>



<figure><a href="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/explanation.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="719" src="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/explanation-1024x719.png" alt="" srcset="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/explanation-1024x719.png 1024w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/explanation-300x211.png 300w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/explanation-768x540.png 768w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/explanation-624x438.png 624w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/explanation.png 1153w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>In case you’re wondering how we know what data to write where, there’s a handy guide at <a href="https://shrubbery.net/~heas/sun-feh-2_1/Devices/IDPROM/IDPROM_Overview.html">https://shrubbery.net/~heas/sun-feh-2_1/Devices/IDPROM/IDPROM_Overview.html</a>. The MAC address I’m using is made-up, but the first three bytes (08-00-20) are actually the correct Sun OUI for this device.</p>



<p>The “checksum” line is more complicated: it’s a tiny little FORTH program that generates the checksum and writes it to address 0xF. Figuring out how it works can be left as an exercise for the reader.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, after entering these commands, we have written a configuration to the IDPROM that is valid enough to allow it to boot. Now we have to reboot without removing the power, so we type “reset”.</p>



<p>The JavaStation restarts, and this time it’s happy enough to start using its built in display (via the VGA port):</p>

<p>Yes! So it’s happy with the configuration, but now we have to get it to boot. It doesn’t have its own storage, so it needs to boot over the network. </p>



<p>The net-booting procedure works as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>The JavaStation attempts to get an IP address by using the venerable RARP protocol.</li>



<li>Once it has an IP address, it presumptuously assumes that whatever machine gave it the IP address will also be able to supply a second stage bootloader using tftp, and attempts to fetch it.</li>



<li>If it manages to get a secondary bootloader over tftp, it runs it.</li>



<li>The secondary bootloader then attempts to fetch and run a kernel and filesystem using NFS.</li>
</ul>



<p>As well as the original Sun documentation, NetBSD has great documentation for booting diskless machines at <a href="https://www.netbsd.org/docs/network/netboot">https://www.netbsd.org/docs/network/netboot</a>, and within that document there are subsections for specific architectures and machines including the JavaStation.</p>



<p>As should be reasonably obvious, net-booting needs support from other computers on the network. The NetBSD documentation describes how to achieve this using a bunch of different operating systems, but as I have a few Linux boxes to hand, that’s what I used.</p>



<p>Firstly, we need to answer the JavaStation’s RARP request. This is a very old standard and well supported by Linux using software called “rarpd”. On ubuntu, you can install this with a simple:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt install rarpd</code></pre>



<p>Once installed, you only need to edit one file to configure it: /etc/ethers. Just add a line to the file consisting of the MAC address of the JavaStation, a space, and the IP address you want it to have on your network. In my case:</p>



<pre><code>08:00:20:B0:0B:13 192.168.128.45</code></pre>



<p>The MAC address is defined by whatever you configured into the NVRAM in the steps above. </p>



<p>Next, we need to be able to provide the secondary bootloader over tftp. This is also surprisingly easy. On ubuntu, install tftpd with:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt install tftpd</code></pre>



<p>NetBSD provides a secondary bootloader specifically for SPARC/JavaStations; the latest NetBSD version (10.1) is at <a href="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-10.1/sparc/installation/netboot/">https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-10.1/sparc/installation/netboot/</a>.<br><a href="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-10.1/sparc/installation/netboot/bootjs.net">bootjs.net</a> is specifically for the JavaStation, but it’s apparently intended for a newer version of the JavaStation than mine because when I tried it, it failed with an “illegal instruction” error. Instead, I used the <a href="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-10.1/sparc/installation/netboot/boot.net">boot.net</a> version which worked fine. You need to rename the file with a specific format: the IP address of the JavaStation, but in 8 capitalized hex digits, followed a dot, and then the architecture (in this case “SUN4M”). So, in this example the IP address (as defined in rarpd above) is 192.168.128.45, which in hex is C0A8802D. I downloaded and renamed the bootloader with the command:</p>



<pre><code>curl -o /tftpboot/C0A8802D.SUN4M https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-10.1/sparc/installation/netboot/boot.net</code></pre>



<p>This should be all you need for getting the secondary bootloader to run. At this point it’s a good idea to give the JavaStation a name so we don’t have to continually use the IP address to refer to it in further configurations. In my case I wanted to give it the name “duke,” and so added the following to the /etc/hosts file:</p>



<pre><code>192.168.128.45 duke</code></pre>



<p>The next stage of the booting involves the JavaStation performing a DHCP request in order find the NFS server it is to boot from. Like most people, I already use DHCP on my LAN to configure everything, but in the DHCP server runs on my router, and the NFS server is running on a different Linux machine. The response from the DHCP server therefore needs to contain a field (“siaddr”) referring to the address of the NFS server. While it should be possible to configure the router’s DHCP server to do this, I had a tough time making it happen. So instead, I decided to configure the router to ignore this MAC address, and instead ran a DHCP server on the Linux machine. You can install the ISC dhcp server on ubuntu with:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server</code></pre>



<p>Then add an entry to /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf along the following lines:</p>



<pre><code>subnet 192.168.128.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
      
        class "javastation-class" {
               lease limit 1;
               default-lease-time 3600;
               max-lease-time 7200;
        }

        pool {
               allow members of "javastation-class";
               range dynamic-bootp 192.168.128.45 192.168.128.45;
        }

        host duke {
          hardware ethernet 08:00:20:B0:0B:13;
          fixed-address 192.168.128.45;
          option routers 192.168.128.1;
          option root-path "/export/client/root";
        }
}</code></pre>



<p>The “host duke” section contains the config we need the JavaStation to have. Apart from the fixed-address, we’re giving it the path to the NFS shares which will be located on the same machine.  As we’re specifically supplying a “hardware ethernet” address, this configuration will only be supplied to our JavaStation, and all other clients will be ignored, leaving the Router DHCP server to deal with everything else as normal.</p>



<p>Finally we need to serve the NetBSD filesystem with NFS. Thankfully, despite its age and total lack of security, NFS is still well supported under Linux. In a nutshell, here’s how you set up the filesystem. These directions are taken from NetBSD’s excellent documentation: <a href="https://www.netbsd.org/docs/network/netboot/nfs.html#linux">https://www.netbsd.org/docs/network/netboot/nfs.html#linux</a></p>



<p>These instructions assume we’ll host the filesystem at /export/client, but it’s really up to you where you put it, as long as you remember to add the path to the DHCP config above.</p>



<pre><code># mkdir -p /export/client/root/dev
# mkdir /export/client/usr
# mkdir /export/client/home
# cd /export/client/root
# curl -L https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-10.1/sparc/binary/sets/kern-MRCOFFEE.tgz | tar xvpzf -
# mknod /export/client/root/dev/console c 0 0</code></pre>



<p>I suggest renaming the kernel from “netbsd” to “kona”, which is the default name the Javastation uses:</p>



<pre><code># mv netbsd kona</code></pre>



<p>Add the following lines to /etc/exports:</p>



<pre><code>/export/client/root duke(rw,no_root_squash)
/export/client/usr duke(rw,root_squash)
/export/client/home duke(rw,root_squash)</code></pre>



<p>Obviously, substitute “duke” for whatever you called your JavaStation.</p>



<pre><code># cd /export/client/root
# curl -L https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-10.1/sparc/binary/sets/base.tgz | tar zxvpf -
# curl -L https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-10.1/sparc/binary/sets/etc.tgz | tar zxvpf -
# mkdir /export/client/root/kern
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/export/client/swap bs=4k count=4k </code></pre>



<p>Create/edit /export/client/root/etc/ifconfig.&lt;ethernet device name&gt; i.e. ifconfig.le0 in this case, and add the following line (setting the netmask and broadcast for your network):</p>



<pre><code>inet duke netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255</code></pre>



<p>Create/edit  /export/client/root/etc/fstab, with the following lines:</p>



<pre><code>/swap                           none  swap  sw 0 0
nfsserver:/export/client/root   /     nfs   rw 0 0
nfsserver:/export/client/usr    /usr  nfs   rw 0 0
nfsserver:/export/client/home   /home nfs   rw 0 0</code></pre>



<p>Edit  /export/client/root/etc/rc.conf. Make sure the following are set:</p>



<pre><code>hostname="client"
defaultroute="192.168.128.1"
nfs_client=YES
auto_ifconfig=NO
net_interfaces=""</code></pre>



<p>Add the following lines to /export/client/root/etc/hosts:</p>



<pre><code>192.168.1.10 client.test.net client
192.168.1.5  nfsserver.test.net nfsserver</code></pre>



<p>Then:</p>



<pre><code># mv /export/client/root/usr/* /export/client/usr/ </code></pre>



<p>Nowadays, the Linux kernel has a built-in NFS server so no extra daemons are needed. You just need to make sure you have the kernel-server installed:</p>



<pre><code># apt install nfs-kernel-server</code></pre>



<p>To make sure that your exported filesystems really are exported, you can force the NFS server to reread /etc/exports:</p>



<pre><code>exportfs -r</code></pre>



<p>Everything should now be in-place. so we’re ready to try booting the system. Plug an ethernet cable into the JavaStation, and at the ok prompt type “reset”. If all goes well, the NetBSD second stage bootloader should be fetched and executed.</p>

<p>If there are any problems, you can get a glimpse into what’s going on by sniffing the network traffic. Personally, I prefer to do captures with tcpdump and then analyse the dumps with Wireshark on my laptop: tcpdump is small and headless. For example running:</p>



<pre><code>tcpdump -n -s0 -w boot.pcap host duke</code></pre>



<p>This will create a capture file that will load straight into Wireshark or any other pcap compatible analyser. Here is what to expect.</p>



<p>Initially, you’ll see the RARP response as the Linux machine tells the Javastation its IP address. Next, you’ll see the JavaStation request the secondary bootloader with TFTP:</p>



<figure><a href="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rarp-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="34" src="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rarp-1-1024x34.png" alt="" srcset="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rarp-1-1024x34.png 1024w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rarp-1-300x10.png 300w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rarp-1-768x26.png 768w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rarp-1-1536x51.png 1536w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rarp-1-624x21.png 624w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rarp-1.png 1827w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>If the bootloader transfer succeeds, you’ll see a DHCP transaction followed by NFS traffic:</p>



<figure><a href="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dhcp-nfs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="102" src="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dhcp-nfs-1024x102.png" alt="" srcset="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dhcp-nfs-1024x102.png 1024w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dhcp-nfs-300x30.png 300w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dhcp-nfs-768x76.png 768w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dhcp-nfs-1536x153.png 1536w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dhcp-nfs-624x62.png 624w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dhcp-nfs.png 1842w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>If all goes well, the first time you boot NetBSD you will be prompted to hit return:</p>



<figure><a href="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/notconfigured.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/notconfigured-1024x557.png" alt="" srcset="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/notconfigured-1024x557.png 1024w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/notconfigured-300x163.png 300w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/notconfigured-768x418.png 768w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/notconfigured-1536x835.png 1536w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/notconfigured-624x339.png 624w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/notconfigured.png 1666w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>At this point you are running an unconfigured version of NetBSD in single user mode. There are only two things left to do. Firstly, create all of the special device files in dev:</p>



<pre><code># mount /usr
# cd /dev
# /bin/sh MAKEDEV all</code></pre>



<p>This takes a lot longer than you’d imagine – NFS over 10Mbps is slow…</p>



<p>Finally edit /etc/rc.conf and change the line that starts “rc_configured” to “rc_configured=yes”. N.B. Before you can run an editor like vi, you may need to set the terminal type to something generic:</p>



<pre><code># export TERM=vt100
# vi /etc/rc.conf</code></pre>



<p>And finally, reboot the system:</p>



<pre><code># reboot</code></pre>



<p>If the universe is behaving,  the system will reboot and you’ll be rewarded with a login prompt. Login as root with no password, and you’re in business!</p>



<figure><a href="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/netbsd-welcome.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="564" src="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/netbsd-welcome-1024x564.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/netbsd-welcome-1024x564.jpg 1024w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/netbsd-welcome-300x165.jpg 300w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/netbsd-welcome-768x423.jpg 768w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/netbsd-welcome-1536x846.jpg 1536w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/netbsd-welcome-624x344.jpg 624w, https://fatsquirrel.org/oldfartsalmanac/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/netbsd-welcome.jpg 1671w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Obviously there is still a lot to do; as you can see postfix isn’t happy, and the swapfile security needs tightening up for a start. But we do now have a functional NetBSD system running on a vintage network computer!</p>

</div><p>Rossmann is clearly perturbed by Brother’s quiet volte-face with regard to aftermarket ink. Above he admits that he used to tell long-suffering HP or Canon printing device owners faces with cartridge DRM issues “Buy a brother laser printer for $100 and all of your woes will be solved.”</p><p>Sadly, “Brother is among the rest of them now,” mused the famous RepairTuber. With that, he admitted he would be stumped if asked to recommend a printer today. However, what he has recently seen of Brother makes him determined to keep his current occasionally used output peripheral off the internet and un-updated.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-320-80.jpg" alt="Brother printers - Lois Rossmann Wiki" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Veftxt6CsjPjT2cTfizCeL.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Louis Rossmann Wiki)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned in the intro, Rossmann has seen two big issues emerge for Brother printer users with recent firmware updates. Firstly, models that used to work with aftermarket ink, might refuse to work with the same cartridges in place post-update. Brother doesn’t always warn about such updates, so Rossmann says that it is important to keep your printer offline, if possible. Moreover, he reckons it is best to keep your printers offline, and “I highly suggest that you turn off your updates,” in light of these anti-consumer updates.</p><p>Another anti-consumer problem Rossmann highlights affects color devices. He cites reports from a Brother MFP user who noticed color calibration didn’t work with aftermarket inks post-update. They used to work, and if the update doesn’t allow the printer to calibrate with this aftermarket ink the cheaper carts become basically unusable.</p><p>Making matters worse, and an aspect of this tale which seems particularly dastardly, Rossmann says that older printer firmware is usually removed from websites. This means users can’t roll back when they discover the unwanted new ‘features’ post-update.</p><p>While he admittedly can’t do much about these printer industry machinations, Rossmann says it feels important to document these changes which show that property rights for individuals are disappearing.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2GJmEWwwXxqxV4o5KwumSW"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

    <p>This is the eighth post in my trek through <a href="https://sebastianraschka.com/">Sebastian Raschka</a>'s book
"<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch">Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)</a>".
I'm blogging about bits that grab my interest, and things I had to rack my
brains over, as a way
to get things straight in my own head -- and perhaps to help anyone else that
is working through it too.  It's been almost a month since my
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/llm-from-scratch-7-coding-self-attention-part-2">last update</a> -- and
if you were suspecting that I was
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/blogging-in-the-age-of-ai">blogging about blogging</a> and spending time
getting <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/adding-maths-to-the-blog">LaTeX working on this site</a> as
procrastination because this next section was always going to be a hard one, then you
were 100% right!  The good news is that -- as so often happens with these things --
it turned out to not be all that tough when I really got down to it.  Momentum
regained.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you found this blog through the blogging-about-blogging, welcome!  Those
  posts were not all that typical, though, and I hope
  you'll enjoy this return to my normal form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This time I'm covering section 3.4, "Implementing self-attention
with trainable weights".  How do we create a system that can learn how to interpret
how much attention to pay to words in a sentence, when looking at other words -- for
example, that learns that in "the fat cat sat on the mat", when you're looking at "cat",
the word "fat" is important, but when you're looking at "mat", "fat" doesn't matter
as much?</p>


    
        <p>Before diving into that, especially given the amount of time since the last post,
let's start with the 1,000-foot view of how the GPT-type
decoder-only transformer-based LLMs (hereafter "LLMs" to save me from RSI) work.
For each step I've linked to the posts where I went throught the details.</p>

<ul>
<li>You start off with a string, presumably of words. (<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-2">Part 2</a>)</li>
<li>You split it up into tokens (words like "the", or chunks like "semi"). (<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-2">Part 2</a>)</li>
<li>The job of the LLM is to predict the next token, given all of the tokens in the
string so far. (<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-1">Part 1</a>)</li>
<li>Step 1: map the tokens to a sequence of
vectors called <em>token embeddings</em>.  A particular token,
say, "the", will have a specific embedding -- these start out random but the LLM
works out useful embeddings as it's trained. (<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-3">Part 3</a>)</li>
<li>Step 2: generate another sequence of <em>position embeddings</em> -- vectors of the
same size as the token embeddings, also starting random but trained, that represent
"this is the first token", "this is
the second token", and so on.  (<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-3">Part 3</a>. <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>)</li>
<li>Step 3: add the two sequences to generate a new sequence of <em>input embeddings</em>.
The first input embedding is the first token embedding plus the first position
embedding (added element-wise), the second is the second token embedding plus the second
position embedding, and so on. (<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-3">Part 3</a>)</li>
<li>Step 4: self-attention.  Take the input embeddings
and for each one, generate a list of <em>attention scores</em>.  These
are numbers that represent how much attention to pay to each other token when considering the token
in question.  So (assuming one token per word) in "the fat cat sat on the mat",
the token "cat" would need a list of 7 attention scores -- how much attention to
pay to the first "the", how much to pay to "fat", how much to pay to itself, "cat",
how much to pay to "sat", and so on.  Exactly how it does that is what this section
of the book covers -- up until now we've been using a "toy" example calculation.
(<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-4">Part 4</a>,
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/01/llm-from-scratch-5-self-attention">Part 5</a>, <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/01/llm-from-scratch-6-coding-self-attention-part-1">Part 6</a>,
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/llm-from-scratch-7-coding-self-attention-part-2">Part 7</a>).</li>
<li>Step 5: normalise the attention scores to <em>attention weights</em>.  We
want each token's list of attention weights to add up to one -- we do this by running each list through
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax</a> function.
(<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-4">Part 4</a>,
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/01/llm-from-scratch-5-self-attention">Part 5</a>, <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/01/llm-from-scratch-6-coding-self-attention-part-1">Part 6</a>,
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/llm-from-scratch-7-coding-self-attention-part-2">Part 7</a>).</li>
<li>Step 6: generate a new sequence of <em>context vectors</em>.
In the system that we've built so far, this contains, for each token, the sum of multiplying all of the input embeddings
by their respective attention weights and adding the results together.
So in that example above, the context vector for "cat"
would be the input embedding for the first "the" times "cat"'s attention score for
that "the", plus the input embedding for "fat" times "cat"'s attention score for
"fat", and so on for every other token in the sequence.
(<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-4">Part 4</a>,
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/01/llm-from-scratch-5-self-attention">Part 5</a>, <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/01/llm-from-scratch-6-coding-self-attention-part-1">Part 6</a>,
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/llm-from-scratch-7-coding-self-attention-part-2">Part 7</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>After all of this is done, we have a sequence of context vectors,
each of which should in some way represent the meaning of its respective token in
the input, including those bits of meaning it gets from all of the other tokens.
So the context vector for "cat" will include some hint of its fatness, for example.</p>

<p>What happens with those context vectors that allows the LLM to use them to predict
what the next token might be?  That bit is still to be explained, so
we'll have to wait and see.  But the first thing to learn is how we create a trainable
attention mechanism that can take the input vectors and generate the attention
scores so that we can work out those context vectors in the first place.</p>

<p>The answer Raschka gives in this section is called <em>scaled dot product attention</em>.
He gives a crystal-clear runthrough of the code to do it, but I had to bang my head
against it for a weekend to get to a solid mental model.
So, instead of going through the
section bit-by-bit, I'll present my own explanation of how it works -- to save me
from future head-banging when trying to remember it, and perhaps to save other people's
foreheads from the same fate.</p>

<h3 id="the-summary-ahead-of-time">The summary, ahead of time</h3>

<p>I'm a <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2011/10/teaching-programming">long-time fan</a> of the Pimsleur
style of language course, where they start each tutorial with minute or so of conversation
in the language you're trying to learn, then say "in 30 minutes, you'll hear that again
and you'll understand it".  You go through the lession, they play the conversation again, and you
do indeed understand it.</p>

<p>So here is a compressed summary of how self-attention works,
in my own words, based on Raschka's explanation.  It might look like a wall of jargon now, but
(hopefully) by the time
you've finished reading this blog post, you'll be able to re-read it and it will all make sense.</p>

<p>We have an input sequence of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math>, of tokens.  We have converted it to a
sequence of input embeddings,
each of which is a vector of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math> -- each of these can be treated as a
point in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math>-dimensional
space.  Let's represent that sequence of embeddings with values like this: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mo>.</mo><mo>.</mo><mo>.</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  Our goal is to produce a
sequence of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> made up of context vectors, each of which represents the
the meaning of the respective input token in the context of the input as a whole.  These
context vectors will each be of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> (which in practice is often equal to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math>,
but could in theory be of any length).</p>

<p>We define three matrices, the <em>query weights matrix</em> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>, the <em>key weights matrix</em> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>,
and the <em>value weights matrix</em> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>v</mi></msub></mrow></math>. These are made up of trainable
weights; each one of them is sized <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>.  Because of those dimensions, we
can treat them as operations that project a vector of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math> -- a point in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math>-dimensonal
space -- to a vector of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> -- a point in
a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>-dimensional space.  We will call these projected spaces <em>key space</em>,
<em>query space</em> and
<em>value space</em>.  To convert an input vector <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> into query space, for example, we just
multiply it by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>, like this <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>When we are considering input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>, we want to work out its <em>attention weights</em> for
every input in the sequence (including itself).  The first step is to work out the <em>attention score</em>,
which, when considering another input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>, is calculated by taking the dot
product of the projection of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> into query space, and the projection of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math> into
key space.  Doing this across all inputs provides us with an attention score
for every other token for <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  We then divide these by the square root of the
dimensionality of the spaces we are projecting into, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>, and run the resulting
list through the softmax function to make them all add up to one.  This list is the
attention weights for <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  This process is called <em>scaled dot product attention</em>.</p>

<p>The next step is to generate a context vector for <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  This is simply the
sum of the projections of all of the inputs into the value space, each one multiplied
by its associated attention weight.</p>

<p>By performing these operations for each of the input vectors, we can generate a list
of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> made up of context vectors of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>, each of which represents the meaning of a input token in the context of
the input as a whole.</p>

<p>Importantly, with clever use of matrix multiplication, all of this can be done for
all inputs in the sequence, producing a context vector for every one of them,
with just five matrix multiplications and a transpose.</p>

<h3 id="now-lets-explain-it">Now let's explain it</h3>

<p>First things first, if there's anyone there that understood all of that without
already knowing how attention mechanisms work, then I salute you!  It was pretty
dense, and I hope it didn't read like my friend Jonathan's
<a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/a-guide-to-git-using-spatial-analogies/">parody of incomprehensible guides to using git</a>.
For me, it took eight re-reads of Raschka's (emininently clear and readable)
explanation to get to a level where I felt I understood it.  I think it's also worth noting
that it's very much a "mechanistic" explanation -- it says how we do these calculations
without saying why.  I think that the "why" is actually out of scope for this book,
but it's something that fascinates me, and I'll blog about it soon.  But,
in order to understand the "why", I think we need to have a solid grounding in the
"how", so let's dig into that for this post.</p>

<p>Up until this section of the book, we have been working out the attention scores by taking the dot product
of the input embeddings against each other -- that is, when you're looking
at <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>, the attention score for <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math> is just <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mi>·</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  I suspected
earlier that the reason that Raschka was using that specific operation for his
"toy" self-attention was that the real implementation is similar, and that has turned
out right, as we're doing scaled dot products here.  But what we do is adjust them first -- <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>, the one that we're considering,
is multiplied by the query weights matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math> first, and the other one <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math> is
multiplied by the key weights matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  Raschka refers to this as a projection,
which for me is a really nice way to look at it.  But his reference is just in passing,
and for me it needed a bit more digging in.</p>

  <p>If your matrix maths is a bit rusty -- like mine was -- and you haven't read the
  <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/basic-neural-network-matrix-maths-part-1">primer I posted the other week</a>, then
  you might want to check it out now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From your schooldays, you might remember that matrices can be used to apply geometric
transformations.  For example, if you take a vector representing a point, you can multiply
it by a matrix to rotate that point about the origin.
You can use a matrix like this to rotate things anti-clockwise by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math> degrees:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mo>[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mi>x</mi></mtd><mtd><mi>y</mi></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>]</mo><mo>[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mtd><mtd><mo>−</mo><mi>sin</mi><mi>θ</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mi>sin</mi><mi>θ</mi></mtd><mtd><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>]</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>sin</mi><mi>θ</mi></mtd><mtd><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mo>−</mo><mi>sin</mi><mi>θ</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>]</mo></mrow></math>

<p>This being matrix multiplication, you could add on more points -- that is, if the
first matrix had more rows, each of which was a point you wanted to rotate, the same
multiplication would rotate them all by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math>.  So you can see that matrix as
being a function that maps sets of points to their rotated equivalents.  This
works in higher dimensions, too -- a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>×</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> matrix like this can represent
transformations in 2 dimensions, but, for example, in 3d graphics, people
use <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>×</mi><mn>3</mn></mrow></math> matrices to do similar transformations to the points that make up
3d objects. <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>An alternative way of looking at this <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>×</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> matrix is that it's a function that
projects points from
one 2-dimensional space to another, the target space being the first space rotated
by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math> degrees anti-clockwise.  For a simple 2d example like this, or even the
3d ones, that's not
necessarily a better way of seeing it.  It's a philosophical difference rather
than a practical one.</p>

<p>But imagine if the matrix wasn't square --
that is, it had a different number of rows to the number of columns.
If you had a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>×</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> matrix, it could be used to multiply a matrix of vectors
in 3d space and produce a matrix in 2d space.  Remember the rule for matrix multiplication:
a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mn>3</mn></mrow></math> matrix times a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>×</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> matrix will give you a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> one.</p>

<p>That is actually super-useful;
if you've done any 3d graphics, you might remember the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum">frustum</a> matrix which is used
to convert the 3d points you're working with to 2d points on a screen.  Without
going into too much detail, it allows you to project those 3d points into a 2d
space with a single matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>So: a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> matrix can be seen as a way to project a vector that represents a
point in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math>-dimensional space into one that represents one in a different <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>-dimensional
space.</p>

<p>What we're doing in self-attention is taking our <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math>-dimensional vectors that make
up the input embedding sequence, then projecting them into three different <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>-dimensional
spaces, and working with the projected versions.  Why do we do this?  That's the
question I want to look into in my future post on the "why", but for now, I think one thing that is fairly
clear is that because these projections are learned as part of the training (remember,
the three matrices we're using for the projections are made up of trainable weights),
it's putting some kind of indirection into the mix that the simple dot product attention
that we were using before didn't have.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-the-dot-products-of-the-projected-input-embeddings">How to do the dot products of the projected input embeddings</h3>

<p>Sticking with this mechanistic view -- "how" rather than "why" -- for now,
let's look at the calculations and how matrix multiplication makes them efficient.
I'm going to loosely follow Raschka's
explanation, but using mathematical notation rather than code, as (unusually for me as a career
techie) I found it a bit easier to grasp what's going on that way.</p>

<p>We'll stick with the case where we're
considering token <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> and trying to work out its attention score for <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>.
The first thing we do is project <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> into query space, which we do by
multiplying it by the query weights matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<p>Now, let's project <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math> into key space by multiplying it by the key weights matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<p>Our attention score is defined as being the dot product of these two vectors:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><msub><mi>ω</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>.</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<p>So we could write a simple loop that iterated over all of the inputs <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>.</mo><mo>.</mo><mo>.</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow></math> once,
generating the projections into query space for each one, and then inside that
loop iterated over <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>.</mo><mo>.</mo><mo>.</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow></math> a second time, projecting them into key space, doing
the dot products, and storing those as attention scores.</p>

<p>But that would be wasteful!  We're doing matrix multiplications, so we can batch
things up.  Let's consider the projections of the inputs into the key space first;
those will always be the same, each time around our hypothetical loop.  So we can
do them in one shot.  Let's treat our input sequence as a matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></math> like this:</p>

<p>We have a row for every input embedding in our input
sequence <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math>, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>, and so on, with the row being made up of the elements in that embedding.  So it
has <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> rows, one per element in the input sequence, and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math> columns, one for each
dimension in the input embeddings, so it's <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></math>.  (I'm using <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></math> as
an example here, like Raschka does in the book.)</p>

<p>That's just like our matrix of points in the rotation matrix example above, so
we can project it into key space in one go, just by multiplying it by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  Let's
call the result of that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow></math>:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<p>It will look like this (again, like Raschka, I'm using a 2-dimensional
key space -- that is, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> -- so that it's easy to see whether a matrix is in the
original 3d input embedding space or a 2d projected one):</p>

<p>...where each of those rows is the projection of the input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow></math> to key space.
It's just all of the projections stacked on top of each other.</p>

<p>Now, let's think about that dot product -- this bit from earlier:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><msub><mi>ω</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>.</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<p>We now have a matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow></math> containing all of our <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow></math> values.  When you're doing
a matrix multiplication, the value of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math> -- that is, the element at
row <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></math>, column <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>j</mi></mrow></math> in the output matrix -- is the dot product of
row <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></math> in the first matrix, taken as a vector, with column <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>j</mi></mrow></math> in the second
matrix, also considered as a vector.</p>

<p>It sounds like we can make use of that to do all of our dot products in a batch.
Let's treat <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>, our projection of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></math>th input token into query space, as
a single-row matrix.  Can we multiply the key matrix by it, like this</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mi>K</mi></mrow></math>

<p>...?</p>

<p>Unfortunately not.  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> is a one-row matrix (size <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>×</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>)
and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow></math> is our <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> key matrix.  With matrix multiplication,
the number of columns in the first matrix -- <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> in this case -- needs to match
the number of rows in the second, which is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math>.  But, if we transpose K, essentially
swapping rows for columns:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><msup><mi>K</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow></math>

<p>...then we have a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>×</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> matrix times a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> one, which does make sense --
and, even better, it's every dot product for every pair of (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>) for all values
of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></math> -- that is, with two matrix multiplications -- the one to work out <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow></math> and this one,
and a transpose, we've worked out all of the attention scores for element <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> in our input
sequence.</p>

<p>But it gets better!</p>

<p>First, let's do the same thing as we did to project the input sequence
into key space to project it all into query space as well.  We
calculated <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math> to work out the key matrix, so we can work out the query matrix the
same way, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  Just like <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow></math> was all of the input vectors projected into
key space, "stacked" on top of each other, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow></math> is all of the input vectors projected
into query space.</p>

<p>Now, what happens if we multiply that by the transposed key matrix?</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>Q</mi><msup><mi>K</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow></math>

<p>Well, our <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow></math> matrix is one row per input, one column per dimension in our projected
space, so it's <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>.  And, as we know, the transposed <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow></math> matrix
is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></math>.  So our result is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> -- and because matrix multiplication
is defined in terms of dot products, what it contains is the dot product of every
row in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow></math> -- the inputs transformed into query space -- against every column
in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mi>K</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow></math> -- the inputs transformed into key space.</p>

<p>The plan was to generate attention scores by working out exactly those dot products!</p>

<p>So with three matrix multiplications, we've done that:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>Ω</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Q</mi><msup><mi>K</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow></math>

<p>...where I'm using the capital <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>Ω</mi></mrow></math> to represent a matrix where each row
represents an input in the sequence, and each column within the row represents
an attention weight for that input.  The element <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>Ω</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math> represents how much
attention to pay to the input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math> when you are trying to work out the context
vector for <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>.  And it has done that by working out the dot product of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> projected
into query space and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math> projected into key space.</p>

<p>That's the "dot product" part of "scaled dot product attention" done and dusted :-)</p>

<h3 id="normalising-it">Normalising it</h3>

<p>So we've worked out our attention scores.  The next thing we need to do is normalise
them; in the past we used the softmax function.  This function takes a list and adjusts
the values in it so that they all sum up to 1, but gives a boost to higher numbers and
a deboost to smaller ones.  I imagine it's named "soft" "max" because it's like finding
the maximum, but in a sense softer because it's leaving the other smaller numbers
in there deboosted.</p>

<p>Raschka explains that when we're working with large numbers of dimensions -- in
real-world LLMs, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> can easily be in the thousands -- using pure softmax
can lead to small gradients -- he says that it can start acting "like a step function",
which I read as meaning that you wind up with all but the largest number in the list
being scaled to really tiny numbers and the largest one dominating.  So, as a workaround,
we divide the numbers by the square root of the number of dimensions in our projected
space <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>, and then only then do we run the result through softmax. <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Remember that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>Ω</mi></mrow></math> is a
matrix of attention scores, with one row for each input token, so we need to apply
the softmax function to each row separately.  Here's what we wind up with:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mtext>softmax</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" fence="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>Ω</mi></mrow><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></msqrt></mrow></mfrac><mo>,</mo><mtext>&nbsp;axis</mtext><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="true" fence="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>

<p>(The <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> isn't really proper mathematical notation, it's just something
I've borrowed from PyTorch to say that we're applying softmax to a matrix on a
per-row basis.)</p>

<p>Once we've done that, we have our normalised attention scores -- that is, the
attention weights.  The next, and final, step, is to use those to work out the context
vectors.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-context-vectors">Creating the context vectors</h3>

<p>Let's reiterate how we're working out the context vectors.  In the previous toy
example, for each token, we took the input embeddings, multiplied each one by
its attention weight, summed the results element-wise, and that was the result.
Now we're doing the same thing, but projecting the input embeddings into another
space first -- the value space.  So let's start off by doing that projection as
a simple matrix multiplication, just like we did for the other spaces:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>v</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<p>Now, from above we have our attention weights matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow></math>, which has in row <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> the attention
weights for every token in the input sequence for input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> -- that is,
at <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math> we have the
attention weight for input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></math> when we're working out the context vector for
input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></math>.  That means that for our input sequence of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math>, it's
an <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> matrix.</p>

<p>In our value matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>, we also have one row per input.  The values in row <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></math>, treated
as a vector, are the projection of the input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math> into value space.  So it's
an <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> matrix.</p>

<p>What happens if we do the matrix multiplication</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>

<p>...?  We'll get a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>×</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></math> matrix of some kind, by the rules of matrix multiplication,
but what will it mean?</p>

<p>To reiterate, the rule for matrix multiplication is that the value of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math> -- that is, the element at
row <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></math>, column <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>j</mi></mrow></math> in the output matrix -- is the dot product of
row <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></math> in the first matrix, taken as a vector, with column <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>j</mi></mrow></math> in the second
matrix, also considered as a vector.</p>

<p>So, at position <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> -- first row, first column, we have the dot product of the first row in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow></math> -- the
attention weight for every token in the input sequence when we're considering the
first token -- and the first column in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>, which is the first element of each
input embedding, projected into the value space.  So, that is the first element
of each input embedding times the attention weights for the first token.  Or,
in other words, it's the first element of the context vector for the first token!</p>

<p>At position <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> -- first row,
second column -- we'll have the same calculation, but for the second element of each
input embedding.  That is the second element of the context vector for the first
token.</p>

<p>...and so on for the rest of the columns.  By the end of the first row,
we'll have something that (treated as a vector) is the sum of all of the input
embeddings, multiplied by the weights for the first input.  It's our context vector
for that input!</p>

<p>The same, of course, repeats for each row.  The result of that single matrix multiplication
is a matrix where the row <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> is the context vector for input <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>We're done!</p>

<h3 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together</h3>

<p>Let's put together those steps.  We start with our input matrix <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></math>, which is the
input embeddings we generated earlier for our sequence of tokens of length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math>.  Each
row is an embedding, and there are <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math> columns, where <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math> is the dimensionality of
our embeddings.</p>

<p>We also have our weight matrices to map input embeddings into different
spaces: the <em>query weights matrix</em> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>, the <em>key weights matrix</em> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>,
and the <em>value weights matrix</em> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>v</mi></msub></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>So, we project our input matrix into those spaces with three matrix multiplications:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>v</mi></msub></mrow></math>

<p>...to get our query matrix, our key matrix, and our value matrix.</p>

<p>We then calculate
our attention scores with one further matrix multiplication and a transpose to work out the dot
products:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>Ω</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Q</mi><msup><mi>K</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow></math>

<p>We normalise those to attention weights by scaling them by the square root of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>
and then applying softmax:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mtext>softmax</mtext><mrow><mo stretchy="true" fence="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>Ω</mi></mrow><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></msqrt></mrow></mfrac><mo>,</mo><mtext>&nbsp;axis</mtext><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="true" fence="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>

<p>...and then we use one final matrix multiplication to use that to work out the
context vectors:</p>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>A</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>

<p>And that's our self-attention mechanism :-)</p>

<p>Now, if you
<a href="#the-summary-ahead-of-time">go back to the explanation at the start</a>, then
hopefully it will make sense.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-book">Back to the book</h3>

<p>Section 3.4 in the book works through the above with PyTorch code, and comes out
with a nice simple <code>nn.Module</code> subclass that does exactly those matrix operations.
This is then improved -- the first version uses generic <code>nn.Parameter</code> objects for
the three weight matrices, and the second uses <code>nn.Linear</code> for more effective training.
That side of it was reasonably easy to understand.  And so, we've wrapped up what I
think is the hardest part of "Build a Large Language Model (from scratch)":
implementing self-attention
with trainable weights.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>

<p>The remainder of chapter 3 is much easier now that we're over
this hump.  We'll be going through two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Causal self-attention (which means that when we are looking at a given token, we don't pay any attention to later
ones, just like we humans do when reading -- our language is structured so that you
don't normally need to read forward to understand what a word means [except <a href="https://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/twain.german.html">in German</a> ;-]).</li>
<li>Multi-head attention (which isn't as complex an issue as I thought it was when I first read about it).</li>
</ul>

<p>So I think
I'll probably blog about those first, and then circle back to the "why" of this
form of self-attention.  It's pretty amazing that we can do all of this
-- projecting into differently-dimensioned spaces, taking dot products between
every token's input embeddings in those spaces, and weighting the projected input
tokens by the weights we generate -- with just five matrix multiplications.  But
why do we do that specifically?</p>

<p>The names of the matrices used -- query, key and value -- hint at
the roles they play in a metaphorical way; Raschka says in a sidebar that
it's a nod to information retrieval systems like databases.  However, it's different
enough to how DBs actually work that I can't quite make the connection.  I'm sure
it will come with time, though.</p>

<p>I also want to, probably in a separate post, consider what batches do to all of this.
With <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/basic-neural-network-matrix-maths-part-1">normal neural networks</a>,
all of our activations when considering a given input are single-row or -column
matrices (depending on the ordering of our equations).  Extending to batches
just means moving to normal multi-row, multi-column matrices.</p>

<p>But ever since
we introduced the matrix of attention scores <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/01/llm-from-scratch-6-coding-self-attention-part-1">for the first time</a>,
it's been clear that even with a single input sequence going through our LLM, we're
already using full matrices.  How do we handle batches where we're processing
multiple input sequences in parallel?  It seems that we're going to need to use
some kind of higher-order tensors -- if scalars are order zero tensors, vectors are
order one tensors, and matrices are order two tensors, we're going to need to start
considering order three tensors at least.  That will require a bit of thought!</p>

<p>But for now, that's all -- see you next time!  And please do comment below --
any thoughts, questions or suggestions would be very welcome, of course, but even
if you just found this post useful it would be great to know :-)</p>

You can disconnect from a tmux session and then reconnect to it later and carry on where you left off. There is a vast amount you can configure with tmux, and many commands that can be used, and at first it can be intimidating to learn and some may fear a steep learning curve. But knowing only a handful of essential commands is enough to be productive day-to-day. I’ve been using tmux for the past two years or so and haven’t really ventured beyond these, and still, have found plenty of value out of it.</p><h2 id="sessions">Sessions</h2><p>If you’ve never run tmux before and have no open sessions, just type:</p><p>This will open a new window with a single pane filling the entire screen.</p><p>One of the features of tmux is the ability to detach from a running tmux session and then be able to reconnect to it at a later time with everything being as you’d left it.</p><p>To detach from the new session you’ve just created type <code>ctrl</code> + <code>b</code> and then <code>d</code>. You will now have been returned to your original command prompt.</p><p>You can see the tmux session that you were just connected to by running:</p><p>To reattach to it, type:</p><h2 id="tmux-prefix-command">Tmux prefix command</h2><p>Let’s talk about the tmux prefix command; <code>ctrl</code> + <code>b</code>. All commands you run within a tmux session are initiated with this. You press this combination first, and then after, the command you want to run. From here on, we’ll reference the prefix with <code>prefix</code> rather than the full <code>ctrl</code> + <code>b</code>.</p><h2 id="windows-and-panes">Windows and panes</h2><p>When within tmux there are two basic concepts that you need to know about if you’re going to use it productively; windows and panes. You can think of windows as tabs within a tmux session. They are listed along the bottom of the tmux window. Each window can have multiple panes, which are different terminal prompts split across the window in various layouts.</p><h3 id="windows">Windows</h3><p>Each window is prefixed with a number to represent it. Type <code>ctrl</code> + <code>b</code> and then <code>c</code> to create a new window. You’ll see it appear in the window list and it has been selected. You now have two windows, one represented by <code>0</code> and the other by <code>1</code>.</p><p>You can switch between windows by typing <code>prefix</code> + <code>0</code> to jump to the first window. Just use the number index to choose which window you want to switch to.</p><p>When you start creating lots of windows, it becomes hard to remember what is within each. By default each window will be named with the default shell it is running. To rename, type <code>prefix</code> + <code>,</code> and then enter a new name, then hit enter. You’ll see the name reflected in the window list displayed along the bottom of the screen.</p><h3 id="panes">Panes</h3><p>Within window 0, let’s create some panes. Type <code>prefix</code> + <code>%</code> to split the current window into two vertical panes. You’ll notice the right-hand pane currently has the terminal focus.</p><p>Type <code>prefix</code> + <code>q</code> and the number for each pane will briefly appear on the screen. This is how you will navigate between panes. The numbers will disappear after a second or so. Just push the combination again <code>prefix</code> + <code>q</code> and then type <code>0</code> immediately to switch focus back to the leftmost pane.</p><p>Now go back to the rightmost pane with <code>prefix</code> + <code>q</code> and then <code>1</code>. We can split this pane in two horizontally by pressing <code>prefix</code> + <code>"</code>.</p><p>Press <code>prefix</code> + <code>q</code> again and you can now see we have three panes indexed with 0—2.</p><p>Sometimes it’s very helpful to <em>zoom in</em> on a single pane. A good example is when you want to copy and paste the contents of a pane that go over more than one line. To zoom press <code>prefix</code> + <code>z</code>. You’ll notice the pane expands to fill the entire window. Also a <code>Z</code> will appear in the window list along the bottom. To unzoom, just press <code>prefix</code> + <code>z</code> again.</p><h2 id="summary-of-commands">Summary of commands</h2><ul><li><code>tmux</code> create a new tmux session</li><li><code>tmux ls</code> list any existing tmux sessions</li><li><code>tmux a</code> reattach to the last open tmux session</li><li><code>ctrl</code> + <code>b</code> the default tmux command prefix</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>d</code> detach from current tmux session</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>c</code> create a new window</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> to switch to the numbered window</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>,</code> rename the existing window</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>%</code> split the current pane into two vertical panes, left and right</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>"</code> split the current pane into two horizontal panes, top and bottom</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>q</code> view numbered panes for current window</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>q</code>, <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> switch to pane immediately after displaying pane numbers</li><li><code>prefix</code> + <code>z</code> to zoom and unzoom</li></ul></article></section></div></div>]]></description>

In Marvel Rivals, every player is initially Bronze 3 and ranks up from there. Almost everyone who actually plays the competitive mode of the game will rank up no matter how bad they are at the game, so we can see that over 30% of the playerbase has never even played the competitive mode. Simply by playing a competitive match, you are ranked in the top 70% of the playerbase. We can look at other activities and interests, such as film, to further reinforce this point.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/michaelcurzi/status/1799748650589208624?t=kGJiVbk8fWMQfKxHKxT1eQ&amp;s=19" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png" width="1176" height="516" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:516,&quot;width&quot;:1176,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:105664,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/michaelcurzi/status/1799748650589208624?t=kGJiVbk8fWMQfKxHKxT1eQ&amp;s=19&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://arealsociety.substack.com/i/157095326?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e34fed4-221f-4d88-b3d2-c04da643ffa5_1176x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>In all fields, </span><a href="https://arealsociety.substack.com/p/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-sort?r=99bhj" rel="">the best quickly climb to the top</a><span>, so it doesn’t take that long to identify who they are, and to find out what they are doing.

If I were to write a fictional story, and set this many characters of such magnitude in the same city at the same time, people would think the premise was absurd. The reality is you will see this play out in countless ways with countless groups. A common example is a simple friend group. You generally have core members, who are core not because they are more attractive or popular (though to be honest this is sometimes the case), but because they actually show up. When I was organizing frequent events, as long as I could convince 2 or 3 other people to go to an event, I would often get 10 to 15 people actually showing up. There would be an inner circle of 3 or 4 event planners, an additional 3 or so consistent attendees, and 20+ people that would rotate in and out. From the outside it may look like 5 people were more popular than than the others, but the reality is that without that core, the other 20+ rotators would just never hang out with each other.</p><p>From a career perspective there are plenty of ways to “do the reading” or to get ahead. A boomer classic is to speak to a manager and give a firm handshake, the seed of good advice is still there. By being willing to apply to jobs, or studying and practicing for interviews, or asking for a promotion, or by researching salary and negotiating well, you can quickly and substantially elevate yourself. An important thing to remember is that if you want other people to do things for or with you, think about their perspective or challenges and make it as easy as possible for the other person to help you. </p><p><span>A work example is if your job uses a “</span><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets/" rel="">promotion packet</a><span>”, which is common in tech, you can literally write your own promotion packet and get your manager to sign it for you. Normally after a couple years at a big tech job your manager will ask you if you want to go for a promotion. You’ll then spend the next year increasing your scope and taking on more complex projects. If that year goes well, in your next performance evaluation your manager will say he plans to promote you in the next six months to a year. He will then start reaching out to other managers or individual contributors you worked with over the year. He’ll get feedback from each person, and all of your feedback providers will often have packed schedules and take weeks if not months to provide their feedback. Your manager will then compile said feedback, summaries of your projects and achievements, and your performance reviews into a document. This is your promotion packet. Wanting to push for promotion is already rare, and going so far as to write your own packet makes it way more probable that you get the promotion you want, and it can potentially push your promotion forward by years.</span></p><p><span>An added benefit to doing things, or being in the arena in general, is that by </span><a href="https://arealsociety.substack.com/p/what-it-means-to-play-the-game?r=99bhj" rel="">participating in the game</a><span> you enable luck. If you never leave your apartment you can’t have a serendipitous run-in with your future spouse. By entering the ranks of the doers, things can happen to you as well. If you don’t apply to a job you don’t 100% meet the requirements for, they aren’t going to email you a “sorry we missed your application”, they’ll go on to someone else who isn’t a perfect match, but was willing to apply. Too many things in life reward action for you to live in a state of stupor. </span></p><p>If you start anywhere, start with simply doing something. For socializing, this can just be showing up when people invite you to something. If you’ve started doing things already, consider “training”. This can be doing the reading, hosting events yourself, or even literal training. This will allow you to quickly distinguish yourself, and it will make your life substantially more fulfilling. Go forth and remember that with even minimal effort, you can elevate yourself to the category of agentic people and be in that 20% of doers while others observe.</p></div></div>]]></description>
