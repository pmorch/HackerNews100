Though Meta has made the trained model available, it is not sharing the model’s training data or the code used to train it. While <a href="https://labs.perplexity.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third</u></a><a href="https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Redmond-Puffin-13B?text=Fish+are+made+of+wood+and+blood%3B+their+offensive+smell+is+not+their+own+fault." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>parties</u></a> have been able to create applications that extend on the base model, aspiring developers and researchers have a limited ability to pick apart the model as is.</p><p>In <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3571884.3604316" target="_blank">research</a> presented at the <a href="https://cui.acm.org/2023/" target="_blank">ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces</a>, a group of AI researchers at <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en" target="_blank">Radboud University</a>, in Nijmegen, Netherlands, argue that Llama 2 is not the only LLM to be questionably labeled as “open source.” In the paper, the scientists present a multidimensional assessment of model openness. They use this rubric to score 15 different nominally open-source LLMs on different aspects of their availability, documentation, and methods of access. The researchers have collected these assessments in an <a href="https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>online table</u></a> that they have since expanded to include 21 different open-source models. Smaller, research-focused models were included in the assessment if they were deemed, as stated in the preprint, “open, sufficiently documented, and released under an open source license.”</p><p>“Meta using the term ‘open source’ for this is positively misleading.” —Mark Dingemanse, Radboud University</p><p>The scientists started the project when looking for AI models to use in their own teaching and research. “If you write a research paper, you want the results to be reproducible for as long as possible,” says <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/liesenfeld-a" target="_blank">Andreas Liesenfeld</a>, one of the preprint’s authors and an assistant professor at Radboud. “That’s something you would specifically value if you do research using these technologies, right? That’s something we did not see, for instance, from ChatGPT”—the chat-bot interface built off of OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)</u></a> LLM series. Despite what may be inferred from its name, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview" target="_blank">OpenAI closed access</a> to much of its research code after launching <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gpt-4">GPT-4</a> and receiving a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/01/27/microsoft-confirms-its-10-billion-investment-into-chatgpt-changing-how-microsoft-competes-with-google-apple-and-other-tech-giants/?sh=5ec5240d3624" target="_blank">substantial investment from Microsoft</a> earlier this year.</p><p><img alt="text on the left with green, yellow and orange boxes on the right" data-rm-shortcode-id="adc541926c705b8e849abba709e8a928" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/text-on-the-left-with-green-yellow-and-orange-boxes-on-the-right.jpg?id=34681681&amp;width=980" height="896" id="82e91" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/text-on-the-left-with-green-yellow-and-orange-boxes-on-the-right.jpg?id=34681681&amp;width=980" width="2402"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The Radboud University team’s assessment gives very poor marks to ChatGPT’s and Llama’s open-source status. (The <a href="https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io/" target="_blank">full table</a> had 20 entries at press time, we show only the top and bottom entries here.) </small></p><p>In fact, OpenAI’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> model has scored the worst out of all models currently assessed on the team’s openness table. Of the available statuses—open, partial, and closed—ChatGPT is marked “closed” in all assessments other than “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>model card</u></a>”—a standard format for describing the model and its limitations—and “preprint”—whether or not there is an in-depth research paper about the model. For these two, ChatGPT only gets a “partial” grade. Llama 2 is ranked second worst overall with an overall openness ranking only marginally better than that of ChatGPT.</p><h2>AI’s Reproducibility Problems</h2><p>Liesenfeld’s concerns about the reproducibility of ChatGPT-based research have borne some evidentiary fruit. A separate <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09009" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>preprint</u></a> from scientists at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, recently demonstrated that both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5’s performance on reasoning tasks has changed between March and June of this year, mostly for the worse. These changes have occurred without any accompanying announcement from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/openai">OpenAI</a>. Such changes may prevent the reproduction of any research results produced from the use of these models during that time period.</p><p>While Liesenfeld and their colleagues determined that several smaller, research-focused models were considerably more open than Llama 2 or ChatGPT, they found that all the models they assessed were closed in two key ways. First, very few of the models gave sufficient detail of the important refinement process required of modern LLM function, also known as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)</u></a>. This key step, which tunes language models to give useful outputs from the statistical patterns trained into them during model pretraining, appears to be the secret sauce behind contemporary LLM performance. The process is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>labor-intensive</u></a>, requiring human-in-the-loop assessment of model outputs during training.</p><p>The second major issue the researchers point to is the ways commercial LLM releases have avoided the peer review process. While publishing model architecture, training methods, and performance through reviewed conferences or journals is a well-established practice in academic research, ChatGPT and Llama 2 were both released with only a company-hosted preprint document, most likely to protect trade secret details around model structure and training.</p><p>While the light this project shines on the variable openness of LLMs may in fact push the field toward truly open-source model development, Liesenfeld and colleagues remain wary of commercial model use in academic research. <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/dingemanse-m" target="_blank">Mark Dingemanse</a>, a coauthor of this report, had a particularly strong assessment of the Llama 2 model: “Meta using the term ‘open source’ for this is positively misleading: There is no source to be seen, the training data is entirely undocumented, and beyond the glossy charts the technical documentation is really rather poor. We do not know why Meta is so intent on getting everyone into this model, but the history of this company’s choices does not inspire confidence. Users beware.”</p><p><em>This story was corrected on 27 July 2023 to indicate that the Radbound group’s research was presented at a conference in July.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://lucas-mcgregor.medium.com/?source=post_page-----9d8bb1a70266--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Lucas McGregor" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*gIUn4y7QIl2ly76FqoOppA.jpeg" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy"></p></div></a></div><figure></figure><p id="0e55">Dearly beloved, we are gather here today to talk about this thing called chat. Electric word, “chatbot”. It means automation of human interactions and that’s a mighty cost effective thing. But I am here to tell you, <strong>no one wants to talk to your chatbot.</strong></p><p id="7905">So before you call up your programmers, and ask them about ChatGPT. Before you launch yet another automated calling system or virtual assistant, put down the Large Language Model. Don’t go crazy. It’s all be done before…</p><h2 id="2516"><strong>Party Like It’s 1999</strong></h2><p id="9d3a">In the late 90’s, it was a race to build commercial websites. We imagined that users would create direct relationships with our URLs. We imagined there would be brand loyalty. We scrambled to buy meaningful domain names. (My company sold <a href="http://start.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">start.com</a> to Microsoft. We were very excited!).</p><p id="6144">In our glorious future, websites would be the next generation of applications. Just like millions of users clicked on an Excel or Word icon on their desktops, millions would launch our websites from their bookmark bars. We were the apps and the browser was the new OS.</p><p id="f959">But of course, that isn’t how it worked out. It was the search engines that became to the entry point for users. We watched most users launch their browsers to Google and then search for us.</p><p id="5f32">We tried everything to get them to come to us directly. We added buttons to our sites that would automatically bookmark us. We worked with browser and computer manufacturers to pre-install our links. There is a still a host of shady browser toolbars and plugins that try to get their sites directly in front of users.</p><p id="df65">But the users have spoken. In response, we have created SEO, a whole new field of marketing to search engine algorithms in hopes that down the line they will market us to humans.</p><p id="7056">We are the apps. The browser is the new OS. But the search engine turned out to be the main interface. It is the shell that wraps all the apps.</p><h2 id="bae3">Rise of the Apps</h2><p id="7870">In 2007, 14 years after the launch of the web, 9 years after Google introduced their search; the iPhone launched. There had been other mobile platforms that came earlier, but none that reached the scale of the iTunes App Store (Now just the App Store).</p><p id="994d">All of a sudden, our dreams were coming true. We had our icons on the screen. Users launched us directly. Once installed, we didn’t have to continually re-invest in SEO for users to find our app versus others. Our websites became apps and we had full relationships with our users. Or, so we thought.</p><p id="9418">Apps were the new applications and iOS/Android was the new OS.</p><h2 id="f4c3">Apps are not Applications.</h2><p id="9d26">Apps are limited. They fit on smaller screens and can be used with only a few finger swipes and clicks. They don’t have mice, right-clicks, and sub-menus. Users don’t save and open files. Apps, and users, rely on their host OS for most advanced functions.</p><p id="d490">The OS handles payments, security, sharing, etc. As more features get handled by the OS, the more they become first point of contact with the user. The more the user has a relationship with their device and less with their apps.</p><h2 id="6074">Rise of the Assistants</h2><p id="25ac">In 2010, Apple launched Siri on MacOS (OS X back then) and added it to their iPhones in 2011. MicroSoft and Amazon followed suite in 2014 and Google’s assistant joined in 2016. Microsoft shutdown their assistant, Cortana, in 2020, but their voice assistant has merged with their search as part of Bing. (MicroSoft has been trying to crack the virtual assistant market since 1997 with Clippy!)</p><p id="d902">Up until now these voice powered personal assistants have been mostly curiosities, used for simple tasks like checking the weather, turning on or off lights, or playing music.</p><p id="e7c1">But if you look at the OS APIs, each company has been creating deeper integrations with their virtual personal assistants and their hosted Apps. iPhone and Android allow apps to chat through their assistance, expose functionality, and offer input. Siri can pull weather from one app, your calendar from another, and check traffic and directions from a third to offer you a complex and well informed dialogue.</p><p id="a226">Amazon’s Alexa is more direct. In addition to accessing your apps, developers can create Amazon Alexa Skills, programs which expand your Alexa virtual assistant with new capabilities. Skills can only be accessed via Alexa. Users talk to Alexa and skills respond back through her and in her voice.</p><h2 id="850f">Language Has Been the Logjam</h2><p id="74eb">Up until now, all of these virtual assistants have been held back by their lack of language skills. Anything beyond simple tasks become either comical and/or frustrating. You can get stonewalled by a benign “I don’t understand” to sidetracked by your assistant totally misunderstanding your request and launching the wrong thing.</p><p id="d824">Suddenly with Large Language Models (LLM) and each of these companies running their own LLM as a Service, these virtual assistants will see massive upgrades. Now they will understand not just you, but also the output of of your apps and skills.</p><h2 id="aad8">The Relationship Is With The Assistant</h2><p id="d53d">Apple and Amazon sell hardware. They are less interested in trying to monetize free users. Google and MicroSoft do both, but still want to own your device and assistant. They sell the operating system (and bundled assistant) that powers much of our hardware.</p><p id="f748">Their devices are in our pockets and our houses. We trust these companies with our personal clouds: our payments, our histories, our contacts, our logins, etc. They are the first devices we interact with when we wakeup and the last screens we stare at before going to sleep. We know their names and voices.</p><p id="2af7">We have been trained to call on them personally and we don’t switch easily. We have all seen a frustrated friend trying to talk to our Alexa by asking it “Hey Siri,” and trying to figure out why she won’t respond.</p><p id="6419">With LLM, these personal virtual assistants are the new starting point. They will be to apps what Google and Bing are to the web.</p><p id="8b11">Few people will be willing to interact with an army of different chatbots and online assistants. They will expect these other chat enabled systems to speak to and through their personal virtual assistant. They will log into their smart phone and expect all the other apps and skills to integrate with their personal clouds, arbitrated by their t<strong>rusted personal virtual assistant</strong>.</p><p id="a269">When they do come directly to your site or app, they are not looking for a chatbot. They are looking for a UI that works. They know why they came to you. They expect your UI to do what it should do.</p><p id="251a">If you have a chatbot, it is for Sir or Alexa to use, not people. I am here to tell you, no human wants to talk to your chatbot.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Commander Keen's Adaptive Tile Refresh</p><hr>


<p>I have been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/43DLW2U">Doom Guy</a> by John Romero. It is an excellent book which I highly recommend. In the ninth chapter, John describes being hit by lightning upon seeing Adaptive Tile Refresh (ATS). That made me realize I never took the time to understand how this crucial piece of tech powers the Commander Keen (CK) series.</p>

<p> During my research I was surprised to learn that ATS only powered the first CK trilogy. The second trilogy turned out to use something far better.</p>


<p>EGA 101</p><hr><p>Commander Keen ran at its best on a PC equipped with a Enhanced Graphic Adapter (EGA) card. On these machines, graphic programming is done through a set of registers for configuration and a window of 64KiB memory mapped<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> to the Video RAM (VRAM) to plot pixels. Internally the EGA stores data in four planes named C0, C1, C2, and C3<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. From the banks, bytes are picked up by the screen controller and sent to the monitor.
</p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/ega_arch_sc.svg" width="361.24442mm" height="89.605553mm">

<p>This design involving four banks may seem bizarre but this was the only way to reach the bandwidth necessary to keep with the screen (CRT). No chip was fast enough so IBM designers made the controller (CRTC) read four bytes in parallel.</p>




<p>EGA Mode 0xD</p><hr><p>The EGA CRTC does not expect RGB values to generate pixels. Instead it is based on a palette system. Several modes offer various resolutions and colors. In its mode <code>Dh</code><a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, which is what CK uses, the resolution is 320x200 16 colors<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

<span><i><small>EGA color space (64 values from 0x00 to 0x3F)</small></i></span>

<p><u><b>Trivia:</b></u> In mode <code>Dh</code>, the palette colors can still be reconfigured but only from the default 16 colors. This is how CK implements its crude fade in/out effect.</p>

<p>EGA Planar Mode</p><hr><p>Each bank stores a plane of a nibble (4-bit). <code>C0</code> stores all LSB of each nibble. <code>C3</code> stores all MSB of each nibble. And so on... As an example, the first byte in <code>C0</code> stores the LSB of the eight first pixel on the screen.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/ega_palette_sc.svg" width="262.46667mm" height="75.935417mm">
<p>A full screen requires 320x200/2= 32,000 bytes of VRAM. Each bank/plane stores 200 lines made of 40 bytes each.</p>

<!-- <p>This arrangement looks tedious to plot a single pixel because the operation involves, for each bank, reading what is there, OR it with the new value, and write it back. To help developer keep their sanity, the EGA has a mask allowing to pick which planes to write to, a latch that is loaded when the CPU reads, and a way to program how to combine incoming value with latch.</p> -->






<p>The problem Adaptive Tile Refresh solves</p><hr><p>At its heart the problem ATS solves is bandwidth. Writing 320x200 nibbles (32 KiB) per frame is too much for the ISA bus. There is no way to maintain a 60Hz framerate while refreshing the whole screen. If we were to run the following code, which simply fills all banks, it would run at 5 frames per seconds.

<p><b><u>Trivia:</u></b> Connoisseurs will point out there are ways for the EGA to write to all four banks simulaneously. These can help to clear the screen or in the case of Wolfenstein 3D duplicate columns. They don't help for Commander Keen.</p>

<p>How Adaptive Tile Refresh Works</p><hr><p>The best way to understand ATS is to build it from scratch, introducing EGA registers as we need them. Let's start by displaying a static image. We set the EGA in mode <code>Dh</code>, pick an address in VRAM, fill it with nibbles, and then use the "CRTC Start" register so the CRTC knows where to start reading from.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/no_scroll_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">
<p><b><u>Trivia:</u></b> There is no single CRTC start address register. A developer must to write in two registers named "Start Address High" (<code>0CH</code>), and "Start Address Low" (<code>0DH</code>). For simplicity, we treat it as if it was a single one and call it <code>CRTC_START</code>.</p>

<p>Smooth vertical scrolling</p><hr><p>Now we are going to add smooth scrolling. The goal is to create a system where the image displayed on the screen can be shifted with an EGA register (cheap) without plotting a single pixel (expensive).</p>

<p>Let's start with smooth vertical scrolling. If we allocate more memory than is displayed, we create a virtual screen in VRAM. We can add 16 lines above and 16 lines below. Instead of 40x200 = 8,000 bytes per plane, we now used 40 x 232 = 9,280 bytes per plane.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/v_scroll_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm"> 
<p>To move the displayed image up by a line, we can just increase the <code>CRTC_START</code> register by 40 bytes.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/v_scroll_up_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">
<p>To move the displayed image down by a line, we can just decrease the <code>CRTC_START</code> register by 40 bytes.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/v_scroll_down_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">

<p>The renderer now needs to write a few more lines to VRAM but the cost is amortized. The gain is that we can update the <code>CRTC_START</code> address up or down in the virtual screen to smoothly move the displayed image up or down.</p>



<p>Smooth horizontal scrolling</p><hr><p>The previous trick allows smooth vertical scrolling. However the truly impressive part, the one John Romero raves about in his book, is smooth horizontal scrolling.</p>

<p>At first sight, it does not look like we can use the same trick since all lines are contiguous in VRAM (there is no space between them). But the EGA has a register to allow padding between lines. With the <code>OFFSET</code> register set to 2 we add 16 bytes of padding which results in 16 extra pixels on the left and 16 extra pixels on pixels in the virtual screen<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. 
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/x_scroll_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">
<p>However this is not enough for the scrolling to be smooth. If we change the CRTC start address, we have to remember that nibbles are stored in planes. Increasing <code>CRTC_START</code> by 1 moves the screen horizontally by 8 pixels. This is coarse, not smooth.</p>

<p>The last register involved in ATS is called "Horizontal Pel Panning" (we will call is <code>PEL</code>). It accepts 4 bits  to tell the CRTC to skip up to 7 bits from <code>CRTC_START</code> before using nibbles. This is exactly what we need for smooth horizontal scrolling.</p>

<p>Each movement left or right is done with a <code>CRTC_START</code> register update (for coordinate / 8). Then the move is fine tuned with the <code>PEL</code> register (for coordinate % 8).</p>









<p>Running out of virtual screen -&gt; jolt</p><hr><p>So far, we have built a virtual screen in VRAM allowing 16 smooth one pixel moves in both axes using only EGA registers. But what happens when we reach an edge? That's where the innovation, and what left John Romero speechless for 30 minutes, starts.</p>

<p>As John Carmack explained<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, once it reaches an edge, the virtual screen must be reset. And it cannot be a full screen redraw because it would take 200ms and drop framerate to 5fps. This operation, coined "jolt" by knolo in their excellent explanation<a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, involves collaboration from the game designers.
</p>


<p>CK levels are built with tiles of dimension 16x16. Upon being drawn by artists, the build system give them an unique ID. A level design creates a map by placing tile IDs in a 2D editor. CK engine keeps track of which tile IDs are in the virtual screen. Since the engine only jolts at tiles size granularity, it can determine extremely fast what has changed on the screen by comparing IDs.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/before_jolt_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">
<span><i><small>Before the jolt</small></i></span>

<p>Notice how, before the jolt, the CRTC starts at the botton of the virtual screen. The image displayed on the screen has not changed between before and after. However the virtual screen has been "re-centered".</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/after_jolt_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm"><span><i><small>After the jolt</small></i></span>



<p>Map Designer help needed</p><hr><p>To jolt, the engine compares each tile ID in the virtual screen current state and the desired, re-centered, state. For matching tiles there is nothing to do and they are skipped entirely. Only mismatch incur a CPU penalty because these need to be overwritten in VRAM.</p>

<p>This is the part where CK game designer had to help the engine with. The jolt efficiency is inversely proportional to the number of tiles to redraw. To avoid costy jolts, designers built tile-maps so there would be a lot of reperating tiles.</p>

<p>In the following screenshot of Commander Keen 1, the player smoothly moved to the right until it ran out of virtual screen. A 16 pixels left jolt occurs. We can see the small number of tiles which were overwritten.</p>

<p> 
  
  
<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/before.webp" width="2240" height="1400" id="ck_diff">  </p>



<p>Only 40 tiles have changed (in pink) out of 250. The amount of redraw is just 16% of the whole screen.

</p><p>Sprites</p><hr><p>So far we have only discussed how the background (made of tiles) is rendered and smoothly scrolled. CK draws a layer of sprites on top of it. While it renders the sprites layer over the background tile layer, the engine maintains a list of dirty (overwritten) tile coordinates. Each new frame, the dirty list is traversed, the background tiles are restored, and then the sprites are drawn again. Rinse, repeat.
</p>


<p>Double buffering / Doing the math</p><hr><p>To avoid visual artifacts, the whole system is duplicated via two framebuffers. While an image is read by the CRTC, another can be written elsewhere in VRAM. Each buffer uses (320 + 32) * (200 + 32) * 4 / 8  = 40,832 bytes. With double buffer, the total is 40,832 * 2 = 81,664 bytes. This is way past the capacity of the standard set by IBM original EGA graphic card. But it was not a problem.</p>


  <blockquote>
Only the original IBM EGA board ever shipped with 64KiB,
and it was a clunky beast full of discrete components, which required
daughter-boards for VRAM expansion.<p>
  The EGA clones that started
coming along in ~1986-7 were based on integrated chipsets (like the
one from Chips &amp; Technologies), and the vast majority of them came
with 256K on board.  When Commander Keen came out, the headcount of
EGA cards with less than 256K 'in the wild' would've been practically
negligible.</p><p>- VileR (sources<a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a><a name="back_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>)</p>
    </blockquote> 

<!-- <p>In CK source code<a name="back_10" style="text-decoration: none;" href="#footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> we can see that register <code>12h</code> is not even consulted to check how much VRAM is installed.</p> -->


<p><b><u>Trivia:</u></b> How to manage 256 KiB of VRAM with only a 64 KiB window? Not a problem since the banks contain 64 KiB each. The CPU can still "see" everything via the plane mask (selection) register.</p>

<p>Better than Adaptive Tile Refresh: Drifting</p><hr><p>Knowing how ATS works, and how it depends on repeating tiles, we should be surprised to see the difference between the first and second trilogy screenshots.</p>


<span><i><small>Commander Keen 1, 2, and 3</small></i></span>


<p>If Commander Keen 1, 2, and 3 show the characteristic repeating patterns required by ATS, the second trilogy, made of Commander Keen 4, 5, and 6, does not. It is most apparent with the starting forest of CK 4 where next to nothing is repeating except for the marginal underground.
</p>


<span><i><small>Commander Keen 4, 5, and 6</small></i></span>

<p>How did they pull that off? John Carmack alluded to the answer on his Twitter account in 2020<a name="back_11" href="#footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.
</p>  

  <blockquote>
The second Keen trilogy used a better trick -- just keep panning and redrawing the leading edge, letting the screen wrap around at the 64k aperture edge.<p>- John Carmack</p>
    </blockquote> 

<p>An explanation further elaborated during an interview with Lex Fridman in 2022<a name="back_12" href="#footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>

  <blockquote>I finally asked what actually happens if you just go off the edge [OF THE VRAM]? 
<p>
If you take your [CRTC] start and you say
OK, I can move over and I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window.
[...] What happens if I start at 0xFFFE at the very end of the 64k block? It
turns out it just wraps back around to the top of
the block.

</p><p>
I'm like oh well this makes everything easy. You can just
scroll the screen everywhere and all you
have to draw is just one new line of
tiles. 
</p><p>
It just works. We no longer had the problem of having fields of similar colors. It doesn't matter what you're
doing, you could be having a completely unique world and you're just drawing the new strip.
</p><p>- John Carmack</p>
    </blockquote> 

<p>So there we have the explanation. ATS was improved upon not by adding a feature but by removing one. Without the jolt, the CRTC start address drift in VRAM space until it wraps around the 64KiB space of the banks. Since it happens with both elements of the double buffer, they drift at the same speed and never overlap. It worked well most of the time.</p>

  <blockquote>
This is so simple, it
just works and it's faster. It
seemed like there was no downside.<p>

Funny thing was it turned out, after we
shipped titles with this, there were super vga cards, allowing higher resolutions and
different features that the
standard ones didn't.
</p><p>
On some of those cards
there was a weird compatibility quirk
again because nobody thought this was what it was designed to do and some
of those cards had more memory.  They had more than just 256k and four planes they
had 512k or a megabyte and on some of
those cards I scroll my window down and then it goes
into uninitialized memory that actually
exists instead of wrapping back
around at the top!</p><p>
        

I was in a tough position. Do I
have to track every single one of these [SUPER VGA CARDS]
and it was a madhouse back then with 20 different video card
vendors with all slightly different
implementations of their non-standard
functionality. Either I needed to
natively program all of the 
cards or I kind of
punt. I took the easy solution of
when you finally did run to the edge of
the screen I accepted a hitch and just
copied the whole screen up.


        </p><p>- John Carmack</p>

<h3>from the <i>yeeted-from-search</i> dept</h3>

<p>A few months ago, Jack Yan pointed out to me that if they did a search for Techdirt on DuckDuckGo, it showed only one single link which was (bizarrely) to a random story from like eight years ago. There were literally no other results for Techdirt. I replicated it, but was travelling, and by the time I went back to write about it a few days later, everything seemed back to normal (in the interim there were a few days where it just found a couple hundred Techdirt posts). Jack wrote a short blog post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jackyan.com/blog/2023/01/bing-increases-techdirts-results-saving-it-some-embarrassment/" target="_blank">on his own site</a> about it.</p>
<p>This morning, however, someone alerted me to the fact that DuckDuckGo currently shows zero results for Techdirt. Not even some random old article. Zero. None. Zilch.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/6b3494cb-9fee-40b0-97a7-387a9b11fc4c-RackMultipart20230727-96-s73gmq.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>Of course, DDG is powered by Bing, so I went to check Bing, and sure enough there’s nothing there:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/43661fc7-153f-4c4f-8e40-cbefbdd2e5a8-RackMultipart20230727-118-ostor0.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1">Bing appears to have deleted all links to Techdirt. Though at least it tells you that “some results have been removed.” Though it doesn’t say why.</p>
<p>At no point did anyone at Bing let us know that we’ve been removed from the search index. And, of course, BIng has every right to kick us out of their index for whatever reason they want. But it does seem odd.</p>
<p>So, hey, if you happen to know anyone at DuckDuckGo or on the Bing team, maybe ask them why they booted Techdirt? Apparently, I’m <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/why-has-my-website-been-removed-from-bing/c5db8282-43a8-4696-8574-82e016b536b1">not the only person</a> this has happened to.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the meantime, I figured I’d ask Bing’s space aged AI chat bot if it could tell me what happened. And… it actually provided a decent answer, first pointing to Jack Yan’s blog post:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/3f0e00a5-fa74-4db4-8149-11930c87339e-RackMultipart20230727-111-nug85h.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>And then coming up with a very speculative list of reasons why we got the boot:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/4807d472-3417-4d45-9b1b-e0c9023cdf16-RackMultipart20230727-111-wbg503.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>I love that first one. Microsoft, a company with a $2.5 trillion market cap, “may not have enough resources” to crawl and index Techdirt? Cool. And the last one is of course possible: that Microsoft encountered “some legal or political pressure to remove or censor Techdirt.com, which is known for its critical and investigative reporting on various topics, such as technology, law, policy, and business,” but it would be nice if someone would just, you know, let me know?</p>
<p>I’m guessing it’s just a bug, but given that many Techdirt readers (for understandable reasons) prefer DDG to Google, it would be kinda nice if they could actually use it to get Techdirt results.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if this were a Trumpist nonsense peddler website, I’m sure there would be blaring headlines on Fox News and in the NY Post, and a whole set of hearings chaired by Jim Jordan about “censorship.” And we’d be hearing about it for years. That’s not going to happen with me. I’m sure the reality is much more mundane. I am guessing it’s just a glitch somewhere in the system.</p>
<p>But it would nice if it got fixed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block-key="mhvmh">Nearly every material, whether it is solid, liquid, or gas, expands when its temperature goes up and contracts when its temperature goes down. This property, called thermal expansion, makes a hot air balloon float, and the phenomenon has been harnessed to create thermostats that automatically turn a home furnace on and off. Railroads, bridges, and buildings are designed with this property in mind, and they are given room to expand without buckling or breaking on a hot day.</p><p data-block-key="e6hqc">Thermal expansion occurs because a material's atoms vibrate more as its temperature increases. The more its atoms vibrate, the more they push away from their neighboring atoms. As the space between the atoms increases, the density of the material decreases and its overall size increases.</p><p data-block-key="4pcsc">There are a few exceptions, but by and large, materials conform strictly to this principle. There is, however, a class of metal alloys called Invars (think <b><i>invar</i></b>iable), that stubbornly refuse to change in size and density over a large range of temperatures.</p>

</div>
<p data-block-key="9fouu">"It's almost unheard of to find metals that don't expand," says Stefan Lohaus, a graduate student in materials science and lead author of the new paper. "But in 1895, a physicist discovered by accident that if you combine iron and nickel, each of which has positive thermal expansion, in a certain proportion, you get this material with very unusual behavior."</p><p data-block-key="3ijgp">That anomalous behavior makes these alloys useful in applications where extreme precision is required, such as in the manufacture of parts for clocks, telescopes, and other fine instruments. Until now, no one knew why Invars behave this way. In a new paper published in <i>Nature Physics</i>, researchers from the lab of <a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/btf">Brent Fultz</a>, the Barbara and Stanley R. Rawn, Jr., Professor of Materials Science and Applied Physics, say they have figured out the secret to at least one Invar's steadiness.</p>

<p data-block-key="dk3n9">For over 150 years, scientists have known that thermal expansion is related to entropy, a central concept in thermodynamics. Entropy is a measure of the disorder, such as positions of atoms, in a system. As temperature increases, so does the entropy of a system. This is universally true, so an Invar's unusual behavior must be explained through something counteracting that expansion.</p><p data-block-key="9t7bk">Lohaus says it had been long suspected that this behavior was somehow related to magnetism because only certain alloys that are ferromagnetic (capable of being magnetized) behave as invars.</p>

<p data-block-key="47uer">"We decided to look at that because we have this very neat experimental setup that can measure both magnetism and atomic vibrations," Lohaus says. "It was a perfect system for this."</p><p data-block-key="a1a30">Since the magnetic properties of a material are the result of its electrons' so-called spin state— a quantum measure of angular momentum that can be either "up" or "down"—any magnetic effect counteracting the material's expected expansion must be due to the activity of its electrons.</p><p data-block-key="7qcii">The relationship between entropy, thermal expansion, and pressure, known as the "Maxwell relations" is often presented as a textbook curiosity, but the Caltech group found a way to use it to independently measure the thermal expansion caused by magnetism and by atom vibrations. The experiments were done at the Advanced Photon Source, a source of synchrotron X-rays at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, by measuring the vibrational spectra and magnetism of small samples of Invar at pressures within a diamond anvil cell.</p><p data-block-key="6oaei">The measurements showed a delicate cancellation of the thermal expansion from atom vibrations and from magnetism. Both changed with temperature and pressure, but in a way that maintained their balance. Using a newly developed accurate theoretical approach, collaborators on this work showed how this balance was helped by interactions between vibrations and magnetism, such as where the frequencies of atom vibrations are altered by magnetism. Such coupling between vibrations and magnetism could be useful for understanding thermal expansion in other magnetic materials, as well for developing materials for magnetic refrigeration.</p><p data-block-key="cqdgu">The experimental setup consisted of a diamond anvil cell, which is essentially two precisely ground diamond tips between which samples of materials can be tightly squeezed. In this case, a small piece of Invar alloy was squeezed at a pressure of 200,000 atmospheres. The researchers passed a powerful beam of X-rays through the alloy, and during that process the X-rays interacted with the vibrations (phonons) of its atoms. That interaction changed the amount of energy carried by the X-rays, allowing the researchers to measure how much the atoms were vibrating.</p><p data-block-key="bmkd">They also placed sensors around the diamond anvil cell that can detect interference patterns created by the spin state of the electrons belonging to the sample's atoms.</p><p data-block-key="56bno">The team used their experimental setup to observe both the atomic vibrations of an Invar sample and the spin state of its electrons as they increased the sample's temperature. At cooler temperatures, more of the Invar's electrons shared the same spin state, causing them to move farther apart and push their parent atoms farther apart as well.</p><p data-block-key="57uaj">As the temperature of the Invar rose, the spin state of some of those electrons increasingly flipped. As a result, the electrons became more comfortable cozying up to their neighboring electrons. Typically, this would cause the Invar to contract as it warmed up. But here, the Invar's atoms were also vibrating more and taking up more room. The contraction due to changing spin states and the atomic vibration expansion counteracted each other, and the Invar stayed the same size.</p><p data-block-key="890us">"This is exciting because this has been a problem in science for over a hundred years or so," Lohaus says. "There are literally thousands of publications trying to show how magnetism causes contraction, but there was no holistic explanation of the Invar effect."</p><p data-block-key="blb2p">The paper describing the research, "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02142-z.epdf?sharing_token=Kpp4hAGNnsZZoWfGGlC58dRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MqX9VjZ126twpdHMGPJ2csd8ecvTUNtpPOWfav11pUg8KfLRin8MEsCEPqrW1H3eUuJLV9emiFiAonE5bGA4x2booS9eOVot9ifuWO3VJgjFHYHgKvGP1fovePZwoYCuk%3D">Thermodynamic explanation of the Invar effect</a>," appears in the July 27 issue of <i>Nature Physics.</i> Co-authors are graduate students in materials science Pedro Guzman and Camille M.

Up close it was both amazing and terrible, like so many other companies and things in life.</p><p id="983c">As someone with a maniacal sense of urgency built into me, Twitter often felt siloed and bureaucratic. Dumb power plays, reorgs and team name changes for the sake of someone’s ego were distractions that occurred too regularly.</p><p id="20f8"><strong>You couldn’t just be a builder — you also needed to be a politician.</strong></p><p id="1aca">I was shocked by how old and bespoke the infrastructure was, but there was little will to think beyond quarterly earnings calls because we were all beholden to the masters of mDAU and revenue growth as a public company. It often felt like things were held together with duct tape and glue, and that many people had just accepted that a small product change could take months or quarters to build.</p><p id="e4e0">Management had become bloated to accommodate <em>career growth</em> and the company culture felt too soft and entitled for my own taste. Healthy debate and criticism was replaced by a default refrain of “no, that can’t be done” or “another team owns that so don’t touch it”.</p><p id="6e63">Teams could spend months building a feature and then some last-minute kerfuffle meant it’d get killed for being too risky.</p><p id="7441"><strong>Just talking directly to customers could turn into a turf war and create deadlocks between functions.</strong></p><p id="4c3d">I recall one such episode where a teammate spent a month trying to get clearance to reach out to some creators. He went through 3 layers of management and 6 different functional teams. In the end 4 executives were involved in the approval. It was insanity, and unfortunately I saw several top performers get burnt out and demoralized after exhausting experiences like that.</p><p id="081c">Most people were good at their jobs but <strong>it was nearly impossible to fire poor performers</strong> — instead they got shuffled around to other teams because few managers had the will or resources to figure out how to get them out.</p><p id="02c1">A high performance culture pulls everyone up, but the opposite weighs everyone down. <strong>Twitter often felt like a place that kept squandering its own potential</strong>, which was sad and frustrating to see. The person who was best at cutting through the BS and inspiring a vision during my tenure was Kayvon Beykpour, but he wasn’t fully empowered to run the company since he wasn’t the CEO.</p><p id="4305">Despite those real issues, I was lucky enough to work with some of the most talented people in the business at Twitter in product, design, engineering, research, legal, BD, trust &amp; safety, marketing, PR and more. <strong>Often it was a small cross-functional team of intrinsically motivated people who made the biggest impact by challenging some core assumption.</strong> Those teams were very fun to be on but they felt like the exception rather than the rule.</p><p id="2da1">The months of waiting for the deal to close in 2022 were particularly slow and painful; it felt like leadership hid behind lawyers and legal language as all answers about the company’s future notoriously included the phrase “fiduciary duty”. Colleagues openly talked about how Twitter was being sold because leadership didn’t have conviction in their own plan or ability to fix longstanding problems.</p><p id="1546"><strong>Although I didn’t know much about Elon I was cautiously optimistic </strong>— I saw him as the guy who built incredible and enduring companies like Tesla and SpaceX, so perhaps his private ownership could shake things up and breathe new life into the company.</p><p id="1e38">My take on what’s happened since then is full of lived nuance.</p><p id="a660">When people ask why I stayed it’s easy to answer: optimism, curiosity, personal growth and money.</p><p id="d451">From the beginning I saw that some changes Elon was going to make were smart and others were stupid, but <strong>when I’m on a team I uphold the philosophy of “praise in public and criticize in private”</strong>. I was far from a silent wallflower. I shared my opinions openly and pushed back often, both before and after the acquisition.</p><p id="202c">I made peace with the fact that I didn’t have psychological safety at Twitter 2.0 and that meant I could be fired at any moment, and for no reason at all. I watched it happen repeatedly and saw how negatively it impacted team morale. Although I couldn’t change the situation I did my best to shine a light on folks who were doing important work while being an emotionally supportive leader for those who were struggling to adapt to the more brutalist and hardcore culture.</p><p id="7e08"><strong>In person Elon is oddly charming and he’s <em>genuinely funny</em>.</strong> He also has personality quirks like telling the same stories and jokes over and over. The challenge is his personality and demeanor can turn on a dime going from excited to angry. Since it was hard to read what mood he might be in and what his reaction would be to any given thing, people quickly became afraid of being called into meetings or having to share negative news with him.</p><p id="319e"><strong>At times it felt like the inner circle was too zealous and fanatical in their unwavering support of everything he said.</strong> When individuals encouraged me to be careful about what I said I politely thanked them and said I would not be taking their advice. I had no interest in adding to a culture of fear or walking on eggshells around Elon. Either he would respect me for being real or he could fire me. Either outcome was okay.</p><p id="96bb">I quickly learned that product and business decisions were nearly always the result of him following his gut instinct, and he didn’t seem compelled to seek out or rely on a lot of data or expertise to inform it. That was particularly frustrating for me since I believed I had useful institutional knowledge that could help him make better decisions. Instead he’d poll Twitter, ask a friend, or even ask his biographer for product advice. <strong>At times it seemed he trusted random feedback more than the people in the room who spent their lives dedicated to tackling the problem at hand.</strong> I never figured out why and remain puzzled by it.</p><p id="622d">I don’t think things had to be as difficult or dramatic as they turned out to be but I can’t say I’d bet against Elon or count him out. He’s smart and has enough money to make a lot of mistakes and then course correct when things go awry. As the largest shareholder he can tank the value in the short-term, but eventually he’ll need things to turn around.</p><p id="7e9f"><strong>His focus on speed is incredible and he’s obviously not afraid of blowing things up</strong>, but now the real measure will be how it get reconstructed and if enough people want the new <em>everything app</em> he is building.</p><p id="c2ac">I learned a ton from watching Elon up close — the good, the bad and the ugly. His boldness, passion and storytelling is inspiring, but his lack of process and empathy is painful.</p><p id="e2bb">Elon has an exceptional talent for tackling hard physics-based problems but products that facilitate human connection and communication require a different type of social-emotional intelligence.</p><p id="03ff"><strong>Social networks are hard to kill but they’re not immune from death spirals.</strong> Only time will tell what the outcome will be but I hope X finds its footing because competition is good for consumers.</p><p id="7414">In the meantime, I have a lot of empathy for the employees who are working tirelessly behind the scenes, the advertisers who want a stable platform to sell their stuff on, and the customers who are experiencing chaotic updates. It’s been a madhouse.</p><p id="4d34">Twitter moved at the speed of molasses and suffered from bureaucracy but now X is run by a mercurial leader whose instinct is driven by the unique and undoubtedly weird experience of being the biggest voice on the platform.</p><p id="7203"><strong>Many of you know me from the <em>sleeping bag incident</em> where I slept on a conference room floor</strong>, so I figure, let’s talk about that too.</p><p id="937e">Going viral was an odd and interesting experience. I was attacked by people on the left and called a billionaire bootlicker, while simultaneously being attacked by people on the right for being a working mom who was demonized as an example of a woman choosing her career over her family.</p><p id="de80">Thankfully I can laugh at myself and I don’t take armchair keyboard ideologues too seriously. <strong>Being the main character on the timeline, even for a few minutes, requires a thick skin and a strong sense of self.</strong></p><p id="e1f5">The real story is pretty simple. I was given a nearly impossible deadline for his first project and as the product lead I would never ask anyone to do anything I wasn’t willing to do myself. So I worked round the clock alongside an amazing team spanning many timezones, and we delivered it on schedule — truly against the odds. It was intense but also fun.</p><p id="7e54"><em>Those first few months were wildly crazy but I wanted to be there and I have no regrets.</em></p><p id="f2f5">Showing up and giving it your all should, in most cases, be celebrated. Obviously you can’t work at that pace forever but there are moments where bursts are mission critical. I’ve pulled many all-nighters in my career and also when I was a student for something that mattered to me. I don’t regret putting in long hours or being ambitious, and feel proud of how far I’ve come from where I started thanks in part to that type of work ethic.</p><p id="505a"><strong>I think of life as a game, and being at Twitter after the acquisition was like playing life at Level 10 on Hard Mode. </strong>Since I like taking on difficult challenges I found it interesting and rewarding because I was growing and learning so rapidly.</p><p id="6d44">I realize our society today trends toward polarization but when it comes to this app, its owner, and its future, <strong>I am neither a fan girl nor a hater — I’m an optimistic pragmatist</strong>.</p><p id="36f9">This may really irritate the internet but you cannot pigeonhole me into some radical position of either loving or hating every change that’s occurred. I escaped my fundamentalist upbringing and am a free thinker these days. <strong>Everyone can be seen as both a hero or a villain, depending on who is telling what angle of the story. </strong>Elon doesn’t deserve to be venerated or vilified. He’s a complicated person with an unfathomable amount of financial and geopolitical power which is why <strong>humanity needs him to err on the side of goodness, rather than political divisiveness and pettiness</strong>.</p><p id="e2d7">I disagree with many of his decisions and am surprised by his willingness to burn so much down, but with enough money and time, something new &amp; innovative may emerge.</p><p id="77a7">I hope it does.</p><p id="676a"><strong>Sometimes I get asked about how I felt when I got laid off, and the truth is it was the best gift I’ve ever received. </strong>Sure the headlines and punchlines wrote themselves but I was battle hardened by then. I knew that I’d worked in a way where I could walk out with my head held high. I have no bitterness about the Product Management team being dismantled, and it made sense for me to exit as nearly all of the remaining PMs were let go.</p><p id="2d07">Going on a sabbatical afterward has been exactly what I needed to decompress and I’m finally feeling rested and relaxed. I’m a creative and a builder, so sooner than later I’ll jump back into a high intensity company but I’m grateful for this season of thinking, reading, traveling and being with people I love.</p><p id="d8c5">After having time to reflect <strong>I believe more than ever that the very best outcomes flow from great leadership that combines <em>the head and the heart</em></strong>.</p><p id="f153">I’d be remiss if I didn’t note that in all of this there is also a cautionary tale for anyone who succeeds at something — which is that <strong>the higher you climb, the smaller your world becomes</strong>. It’s a strange paradox but the richest and most powerful people are also some of the most isolated.</p><p id="e085">I found myself frequently looking at Elon and seeing a person who seemed quite alone because his time and energy was so purely devoted to work, which is not the model of a life I want to live.</p><p id="7f5d">Money and fame can create psychological prisons which may worsen mental health conditions. We’ve all seen high profile cases of celebrities who end up with some combination of depression, paranoia, delusions of grandeur, mania and/or erratic behavior.</p><p id="09e0">Living in an echo chamber is dangerous and <strong>being at the top makes a person even more susceptible to being surrounded by yes people when nearly everyone around you is on the payroll and somehow stands to benefit from being in your orbit</strong>. Figuring out how to keep “better angels” around in the form of family, friends, and teammates is critical to staying on the rails and enduring intense ups and downs. Everyone needs to hear hard truths sometimes and if you fire all the people who speak up then the reality distortion field may just turn into a vortex.</p><p id="aa69">I was drawn to Twitter because I’m obsessed with the problem of loneliness and connection between people. <strong>I find it fascinating &amp; troubling that humans are getting lonelier as we simultaneously create a world that’s both safer and wealthier.</strong> I don’t believe that trade-off has to exist, which is why I keep returning to that theme in my personal and professional life.</p><p id="e729">I realize this is <em>too long of a tweet</em> but Twitter was a weird and special place on the internet, and I’m grateful to have played a teeny tiny role in its story and evolution.</p><p id="996a">I’m here for whatever comes next — on this app and in new places. Consumer social is very much alive and at a fascinating juncture, so I’ll be watching and participating and sharing hot takes because I don’t want to, and probably can’t, turn that part of me off.</p><p id="462d">Perhaps X becomes a resounding success. Or it fails epically.</p><p id="9005">Either way, I expect it will continue to be a very entertaining ride.</p><p id="876c">🫡</p></div></div>]]></description>

Here’s a list of some of the things that didn’t work:</p><ul><li>Metrics</li></ul><ul><li>Any pixel tracking ( Facebook Ads / Google Ads / etc )</li></ul><ul><li>Abandoned checkout emails</li></ul><ul><li>SMS abandoned cart</li></ul><ul><li>FB Messenger abandoned cart ( it was a thing back then )</li></ul><ul><li>Refunds</li></ul><p>There was no way that they could use the checkout until all of their services worked - I had no idea how I missed all those things. Worse, I had no idea how to fix those problems. I promised to find a solution somehow and had a long trip home.</p><p>It took me the whole summer to solve most of the issues. </p><p>Some things I managed to integrate, some things I had to rebuild myself, but in September of 2018 we finally launched on one of their stores. Then we added more. </p><p>Finally, the app was live. 🚀 </p><h3 data-id="27d8087ad01248c8aa899d805044e1f7" id="the-first-100-customers"><span><a href="#the-first-100-customers" title="The first 100 customers"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>The first 100 customers</span></span></h3><figure><div><p><img alt="One of the first designs for the mainstream Checkout X product" src="https://cdn.feather.blog/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fusenotioncms.com%2Fproxy%2Fblock%2Fd4b5abbd-0ca6-4313-9a96-6623218f9b3e%252F6130b4b7-ec1b-46d9-a675-16dbd427ddbb%252F1.0-Begin-Checkout_Copy_2.png&amp;optimizer=image" height="100%"></p><figcaption>One of the first designs for the mainstream Checkout X product</figcaption></div></figure><p>Once the SuperPrix guys onboarded all of their shops and things were stable ( relatively 🙄&nbsp;) I started working towards getting more customers.</p><p>At the time, every customer had to be onboarded manually. I had to explain to them all the weird stuff that the app brought with it ( custom metrics ; integrations; etc ) and I had to add custom code to their shop. </p><p>Slowly but surely I got to my first 100 customers using the following channels:</p><p><b>Bluesnap partnership</b></p><p>At the time Bluesnap got kicked out of Shopify ( not sure why ) so they referred us to prospects that were on Shopify. </p><p>We had a lot of issues in our partnership, merchants were signing up for a payment provider and they were forced to use a custom checkout with all it’s quirks ( and benefits ). </p><p>The thing was, Bluesnap was selling their benefits, not ours - so the merchants were confused on why they had to use an alternative checkout. </p><p>It was tough but I got some of my first customer from them - I guess it was worth it.</p><p><b>Negative virality</b></p><p>For most products - being viral means that your existing users would recommend it to their friends.

   <p>Already thinking about next summer's vacation plans? If Europe is on your short list, there could be one extra step to take before boarding that plane. </p>   <p>Starting in 2024, American passport holders traveling to 30 European countries will need authorization via the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). </p>   <p> Though it may sound complicated, the ETIAS and the reasoning behind it are quite similar to existing travel requirements and reflect increasing fear of terrorism in the U.S., Europe and around the world. </p>   <p>Here's what you need to know. </p>   <h3>What is ETIAS? Is it a visa? </h3>   <p>While some media outlets are taking a cue from <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en">the European Union's travel site</a> and calling this a visa, in truth, ETIAS is more like a travel authorization form. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1190457886" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"It's definitely not a visa," said Dan Hamilton, a senior non-resident fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. "It's an electronic entry-point, an authorization for countries that are currently visa-free." </p>   <p>Even <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_18_4362">the European Commission has said as much (and in bold letters)</a>, writing this is "not a visa" but rather an "automated IT system" in a press release on the discussions around it back in 2018. </p>   <p>Whatever you want to call it, the ETIAS form is not what you'd seek if you're trying to work or live in Europe, but rather what you'll need for short-term trips — up to 90 days within any 180-day period. </p>   
   <h3>Why is it being implemented? </h3>   <p>These new requirements have been years in the making, stemming back to a rise in terrorism fears following 9/11. It's very similar to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization — or ESTA — program that <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visas-news-archive/20080801_dhs-announces-implementation-of-the-electronic-system-for-travel.html">the U.S. implemented in 2008</a>. </p>   <p>At the heart of ETIAS is an electronic database system to better track who's coming and going. According to the <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Tesat_Report_2022_0.pdf">EU's latest report on terrorism data</a>, EU law enforcement authorities arrested about 388 suspects for terror-related offenses in 2021, more than half of whom were accused of being associated with Jihadist groups based abroad. </p>   <p>The European Commission says ETIAS may have the added impact of cutting down on "irregular migration" (i.e. illegal immigration), but one thing the form is definitely not aimed to do is deter tourism in general. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1190457683" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105323610/flight-tickets-inflation-pandemic-revenge-travel-vacation-europe-recession">Crowded cities, inflated airfare</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/25/1189837347/u-s-european-heat-waves-virtually-impossible-without-climate-change-new-study-fi">extreme heat disasters</a> may all be making headlines this summer, but many of these European countries are still depending on tourism revenue to help them bounce back from pandemic slumps, Hamilton said. </p>   <p>And the pandemic is another one of the many reasons this new requirement has been delayed by decades — there was no need for ETIAS when countries closed their borders to all travel amid fears of spreading COVID-19. </p>   <p>"Another part of it is simply the pace of the way this parliament and European commission works," Hamilton explained in an interview with NPR. "They're ending their term and pushing through a lot of these directives because parliamentary elections happen next June." </p>   
   <p>"And getting 30 countries to agree on anything takes a long time," he added. </p>   <h3>When does it take effect? </h3>   <p>The European Union's website says the new authorization will start in 2024 but hasn't clarified a specific date. A press spokesperson for the union's travel arm did not respond to NPR's request for information. </p>   <p>And, similarly, a spokesperson for the State Department told NPR that the U.S. government website for international travel (travel.state.gov) would be updated "once the regulation goes into effect," but didn't specify when that would be. </p>   <p>"Frankly, I'd be surprised if this starts on time," Hamilton said. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/09/701851610/eu-officials-move-to-clarify-rules-for-u-s-travelers-after-erroneous-visa-report">rollout of ETIAS has already been delayed</a> at least once. </p>   <p>But it couldn't hurt to plan ahead for any 2024 travel just to be safe. </p>   <h3>Who needs to apply for ETIAS approval? </h3>   <p>Basically, all passport holders from 60 countries who can currently travel to most European destinations without a visa — and that includes American passport holders — will now need to get ETIAS authorization for the same trip. That's about 1.4 billion people, by <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en">the European Union's estimation. </a></p>   <p>There are <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/system/files/2022-11/These%2030%20European%20countries%20require%20ETIAS_en.pdf">30 European countries in total on the impacted destination list</a>, including those in the "Schengen Area" — 27 European countries, many that are part of the European Union, that agreed to ease border restrictions to facilitate the movement of people within Europe. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1190457482" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Those Schengen countries include top vacation spots like France, Italy and Spain. </p>   <p>The other three countries on the list are Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus, which are all trying to become a part of the Schengen Area soon. </p>   <p>You can check the full list of <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias/who-should-apply_en#ETIAS-countries">both impacted passport holders and affected European destinations here. </a></p>   <h3>How can you apply for ETIAS approval (and does it cost money)?</h3>   <p>The application isn't open yet, but the European Union says that when it is, all necessary forms can be filled out via a web portal or mobile phone application. </p>   
   <p>You'll be asked to share personal information such as your date of birth, parents' names and details about your current occupation and previous criminal convictions. You'll also need to share a passport that is not set to expire in less than three months. </p>   <p>Oh, and you'll have to pay a fee of 7 euros (about $8). </p>   <h3>When is the right time to apply? </h3>   <p>If you want to play it safe, apply well in advance of your trip — no later than a month out. </p>   <p>ETIAS says most applications "are processed within minutes" and decisions are delivered within four days. But that wait could take up to 14 days if you are requested to supply additional information and up to 30 days if you're invited to interview. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1190457576" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Those denied an application can appeal, but that process could be even lengthier. </p>   <p>The European Union says ETIAS approval will stay valid for three years or until the passport you used in your application expires. </p>   <p>Naturally, you'll also need to follow the ETIAS rules to stay in good standing. </p>   <p>Those with ETIAS approval can stay in the European countries on the list for up to 90 days within any 180-day period. So you can leave and come back, but you can't stay in the confines of the countries on the list for 91 days or more non-stop. </p>   <h3>What happens if I don't apply for this and try to travel to Europe?<strong> </strong></h3>   <p>Your ETIAS approval will be linked to your passport. So without it, airport security (or cruise, bus or train line staff) won't let you board. </p>   <p>In other words, you can kiss that dream vacation goodbye. </p>

      The heat in July has already <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/08/world/extreme-global-temperature-heat-records-climate/index.html" target="_blank">been so extreme</a> that it is “virtually certain” this month will break records “by a significant margin,” the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization said in a report published Thursday.

      We have just lived through the hottest three-week-period on record – and almost certainly in more than a hundred thousand years.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_B568D4B2-7B89-EFBA-5B83-96CED629E743@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      Typically these records, which track the average air temperature across the entire world, are broken by hundredths<strong> </strong>of a degree. But the temperature for the first 23 days of July averaged 16.95 degrees Celsius (62.51 Fahrenheit), well above the previous record of 16.63 degrees Celsius (61.93 Fahrenheit) set in July 2019, according to the report.

      The data used to track these records<strong> </strong>goes back to 1940, but many scientists – including those at Copernicus – say it’s almost certain that these temperatures are the warmest the planet has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/world/hottest-day-world-climate-el-nino-intl/index.html" target="_blank">seen in 120,000 years</a>, given what we know from millennia of climate data extracted from tree rings, coral reefs and deep sea sediment cores.

      It all adds up to a blistering Northern Hemisphere<strong> </strong>summer – potentially an unprecedented one. “The odds are certainly in a favor of a record-breaking summer,” said Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus, although he cautioned that it’s too early to state that with confidence.

      Human-caused climate change is the main driver of this extraordinary heat, Burgess said. “The global air temperature is directly proportional to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”

      The arrival of El Niño, a natural climate fluctuation with a warming impact, has not had a huge impact on the temperatures as it is still in its developmental phase, Burgess said, but it will play much more of a role next year, she added, and will likely drive temperatures even higher.

      “We are seven months into 2023 and almost every month this year has been in the top five hottest on record,” said Burgess, adding that if the trends continue into the fall and winter, 2023 is likely to be among the warmest years ever recorded.

        <h2>Adding new evaluators or eval sets </h2>
        <p>
            We also welcome contributions for new evaluators or new eval sets!
            For making new evaluators, we release our ground-truth
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#data-release" target="_blank">human annotations</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#analyzing-an-evaluator" target="_blank">comparison
            metrics</a>.
            We also release a

            to follow for making new eval sets.
            We specifically encourage contributions for harder instructions distributions and for safety testing of
            LLMs.
        </p>
        <h2>AlpacaEval limitations</h2>
        <p>
            While AlpacaEval provides a useful comparison of model capabilities in following instructions,
            it is not a comprehensive or gold-standard evaluation of model abilities.
            For one, as detailed in the
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14387" target="_blank">AlpacaFarm paper</a>,
            the auto annotator winrates are correlated with length.
            Though human annotations also display this bias,
            it is unclear if more verbose answers add utility in downstream tasks.
            Additionally, the AlpacaFarm eval set, though diverse, consists mainly of simple instructions.
            We encourage the community to contribute new, more complex eval sets, such as for tool use.
            Finally, AlpacaEval does not evaluate the safety of any of the models.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36895220">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! I'm Sai, the co-founder and CEO of PeerDB (<a href="https://www.peerdb.io/">https://www.peerdb.io/</a>), a Postgres-first data-movement platform that makes moving data in and out of Postgres fast and simple. PeerDB is free and open (<a href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb">https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb</a>) and we provide a Docker stack for users to try us out. Our repo is at <a href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb">https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb</a> and there’s a 5-minute quickstart here: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart">https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart</a>.</p><p>For the past 8 years, working at Microsoft on Postgres on Azure, and before that at Citus Data, I’ve worked closely with customers running Postgres at the heart of their data stack, storing anywhere from 10s of GB of data to 10s of TB.</p><p>This was when I got exposed to the challenges customers faced when moving data in and out of Postgres. Usually they would try existing ETL tools, fail, and decide to build in-house solutions. Common issues with these tools included painfully slow syncs - syncing 100s of GB of data took days; flaky and unreliable - frequent crashes, loss of data precision on target etc., and; feature-limited - lack of configurability, unsupported data types and so on.</p><p>I remember a specific scenario where a tool didn’t support something as simple as the Postgres’ COPY command to ingest data. This would have improved the throughput by orders of magnitude. We (customer and me) reached out to that company to request them to add this feature. They couldn’t prioritize this feature because it wasn’t very easy - their tech stack was designed to support 100s of connectors rather than supporting a native Postgres feature.</p><p>After multiple such occurrences, I thought, why not build a tool specialized for Postgres, making the lives of many Postgres users easier. I reached out to my long-time buddy Kaushik, who was building operating systems at Google and had led data teams at Safegraph and Palantir. We spent a few weeks building an MVP that streamed data in real-time from Postgres to BigQuery. It was 10 times faster than existing tools and maintained data freshness of less than 30 seconds. We realized that there were many Postgres native and infrastructural optimizations we could do to provide a rich data-movement experience for Postgres users. This is when we decided to start PeerDB!</p><p>We started with two main use cases: Real-time Change Data Capture from Postgres (demo: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/usecases/realtime-cdc#demo">https://docs.peerdb.io/usecases/realtime-cdc#demo</a>) and Real-time Streaming of query results from Postgres (demo: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/usecases/realtime-streaming-of-query-results#demo">https://docs.peerdb.io/usecases/realtime-streaming-of-query-...</a>). The 2nd demo shows PeerDB streaming a table with 100M rows from Postgres to Snowflake.</p><p>We implement multiple optimizations to provide a fast, reliable, feature-rich experience.  For performance, we can parallelize the initial load of a large table, still ensuring consistency. Syncing 100s of GB goes from days to minutes. We do this by logically partitioning the table based on internal tuple identifiers (CTID) and parallelly streaming those partitions (inspired by this DuckDB blog - <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/09/30/postgres-scanner.html#parallelization" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://duckdb.org/2022/09/30/postgres-scanner.html#parallel...</a>)</p><p>For CDC, we don’t use Debezium, rather handle replication more natively—reading the slot, replicating the changes, keeping state etc. We made this choice mainly for flexibility. Staying native helps us use existing and future Postgres enhancements more effectively. For example, if the order of rows across tables on the target is not important, we can parallelize reading of a single slot across multiple tables and improve performance. Our architecture is designed for real-time syncs, which enables data-freshness of a few 10s of seconds even at large throughputs (10k+ tps).</p><p>We have fault tolerance mechanisms for reliability (<a href="https://blog.peerdb.io/using-temporal-to-scale-data-synchronization-at-peerdb">https://blog.peerdb.io/using-temporal-to-scale-data-synchron...</a>) and support multiple features including log-based (CDC) / query based streaming, efficient syncing of tables with large (TOAST) columns, configurable batching and parallelism to prevent OOMs and crashes etc.</p><p>For usability - we provide a Postgres compatible SQL layer for data-movement. This makes the life of data engineers much easier. They can develop pipelines using a framework they are familiar with, without needing to deal with custom UIs and REST APIs. They can use Postgres' 100s of integrations to build and manage ETL. We extend Postgres' SQL grammar with a few new intuitive SQL commands to enable real-time data streaming across stores. Because of this, we were able to add dbt integration via Dagster (in private preview) in a few hours! We expect data-engineers to unravel similar integrations with PeerDB easily, and plan to make this grammar richer as we evolve.</p><p>PeerDB consists of the following components to handle data replication: (1) PeerDB Server uses the pgwire protocol to mimic a PostgreSQL server, responsible for query routing and generating gRPC requests to the Flow API. It relies on AST analysis to make informed decisions on routing. (2) Flow API: an API layer that deals with gRPC commands, orchestrating the data sync operations; (3) Flow Workers execute the data read-write operations from the source to the destination. Built to scale horizontally, they interact with Temporal for increased resilience. The types of data replication supported include CDC streaming replication and query-based batch replication. Workers do all of the heavy lifting, and have data store specific optimizations.</p><p>Currently we support 6 target data stores (BigQuery, Snowflake, Postgres, S3, Kafka etc) for data movement from Postgres. This doc captures the current status of the connectors: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/sql/commands/supported-connectors">https://docs.peerdb.io/sql/commands/supported-connectors</a>.</p><p>As we spoke to more customers, we realized that getting data into PostgreSQL at scale is equally important and hard. For example one of our customers wants to periodically sync data in multiple SQL Server instances (running on the edge) to their centralized Postgres database. Requests for Oracle to Postgres migrations are also common. So now we’re also supporting source data stores with Postgres as the target (currently SQL Server and Postgres itself, with more to come).</p><p>We are actively working with customers to onboard them to our self-hosted enterprise offering. Our fully hosted offering on the cloud is in private preview. We haven’t yet decided on the pricing. One common concern we’ve heard from customers is that existing tools are expensive and charge based on the amount of data transferred. To address this, we are considering a more transparent way of pricing—for example, pricing based on provisioned hardware (cpu, memory, disk). We’re open for feedback on this!</p><p>Check out our github repo - <a href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb">https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb</a> and go ahead and give it a spin (5-minute quickstart <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart">https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart</a>).</p><p>We want to provide the world’s best data-movement experience for Postgres. We would love to get your feedback on product experience, our thesis and anything else that comes to your mind. It would be super useful for us. Thank you!</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

However, the last six years working with Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) have forced me to think about systems in broader terms than I ever have before. In a given week, I get to be involved in everything from hard disk mechanics, firmware, and the physical properties of storage media at one end, to customer-facing performance experience and API expressiveness at the other. And the boundaries of the system are not just technical ones: I’ve had the opportunity to help engineering teams move faster, worked with finance and hardware teams to build cost-following services, and worked with customers to create gob-smackingly cool applications in areas like video streaming, genomics, and generative AI.</p><p>What I’d really like to share with you more than anything else is my sense of wonder at the storage systems that are all collectively being built at this point in time, because they are pretty amazing. In this post, I want to cover a few of the interesting nuances of building something like S3, and the lessons learned and sometimes surprising observations from my time in S3.</p><h2 id="17-years-ago-on-a-university-campus-far-far-away">17 years ago, on a university campus far, far away… <a href="#17-years-ago-on-a-university-campus-far-far-away"></a></h2><p><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/s3.html">S3 launched on March 14th, 2006</a>, which means it turned 17 this year. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that for engineers starting their careers today, S3 has simply existed as an internet storage service for as long as you’ve been working with computers. Seventeen years ago, I was just finishing my PhD at the University of Cambridge. I was working in the lab that developed Xen, an open-source hypervisor that a few companies, including Amazon, were using to build the first public clouds. A group of us moved on from the Xen project at Cambridge to create a startup called XenSource that, instead of using Xen to build a public cloud, aimed to commercialize it by selling it as enterprise software. You might say that we missed a bit of an opportunity there. XenSource grew and was eventually acquired by Citrix, and I wound up learning a whole lot about growing teams and growing a business (and negotiating commercial leases, and fixing small server room HVAC systems, and so on) – things that I wasn’t exposed to in grad school.</p><p>But at the time, what I was convinced I really wanted to do was to be a university professor. I applied for a bunch of faculty jobs and wound up finding one at UBC (which worked out really well, because my wife already had a job in Vancouver and we love the city). I threw myself into the faculty role and foolishly grew my lab to 18 students, which is something that I’d encourage anyone that’s starting out as an assistant professor to never, ever do. It was thrilling to have such a large lab full of amazing people and it was absolutely exhausting to try to supervise that many graduate students all at once, but, I’m pretty sure I did a horrible job of it. That said, our research lab was an incredible community of people and we built things that I’m still really proud of today, and we wrote all sorts of really fun papers on security, storage, virtualization, and networking.</p><p>A little over two years into my professor job at UBC, a few of my students and I decided to do another startup. We started a company called Coho Data that took advantage of two really early technologies at the time: NVMe SSDs and programmable ethernet switches, to build a high-performance scale-out storage appliance. We grew Coho to about 150 people with offices in four countries, and once again it was an opportunity to learn things about stuff like the load bearing strength of second-floor server room floors, and analytics workflows in Wall Street hedge funds – both of which were well outside my training as a CS researcher and teacher. Coho was a wonderful and deeply educational experience, but in the end, the company didn’t work out and we had to wind it down.</p><p>And so, I found myself sitting back in my mostly empty office at UBC. I realized that I’d graduated my last PhD student, and I wasn’t sure that I had the strength to start building a research lab from scratch all over again. I also felt like if I was going to be in a professor job where I was expected to teach students about the cloud, that I might do well to get some first-hand experience with how it actually works.</p><p>I interviewed at some cloud providers, and had an especially fun time talking to the folks at Amazon and decided to join. And that’s where I work now. I’m based in Vancouver, and I’m an engineer that gets to work across all of Amazon’s storage products. So far, a whole lot of my time has been spent on S3.</p><h2 id="how-s3-works">How S3 works <a href="#how-s3-works"></a></h2><p>When I joined Amazon in 2017, I arranged to spend most of my first day at work with Seth Markle. Seth is one of S3’s early engineers, and he took me into a little room with a whiteboard and then spent six hours explaining how S3 worked.</p><p>It was awesome. We drew pictures, and I asked question after question non-stop and I couldn’t stump Seth. It was exhausting, but in the best kind of way. Even then S3 was a very large system, but in broad strokes — which was what we started with on the whiteboard — it probably looks like most other storage systems that you’ve seen.</p><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/fast-s3-white-board.png" alt="Whiteboard drawing of S3" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Amazon Simple Storage Service - Simple, right?</figcaption></figure><p>S3 is an object storage service with an HTTP REST API. There is a frontend fleet with a REST API, a namespace service, a storage fleet that’s full of hard disks, and a fleet that does background operations. In an enterprise context we might call these background tasks “data services,” like replication and tiering. What’s interesting here, when you look at the highest-level block diagram of S3’s technical design, is the fact that AWS tends to ship its org chart. This is a phrase that’s often used in a pretty disparaging way, but in this case it’s absolutely fascinating. Each of these broad components is a part of the S3 organization. Each has a leader, and a bunch of teams that work on it. And if we went into the next level of detail in the diagram, expanding one of these boxes out into the individual components that are inside it, what we’d find is that all the nested components are their own teams, have their own fleets, and, in many ways, operate like independent businesses.</p><p>All in, S3 today is composed of hundreds of microservices that are structured this way. Interactions between these teams are literally API-level contracts, and, just like the code that we all write, sometimes we get modularity wrong and those team-level interactions are kind of inefficient and clunky, and it’s a bunch of work to go and fix it, but that’s part of building software, and it turns out, part of building software teams too.</p><h2 id="two-early-observations">Two early observations <a href="#two-early-observations"></a></h2><p>Before Amazon, I’d worked on research software, I’d worked on pretty widely adopted open-source software, and I’d worked on enterprise software and hardware appliances that were used in production inside some really large businesses. But by and large, that software was a thing we designed, built, tested, and shipped. It was the software that we packaged and the software that we delivered. Sure, we had escalations and support cases and we fixed bugs and shipped patches and updates, but we ultimately delivered software. Working on a global storage service like S3 was completely different: S3 is effectively a living, breathing organism. Everything, from developers writing code running next to the hard disks at the bottom of the software stack, to technicians installing new racks of storage capacity in our data centers, to customers tuning applications for performance, everything is one single, continuously evolving system. S3’s customers aren’t buying software, they are buying a service and they expect the experience of using that service to be continuously, predictably fantastic.</p><p>The first observation was that <strong>I was going to have to change, and really broaden how I thought about software systems and how they behave</strong>. This didn’t just mean broadening thinking about software to include those hundreds of microservices that make up S3, it meant broadening to also include all the people who design, build, deploy, and operate all that code. It’s all one thing, and you can’t really think about it just as software. It’s software, hardware, and people, and it’s always growing and constantly evolving.</p><p>The second observation was that despite the fact that this whiteboard diagram sketched the broad strokes of the organization and the software, it was also wildly misleading, because it completely obscured the scale of the system. Each one of the boxes represents its own collection of scaled out software services, often themselves built from collections of services. <strong>It would literally take me years to come to terms with the scale of the system that I was working with, and even today I often find myself surprised at the consequences of that scale.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/fast-s3-stats.png" alt="Table of key S3 numbers as of 24-July 2023" loading="lazy"><figcaption>S3 by the numbers (as of publishing this post).</figcaption></figure><h2 id="technical-scale-scale-and-the-physics-of-storage">Technical Scale: Scale and the physics of storage <a href="#technical-scale-scale-and-the-physics-of-storage"></a></h2><p>It probably isn’t very surprising for me to mention that S3 is a really big system, and it is built using a LOT of hard disks. Millions of them. And if we’re talking about S3, it’s worth spending a little bit of time talking about hard drives themselves. Hard drives are amazing, and they’ve kind of always been amazing.</p><p>The first hard drive was built by Jacob Rabinow, who was a researcher for the predecessor of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Rabinow was an expert in magnets and mechanical engineering, and he’d been asked to build a machine to do magnetic storage on flat sheets of media, almost like pages in a book. He decided that idea was too complex and inefficient, so, stealing the idea of a spinning disk from record players, he built an array of spinning magnetic disks that could be read by a single head. To make that work, he cut a pizza slice-style notch out of each disk that the head could move through to reach the appropriate platter. Rabinow <a href="https://www.si.edu/media/NMAH/NMAH-AC0196_rabi701123.pdf">described this</a> as being like “like reading a book without opening it.” The first commercially available hard disk appeared 7 years later in 1956, when IBM introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM_magnetic_disk_drives#Early_IBM_HDDs">the 350 disk storage unit</a>, as part of the 305 RAMAC computer system. We’ll come back to the RAMAC in a bit.</p><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/fast-magnetic-drive-chm.jpg" alt="The first magnetic memory device" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The first magnetic memory device. Credit: https://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/rabinow-patents-magnetic-disk-data-storage/</figcaption></figure><p>Today, 67 years after that first commercial drive was introduced, the world uses lots of hard drives. Globally, the number of bytes stored on hard disks continues to grow every year, but the applications of hard drives are clearly diminishing. We just seem to be using hard drives for fewer and fewer things. Today, consumer devices are effectively all solid-state, and a large amount of enterprise storage is similarly switching to SSDs. Jim Gray predicted this direction in 2006, when he very presciently said: “Tape is Dead. Disk is Tape. Flash is Disk. RAM Locality is King.“ This quote has been used a lot over the past couple of decades to motivate flash storage, but the thing it observes about disks is just as interesting.</p><p>Hard disks don’t fill the role of general storage media that they used to because they are big (physically and in terms of bytes), slower, and relatively fragile pieces of media. For almost every common storage application, flash is superior. But hard drives are absolute marvels of technology and innovation, and for the things they are good at, they are absolutely amazing. One of these strengths is cost efficiency, and in a large-scale system like S3, there are some unique opportunities to design around some of the constraints of individual hard disks.</p><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/fast-hd-anatomy.jpg" alt="Diagram: The anatomy of a hard disk" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The anatomy of a hard disk. Credit: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mechanical-components-of-a-typical-hard-disk-drive_fig8_224323123</figcaption></figure><p>As I was preparing for my talk at FAST, I asked Tim Rausch if he could help me revisit the old plane flying over blades of grass hard drive example. Tim did his PhD at CMU and was one of the early researchers on heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) drives. Tim has worked on hard drives generally, and HAMR specifically for most of his career, and we both agreed that the plane analogy – where we scale up the head of a hard drive to be a jumbo jet and talk about the relative scale of all the other components of the drive – is a great way to illustrate the complexity and mechanical precision that’s inside an HDD. So, here’s our version for 2023.</p><p>Imagine a hard drive head as a 747 flying over a grassy field at 75 miles per hour. The air gap between the bottom of the plane and the top of the grass is two sheets of paper. Now, if we measure bits on the disk as blades of grass, the track width would be 4.6 blades of grass wide and the bit length would be one blade of grass. As the plane flew over the grass it would count blades of grass and only miss one blade for every 25 thousand times the plane circled the Earth.</p><p><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/fast-plane-example.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That’s a bit error rate of 1 in 10^15 requests. In the real world, we see that blade of grass get missed pretty frequently – and it’s actually something we need to account for in S3.</p><p>Now, let’s go back to that first hard drive, the IBM RAMAC from 1956. Here are some specs on that thing:</p><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/fast-ramac-stats.png" alt="RAMAC hard disk stats" width="70%"><p>Now let’s compare it to the largest HDD that you can buy as of publishing this, which is a Western Digital Ultrastar DC HC670 26TB. Since the RAMAC, capacity has improved 7.2M times over, while the physical drive has gotten 5,000x smaller. It’s 6 billion times cheaper per byte in inflation-adjusted dollars. But despite all that, seek times – the time it takes to perform a random access to a specific piece of data on the drive – have only gotten 150x better. Why? Because they’re mechanical. We have to wait for an arm to move, for the platter to spin, and those mechanical aspects haven’t really improved at the same rate. If you are doing random reads and writes to a drive as fast as you possibly can, you can expect about 120 operations per second. The number was about the same in 2006 when S3 launched, and it was about the same even a decade before that.</p><p>This tension between HDDs growing in capacity but staying flat for performance is a central influence in S3’s design. We need to scale the number of bytes we store by moving to the largest drives we can as aggressively as we can. Today’s largest drives are 26TB, and industry roadmaps are pointing at a path to 200TB (200TB drives!) in the next decade. At that point, if we divide up our random accesses fairly across all our data, we will be allowed to do 1 I/O per second per 2TB of data on disk.</p><p>S3 doesn’t have 200TB drives yet, but I can tell you that we anticipate using them when they’re available. And all the drive sizes between here and there.</p><h2 id="managing-heat-data-placement-and-performance">Managing heat: data placement and performance <a href="#managing-heat-data-placement-and-performance"></a></h2><p>So, with all this in mind, one of the biggest and most interesting technical scale problems that I’ve encountered is in managing and balancing I/O demand across a really large set of hard drives. In S3, we refer to that problem as heat management.</p><p>By heat, I mean the number of requests that hit a given disk at any point in time. If we do a bad job of managing heat, then we end up focusing a disproportionate number of requests on a single drive, and we create hotspots because of the limited I/O that’s available from that single disk. For us, this becomes an optimization challenge of figuring out how we can place data across our disks in a way that minimizes the number of hotspots.</p><p>Hotspots are small numbers of overloaded drives in a system that ends up getting bogged down, and results in poor overall performance for requests dependent on those drives. When you get a hot spot, things don’t fall over, but you queue up requests and the customer experience is poor. Unbalanced load stalls requests that are waiting on busy drives, those stalls amplify up through layers of the software storage stack, they get amplified by dependent I/Os for metadata lookups or erasure coding, and they result in a very small proportion of higher latency requests — or “stragglers”. In other words, hotspots at individual hard disks create tail latency, and ultimately, if you don’t stay on top of them, they grow to eventually impact all request latency.</p><p>As S3 scales, we want to be able to spread heat as evenly as possible, and let individual users benefit from as much of the HDD fleet as possible. This is tricky, because we don’t know when or how data is going to be accessed at the time that it’s written, and that’s when we need to decide where to place it. Before joining Amazon, I spent time doing research and building systems that tried to predict and manage this I/O heat at much smaller scales – like local hard drives or enterprise storage arrays and it was basically impossible to do a good job of. But this is a case where the sheer scale, and the multitenancy of S3 result in a system that is fundamentally different.</p><p>The more workloads we run on S3, the more that individual requests to objects become decorrelated with one another. Individual storage workloads tend to be really bursty, in fact, most storage workloads are completely idle most of the time and then experience sudden load peaks when data is accessed. That peak demand is much higher than the mean. But as we aggregate millions of workloads a really, really cool thing happens: the aggregate demand smooths and it becomes way more predictable. In fact, and I found this to be a really intuitive observation once I saw it at scale, once you aggregate to a certain scale you hit a point where it is difficult or impossible for any given workload to really influence the aggregate peak at all! So, with aggregation flattening the overall demand distribution, we need to take this relatively smooth demand rate and translate it into a similarly smooth level of demand across all of our disks, balancing the heat of each workload.</p><video autoplay="" muted="" controls="" loop="" width="100%">

They spread load out and give you an opportunity to steer request traffic away from hotspots. As an example, consider replication as a simple approach to encoding and protecting data. Replication protects data if disks fail by just having multiple copies on different disks. But it also gives you the freedom to read from any of the disks. When we think about replication from a capacity perspective it’s expensive. However, from an I/O perspective – at least for reading data – replication is very efficient.</p><p>We obviously don’t want to pay a replication overhead for all of the data that we store, so in S3 we also make use of erasure coding. For example, we use an algorithm, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed-Solomon</a>, and split our object into a set of k “identity” shards. Then we generate an additional set of m parity shards. As long as k of the (k+m) total shards remain available, we can read the object. This approach lets us reduce capacity overhead while surviving the same number of failures.</p><h2 id="the-impact-of-scale-on-data-placement-strategy">The impact of scale on data placement strategy <a href="#the-impact-of-scale-on-data-placement-strategy"></a></h2><p>So, redundancy schemes let us divide our data into more pieces than we need to read in order to access it, and that in turn provides us with the flexibility to avoid sending requests to overloaded disks, but there’s more we can do to avoid heat. The next step is to spread the placement of new objects broadly across our disk fleet. While individual objects may be encoded across tens of drives, we intentionally put different objects onto different sets of drives, so that each customer’s accesses are spread over a very large number of disks.</p><p>There are two big benefits to spreading the objects within each bucket across lots and lots of disks:</p><ol><li>A customer’s data only occupies a very small amount of any given disk, which helps achieve workload isolation, because individual workloads can’t generate a hotspot on any one disk.</li><li>Individual workloads can burst up to a scale of disks that would be really difficult and really expensive to build as a stand-alone system.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/fast-spiky-workload.png" alt="A spiky workload" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Here's a spiky workload</figcaption></figure><p>For instance, look at the graph above. Think about that burst, which might be a genomics customer doing parallel analysis from thousands of Lambda functions at once. That burst of requests can be served by over a million individual disks. That’s not an exaggeration. Today, we have tens of thousands of customers with S3 buckets that are spread across millions of drives. When I first started working on S3, I was really excited (and humbled!) by the systems work to build storage at this scale, but as I really started to understand the system I realized that it was the scale of customers and workloads using the system in aggregate that really allow it to be built differently, and building at this scale means that any one of those individual workloads is able to burst to a level of performance that just wouldn’t be practical to build if they were building without this scale.</p><h2 id="the-human-factors">The human factors <a href="#the-human-factors"></a></h2><p>Beyond the technology itself, there are human factors that make S3 - or any complex system - what it is. One of the core tenets at Amazon is that we want engineers and teams to fail fast, and safely. We want them to always have the confidence to move quickly as builders, while still remaining completely obsessed with delivering highly durable storage. One strategy we use to help with this in S3 is a process called “durability reviews.” It’s a human mechanism that’s not in the statistical 11 9s model, but it’s every bit as important.</p><p>When an engineer makes changes that can result in a change to our durability posture, we do a durability review. The process borrows an idea from security research: the threat model. The goal is to provide a summary of the change, a comprehensive list of threats, then describe how the change is resilient to those threats. In security, writing down a threat model encourages you to think like an adversary and imagine all the nasty things that they might try to do to your system. In a durability review, we encourage the same “what are all the things that might go wrong” thinking, and really encourage engineers to be creatively critical of their own code. The process does two things very well:</p><ol><li>It encourages authors and reviewers to really think critically about the risks we should be protecting against.</li><li>It separates risk from countermeasures, and lets us have separate discussions about the two sides.</li></ol><p>When working through durability reviews we take the durability threat model, and then we evaluate whether we have the right countermeasures and protections in place. When we are identifying those protections, we really focus on identifying coarse-grained “guardrails”. These are simple mechanisms that protect you from a large class of risks. Rather than nitpicking through each risk and identifying individual mitigations, we like simple and broad strategies that protect against a lot of stuff.</p><p>Another example of a broad strategy is demonstrated in a project we kicked off a few years back to rewrite the bottom-most layer of S3’s storage stack – the part that manages the data on each individual disk. The new storage layer is called ShardStore, and when we decided to rebuild that layer from scratch, one guardrail we put in place was to adopt a really exciting set of techniques called “lightweight formal verification”. Our team decided to shift the implementation to Rust in order to get type safety and structured language support to help identify bugs sooner, and even wrote libraries that extend that type safety to apply to on-disk structures. From a verification perspective, we built a simplified model of ShardStore’s logic, (also in Rust), and checked into the same repository alongside the real production ShardStore implementation. This model dropped all the complexity of the actual on-disk storage layers and hard drives, and instead acted as a compact but executable specification. It wound up being about 1% of the size of the real system, but allowed us to perform testing at a level that would have been completely impractical to do against a hard drive with 120 available IOPS. We even managed to <a href="https://assets.amazon.science/77/5e/4a7c238f4ce890efdc325df83263/using-lightweight-formal-methods-to-validate-a-key-value-storage-node-in-amazon-s3-2.pdf">publish a paper about this work at SOSP</a>.</p><p>From here, we’ve been able to build tools and use existing techniques, like property-based testing, to generate test cases that verify that the behaviour of the implementation matches that of the specification. The really cool bit of this work wasn’t anything to do with either designing ShardStore or using formal verification tricks. It was that we managed to kind of “industrialize” verification, taking really cool, but kind of research-y techniques for program correctness, and get them into code where normal engineers who don’t have PhDs in formal verification can contribute to maintaining the specification, and that we could continue to apply our tools with every single commit to the software. Using verification as a guardrail has given the team confidence to develop faster, and it has endured even as new engineers joined the team.</p><p>Durability reviews and lightweight formal verification are two examples of how we take a really human, and organizational view of scale in S3. The lightweight formal verification tools that we built and integrated are really technical work, <strong>but they were motivated by a desire to let our engineers move faster and be confident even as the system becomes larger and more complex over time.</strong> Durability reviews, similarly, are a way to help the team think about durability in a structured way, but also to make sure that we are always holding ourselves accountable for a high bar for durability as a team. There are many other examples of how we treat the organization as part of the system, and it’s been interesting to see how once you make this shift, you experiment and innovate with how the team builds and operates just as much as you do with what they are building and operating.</p><h2 id="scaling-myself-solving-hard-problems-starts-and-ends-with-ownership">Scaling myself: Solving hard problems starts and ends with “Ownership” <a href="#scaling-myself-solving-hard-problems-starts-and-ends-with-ownership"></a></h2><p>The last example of scale that I’d like to tell you about is an individual one. I joined Amazon as an entrepreneur and a university professor. I’d had tens of grad students and built an engineering team of about 150 people at Coho. In the roles I’d had in the university and in startups, I loved having the opportunity to be technically creative, to build really cool systems and incredible teams, and to always be learning. But I’d never had to do that kind of role at the scale of software, people, or business that I suddenly faced at Amazon.</p><p>One of my favourite parts of being a CS professor was teaching the systems seminar course to graduate students. This was a course where we’d read and generally have pretty lively discussions about a collection of “classic” systems research papers. One of my favourite parts of teaching that course was that about half way through it we’d read the <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html">SOSP Dynamo paper</a>. I looked forward to a lot of the papers that we read in the course, but I really looked forward to the class where we read the Dynamo paper, because it was from a real production system that the students could relate to. It was Amazon, and there was a shopping cart, and that was what Dynamo was for. It’s always fun to talk about research work when people can map it to real things in their own experience.</p><p><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/fast-dynamo-paper-bw.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Dynamo paper" loading="lazy"></p><p>But also, technically, it was fun to discuss Dynamo, because Dynamo was <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html">eventually consistent</a>, so it was possible for your shopping cart to be wrong.</p><p>I loved this, because it was where we’d discuss what you do, practically, in production, when Dynamo was wrong. When a customer was able to place an order only to later realize that the last item had already been sold. You detected the conflict but what could you do? The customer was expecting a delivery.</p><p>This example may have stretched the Dynamo paper’s story a little bit, but it drove to a great punchline. Because the students would often spend a bunch of discussion trying to come up with technical software solutions. Then someone would point out that this wasn’t it at all. That ultimately, these conflicts were rare, and you could resolve them by getting support staff involved and making a human decision. It was a moment where, if it worked well, you could take the class from being critical and engaged in thinking about tradeoffs and design of software systems, and you could get them to realize that the system might be bigger than that. It might be a whole organization, or a business, and maybe some of the same thinking still applied.</p><p>Now that I’ve worked at Amazon for a while, I’ve come to realize that my interpretation wasn’t all that far from the truth — in terms of how the services that we run are hardly “just” the software. I’ve also realized that there’s a bit more to it than what I’d gotten out of the paper when teaching it. Amazon spends a lot of time really focused on the idea of “ownership.” The term comes up in a lot of conversations — like “does this action item have an owner?” — meaning who is the single person that is on the hook to really drive this thing to completion and make it successful.</p><p>The focus on ownership actually helps understand a lot of the organizational structure and engineering approaches that exist within Amazon, and especially in S3. To move fast, to keep a really high bar for quality, teams need to be owners. They need to own the API contracts with other systems their service interacts with, they need to be completely on the hook for durability and performance and availability, and ultimately, they need to step in and fix stuff at three in the morning when an unexpected bug hurts availability. But they also need to be empowered to reflect on that bug fix and improve the system so that it doesn’t happen again. Ownership carries a lot of responsibility, but it also carries a lot of trust – because to let an individual or a team own a service, you have to give them the leeway to make their own decisions about how they are going to deliver it. It’s been a great lesson for me to realize how much allowing individuals and teams to directly own software, and more generally own a portion of the business, allows them to be passionate about what they do and really push on it. It’s also remarkable how much getting ownership wrong can have the opposite result.</p><h2 id="encouraging-ownership-in-others">Encouraging ownership in others <a href="#encouraging-ownership-in-others"></a></h2><p>I’ve spent a lot of time at Amazon thinking about how important and effective the focus on ownership is to the business, but also about how effective an individual tool it is when I work with engineers and teams. I realized that the idea of recognizing and encouraging ownership had actually been a really effective tool for me in other roles. Here’s an example: In my early days as a professor at UBC, I was working with my first set of graduate students and trying to figure out how to choose great research problems for my lab. I vividly remember a conversation I had with a colleague that was also a pretty new professor at another school. When I asked them how they choose research problems with their students, they flipped. They had a surprisingly frustrated reaction. “I can’t figure this out at all. I have like 5 projects I want students to do. I’ve written them up. They hum and haw and pick one up but it never works out. I could do the projects faster myself than I can teach them to do it.”</p><p>And ultimately, that’s actually what this person did — they were amazing, they did a bunch of really cool stuff, and wrote some great papers, and then went and joined a company and did even more cool stuff. But when I talked to grad students that worked with them what I heard was, “I just couldn’t get invested in that thing. It wasn’t my idea.”</p><p>As a professor, that was a pivotal moment for me. From that point forward, when I worked with students, I tried really hard to ask questions, and listen, and be excited and enthusiastic. But ultimately, my most successful research projects were never mine. They were my students and I was lucky to be involved. The thing that I don’t think I really internalized until much later, working with teams at Amazon, was that one big contribution to those projects being successful was that the students really did own them. Once students really felt like they were working on their own ideas, and that they could personally evolve it and drive it to a new result or insight, it was never difficult to get them to really invest in the work and the thinking to develop and deliver it. They just had to own it.</p><p>And this is probably one area of my role at Amazon that I’ve thought about and tried to develop and be more intentional about than anything else I do. As a really senior engineer in the company, of course I have strong opinions and I absolutely have a technical agenda. But If I interact with engineers by just trying to dispense ideas, it’s really hard for any of us to be successful. It’s a lot harder to get invested in an idea that you don’t own. So, when I work with teams, I’ve kind of taken the strategy that my best ideas are the ones that other people have instead of me. I consciously spend a lot more time trying to develop problems, and to do a really good job of articulating them, rather than trying to pitch solutions. <strong>There are often multiple ways to solve a problem, and picking the right one is letting someone own the solution.</strong> And I spend a lot of time being enthusiastic about how those solutions are developing (which is pretty easy) and encouraging folks to figure out how to have urgency and go faster (which is often a little more complex). But it has, very sincerely, been one of the most rewarding parts of my role at Amazon to approach scaling myself as an engineer being measured by making other engineers and teams successful, helping them own problems, and celebrating the wins that they achieve.</p><h2 id="closing-thought">Closing thought <a href="#closing-thought"></a></h2><p>I came to Amazon expecting to work on a really big and complex piece of storage software. What I learned was that every aspect of my role was unbelievably bigger than that expectation. I’ve learned that the technical scale of the system is so enormous, that its workload, structure, and operations are not just bigger, but foundationally different from the smaller systems that I’d worked on in the past. I learned that it wasn’t enough to think about the software, that “the system” was also the software’s operation as a service, the organization that ran it, and the customer code that worked with it. I learned that the organization itself, as part of the system, had its own scaling challenges and provided just as many problems to solve and opportunities to innovate. And finally, I learned that to really be successful in my own role, I needed to focus on articulating the problems and not the solutions, and to find ways to support strong engineering teams in really owning those solutions.</p><p>I’m hardly done figuring any of this stuff out, but I sure feel like I’ve learned a bunch so far. Thanks for taking the time to listen.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sc3J4McebHE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="related-posts-and-papers">Related posts (and papers) <a href="#related-posts-and-papers"></a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=big+storage+system">Amazon’s Dynamo</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=big+storage+system">Eventually consistent - revisited</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.science/publications/using-lightweight-formal-methods-to-validate-a-key-value-storage-node-in-amazon-s3?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=big+storage+system">Using lightweight formal methods to validate key-value storage node in Amazon S3</a></li></ul></span></section><hr></div></div>]]></description>

              <p>In a paper posted on arXiv on 2023-07-23, three researchers from the Quantum Energy Research Centre, Inc. and KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, report the production and test of a lead-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite">apatite</a> material which they claim exhibits all of the phenomena of superconductivity at room temperatures and above (they state its critical temperature, below which it is a superconductor, as 400 K, or 127° C) and ambient atmospheric pressure at sea level.  Here is the paper.</p>


<p>Full text, in PDF form, is available at the link.  The abstract is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the room-temperature superconductor (<span>T_c\geq 400 {\rm K}</span>, 127∘ C) working at ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature (<span>T_c</span>), Zero-resistivity, Critical current (<span>I_c</span>), Critical magnetic field (<span>H_c</span>), and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by <span>{\rm Cu}^{2+}</span> substitution of <span>{\rm Pb2}^{+}</span>(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate and it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface, which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.</p>

<p>This silent video from the Quantum Energy Research Centre, institution of two of the co-authors, purports to show repulsion of a copper disc with a thermally deposited coating of the LK-99 material from a permanent magnet, as would be expected to occur from a superconductor manifesting the Meissner effect.</p>

<p>Another video, which cannot be embedded here, claims to show levitation of a sample of LK-99 above a permanent magnet: “<a href="https://sciencecast.org/casts/suc384jly50n">Superconductor <span>{\rm Pb}_{10−x}{\rm ​Cu}_x​({\rm PO}_4​)_{6 O}​</span> showing levitation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and mechanism</a>”.  Note that the corner of the material never actually rises above the magnet.</p>
<p>In both of these magnetic repulsion videos, keep in mind that magnetic repulsion and/or levitation are not, by themselves, probative of superconductivity: a diamagnetic material such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolytic_carbon#Magnetic_levitation">pyrolytic graphite</a>, <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2013-03/001428.html">can be made to levitate</a> in a magnetic field without being superconductive.</p>

<p>Unlike earlier claims, which were based upon material under extreme pressure in a diamond anvil cell, this paper claims superconductivity under ordinary laboratory conditions, and rather than exotic materials such as lutetium hydride compounds, uses a phosphate of lead doped with copper, which a competent chemist should be able to whip up and test for themselves, which I presume is going on as I write in laboratories around the world.</p>
<p>There’s no need among this audience to explain the technological consequences of discovery of room temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity.  If the effect is genuine, and materials can be engineered which retain their superconductivity under the high magnetic fields of power transmissions (which has been a limitation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuprate_superconductor">cuprate superconductors</a> that operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures), this may spark a revolution in electronics as significant as the invention of the transistor, vacuum tube, and induction motor.</p>

<p>It's often stated that this is because the DHCP server uses raw sockets.  I think this phrasing is quite confusing.  Some official ISC docs for their DHCP server use "raw sockets" as a broad term, because it can run on a number of different platforms where it must use a number of different interfaces.  On Linux, there is more than one type that you might hear referred to as raw sockets.  <em>Some are affected by Linux iptables, and some are not affected by Linux iptables</em>.</p>

<p>I'm confident that Linux' TCP/IP stack imposes some restrictions when sending packets with PF_INET+SOCK_RAW.  My vague memory was that DHCP on Linux does not necessarily work with that type of socket, and might need to use "packet sockets" instead.  Packet sockets work at a lower level.  I'm confident that packet sockets are not affected by iptables.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PF_PACKET sockets bypass the TCP/IP stack.</p>
  
  <p>PF_INET/SOCK_RAW sockets still travers the TCP/IP stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote was written in the context of receiving packets. There is also evidence that this applies to sending packets, as you might expect.</p>

<hr>

<p>It seems that iptables is one of the restrictions that applies to the TCP/IP stack, including to sending with PF_INET+SOCK_RAW.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If I have a an IP datagram in userspace and I send it via a raw socket
    created with socket(PF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW) using the send()
    system call, will this packet traverse the netfilter chains?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>looks like good news:</p>

<pre><code>ipt_hook: happy cracking.
ipt_hook: happy cracking.
ipt_hook: happy cracking.
ipt_tcpmss_target: bad length (10 bytes)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>So your packets will traverse iptables.</p>

<p>And the evidence for the receive direction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out that using raw sockets
  gives me the packets post-NAT so the IP addresses are back in the
  private range (10.x.x.x in my example). Maybe this is common knowledge
  but I've struggled to find it documented. If I use libpcap/tcpdump I
  get packets pre-NAT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[NAT is performed by iptables]</p>

<hr>

<p>Bonus griping: I <em>think</em> the term "packet filter" in my initial quote is a straight out abuse, albeit a long-standing one.  Berkeley Packet Filter is a mechanism used to install a filter on a raw socket, e.g. so that it only receives packets on the DHCP port.  I think ISC at times refer to "Linux Packet Filter" as if it was a type of raw socket itself.  It's not, and you can actually use BPF on normal UDP or TCP sockets.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Usually, SQLite allows at most one writer to proceed concurrently. The
BEGIN CONCURRENT enhancement allows multiple writers to process write
transactions simultanously if the database is in "wal" or "wal2" mode,
although the system still serializes COMMIT commands.</p>

<p>When a write-transaction is opened with "BEGIN CONCURRENT", actually 
locking the database is deferred until a COMMIT is executed. This means
that any number of transactions started with BEGIN CONCURRENT may proceed
concurrently. The system uses optimistic page-level-locking to prevent
conflicting concurrent transactions from being committed.</p>

<p>When a BEGIN CONCURRENT transaction is committed, the system checks whether 
or not any of the database pages that the transaction has read have been
modified since the BEGIN CONCURRENT was opened. In other words - it asks 
if the transaction being committed operates on a different set of data than
all other concurrently executing transactions. If the answer is "yes, this
transaction did not read or modify any data modified by any concurrent
transaction", then the transaction is committed as normal. Otherwise, if the
transaction does conflict, it cannot be committed and an SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT
error is returned. At this point, all the client can do is ROLLBACK the
transaction.</p>

<p>If SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT is returned, messages are output via the sqlite3_log
mechanism indicating the page and table or index on which the conflict
occurred. This can be useful when optimizing concurrency.</p>

<h2>Application Programming Notes</h2>
<p>In order to serialize COMMIT processing, SQLite takes a lock on the database
as part of each COMMIT command and releases it before returning. At most one
writer may hold this lock at any one time. If a writer cannot obtain the lock,
it uses SQLite's busy-handler to pause and retry for a while:</p>

<p>  <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_handler.html">
      https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_handler.html
  </a></p>

<p>If there is significant contention for the writer lock, this mechanism can be
inefficient. In this case it is better for the application to use a mutex or
some other mechanism that supports blocking to ensure that at most one writer
is attempting to COMMIT a BEGIN CONCURRENT transaction at a time. This is
usually easier if all writers are part of the same operating system process.</p>

<p>If all database clients (readers and writers) are located in the same OS
process, and if that OS is a Unix variant, then it can be more efficient to
the built-in VFS "unix-excl" instead of the default "unix". This is because it
uses more efficient locking primitives.</p>

<p>The key to maximizing concurrency using BEGIN CONCURRENT is to ensure that
there are a large number of non-conflicting transactions. In SQLite, each
table and each index is stored as a separate b-tree, each of which is
distributed over a discrete set of database pages. This means that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two transactions that write to different sets of tables never 
conflict, and that</p></li>
<li><p>Two transactions that write to the same tables or indexes only 
conflict if the values of the keys (either primary keys or indexed 
rows) are fairly close together. For example, given a large 
table with the schema:</p>

<pre>     CREATE TABLE t1(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, b BLOB);</pre>

<p>writing two rows with adjacent values for "a" probably will cause a
conflict (as the two keys are stored on the same page), but writing two
rows with vastly different values for "a" will not (as the keys will likly
be stored on different pages).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, in SQLite, if values are not explicitly supplied for an INTEGER
PRIMARY KEY, as for example in:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> INSERT INTO t1(b) VALUES(&lt;blob-value&gt;);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>then monotonically increasing values are assigned automatically. This is
terrible for concurrency, as it all but ensures that all new rows are 
added to the same database page. In such situations, it is better to
explicitly assign random values to INTEGER PRIMARY KEY fields.</p>

<p>This problem also comes up for non-WITHOUT ROWID tables that do not have an
explicit INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column. In these cases each table has an implicit
INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column that is assigned increasing values, leading to the
same problem as omitting to assign a value to an explicit INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
column.</p>

<p>For both explicit and implicit INTEGER PRIMARY KEYs, it is possible to have
SQLite assign values at random (instead of the monotonically increasing
values) by writing a row with a rowid equal to the largest possible signed
64-bit integer to the table. For example:</p>

<pre><code> INSERT INTO t1(a) VALUES(9223372036854775807);
</code></pre>

<p>Applications should take care not to malfunction due to the presence of such
rows.</p>

<p>The nature of some types of indexes, for example indexes on timestamp fields,
can also cause problems (as concurrent transactions may assign similar
timestamps that will be stored on the same db page to new records). In these
cases the database schema may need to be rethought to increase the concurrency
provided by page-level-locking.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal, according to one of the developers working on the controversial fraud fighting project, aims to make the web "more private and safe."</p>
<p>Ben Wiser, a software engineer at the Chocolate Factory, responded on Wednesday to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/25/google_web_environment_integrity">serious concerns</a> about the proposal by insisting that WEI aims to address online fraud and abuse without the privacy harms enabled by browser fingerprinting and cross-site tracking.</p>
<p>"The WEI experiment is part of a larger goal to keep the web safe and open while discouraging cross-site tracking and lessening the reliance on fingerprinting for combating fraud and abuse," he explained in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues/28#issuecomment-1651129388">GitHub Issues post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The WEI experiment is part of a larger goal to keep the web safe and open</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Fraud detection and mitigation techniques often rely heavily on analyzing unique client behavior over time for anomalies, which involves large collection of client data from both human users and suspected automated clients."</p>
<p>WEI is an attestation scheme. It provides a way for a web publisher to add code to a website or app that checks with a trusted third party, like Google, to see whether a visitor's software and hardware stack meets certain criteria to be deemed authentic.</p>

    

<p>Technically speaking, attestation is just a matter of transmitting <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949">a token</a> with a value – derived from as-yet-undisclosed hardware and software characteristics – that indicates whether or not the client is trustworthy. It's then up to the website publisher to decide how to respond to that signal.</p>

        


        

<p>In theory, if effectively implemented, WEI could allow a web game publisher to check whether game players are cheating through the use of unsanctioned hardware or software. Or it might be used by a content publisher to check whether ads are being displayed to real visitors or fraudulent bots.</p>
<p>The worry is that WEI could potentially be used to disallow ad blocking, to block certain browsers, to limit web scraping (still largely legal, though often disallowed under websites' terms-of-service), to exclude software for downloading YouTube videos or other content, and impose other limitations on otherwise lawful web activities.</p>

        

<p>What WEI's attestation check actually looks for has not been revealed. Nor is it evident from the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/6f47a22906b2899412e79a2727355efa9cc8f5bd">WEI code</a> that has been added to the Chromium open source project. But Wisner insists, "WEI is not designed to single out browsers or extensions" and is not designed to block browsers that spoof their identity.</p>
<p>However, the intended use of a technology isn't necessarily a limitation on it being employed in tricky new ways.</p>
<h3>Sounding the alarm</h3>
<p>Those in the technical community who have expressed alarm about the proposal argue that the web should not be brought under a permission-based regime, where a third party renders judgment on the worthiness of users – without consultation, based on opaque criteria.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The idea of it is as simple as it is dangerous. It would provide websites with an API telling them whether the browser and the platform it is running on that is currently in use is trusted by an authoritative third party (called an attester)," wrote Julien Picalausa, a software developer at browser maker Vivaldi, in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/googles-new-dangerous-web-environment-integrity-spec/">a post</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The details are nebulous, but the goal seems to be to prevent 'fake' interactions with websites of all kinds. While this seems like a noble motivation, and the use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible and has already been equated with DRM for websites, with all that it implies."</p>
<p>Dangerous though the idea may be, attestation has already been implemented on native platforms (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity">Android</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_server">iOS</a>) – some would say autocratic regimes compared to the relatively open web.</p>

</ul>
<p>But attestation has even made it to the web. Tim Perry, creator of dev tool HTTP Toolkit, noted in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/apple-private-access-tokens-attestation/">blog post</a> on Tuesday that Apple offers <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=huqjyh7k">Private Access Tokens</a> for its Safari browser. Network security firm Cloudflare uses Private Access Tokens as a way to avoid showing people CAPTCHA puzzles to prove that they're not robots.</p>
<p>Perry argues that Apple's scheme is less of a concern because Safari's market share (~20 percent of mobile and desktop browsers) is far less than Chrome/Chromium (~70 percent of web clients). Nonetheless, he opposes attestation for being fundamentally anti-competitive.</p>

        

<p>"Fraud and bots on the web are a real problem, and discussion on ways to defend against that is totally reasonable, and often very valuable!" Perry declared.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Removing all user control over their own devices is not a reasonable tradeoff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"It's a hard problem. That said, this has to be carefully balanced against the health of the web itself. Blocking competition, hamstringing open source and the open web, and removing all user control over their own devices is not a reasonable tradeoff."</p>
<p>Google considers Apple Private Access Tokens to be too private. The WEI proposal says, "due to the fully masked tokens, this technology assumes that the attester can produce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from websites about gaps such as false positives or false negatives."</p>
<p>Apple's Private Access Tokens <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/">do not involve the exchange of device data</a> between the device maker (Apple, as an attester) and Cloudflare. Google argues that masking token data in this manner denies feedback from websites involved in the attestation process that may be able to use withheld device data to minimize incorrect trust verdicts.</p>
<p>In fact, Wiser suggests privacy improvements are what prompted WEI. "Privacy features like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/">user-agent reduction</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ip-protection">IP reduction</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/storage-partitioning/">preventing cross-site storage</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/3-fingerprint-randomization/">fingerprint randomization</a> make it more difficult to distinguish or reidentify individual clients, which is great for privacy, but makes fighting fraud more difficult," he claimed.</p>
<p>The result of this, he argues, is that websites – determined to fight fraud – have responded by increasing their usage of sign-in gates, invasive fingerprinting techniques, and intrusive challenges like CAPTCHAs and SMS verification. Wiser argues these defenses make the web experience worse.</p>
<p>"We believe this is a tough problem to solve, but a very important one that we will continue to work on. We will continue to design, discuss, and debate in public," he said.</p>
<h3>A fundamental flaw</h3>
<p>Jon von Tetzchner, CEO of Vivaldi, told <em>The Register</em> in an interview that while Google has yet to specify exactly what WEI will be measuring to render trust verdicts, the details don't really matter – the entire approach is flawed.</p>
<p>"A big part of the reason why there is a problem is the surveillance economy," he explained, "and the solution to the surveillance economy seems to be more surveillance."</p>
<p>Von Tetzchner said that Google wants to know who is seeing its ads when it should, in his opinion, focus on where its ads get shown – often on web spam pages to be viewed by bots involved in ad fraud.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The solution is to get away from the surveillance economy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He recalled when he was involved with the Opera browser and had to deal with Google Docs not working on the browser. "When we started with Vivaldi, my thinking was okay, we are using Chromium, this is not going to be a problem," he said.</p>
<p>But compatibility issues remained, he said, and Vivaldi had to hide its identity (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://vivaldi.com/press/releases/vivaldi-2-10-no-strings-attached/">spoof its default User-Agent string</a>) to enable users to access popular Google services. And he's concerned WEI represents more of the same.</p>
<p>Von Tetzchner argues that attestation is not the proper response to online fraud.</p>
<p>"I just don't think this is a solution," he said. "The solution is to get away from the surveillance economy. We've been trying to ban the surveillance economy and ban the collection of data and making profiles on end users and utilizing it for advertisements. I really don't really see any reason why that should be legal in society.</p>
<p>"The surveillance economy is highly toxic," he added. "It has created significant issues for society. And I think that the obvious thing should be to stop using the technology. It doesn't make any sense to use it and there are other ways to do advertising that work just as well. But there is a lot of money for certain companies and they don't want to give up what they have." ®</p>

<p>How cool is this! Popularized in England, these wavy walls actually use less bricks than a straight wall because they can be made just one brick thin, while a straight wall—without buttresses—would easily topple over. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">Wikipedia</a>, these wavy walls are also known as: crinkle crankle walls, crinkum crankum walls, serpentine walls, or ribbon walls. The alternate convex and concave curves in the wall provide stability and help it to resist lateral forces. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">source</a>]</p>
<p>The county of Suffolk seems to be home to countless examples of these crinkle crankle walls. On <a href="http://www.freston.net/blog/index.php?y=2016&amp;m=01&amp;d=04">freston.net</a> you can find 100 wavy walls that have been documented and photographed. In the United States, the best known serpentine wall can be found at the University of Virginia where Thomas Jefferson incorporated the wavy walls into the architecture. Although some authorities claim that Jefferson invented this design, he was merely adapting a well-established English style of construction. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">source</a>]</p>
<p>As for the mathematics behind these serpentine walls and why the waves make them more resistant to horizontal forces like wind vs straight walls, check out this post by <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/11/19/crinkle-crankle-calculus/">John D. Cook</a>.</p>
<p>Below you will find additional examples of these intriguing wavy walls that lawnmowers surely detest! </p>

This is why we are investigating whether Microsoft’s tying of its productivity suites with Teams may be in breach of EU competition rules.”</p><p>Microsoft has responded to the EU’s complaint. “We respect the European Commission’s work on this case and take our own responsibilities very seriously,” says Microsoft spokesperson Robin Koch, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “We will continue to cooperate with the Commission and remain committed to finding solutions that will address its concerns.”</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Microsoft Teams stock" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/376x251/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/384x256/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/415x277/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/480x320/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/540x360/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/640x427/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/750x500/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/828x552/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1080x720/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1200x800/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1440x960/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1920x1280/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2048x1365/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2400x1600/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2400x1600/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>Microsoft has previously bundled Teams with its Office subscriptions.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office">Slack’s original complaint</a> alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.” Now EU regulators are fully investigating the situation, after Microsoft reportedly offered a concession to the EU to stop bundling Teams with Office. This clearly wasn’t enough to avoid an official antitrust investigation — the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/014172b7-d125-442a-addd-85b7a71d34b1"><em>Financial Times </em>reported</a> recently that EU regulators and Microsoft couldn’t agree on whether the removal of bundling would be limited to just the EU and how prices might be impacted to ensure competition is still fair.</p><p>Microsoft also recently decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23761859/microsoft-windows-11-teams-chat-integration-deprecation">remove its Microsoft Teams integration in Windows 11</a>. The Chat functionality in Windows 11 was only ever available for consumers and not the key enterprise users that were the focus of Slack’s complaint. But Microsoft could have enabled enterprise support in the future in this built-in version, and it’s possible the EU probe might have spooked Microsoft into killing the integration altogether. </p><p>This is the first time Microsoft has faced an antitrust investigation in the EU for nearly 15 years, following two big cases related to Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer bundling.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="paragraph-0">AUSTIN, Texas</p>
<p id="paragraph-1">In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.</p>
<p id="paragraph-2">He soon realized he was sometimes&nbsp;getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.</p>
<p id="paragraph-3">“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.</p>
<p id="paragraph-4">Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-5">What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.</p>
<p id="paragraph-6">The Austin, Texas-based&nbsp;electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-8">Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.</p>
<p id="paragraph-9">Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.</p>
<p id="paragraph-10">In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.</p>
<p id="paragraph-11">Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.</p>

    <figure id="video-title" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-13">Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.</p>
<p id="paragraph-14">Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-15">The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-16">“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-17">Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.</p>
<p id="paragraph-18">Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-20">At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.</p>
<p id="paragraph-21">Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel&nbsp;before their batteries run out.</p>
<p id="paragraph-22"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/south-korea-fines-tesla-22-mln-exaggerating-driving-range-evs-2023-01-03/" id="article-link-0">Tesla was fined</a> earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models&nbsp;averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.</p>
<p id="paragraph-23">The U.S. Environmental&nbsp;Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.</p>
<p id="paragraph-24">Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their&nbsp;estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.</p>
<p id="paragraph-25">Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures.&nbsp;Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.</p>
<p id="paragraph-26">Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.</p>
<p id="paragraph-27">Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/range" id="article-link-1">“Range Tips”</a> section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.</p>
<p id="paragraph-28">Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-29">Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters – &nbsp;including&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.</p>
<p id="paragraph-30">Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-32">Failed tests and false advertising</p>
<p id="paragraph-33">Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.</p>
<p id="paragraph-34">One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a <a href="https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2023-01-0349/" id="article-link-2">study</a> of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.</p>
<p id="paragraph-35">The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.</p>
<p id="paragraph-36">The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-37">Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.</p>

    <blockquote id="JEUJMAJ611_4">
        <p>“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-39">EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers&nbsp;can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.</p>
<p id="paragraph-40">Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-41">Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it&nbsp;believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.</p>
<p id="paragraph-42">Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-44">Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.</p>
<p id="paragraph-45">EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-46">The&nbsp;EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers.&nbsp;“That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market &nbsp;and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-47">The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.</p>
<p id="paragraph-48">Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-49">“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-50">Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone&nbsp;after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.</p>
<p id="paragraph-51">All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.</p>
<p id="paragraph-52">Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.</p>
<p id="paragraph-53">Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/testing-teslas-range-anxiety.html" id="article-link-3">reported in March 2021</a>. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.</p>
<p id="paragraph-54">Edmunds has <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/electric-car-range-and-consumption-epa-vs-edmunds.html" id="article-link-4">continued to test electric vehicles</a>, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-55">“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-56">South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that&nbsp;showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.</p>
<p id="paragraph-57">The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.</p>
<p id="paragraph-58">Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-60">Creating a diversion</p>
<p id="paragraph-61">By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.</p>
<p id="paragraph-62">As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-63">Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.</p>
<p id="paragraph-64">Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”</p> 
<p id="paragraph-71">Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the&nbsp;Las Vegas “Diversion Team”&nbsp;to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p id="paragraph-72">The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had&nbsp;purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-73">Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.</p>
<p id="paragraph-74">If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving&nbsp;range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.</p>
<p id="paragraph-75">Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-77">The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-78">The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.</p>
<p id="paragraph-79">In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-80">“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-81">Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.</p>
<p id="paragraph-82">Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.</p>

<p id="paragraph-87">On the road</p>
<p id="paragraph-88">By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.</p>
<p id="paragraph-89">Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two&nbsp;weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.</p>
<p id="paragraph-90">Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-91">“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.</p>
<p id="paragraph-92">“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”</p>
<p id="paragraph-93">The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.</p>
<p id="paragraph-94">Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-95">After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.</p>
<p id="paragraph-96">“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”</p>

<p>Over the past six years, we’ve seen Transformers take the world by storm. Transformers have been the workhorse architecture behind modern foundation models and have seen impressive empirical success across diverse applications – from pretrained language models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416">Flan-T5</a>, to image models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643">SAM</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752">stable diffusion</a>. We think Transformers are great (and have had lots of fun <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">optimizing</a> <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/07/17/flash2.html">them</a>), but we’ve also been thinking about a deeper <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-23-ai-everywhere">question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Are Transformers the only way to get this amazing performance?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the first reason we’ve been poking around at this is because it’s really interesting! Diving into the inner workings of the architectures could help us understand what makes our current generation of models really tick and learn how to train or use them better. And we’ve been really excited by a lot of the work looking into new architectures, from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a> to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">BiGS</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10655">Mega</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12951">Liquid</a>, and more. It’s great to live in a world where there are so many great ideas!</p>
<p>But we’re also interested in this question for some core efficiency reasons. Ideally, an alternative to Transformers would scale more efficiently while still matching in quality. One strong motivation for us has been scaling in sequence length – hence the line of work in our lab looking into replacing attention with a sub-quadratic operator (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794">HyenaDNA</a>). And we’re encouraged by the groundswell of work into new architectures for long sequences, from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621">RetNet</a> to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048">RWKV</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595">positional interpolation</a> – just to name a few!</p>
<p>MLPs – the other core building block of Transformers – also introduce an efficiency bottleneck, which becomes more acute as we continue to optimize attention. MLPs are quadratic in the model width, which means they grow more expensive as you make models wider. This is why models like GPT-3 are so expensive, and why GPT-4 has allegedly started using techniques like mixtures of experts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What if there were a model that were sub-quadratic along both sequence length and model dimension, and could match Transformers in quality?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we’re excited to present a little teaser of some work in this direction – Monarch Mixer BERT (M2-BERT). M2-BERT is sub-quadratic in sequence length and model dimension, has 25% fewer parameters/FLOPs than BERT, and matches in quality (potentially exceeding a little bit when parameter-matched). We’re still very early days, so come talk to us if you find these questions exciting! And if you’re reading this the week of release, we’ll be at ICML – come find us in Hawaii, we’ll be putting up a poster at the <a href="https://es-fomo.com/">ES-FoMo</a> workshop!</p>
<p>This blog post highlights a small portion of the Monarch Mixer line of work. Full arXiv coming soon, and this would not have been possible without the <a href="#ack">full team</a>!</p>
<h2>Monarch Mixer</h2>
<p>Our basic idea is to replace the major elements of a Transformer with Monarch matrices — which are a class of structured matrices that generalize the FFT and are sub-quadratic, hardware-efficient, and expressive. A key property of Monarch matrices is that they can be computed using a series of <em>block-diagonal</em> matrices, interleaved with permutations:</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2023-07-25-m2-bert/m2-diagram.png"></figure>
<p>In Monarch Mixer (M2), we use layers built up from Monarch matrices to do both mixing across the sequence (what attention does in Transformers) and mixing across the model dimension (what the MLP does in Transformers). This is similar in spirit to great work like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601">MLP Mixer</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09792">ConvMixer</a>, which similarly replaced everything with a single primitive for vision tasks (but went for quadratic primitives).</p>
<p>Why go for a fully sub-quadratic architecture now? We’re continuing off a recent line of work in our lab (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">and</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13947">elsewhere</a>) that replaces attention with long convolutions – which is implemented efficiently with the FFT. Critically, Monarch matrices can implement the FFT – which gives us hope that a fully Monarch-based architecture can get there.</p>
<h2>Revisiting BERT with Monarch Mixer</h2>
<p>As a first proof-of-concept of our ideas, we’re going to roll the clock back to 2018, and look at one of the first big applications of pretrained Transformers – language modeling with BERT! Despite its (relative) age, BERT is still a workhorse model for applications such as text classification, retrieval, search, and more (see <a href="https://sayanchak.medium.com/practical-uses-of-bert-c384ae3a5c2a">this</a> great summary – and this great <a href="https://twitter.com/marktenenholtz/status/1682436003158433816">tweet</a> on why we love BERT).</p>
<p>For our model, we’ll replace the attention block with a layer inspired by previous work in attention-free models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>), and replace the fully-connected layers in the MLP with some simple block-diagonal matrices. All of these operations can be implemented with Monarchs, and the rest is standard stuff like element-wise multiplication, and simple pointwise operators.</p>
<p>Our sequence mixer block builds off H3 and Hyena. Our <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-01-20-h3">previous</a> <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-07-hyena">blogs</a> give some intuition about what the architecture is doing – in brief, the short convolutions allow the model to do a quick lookup of nearby tokens, while the long convolutions allow global information to pass over the sequence.</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2023-07-25-m2-bert/m2-arch.png"></figure>
<p>The deltas between our sequence mixer the original H3/Hyena layer are a bit interesting, so we’ll go over them briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FFT -&gt; Monarch:</strong> in H3 and Hyena, the long convs are computed using the FFT, e.g. <code>iFFT(FFT(x) * FFT(k))</code>. In M2-BERT, we compute these FFTs with Monarchs!</li>
<li><strong>Causal vs. bidirectional:</strong> in H3 and Hyena, the long convs are <em>causal</em> (for the autoregressive language modeling loss). This is done by padding the inputs of the FFTs with zeros, since the FFT implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem">circular</a> convolution. In M2-BERT, we make the convolutions <em>non-causal</em> by making the convolution kernel twice the length of the input, which makes the weights wrap around.</li>
<li><strong>Convolution kernel:</strong> For the actual kernels <code>k</code>, we use a CKConv parameterization with an exponential, similar to Hyena! In our bidirectional setup, this makes the convolution kernels focus on nearby tokens in the input.</li>
<li><strong>Extra convolution connection:</strong> for BERT, we found that adding an extra convolution (a “residual” so to speak) improved performance on synthetic tasks and pretraining loss.</li>
<li><strong>Average pooling in fine-tuning:</strong> Transformer-based BERT models are traditionally fine-tuned using the embedding of the CLS token. We find that taking the average pool of the embeddings in the input can work a bit better for M2-BERT on downstream tasks that require comparing information spread across multiple sentences such as GLUE NLI tasks (one intuition is that the convolutions spread the information across more tokens).</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, the dimension mixer looks a lot like a normal MLP with GLU, but replaces the fully-connected layers with block-diagonal layers – which drastically reduces the parameters and makes the model more efficient!</p>
<p>So then the natural questions are – given the drastic parameter reduction, how does quality compare to a standard BERT model, and how much faster is it?</p>
<h2>Quality on GLUE</h2>
<p>So our first evaluation was pretraining some M2-BERT models and comparing their downstream GLUE scores after fine-tuning.</p>
<p>When we take our M2-BERT models with the same model width and depth as a standard BERT model, we get some pretty decent parameter savings – M2-BERT-base with 12 layers and model with 768 has 80M parameters, compared to a standard BERT-base of 110M parameters. We pretrained M2-BERT-base (80M) on 36.5B tokens of C4, at sequence length 128, as well as an M2-BERT parameter-matched to BERT-base.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we can get pretty decent results, even with fewer parameters – M2-BERT-base (80M) matching the original BERT-base scores from Devlin 2018 BERT, and the parameter-matched M2-BERT-base sees further lift (see the end of the blog post for full numbers):</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Model</strong></th><th>Average GLUE Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BERT-base (110M)</td><td>79.6</td></tr><tr><td>Crammed BERT-base (110M)</td><td>79.1</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (80M)</td><td>79.9</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (110M)</td><td><strong>80.9</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>There’s still a lot we don’t know about these models, so quality could get even better. We mostly took standard Transformer BERT-base hyperparameters, besides some basic hyperparameter sweeps on fine-tuning. The Transformer hyperparameters have been optimized by the community in tons of ways over the past five years, so there’s a lot still to learn about what the best hyperparameters and training formulae are for M2 (e.g., we observed up to half-point swings in average GLUE score during our sweeps). And there’s been great work in the community about exactly how much gating you need for different tasks (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">BiGS, section 7.2</a>, so lots more to explore here).</p>
<h2>Long Sequence Preview</h2>
<p>So what does this new architecture buy us? One possibility is speed, and scaling to longer sequences. Since M2 is sub-quadratic in model dimension, we see a FLOP reduction (which is reflected in the lower parameter count). But the sequence mixer is also sub-quadratic in sequence length, which means the potential to scale to longer sequences.</p>
<p>We’ll be exploring long-sequence M2-BERT models more in-depth in the coming weeks, but for now here’s a simple preview of throughput at different sequence lengths, compared to the HuggingFace BERT-base and a more optimized FlashAttention BERT-base, for various sequence lengths. Here, we’re looking at throughput in terms of tokens/ms, on a single A100.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>512</th><th>1024</th><th>2048</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HF BERT-base (110M)</td><td>206.5</td><td>130.8</td><td>71.3</td></tr><tr><td>FlashAttention BERT-base (110M)</td><td>380.7</td><td>359.7</td><td>265.3</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (80M)</td><td><strong>386.3</strong></td><td><strong>380.7</strong></td><td><strong>378.9</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Today we’re releasing two initial M2-BERT checkpoints pretrained on short sequences, but M2-BERT has the potential to scale to much longer sequences. We’ve started using these scaling properties to experiment with data recipes for long-sequence M2-BERT’s – stay tuned!</p>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are releasing code for BERT and checkpoints for 80M and 110M models today, pretrained using a standard recipe at sequence length 128 – stay tuned for longer sequences! Check out our <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/m2">code</a> and checkpoints (<a href="https://huggingface.co/danfu09/m2-bert-80M">80M</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/danfu09/m2-bert-110M">110M</a>).</li>
<li>In the coming weeks, watch out for further releases, as we train up long-sequence BERT’s and start tracing the history of Transformers forward – on ImageNet, causal language modeling, T5-style models, as well as explorations of the long sequence capabilities</li>
<li>As part of this release, you’ll find some optimized CUDA code for the forward pass of the M2 layer (which we used for the benchmarks) – we’ll continue to optimize and release updates over the coming weeks. Expect another series of blogs and materials on these soon as we explore the computational tradeoff space!</li>
<li>And of course, full arXiv coming soon!</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I've been <a href="https://jlericson.com/2015/07/21/vacation.html/2015/07/21/vacation.html">on
vacation</a>, so I
haven't been following <a href="https://jlericson.com/tag/strike.html">the Stack Overflow moderator
strike</a>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Not there has been
much progress. Negotiations stalled for <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/390106/moderation-strike-update-data-dumps-choosing-representatives-gpt-data-and-wh/390704#390704">a variety of
reasons</a>. Meanwhile
Stack Overflow's CEO, Prashanth Chandrasekar, dug the company's hole a
bit deeper <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stack-overflow-ceo-teases-generative-ai-tools-addresses-moderator-protest/">during an interview with
VentureBeat</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://jlericson.com/2020/02/04/misunderstanding_meta.html">the last time I analyzed an
interview</a>, I assume the
author accurately represented Prashanth. I'd prefer an unedited
transcript because it allows the reader to interpret in the original
context but we must play the hand we are dealt. I will pull out the
quotes and offer my analysis below.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's definitely a question around how we leverage [generative AI]
technology to deliver on our mission of helping build technology
through collective knowledge. This intersection between the power of
community on one side and AI on the other side—from my
standpoint, human-generated community content has taken us to this
level, we have a large impact, but there are also so many problems
we can solve by leveraging this technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I jump in, please take a moment to read <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/introducing-stackoverflow-com/">Jeff
Atwood's</a>
and <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/">Joel
Spolsky's</a>
introductions of Stack Overflow.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>  Did you
notice what I did? Both describe Stack Overflow as the solution to a
very specific problem: programming knowledge locked up in minds and
forums whence it's difficult to retrieve. They also explain how they
intend to solve the problem including using their combined audience to
form the core of the community of programmers to answer questions. As
someone who was there at the time, it was easy to envision how the project
might solve the problem even if that was an unlikely outcome.</p>
<p>By contrast Prashanth regularly talks about combining community and AI
without going into detail about how that solves the problem at
hand. Neither does he go into much detail about the problems the
company intends to solve. I suspect one reason is that Prashanth, who
has spent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pchandrasekar/details/experience/">most of his career in
management</a>,
has become something of an <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/">architecture
astronaut</a>. As
Joel puts it, "architecture people are solving problems that they
think they can solve, not problems which are <em>useful</em> to solve." Since
there is overlap between a Q&amp;A site and generative artificial
intelligence, there must be a way of jamming them together.</p>
<p>But there's another factor. In May I <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/05/17/so_business.html">wrote about Stack Overflow's
business</a>, which lost $42 million over 6
months and had just laid off 10% of its employees. Since then, <a href="https://prosus-ir.com/results/2023/Prosus-annual-results-2023/pdf/booklet.pdf">the
company's fiscal year-end results came
out</a>. Despite
growing revenue, it lost $84 million over the year ending on March
31, 2023. In fact Prosus' <em>entire education technology segment</em> lost
money despite growing income:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On an economic-interest basis, Edtech segment revenues grew by 28%
(18%) to US$545m and trading losses increased to US$258m. Growth was
affected by decreased demand in the macroeconomic downturn. Our
portfolio companies have reacted quickly to changing market conditions
and are rationalising their cost structures and investments. At the
same time, our businesses are shifting resources to take advantage of
new AI technologies which promise to transform the industry. By
deploying GenAI technologies, our companies can better personalise the
content and user feedback on their platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.prosus.com/~/media/Files/P/Prosus-CORP/latest-financial-results/results-call-transcript.pdf">most recent earnings
call</a>,
Larry Illg, the CEO of the segment and Prashanth's boss, commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Stack specifically, we think that Gen AI is going to be an
important evolution to how developers work and learn in the future,
helping them to be more efficient and also learn new techniques
while they're in the flow of work. We think, and the Stack team
believes the developer community can play a crucial role in how AI
evolves and accelerates, ultimately, with the community being
helpful in ensuring the quality of Gen AI offerings. And Stack
itself sees its role as is bringing the power of its developer
community—and it's important to remember that they have assembled
one of the biggest developer communities in the world—bringing
that community together with the technology power of AI with the
goal of creating highly trusted solutions to technology
problems. And the team is working and launching a variety of AI
solutions and more to come here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it might be that the shift to allow AI answers has more to do with
Stack Overflow's parent company than its CEO. Or maybe Prashanth has
been pushing this as a solution to Stack Overflow's financial
problems. Either way, it appears the company hopes the community will
cooperate by vetting artificially generated content. It doesn't appear
they have put much thought into why the community might want to do
this, though it's important to remember these are comments directed to
investors, not developers.</p>
<p>The call happened on June 27, a month after <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389582/what-is-the-network-policy-regarding-ai-generated-content">the policy allowing AI
content</a>. I
can only speculate, but a reasonable interpretation would be that the
company found it could not solve its financial problems by <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">selling
data</a> and looked for other ways it could
provide something to sell to LLM developers. Given Stack Overflow's
voting system, it's natural to wonder if that data could be fed back
into the models. (And even better if Stack Overflow can be paid for
that data.) But you can't very well do that if machine-generated
content is absolutely disallowed.</p>
<p>Let's pop the stack back to Prashanth's interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to do it responsibly and safely and have the right use case
to solve specific user and customer problems. It's going
to be very, very exciting—I can't wait for the world to know and
for our community to use the things that we're about to announce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is clearly referencing Prashanth's keynote address on July 27
when he's planning on making an announcement. I
<a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">predicted</a> the announcement would be
adding Prosus' LLM technology to Stack Overflow. That wouldn't help
with revenue, but it's the easiest way for Stack Overflow to
demonstrate the potential value of using voting data. In order to
maximize press coverage on the day of the announcement, the company
can only tease without breaking the news early. That's a pretty
terrible communication strategy for a community, however. Unless your
community trusts you without reservation (and Stack Overflow is
nowhere near that blessed state) the teases will only increase
anxiety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're probably talking about 30 million official developers based on
our own data sets, but that number is probably going to at least
triple because there are so many people that are going to come into
the field of writing code because it's so much easier to begin to
write a baseline level of quality of code. And I think
the watermark has just sort of gone up in terms of the expectations
for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stack Overflow has <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#users">21 million
users</a>, so that's not where the
30 million comes from. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+developers+are+in+the+world">quick Google
search</a>
puts the number of developers worldwide at 27 million. Since the world
population stands at <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">8
billion</a>, roughly 3
of every thousand people on Earth are developers. I don't know if that
sounds like a large or a small number to you, but given there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programmers">no
programmers before
1945</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD340.PDF">not many
more added in the
1950s</a>, the
profession has grown at a goodly rate.</p>
<p><img src="https://jlericson.com/images/arrow_tech.jpg" alt="Display of arrowhead technology at Guernsey State Park, Wyoming."></p>
<p>In a blog earlier this year, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/?p=21973">Prashanth compared AI to the
introduction of tractors</a> in that
they made the job easier. I pointed out that <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/388401/new-blog-post-from-our-ceo-prashanth-community-is-the-future-of-ai/389224#389224">tractors reduced the
number of
farmers</a>.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
Tripling the number of programmers would imply a rather dramatic
change to the world economy. What sort of work would they be doing? As
a lapsed programmer, I do find myself reaching for the old tools to
help a colleague from time to time. But I don't envision my co-workers
becoming programmers no matter how easy it becomes. If I weren't
around to ask, they'd reach for other tools or just go without.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you want to definitely be adopting these tools to get more
productive and efficient and learn faster in your role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another way of expressing the well-worn idea: <a href="https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1610984481342771200">"AI will not
replace you. A person using AI
will."</a>
Remember there used to be an occupation called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)">"computer"</a>. The
people who had those jobs (often women) lost them to devices also
called "computers". AI enthusiasts aim for a happy medium where the
technology is disruptive enough to demand attention, but tame enough
that everyone who adopts it will prosper.</p>
<p>Since the invention of writing, there were scribes who specialized in
using (and creating) the tools required to make legible marks. They
were hired to take dictation and copy manuscripts. It was technical
and highly-specialized work. With improvements in technology
(including <a href="https://www.bl.uk/history-of-writing/articles/a-brief-history-of-writing-materials-and-technologies">the printing press and mass-produced metal
nibs</a>)
more people could write for themselves and "scribe" took on a
metaphorical meaning for someone who makes a living cranking out the
written word. Technology dramatically increased the production of
writing at the cost of people making a living doing that work.</p>
<p>After using ChatGPT for a few months to <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/03/29/coding_ai.html">help me write
code</a>, I'm not sure
it will have the same impact as metal nibs had on writing. For common
questions, it's impressive but <a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-miracle-of-chatgpt">blind spots can be easily
found</a>. The
primary advantage of LLMs (their output can be copied and used without
modification) also makes them poor tools for effective learning. They
create <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf">cargo
cults</a> from
their training materials. They sometimes produce useful results if
circumstances are favorable, but provide no help otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision to ban ChatGPT was the “right decision” back in
December, said Chandrasekar. But now, he explained, the company has
slowly been working with the community, doing research and getting
input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the primary spot I wish VentureBeat had provided a
transcript. I think Prashanth has <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/labs/">Stack Overflow
Labs</a> in mind here. If so, the
feedback from the community was largely "please don't do this". It's
hard to see how any of what happened after reversing the ban on
ChatGPT is working <em>with</em> the community. "Against" seems the more
appropriate preposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have gotten feedback on how best to make sure that we will trust
generative AI products, from a Stack Overflow standpoint, and that's
what we're going to announce in about a month's time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fairly vague, but despite the context I suspect the feedback
came from people working with LLMs. It certainly hasn't come from the
community since their elected moderators were told their judgment was
unreliable. In that light "make sure that we will trust generative AI
products" feels a lot more sinister than it first appears. Perhaps
what Prashanth meant was simply "improve the trustworthiness of
generative AI products", which once again signals using Stack Overflow
voting to provide feedback to some model or other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[False negatives are] causing a really negative impact because when
a legitimate human being coming on the website wants to ask a
question, we don't want to shoo them away. We want to share the
question, we want to serve our purpose and mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[The decision to create a new AI policy was] not an easy decision by
any means—but we just thought that the cost of dissuading
people from asking a question on Stack Overflow was too high. And it
was happening very alarmingly high rate based on the analysis that
we looked at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can tell, most suspected machine-generated content comes
in the form of an answer, not a question. Nevertheless, incorrectly
flagged content does have a negative impact on the humans that
produced it. I believe, however, the company is <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/26/problem_ai.html">underestimating the
number of answers copied from ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've taken a public position around this subject, saying that we
always want to be open and free with our data with our developer
community. However, large AI companies building models—we
absolutely want to work with them in a more formal way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this might be the company's public position, <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/391634/the-companys-commitment-to-the-data-dumps-the-api-and-sede/391640#391640">Prashanth
privately wanted to limit who can access the
data</a>. On
March 28, 2023, he ordered the data dump not be uploaded to
Archive.org. The DBA who turned it off warned that the community would
notice and it did. Rather than having an answer prepared, the company
publicly struggled for an answer. <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">Internal
communication</a> shows most of the company
was as surprised as the rest of us.</p>
<p>The harsh reality is that Stack Overflow's CEO hasn't listened to the
people who best understand Stack Overflow. He appears to have a
surface-level grasp of the site, the community and the culture. As a
result, he's made decisions that harm the value of Stack
Overflow. This isn't necessarily malicious, but rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">incompetence
of some sort</a>.</p>
<p>Prashanth has already demonstrated skill in selling Stack
Overflow. That was an impressive feat. But nobody can excel at
everything and he hasn't shown an aptitude for running a
community-centered company. It requires <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/391626/historical-policy-on-the-use-of-gpt-generators/391654#391654">much more than platitudes and
boundless
enthusiasm</a>.</p>
