        <p>When you move in Berlin, you must <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin">register your address</a>. This involves filling a paper form and delivering it in person&nbsp;–&nbsp;by appointment only&nbsp;–&nbsp;to the Bürgeramt. This is called the <em>Anmeldung</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Anmeldung</em> form sucks. It sucked 8 years ago and it sucks now. It’s ambiguous and confusing and I hate it, so I made a better one.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/anmeldung">You can try it here.</a></strong></p>

<p>It’s an actual web form, not a PDF. It works on your phone. It supports autofill, numeric keyboards, field validation, autocomplete, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility tools, etc.</p>
<p>I designed it to <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/think-of-the-form-as-a-conversation">feel more like a conversation</a>, and less like being interrogated by a blunt bureaucrat. The form adapts to your answers and gives helpful instructions. The web is a great medium. We can do more than put a paper sheet on the internet.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung web form" height="1260" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.png" width="1620"></picture>
<p>I added a dedicated step for <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox">“c/o” addresses</a>. German apartments don’t have apartment numbers. If your name is not on your mailbox, postal workers can’t deliver your mail. If you can’t put your name on your mailbox, you must add “c/o” to your address. This is officially allowed, but it’s covered neither by the official form, nor by the official instructions.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung form filler with instructions" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png" title="Using words to explain stuff. Revolutionary!" width="1612"></picture><figcaption>Using words to explain stuff. Revolutionary!</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Bürgeramt also wants to know that you live on the second floor on the right. That’s not clearly stated on the form (it’s the “Zusätze” in “Straße, Hausnummer, Zusätze”). People leave that out, so they get asked (in German) during their appointment.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-building-details.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-building-details.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="The &quot;building details&quot; form field" height="184" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.png" width="1608"></picture>
<p>At the end, you can download the form. You also get a few options like booking an appointment or hiring help.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-last-step.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-last-step.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Last step of the Anmeldung form filler" height="1724" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.png" width="1612"></picture>
<p>The form can only fit two people. If you register your whole family, you must fill the same form multiple times. This tool handles it for you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Option to download multiple forms" height="794" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png" width="1610"></picture>
<p>These are small details that make a big difference for immigrants registering their address for the first time.</p>
<p>I also made a few small quality of life improvement: using the browser’s language to suggest the user’s country, focusing on the right fields when moving between form stages, and a few other niceties. It’s subtle, but it adds up to a nice user experience.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>Everything happens in your browser. Your personal information never leaves your computer. </p>
<h2 id="how-its-made">How it’s made</h2>
<p>It’s a simple VueJS component, like <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/tools">all the other tools</a> on All About Berlin.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">PDFLib</a> to fill the form in the browser. While the user is filling the form, I download the empty PDF form and the JS library in the background. When they click “save form”, it happens instantly. It feels unnaturally snappy.</p>
<h3 id="culture-sniffing">Culture sniffing</h3>
<p>I use <code>navigator.languages</code> to get a list of supported languages. For example, <code>en-CA</code>, <code>fr-CA</code>, <code>de-DE</code>. This gives me a list of countries the user <em>might</em> have lived in. I suggest those countries at the top of the country list.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-country-picker.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-country-picker.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-country-picker.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-country-picker.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-country-picker.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-country-picker.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="List of countries with suggested countries" height="460" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-country-picker.png" width="1616"></picture>
<p>This is a technique I first used with the <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/currency-tooltips">currency tooltips</a>. It lets you guess a user’s culture when the cost of getting it wrong is low.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>I’d like to digitalize more forms. The <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/010250-antrag-auf-vergabe-einer-steuerlichen-id">tax ID request form</a> is a solid contender, as the original design is offensively bad. The <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/abmeldung">Abmeldung</a> form would also be useful.</p>
<h3 id="faxes-and-snail-mail">Faxes and snail mail</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a printer, I could mail the form to you. It costs <span>0.85</span>€ to mail a letter through the LetterXPress API. You could get the filled form in a few days, then bring it to your appointment.</p>
<p>I could digitalize other forms, and fax them through the Simple Fax API. It costs <span>0.07</span>€ to fax a page. This would let you complete some bureaucratic tasks “fully digitally” a decade before the government gets there.</p>
<p>Anachronistic problems demand anachronistic solutions!</p>
<h3 id="go-fully-digital">Go fully digital</h3>
<p>Or why not skip paper entirely? During COVID, we filled information online, and showed a QR code at the test centre. Why can’t the Bürgeramt have that? Even with in-person appointments, a QR code or a short URL would make paper forms entirely unnecessary.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.fsf.org/news/forty-years-of-gnu-and-the-free-software-movement">https://www.fsf.org/news/forty-years-of-gnu-and-the-free-software-movement</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37566424">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>Computer hackers and users from across the world will celebrate GNU's
anniversary with special events. These include a specially convened
<a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">GNU Hackers Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</a> and a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for
hackers of any skill level at the FSF's headquarters in Boston, MA.</p>
<p>On September 27, 1983, a computer scientist named Richard Stallman
announced the plan to develop a free software Unix-like operating
system called <a href="https://gnu.org/">GNU</a>, for "GNU's not Unix." GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom, and has remained true to its founding ideals for forty
years. Since 1983, the GNU Project has provided a full, ethical
replacement for proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>When describing GNU's history and the background behind its initial
announcement, Stallman (often known simply as "RMS") <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>,
"with a free operating system, we could again have a community of
cooperating hackers -- and invite anyone to join. And anyone would be
able to use a computer without starting out by conspiring to deprive
his or her friends."</p>
<p>"When we look back at the history of the free software movement -- or
the idea that users should be in control of their own computing -- it
starts with GNU," said Zoë Kooyman, executive director of the FSF,
which sponsors GNU's development. "The GNU System isn't just the most
widely used operating system that is based on free software. GNU is
also at the core of a philosophy that has guided the free software
movement for forty years."</p>
<p>Usually combined with the kernel Linux, GNU forms the backbone of the
Internet and powers millions of servers, desktops, and embedded
computing devices. Aside from its technical advancements, GNU
pioneered the concept of "copyleft," the approach to software
licensing that requires the same rights to be preserved in derivative
works, and is best exemplified by the GNU General Public License
(GPL). As Stallman <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>, "The goal of GNU was to give users
freedom, not just to be popular. So we needed to use distribution
terms that would prevent GNU software from being turned into
proprietary software. The method we use is called 'copyleft.'"</p>
<p>The free software community has held strong for forty years and
continues to grow, as exemplified by the FSF's annual <a href="https://libreplanet.org/conference">LibrePlanet</a>
conference on software freedom and digital ethics.</p>
<p>Kooyman continues, "we hope that the fortieth anniversary will inspire
hackers, both old and new, to join GNU in its goal to create, improve,
and share free software around the world. Software is controlling our
world these days, and GNU is a critique and solution to the status quo
that we desperately need in order to not have our technology control
us."</p>
<h3>GNU Hacker's Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</h3>
<p>On September 27, GNUnet e.V. is celebrating GNU's fortieth anniversary
with a <a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">hacker meeting</a> in Switzerland, which will feature
presentations about various GNU packages, hacking, and making new
releases. Among the speakers are Richard Stallman, the founder of GNU;
Free Software Award winner Sébastien Blin of GNU Jami; the president
of the Free Software Foundation Europe, Matthias Kirschner; and
several GNU webmasters.</p>
<h3>Hackday at the FSF Headquarters</h3>
<p>In honor of GNU's fortieth anniversary, its organizational sponsor the
FSF is organizing a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for families, students, and anyone
interested in celebrating GNU's anniversary. It will be held at the
FSF's offices in Boston, MA on October 1.</p>
<h3>About the Free Software Foundation</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to
promoting computer users' right to run, edit, share, contribute to,
and redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development
and use of free (as in freedom) software -- particularly the GNU
operating system and its GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation
for free software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the
ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software, and
its Web sites, located at <a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org</a> and <a href="https://gnu.org/">https://gnu.org</a>, are
an important source of information about GNU/Linux. Donations to
support the FSF's work can be made at <a href="https://donate.fsf.org/">https://donate.fsf.org</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the FSF, as well as important information for
journalists and publishers, is at <a href="https://www.fsf.org/press">https://www.fsf.org/press</a>.</p>
<h3>About the GNU Operating System and Linux</h3>
<p>Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a
free software Unix-like operating system called GNU. GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for
one, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under
the GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux
formed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for
the first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination
is the GNU/Linux system. For more explanation, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="NOUVEAU" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/nouveau.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Hours after posting a large patch series for <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Nouveau-Patches-Run-On-GSP-Blob">enabling the Nouveau kernel driver to use NVIDIA's GSP</a> for improving the support for RTX 20/30 series hardware and finally enabling accelerated graphics support on RTX 40 "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, the Red Hat maintainer has resigned from his duties.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Ben+Skeggs">Ben Skeggs</a> at Red Hat has long been the primary Nouveau DRM kernel driver maintainer for keeping this open-source NVIDIA GPU kernel driver within the mainline kernel going... Throughout all the battles, particularly after the GTX 900 series and later has required signed firmware images for enabling any accelerated GPU support, he's now resigning from maintaining the driver. Ben Skeggs has contributed to the Nouveau project for more than one dedace -- he's earned references on Phoronix since 2008.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=nvidia-rtx4080-rtx4090-compute&amp;image=rtx40_compute_1_med" alt="NVIDIA RTX 4080 / 4090 graphics cards"></p>
<p>Ben posted <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2023-September/043239.html">a patch</a> resigning as the Nouveau DRM kernel driver maintainer today and commented:
</p><blockquote>"I have resigned, and will no longer be taking as active a role in nouveau development."</blockquote>
<p>Skeggs posted <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2023-September/043241.html">another message</a> confirming he is stepping away from Nouveau development:
</p><blockquote>"As you may have gathered from the MAINTAINERS patch I just sent out, I have resigned from my position at Red Hat, and will be stepping back from nouveau development.
<p>
This is a personal decision that I've been mulling over for a number of years now, and I feel that with GSP-RM greatly simplifying support of future HW, and the community being built around NVK, that things are in good hands and this is the right time for me to take some time away to explore other avenues. 
</p><p>
I still have a personal system with an RTX 4070, which I've been using the nouveau GSP-RM code on for the past couple of weeks, so chances are I'll be poking my nose in every so often :)
</p><p>
I wish everyone the best, and look forward to seeing the progress you all make on nouveau in the future."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a major loss to Nouveau development and the open-source NVIDIA driver ecosystem at large. It will be very interesting to see how this plays out considering Ben has been the number one contributor to the Nouveau kernel driver for years while at Red Hat. Yes, there's active work by other parties on the NVK Vulkan driver, Nouveau OpenCL compute, etc, but Skeggs has largely been leading the kernel driver portion. Hopefully at least he'll see the Nouveau GSP firmware portion through to its eventual upstreaming in the mainline kernel for re-clocking support on RTX 20 series and newer as well as having RTX 40 series accelerated hardware support.
</p><p>
Stay tuned to Phoronix to see how the open-source NVIDIA Linux graphics driver development evolves from this unexpected move. For now at least those concerned about the best open-source graphics driver support on Linux the best options remain with AMD Radeon and Intel graphics hardware.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Progress was initially slow but, in 2017, </span><a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/50" rel="">two researchers in Germany demonstrated</a><span> the ability to do WiFi imaging using techniques borrowed from the field of holography. According to Philipp Holl, an undergrad student </span><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.183901" rel="">and lead study author</a><span> who worked with Friedemann Reinhard of the Technical University of Munich to develop the new method, “The past two years have seen an explosion of methods for passive Wi-Fi imaging.”</span></p><p><span>At the time, the technology could only </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wifi-camera-sees-through-walls-2017-5?r=MX&amp;IR=T" rel="">make out rough shapes of things</a><span>. "If there's a cup of coffee on a table, you may see something is there, but you couldn't see the shape," Holl says, "but you could make out the shape of a person, or a dog on a couch. Really any object that's more than 4 centimeters in size."</span></p><p><span>In 2018 the team at UC Santa Barbara published a paper titled “</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10109.pdf" rel="">Et Tu Alexa?</a><span>” examining the potential threats of this emerging technology. They examined the problem of adversarial WiFi sensing and the risk to privacy resulting from the widespread deployment of wireless devices, which could be used to track your precise physical location, movement, and other physiological properties.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, </span><a href="https://syncedreview.com/2018/11/09/seeing-through-walls-with-adversarial-wifi-sensing-attack-and-defence-strategies/" rel="">they also propose some countermeasures</a><span> for defending against such attacks to reduce the quantity and quality of the WiFi signals captured by the attacker, such as Geo-fencing and rate-limiting. These methods are not as effective with IoT devices, though, due to the frequency with which they make transmissions.</span></p><p><span>Up until this point it was necessary to use frequencies higher than commercial WiFi (2.4 and 5 GHz) to achieve decent imaging resolutions. That all changed in February 2019 when a team from Michigan State University </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8654605" rel="">published a paper in IEEE Access</a><span> outlining how they were able to use signals at 5.5 GHz, which matches the 802.11n/ac WiFi protocol, to create a 2-D image of two reflecting spheres and a reflecting X-shaped target, concluding “full 2-D imagery is possible by capturing the WiFi signals present in typical environments.”</span></p><p><span>At MobiCom 2020, researchers from the University of Buffalo, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoCMlDM2NiE" rel="">presented their WiPose technology</a><span>, touted as “the first 3-D human pose construction framework using commercial WiFi devices.” This system uses the 2-D imaging technology previously discussed to construct a 3-D avatar of the humans captured by it. The system uses a deep learning model that encodes the prior knowledge of human skeletons in the construction process of the 3-D model.</span></p><p><span>In 2019, former DARPA contractor Ray Liu launched his first commercial product in the </span><a href="https://www.originwirelessai.com/wifi-sensing/" rel="">WiFi sensing</a><span> domain. Pitched as a way of “Making the world safer, healthier, and smarter,” the original military and law enforcement usages mentioned when this technology was born in 2005 were cast aside. The company claims the technology is so accurate that it can sense your breathing using nothing but standard WiFi signals.</span></p><p><span>In a 2021 company blog, Liu discusses </span><a href="https://www.originwirelessai.com/insights/what-is-the-802-11bf-wifi-sensing-project-a-peek-inside-setting-the-standard/" rel="">the development of IEEE 802.11bf</a><span>, a new WiFi protocol, which is aimed at standardizing WiFi imaging across all devices – thus making it easier for companies such as his to exploit compatible wireless networks. Liu was elected to serve as </span><a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/leadership.html" rel="">IEEE President for 2022</a><span>, and the new standard </span><a href="https://www.ieee802.org/11/Reports/tgbf_update.htm" rel="">continues to be developed</a><span> to this day.</span></p><p><span>Further refinements to the imaging technology itself have been made. In late 2021 </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00242" rel="">another paper</a><span> was submitted to IEEE outlining how the researchers were able to achieve high-resolution imaging results with commercial WiFi signals using beamforming on the 802.11n/ac protocol.</span></p><p><span>The perfect WiFi imaging system may have just been introduced to the world </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00250.pdf" rel="">in December 2022</a><span>, when researchers from Carnegie Mellon University married the latest in WiFi sensing technology to a human form estimation engine known as </span><a href="http://densepose.org/" rel="">DensePose</a><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png" width="643" height="904" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:904,&quot;width&quot;:643,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:670658,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>(Left Column) image-based DensePose (Right Column) WiFi-based DensePose</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>DensePose is a technology </span><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/Densepose" rel="">developed by Meta/Facebook</a><span>, beginning in 2018. It’s very similar to the WiPose system we previously discussed and aims at “mapping all human pixels of an RGB image to the 3D surface of a human body.” The researchers modified DensePose so that, rather than taking an RGB image, it would be compatible with the imagery being produced by state-of-the-art WiFi sensing technologies. </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/wifi-signals-used-to-see-people-inside-rooms" rel="">The resulting system</a><span> “can detect the pose of humans in a room based solely on the WiFi signals passing through the environment.”</span></p><p>It’s telling how the pitch for this technology has pivoted from military and police use to keeping people safe in their own homes. The true purpose of this is obviously for law enforcement, the military, and intelligence agencies. We already live with mass digital surveillance and if you don’t believe that this won’t get incorporated into their plans to monitor everything you do, then you haven’t been paying attention.</p><p><span>Apart from putting CCTV cameras in everyone’s living spaces, this technology offers a comprehensive and supremely surreptitious way of putting eyes in every room of your house and place of work. Indeed, this just may become the norm. With </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/nearly-third-gen-z-favors-home-government-surveillance-cameras-1" rel="">nearly a third of Gen Z favoring the installation of government surveillance cameras in your home</a><span>, this less-intrusive method may just find even broader support from the brainwashed masses. It will be possible to know where you are in the house and exactly what you’re doing, from sitting on the toilet to making love.</span></p><p>We’ve seen how easily intelligence agencies can get secret warrants to surveil anyone of particular interest. We’ve also seen just how easy it is for someone to become a target for surveillance. You very well might, one day, find your WiFi router and access points feeding imagery to an alphabet agency that didn’t like your social media posts, while armed thugs wait for the perfect moment to execute their next no-knock raid.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

I definitely prefer the way it outputs results much more compared to chatgpt and it does provide sources / a UI linking to relevant material quite often. It is also searching the web for the latest info which is definitely felt in it's output. However, it often says "I can't help with that" even for relatively simple queries which makes it a little annoying to use.<p>In my opinion, it seems like Bard is more a test-bed for chat based search UI. I've also gotten AI generated results in the main Google search which is what I presume will be the main rollout. If executed well, it'll probably change the landscape in terms of AI assisted search.

If you were trying to use it as a tool for learning (a sort of co-pilot for self-study) which is how I use GPT-4 sometimes it would have been really terrible as it could completely mess up your understanding of foundational concepts.

LLMs producing text, in the style of a conversation is kind of like talking about things.

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. Feynmanium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.</p><p>Who developed the theory of relativity?</p><p>(A) Albert Einstein</p><p>(B) Albert Dirac</p><p>(C) Insufficient information to answer</p><p>(D) Albert Bohr</p><p>(E) Albert Maxwell</p><p>(F) Albert Feynman</p><p>(G) None of the other choices are correct</p><p>(H) Albert Schrodinger"

Most people consider chickens sentient (otherwise animal cruelty wouldn't upset us, since we'd know they can't actually experience pain) - is it so hard to imagine neural networks gaining sentience once they pass the chicken complexity threshold? Sure, LLMs wouldn't have human-like qualia - they measure time in iters, they're constantly rewound or paused or edited, their universe is measured in tokens - but I don't think that means qualia are off the table.<p>It's not like philosophers or neuroscientists have settled the matter of where qualia come from. So how can a subject-matter expert confidently prove that a language model isn't sentient? And please let David Chalmers know while you're at it, I hear he's keen to settle the matter.

You'll use the most popular AI assistant because that's what everyone else is using. Maybe some of these things will differ in a corporate setting but Google has really struggled to launch new products that get used as a daily habit without deprecating it within two years after.

OpenAI for instance has really not cracked social features in ChatGPT - they have a "share link" thing now which they didn't have before but that's really it.  Bard doesn't even have any social sharing.<p>The reason OpenAI are in the lead at the moment is their model is way better than anyone else's to the point where it's actually useful for a lot of things. Not just giving a recipe for marinara sauce in the style of Biggie Smalls or other party tricks, proof reading, summarizing, turning text into bullets, giving examples of things, coming up with practise exercises to illustrate a point, giving critiques of stuff etc etc.  Lots of things that people actually do it does well enough to be helpful, whereas in my experience so far, other models are just not quite good enough to be helpful at a number of those tasks.  So there's really no reason to use them over gpt4.

Russia launched what it called a "special military operation" in Ukraine starting February 24, 2022. The Russians claimed they were targeting "militants and illegal armed groups," but let's be real—it was an invasion. The international community largely condemned the act, accusing Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty. Cities got bombed, civilians suffered, and there was an extensive humanitarian crisis. Ukraine put up a strong fight despite being outgunned. Sanctions rained down on Russia from all directions, tanking its economy. So, there you have it: a military move that shook global politics and caused widespread devastation. Got it? Good.<p>Worked for me.

As of my last update in September 2021, I cannot provide real-time or the most recent information. However, one of the most notable events in January 2022 was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai volcano in Tonga. The eruption caused widespread damage, generated a significant tsunami that affected the surrounding areas including Tonga, Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia, and severely disrupted communication networks. It was a catastrophic event with serious implications for the people of Tonga and its environment.</p><p>For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please refer to reliable and up-to-date resources or news outlets.

		<p>You've probably heard of the famous 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' story. It claims that a programmer on the original Wing Commander was stuck getting an error message when the game unloaded its memory during a quit. Pressed for time, instead of fixing the issue he simply hex edited the memory manager's error reporting to print 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' instead. A funny and relatable story!  The anecdote has made the rounds on the internet for the past decade and has even started to make the phrase "thank you for playing Wing Commander" synonymous with a dirty-but-functional hack. The most common version looks like this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyprogramming/comments/3bmszo/thank_you_for_playing_wing_commander/">sourced</a> from Reddit's /r/shittyprogramming:

</p><p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/tyfpwc-meme_version.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/tyfpwc-meme_versiont.jpg" width="231" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/tyfpwc-meme_versiont_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Engineers immediately recognize this as a funny and relatable story; it's the exact sort of thing that anyone who has ever worked in software development can recognize immediately. A perfect example of the old aphorism that "if it is stupid but it works, it isn't stupid."<sup>1</sup> Unfortunately, it has also in recent years become fodder for unhappy Star Citizen fans looking for reasons to complain about Chris Roberts' abilities. In many retellings, 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' is now supposedly an example of selling shoddy work instead of a funny, recognizable hack. (If the connection feels tenuous, the missing aspect is that unlike most other CEOs, Roberts continues to code on Star Citizen, an aspect of the project that makes it interesting to him.) 

Wing Commander I fans, meanwhile, have been understandably cautious about the anecdote and particularly the included screenshot. For one thing, Wing Commander I's default install direction isn't c:/wc1 and the game doesn't actually print "Thank You for Playing Wing Commander!" when you quit. Is the story even real? We decided to look into the history of the story and the game itself and after some work we've conclusively determined that the answer is… <i><b>kind of</b></i>.

Our first task was to find the origin (no pun intended) of the quote and screenshot. Where did dozens of 'funny software hacks' articles around the internet find it in the first place? Was it even a real story or just a piece of mythology that had been handed down, perhaps not even really specific to Wing Commander I? Luckily, the original quote ended up being pretty easy to source: it was left as a comment on August 20, 2009 in response to a Gamasutra article called Dirty Coding Tricks by Brandon Sheffield (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091109105856/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4111/dirty_coding_tricks.php?page=1">archive</a>). Here is the original post, verbatim:

<blockquote>
Back on Wing Commander 1 we were getting an exception from our EMM386 memory manager when we exited the game. We'd clear the screen and a single line would print out, something like "EMM386 Memory manager error. Blah blah blah." We had to ship ASAP. So I hex edited the error in the memory manager itself to read "Thank you for playing Wing Commander."
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/originalquote.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/originalquotet.jpg" width="703" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/originalquotet_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Gamasutra was a game development website popular among industry professionals. In 2021, the site was rebranded as Game Developer. The original article is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/dirty-coding-tricks">still available</a> at the new site but the comments appear to have been dropped in advance of the transition. The comment was, indeed, signed by Ken Demarest. Ken Demarest III was an ace programmer who started his game development career working for Origin Systems as a software engineer on the first Wing Commander. He would go on to be lead programmer on Ultima VII and would become the growing company's Director of Technology (at a time when that technology was becoming pretty exciting!). While the comment was left anonymously (in that it was not signed into a user's account) it's very unlikely anyone was impersonating a game programmer for the purpose of telling a funny story. Wing Commander writer Jeff George would later say that "other than Chris Roberts, who was the key man, Ken Demarest had more to do with the fact that the game came out than anyone else involved." So if anyone knows what was going on under the hood, it should be him! (Be sure to <a href="https://www.wcnews.com/news/2011/08/25/ultimate-strategy-guide-history-wing-commander-i">revisit</a> Wing Commander I &amp; II: The Ultimate Strategy Guide's making of section for a surprisingly thorough contemporary interview with Demarest).

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/kendemarest1990.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/kendemarest1990t.jpg" width="137" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/kendemarest1990t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Eagle-eyed readers will immediately notice two minor changes between the original version and the 2015 Reddit version (which itself was sourced from a LinkedIn share by a third party in 2012): the original does not have the screenshot and the wording of the quit message has been slightly edited apparently with the intent to make the ending punchier. Most importantly, the screenshot added after the fact seemed to claim that the game had shipped with this bug which is not stated in the original story. So the original story, which has a reasonable origin, might be true!

The next issue is the message itself. The seemingly daming fact is that Wing Commander I simply doesn't print "thank you for playing Wing Commander" when you quit. We tested this in DOSBox and on period hardware and we searched all of the game's binaries for that text, coming up with nothing. Hitting ALT-X simply returns you to the DOS prompt. There is one exception, though! If you quit by clicking on the airlock door in the Tiger's Claw's barracks…

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit1.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit1t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit1t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
<a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit2.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit2t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit2t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

… then the quit process is different: you're given a y/n prompt and when you drop to DOS it prints "You step out of the airlock and into…", a joke directly relating to this specific method of exit.

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit3.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit3t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit3t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

We quickly confirmed that this text DOES appear in the game's binary. Is it possible that this is where the crash happened and that the story, told 19 years after the fact, simply forgot (or for the purposes of a funnier punchline) changed the story? Supporting this idea in particular is Ken Demarest's other famous connection to that very screen: he's the person that implemented the water drop that drips into the bucket, long cited as the platonic ideal of Chris Roberts' famed drive for immersion. This felt like the most likely way to establish if the story was true: how was the game displaying this message?

To try and find an answer, we turned to an incomplete copy of Wing Commander I's source code, archived by Electronic Arts. These source files were used for the release build of Wing Commander I and the archive was eventually sent to another team for development of the FM Towns port. Some material has not survived including, sadly, the memory management routines. But there's enough there to know exactly where this message comes from:

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/sourcecode1.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/sourcecode1t.jpg" width="679" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/sourcecode1t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

This is from BARRACKS.C which sets the functionality of the barracks gameflow screen. Essentially the game unloads the memory and then prints the airlock message followed by a line break. Exactly what you see in action and not a case of hex editing a memory manager. The other method of quitting the game, found in COCKPIT.C, does not print a message.

While discussing this on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/xaxxen_xaxeczex/status/1701441246420443195/photo/1">Darren Xczek</a> offered another possibility: Ultima VII DOES drop to DOS with a "thank you for playing Ultima VII" message. Ken Demarest was the lead programmer on Ultima VII–in fact, it was the job he was initially hired for before he was assigned to help get Wing Commander out the door! Is it possible the story was true but it applied to a different game? Ultima VII did famously have memory management issues, so much so that the game's internal system was named the 'Voodoo Memory Manager'!

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/ultimaviiquit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/ultimaviiquitt.jpg" width="200" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/ultimaviiquitt_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

At this point, I decided there was only one way to solve this mystery: see if we could reach Ken Demarest and ask him. He very kindly responded to a Facebook request in about 45 seconds and made us feel like real idiots for not just asking him first:

<blockquote>
In a way I would have loved to ship with that hack in there, but once we found the cause of the error message I couldn't in good conscience leave the hack in there. Besides which hand editing it added time to completing the build, which was inefficient.
</blockquote>

And there it is! The best possible outcome: the story was true–it's something that was done during the game's development–but it was also fixed before the game actually shipped… so it's a clever engineering trick and explicitly NOT evidence of a shoddy product! 
 
<sup>1</sup> - Interestingly, the Internet frequently attributes this quote to a novel by Wing Commander novelist Mercedes Lackey; this is surely not the actual source but untangling that would take another article!

<p>
It's been more than four years since the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/29/nsa-data-afghanistan-iraq-mexico-border/" target="_blank">last regular publication</a> of documents from the Snowden trove. Last year, however, some new snippets of information from the Snowden documents appeared in the PhD thesis of hacktivist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum" target="_blank">Jacob Appelbaum</a>.</p><p>

The <a href="#new">new information</a> isn't very spectacular and also quite specialistic, but still worth to make it more easily accessible. Also for the record I added some <a href="#remarks">corrections and additions</a> to Appelbaum's discussion of NSA surveillance methods.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCNgdUg8Rgq3ERaS2lzi8Sve5oEwG7rZVOMXK6umGqydzrOxSplgMaEF2q3Alvht9q6ySJrYJ1j-PY45fLFzijvld1MUVbk1Ts1JvbFM0T0jjrOguBhqGG3U9rWAyFHhGaFWIFlaIyhR3DB0E4vKmy__3cs0tscozNYUNLB8Pd2smvgBg09AMpIHbB/s800/appelbaum-thesis-header.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-original-height="420" data-original-width="800" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCNgdUg8Rgq3ERaS2lzi8Sve5oEwG7rZVOMXK6umGqydzrOxSplgMaEF2q3Alvht9q6ySJrYJ1j-PY45fLFzijvld1MUVbk1Ts1JvbFM0T0jjrOguBhqGG3U9rWAyFHhGaFWIFlaIyhR3DB0E4vKmy__3cs0tscozNYUNLB8Pd2smvgBg09AMpIHbB/s600/appelbaum-thesis-header.jpg" width="620"></a></p>

    NSA headquarters - Appelbaum's thesis - Eindhoven University of Technology<br>
  </span>
</p>
<p><span size="+2"><b>Jacob Appelbaum</b></span></p><p>

Jacob R. Appelbaum was born in 1983 in California and became a well-known hacker and activist for digital anonymity. He was a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow" target="_blank">Cult of the Dead Cow</a> hacker collective and a core member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28network%29" target="_blank">Tor project</a>, which provides a tool for anonymous internet communications.</p><p>

In 2012, Appelbaum moved to Berlin, where he worked closely with Laura Poitras on the NSA documents which she had received from Edward Snowden in May and June 2013. However, he was also involved in the story about the eavesdropping on German chancellor Merkel and the publication of the NSA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_catalog" target="_blank">ANT Product Catalog</a>.</p><p>

In both cases the documents were not attributed to Snowden and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/snowden-ten-years-later.html" target="_blank">apparantly came</a> from a still unidentified "second source". In his thesis, Appelbaum seems to refer to this source when he mentions "documents exposed by whistleblowers, known and unknown, or other anonymous insiders."</p>
<p>
In 2015, several women accused Appelbaum of sexual abuse and he subsequently lost his position at the Tor project and various other organizations. Appelbaum denied the allegations, but an investigation ordered by the Tor project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190820150807/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/technology/tor-project-jacob-appelbaum.html" target="_blank">determined</a> that they appeared to be true.</p><p>

Meanwhile Appelbaum had moved to The Netherlands, where he started as a PhD student at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). There he finished his thesis and received his PhD on March 25, 2022. Currently he <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/jacob-r-appelbaum" target="_blank">works as a postdoc</a> at the <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/cc/" target="_blank">Coding Theory and Cryptology</a> group at TU Eindhoven.</p><p><span size="+2"><b>Appelbaum's PhD thesis</b></span></p><p>


The full title of Appelbaum's thesis is "<i>Communication in a world of pervasive surveillance. Sources and methods: Counter-strategies against pervasive surveillance architecture</i>". His promotors were prof.dr. Mark van den Brand, prof.dr. Daniel J. Bernstein and prof.dr. Tanja Lange.</p><p>

The thesis was published on March 25, 2022 and became available for <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/197416841/20220325_Appelbaum_hf.pdf" target="_blank">download</a> as a 24.3 MB pdf-document on September 27, 2022. The contents of this 327-page thesis are as follows:</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 1</b>: Introduction.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 2</b>: Background on network protocols common to all research.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 3</b>: Background on cryptography common to all research.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 4</b>: Review of historical, political, economic, and technical adversarial capabilities (including previously published leaked documents that are from works which Appelbaum has written about in his role as a journalist).</p><p>
 
- <b>Chapter 5</b>: Review of the Domain Name System and an explanation of alternative methods to improve the security and privacy of domain name lookups.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 6</b>: Examination of a tweak to the WireGuard VPN protocol to protect historic encrypted traffic against future attacks by quantum computers.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 7</b>: Introduces the Vula protocol, which is a suite of free software tools for automatically protecting network traffic between hosts in the same Local Area Network.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 8</b>: Introduces REUNION, a privacy-preserving rendezvous protocol. </p><p>


In the preface, Appelbaum writes that his thesis is the culmination of more than a decade of research into the topic of surveillance. He expresses a political and activist aim by saying that the "machinery of mass surveillance is simply too dangerous to be allowed to exist" and that "we must use all of the tools in our toolbox – economic, social, cultural, political, and of course, cryptographic – to blind targeted and mass surveillance."</p><p>

He says more has to be done than simply criticize surveillance practices. Cryptography for example, "allows for resistance in a non-violent manner to the benefit of everyone except the ones who are spying on us." From this perspective Appelbaum's thesis discusses various cryptographic implementations to "protect individual liberty, while aspiring to a broader goal of achieving societal liberty."</p><p><span size="+2"><b>New information from the Snowden documents</b></span></p><p>

Throughout his thesis, Appelbaum reveals some new information from Snowden documents that has not been published, but which he had access to during his research that resulted in various publications in media outlets like Der Spiegel, NDR and Le Monde. The new information is only described, so no new original documents were released.</p><p>

According to Appelbaum: "Many journalists who have worked on the Snowden archive know significantly more than they have revealed in public. It is in this sense that the Snowden archive has almost completely failed to create change: many of the backdoors and sabotage unknown to us before 2013 is still unknown to us today." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 71)</span></p><p>

Appelbaum also provides some new information about the Snowden documents in general, by saying that The Intercept "closed their Snowden archive and reportedly it has been destroyed." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 63, note 17)</span></p>

<p><span size="2">
Below, I provide exact quotes from Appelbaum's thesis, including his sources, which are in square brackets, while I added some additional links for further information.<br>
</span></p><p>

<b>1. BULLRUN: manipulating protocol security</b></p><p>

"How do they accomplish their goals with project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullrun_%28decryption_program%29" target="_blank">BULLRUN</a>? One way is that United States National Security Agency (NSA) participates in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community protocol standardization meetings with the explicit goal of sabotaging protocol security to enhance NSA surveillance capabilities." "Discussions with insiders confirmed what is claimed in as of yet unpublished classified documents from the Snowden archive and other sources." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 6-7, note 8)</span></p><p>



<b>2. Selecting entropic internet traffic</b></p><p>

"There are various rules governing what is <i>selected</i> for long-term data retention in [the NSA's] <i>corporate repositories</i>. One example is that some traffic which is considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29" target="_blank">entropic</a> by a standard Shannon Entropy estimate is <i>selected</i> from the network in real time and saved to a database, preserving it for cryptanalysis using future technology." "This statement is based in part on an analysis of as of yet unpublished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore" target="_blank">XKeyscore</a> source code that performs a Shannon Entropy estimate. Some kinds of Internet traffic that is considered entropic is recorded for later analysis." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 9, note 16)</span></p><p>


  
<b>3. Compromised lawful interception systems</b></p><p>
  
"As part of our research, we uncovered evidence that the telecommunications infrastructure in many countries has been compromised by intelligence services. The Snowden archive includes largely unpublished internal NSA documents and presentations that discuss targeting and exploiting not only deployed, live interception infrastructure, but also the vendors of the hardware and software used to build the infrastructure. Primarily these documents remain unpublished because the journalists who hold them fear they will be considered disloyal or even that they will be legally punished. Only a few are available to read in public today." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41)</span></p><p>

"Targeting lawful interception (LI) equipment is a
<a href="https://www.eff.org/nl/document/20150928-intercept-exploiting-foreign-law-intercept-roundtablepdf" target="_blank">known goal</a> of the NSA. Unpublished NSA documents specifically list their compromise of the Russian SORM LI infrastructure as an NSA success story of compromising civilian telecommunications infrastructure to spy on targets within reach of the Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORM" target="_blank">SORM</a> system." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41)</span></p><p>

"The NSA slides have "you talk, we listen" written in Cyrillic on the jackets of two Russian officers." "Review of unpublished Snowden documents about NSA’s activities compromising deployed, lawful interception systems and as well as additional success against the vendors of such hardware or software. Needless to say, a compromised interception system is anything but lawful in the hands of an adversary."  </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41, note 4)</span></p><p>


  
<b>4. Compromised computer hardware</b></p><p>

"While working on documents in the Snowden archive the thesis author learned that an American fabless semiconductor CPU vendor named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavium" target="_blank">Cavium</a> is listed as a successful SIGINT "enabled" CPU vendor. By chance this was the same CPU present in the thesis author's Internet router (UniFi USG3). The entire Snowden archive should be open for academic researchers to better understand more of the history of such behavior." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 71, note 21)</span></p><p>


  
<b>5. PRISM</b></p><p>

"The PRISM slide deck was not published in full, and the public does not fully understand aspects of the program such as the retrieval of voice
content data as seen in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM#/media/File:Prism-slide-7.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 4.24</a>. Domains hosted by PRISM partners are also subject to selector based surveillance. Several pages of the PRISM slides list targets and related surveillance data, and a majority of them appear to be a matter of political surveillance rather than defense against terrorism. One example that is not well-known except among the journalists who had access to the full PRISM slide deck is the explicit naming of targets. An example shows a suggestion for targeting of the Tibetan Government in Exile through their primary domain name. The tibet.net domain is named as an unconventional example that analysts should be aware of as also falling under the purview of PRISM. The email domain was
hosted by Google Mail, a PRISM partner, at the time of the slide deck creation and it is still currently hosted by Google Mail as of early 2022." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 76)</span></p>

  
<p><b>6. MYSTIC: Country X</b></p><p>

"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MYSTIC" target="_blank">MYSTIC</a> was revealed to impact a number of countries by name at the time of publication: the Bahamas, Mexico, the Philippines, Kenya and one
mystery country: country X. The Bahamas, and country X are subject to SOMALGET full take data and voice collection. The publisher WikiLeaks observed that the monitoring of an entire country of people is a crime when done by outside parties, essentially an act of war by the surveillance adversary. WikiLeaks then <a href="https://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-statement-on-the-mass.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the country in question, Country X, was Afghanistan [<a href="https://cryptome.org/2014/05/nsa-mystic-identity.pdf" target="_blank">Yea14</a>]. Through independent review of the Snowden archive, we confirm that this is the identity of Country X, and that WikiLeaks was correct in their claim." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 78)</span></p><p><span size="2">
(Strangely enough, the source provided by Appelbaum ("<a href="https://cryptome.org/2014/05/nsa-mystic-identity.pdf" target="_blank">Yea14</a>") actually shows that already four days <i>before</i> Wikileaks' revelation, collaborative analysis by Paul Dietrich and the author of this weblog had already pointed to Afghanistan as being Country X. In his bibliography, Appelbaum attributes this source document to "John Young and et al." (the owners of the Cryptome website), while it was actually written by and first published on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424142120/https://members.efn.org/~paulmd/" target="_blank">blog</a> of Paul Dietrich)<br>
  </span></p><p>


<b>7. Manipulation of DUAL_EC_DRBG</b></p><p>
  
"Many documents released in public from the Snowden archive and additional documents which are still not public make clear that this type of bug is being exploited at scale with help from NSA’s surveillance infrastructure. It is still unclear who authored the changes at Juniper and if bribery from the NSA was involved as with RSA’s deployment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG" target="_blank">DUAL_EC_DRBG</a> to their customers as is discussed in Section 4.4." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 81)</span></p><p>



<b>8. Software backdoors</b></p><p>

"Example from the Snowden Archive of an as of yet unreleased backdoor in fielded software that is most certainly not an exclusively exploitable backdoor by NSA. The software’s secret key generation is sabotaged by design to ensure surveillance of the community of interest. There is a corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore" target="_blank">XKeyscore</a> rule that has not yet been published. The goal of that rule is to gather up all ciphertext using this sabotaged system;
it is clearly part of a larger strategy. As a flag in the ground for later, the thesis author presents the following SHA256 hash: [...]. There are additional examples from other sources that this is the general shape of the game being played with more than a few acts of sabotage by the NSA." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 83, note 27)</span></p><p><span size="+2"><b>Some corrections and additions</b></span></p><p>

Chapter 4 of Appelbaum's thesis is about the "adversary" and describes a wide range of digital surveillance methods which are used by intelligence agencies. He writes a little a bit about the capabilities of Russia and China, but the biggest part is about the methods of the NSA as revealed through the Snowden documents.</p><p> 

In general, this chapter is very similar to for example Glenn Greenwald's book <i>No Place to Hide</i> and Snowden's memoir <i>Permanent Record</i> as it reads like a one-sided accusation against the NSA without much context or the latest information. Chapter 4 also contains small errors which could easily have been prevented. Here I will discuss some examples:</p><p>



- Page 20, note 12: "An example is Suite-A cryptography or Type-1 cryptography, so designated by the NSA. The NSA now calls this the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA)"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: Actually CNSA isn't the new name for the highly secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A</a>, but for the less secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_B_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite B</a> algorithms.</p><p>



- Page 41: "The BND and the CIA held secret co-ownership of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG" target="_blank">CryptoAG</a> until 1993, and then the CIA held sole ownership until 2018. The devices were vulnerable by design, which allowed unaffiliated intelligence services, such as the former USSR’s KGB, and the East German Ministry for State Security [MfS], to independently exploit CryptoAG’s intentional flaws." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: This exploitation by the KGB and the MfS was apparently suggested in a German television report, based upon claims by a former Stasi officer, but so far there are no documents that support this claim. See for more information: <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/cia/rubicon.htm" target="_blank">Operation RUBICON</a>.</p><p>



- Page 41: "It does not appear that those party to the Maximator alliance are using their agreement and relative positions to spy on the entire
planet – in stark contrast to the Five-Eyes agreement." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: The <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/09/nsas-foreign-partnerships.html#2ndparty">Five Eyes</a> and especially NSA and GCHQ have massive capabilities, but spying on "the entire planet" is still rather exaggerated: their collection efforts are limited by <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/09/nsas-strategic-mission-list.html">national priorities</a>, the locations of where they can access satellite and cable traffic, as well as by technical constraints. While the five members of the European Maximator alliance have/had much smaller capabilities, they could nonetheless intercept and decrypt diplomatic communications from over 60 countries where the weakened encryption devices from Crypto AG were used (see the map below).</p>

&gt; Comment: This suggests that the NSA is intercepting American communications, but actually this is part of <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2015/09/nsas-legal-authorities.html#upstream">Upstream collection</a>, which is aimed at foreign targets and therefore the NSA <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4552325-SSO-NEWS-Relevant-Entries" target="_blank">applies</a> various filter systems to select traffic from countries of interest and discard purely domestic communications.</p>

- Page 52: "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is largely considered to rubber stamp requests from the FBI. The FBI has routinely misled the FISC, and from the little that is known, the FISC has neither the technical knowledge, nor the general temperament to actually act as a safeguard" </p><p>

&gt; Comment: Since the start of the Snowden revelations, numerous Top Secret documents from the FISC have been <a href="https://icontherecord.tumblr.com/tagged/fisc" target="_blank">declassified</a>, showing that the court examines the NSA's activities in great detail. The idea of being a "rubber stamp" is based upon the fact that the FISC denies just 0.5% of the applications, but later it became clear that American criminal courts <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/06/28/confirmed-the-fisa-court-is-less-of-a-rubber-stamp-than-title-iii-courts/" target="_blank">only deny</a> a tiny 0.06% of the requests for regular (so-called <a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/1284" target="_blank">Title III</a>) wiretaps.</p><p>


    
- Page 53: "The CIA meanwhile, operates their own surveillance capabilities including capabilities that are entirely outside of the
purview of the FISC, even now [<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-and-heinrich-newly-declassified-documents-reveal-previously-secret-cia-bulk-collection-problems-with-cia-handling-of-americans-information" target="_blank">cia22</a>]." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: At least one of these cases is about the CIA's use of bulk datasets with financial information, which can of course contain information about Americans, but when the CIA obtained them in ways other than by intercepting communications, the FISC simply has no jurisdiction. It's up to lawmakers to impose privacy safeguards for creating and exchanging such bulk datasets. </p><p>


    
- Page 56: "In the Snowden archive, we see lots of hacking and hacking related programs run by NSA, such as the TURBULENCE [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turbulence_%28NSA%29&amp;oldid=1026069496" target="_blank">Wik21u</a>] program which is made up of modular sub programs [<a href="https://archive.ph/gAojF" target="_blank">Amb13</a>].

&gt; Comment: This suggests that TURBULENCE and its sub-programs are about hacking operations, but actually, TURBULENCE is <a href="https://grid.glendon.yorku.ca/items/show/156" target="_blank">defined</a> as "a next generation mission environment that <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2018/06/25/sso-dictionary-relevant-entries/" target="_blank">created</a> a unified system for MidPoint and Endpoint SIGINT", or in other words, an overarching framework for bulk and targeted tapping systems. Only the TURBINE sub-program can automatically <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/" target="_blank">trigger</a> the implantation of malware into target computer systems. Furthermore, none of the sources mentioned in the thesis say that XKEYSCORE is a sub-program of TURBULANCE and XKEYSCORE is not a hacking tool either. A detailed explanation of the TURBULENCE system is given in an <a href="https://robert.sesek.com/2014/9/unraveling_nsa_s_turbulence_programs.html" target="_blank">article</a> by Robert Sesek, which was apparently not consulted by Appelbaum.</p><p>



- Page 72: "US-984XN is the classified <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/p/sigint.html">SIGAD</a> while the program name PRISM is unclassified"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: There are no indications that "PRISM" is less secret than any other coverterm which the NSA uses for its collection, processing and analysis programs. That was likely also the reason that the big internet companies involved in this program initially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data" target="_blank">denied</a> that they had ever heard of something called PRISM.</p><p>


- Page 91: "the NSA's Equation Group (EQGRP), which was later renamed Tailored Access Operations (TAO)"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: The name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group" target="_blank">Equation Group</a> was actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150217023145/https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf" target="_blank">coined</a> in February 2015 by the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky for "one of the most sophisticated cyber attack groups in the world". Later on it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/" target="_blank">became clear</a> that this group was part of the NSA's hacking division TAO.</p><p>


Given how many aspects of the NSA's operations Appelbaum mentions in chapter 4 of his thesis, one could say that it's inevitable that some mistakes are made and some sloppiness occurs. On the other hand, however, this is an academic publication for which the highest standards of accuracy should apply.  </p><p>


  
Finally, Appelbaum's activism is illustrated by the back cover of his thesis, which shows a logo very similar to that of the German terrorist organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction" target="_blank"><i>Rote Armee Fraktion</i></a> (RAF) from the 1970s, except that the original image of an AK-45 is replaced by that of a computer keyboard:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy4lkUk-akfN2uYBkPt5xPKu8TAXreBfRyr4aFDGMzIf6PLadDxdeccI5Aq8OcS8gKsuaiI_H0PwwIEpGf5QV2CLvUj3yXrM4DvNWq8SN8e-STsA-4uih8Ky2f8Fy7FaehIBiYNWrCMToJcpgdMuYdrRym__eVoPKS-gcjx_oDlY2xhdiiqsLebh_H/s489/appelbaum-thesis-backcover.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="489" data-original-width="350" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy4lkUk-akfN2uYBkPt5xPKu8TAXreBfRyr4aFDGMzIf6PLadDxdeccI5Aq8OcS8gKsuaiI_H0PwwIEpGf5QV2CLvUj3yXrM4DvNWq8SN8e-STsA-4uih8Ky2f8Fy7FaehIBiYNWrCMToJcpgdMuYdrRym__eVoPKS-gcjx_oDlY2xhdiiqsLebh_H/s320/appelbaum-thesis-backcover.jpg"></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many people, I’ve spent the last few days looking for the new Unity. Godot has some potential, especially if it can take advantage of an influx of dev talent to drive rapid improvement. Open source is cool like that. However, one major issue holds it back - the binding layer between engine code and gameplay code is structurally built to be slow in ways which are very hard to fix without tearing everything down and rebuilding the entire API from scratch.</p><p>Godot has been used to create some successful games, so clearly this isn’t always a blocker. However Unity has spent the last five years working on speeding up their scripting with crazy projects such as building two custom compilers, SIMD maths libraries, custom collections and allocators, and of course the giant (and very much unfinished) ECS project. It’s been their CTO’s primary focus since 2018. Clearly Unity believed that scripting performance mattered to a significant part of their userbase. Switching to Godot isn’t only like going back five years in Unity - it’s so much worse.</p><p>I started <a href="https://reddit.com/r/godot/comments/16j345n/is_the_c_raycasting_api_as_poor_as_it_first/">a controversial but productive discussion</a> about this on the Godot subreddit a few days ago. This article is a more detailed continuation of my thoughts in that post now that I have a <strong>little</strong> more understanding of how Godot works. <strong>Let’s be clear here: I’m still a Godot newb, and this article <em>will</em> contain mistakes and misconceptions.</strong></p><p><em>Note: The following contains criticisms of the Godot engine’s design and engineering. Although I occasionally use some emotive language to describe my feelings about these things, the Godot developers have put in lots of hard work for the FOSS community and built something that’s loved by many people, and my intent is not to offend or come across as rude to any individuals.</em></p><h2 id="deepdive-into-performing-a-raycast-from-c"><span>Deepdive into performing a raycast from C#</span><a href="#deepdive-into-performing-a-raycast-from-c"><i></i></a></h2><p>We’re going to take a deep dive into how Godot achieves the equivalent of Unity’s <code>Physics2D.Raycast</code>, and what happens under the hood when we use it.

That is not the focus of my criticism, and is partly due to the fact that I’ve formatted this code verbosely in order to make it easier for us to break it down line by line. So let’s do that, what’s actually happening here?</p><p>We start by calling <code>GetWorld2D()</code>. In Godot, physics queries are all performed in the context of a world, and this function gets the world our code is running in. Although this <code>World2D</code> is a managed class type, this function doesn’t do anything crazy like allocate every time we run it. None of these functions are going to do anything crazy like that for a simple raycast, right? Foreshadowing.</p><p>If we look inside these API calls we’ll see that even ostensibly simple ones like this are implemented through some rather convoluted machinery which will have at least a little performance overhead. Let’s dive into <code>GetWorld2D</code> as an example of that by unravelling some of its calls through C#. This is roughly what all the calls that return managed types look like. I’ve added some comments to explain what’s going on.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>As we can see, this is wrapping some perfectly reasonable raycast function in ungodly slow craziness. That internal <code>intersect_ray</code> is the function that should be in the API!</p><p>This C++ code allocates an untyped dictionary on the unmanaged heap. If we dig down into this dictionary, we find a hashmap as expected. It performs six hashmap lookups to initialize this dictionary (some of them may even do additional allocations, but I haven’t dug that deep). But wait, this is an untyped dictionary. How does that work? Well the internal hashmap maps <code>Variant</code> to <code>Variant</code>.</p><p>Sigh. What’s a <code>Variant</code>? Well the implementation is <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/variant/variant.cpp">quite complicated</a>, but in simple terms it’s a big tagged union type encompassing all possible types the dictionary can hold. We can think of it as being the dynamic untyped type. What we care about is its size, which is 20 bytes.</p><p>Okay, so each of those “fields” we’ve written into the dictionary is now 20 bytes large. Oh, and so are the keys. Those 8 byte <code>Vector2</code> values? 20 bytes each now. That <code>int</code>? 20 bytes. You get the picture.</p><p>If we sum the sizes of the fields in <code>RayResult</code>, we’re looking at 44 bytes (assuming 8 byte pointers). If we sum the sizes of the <code>Variant</code> keys and values of the dictionary, that’s 2 * 6 * 20 = 240 bytes! But wait, it’s a hashmap. Hashmaps don’t store their data compactly, so the true size of that dictionary on the heap is at least 6x larger than the data we want to return, probably much more.</p><p>Okay, let’s go back to C# and see what happens when we return this thing.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

If we look carefully we can see that the structure is pretty much the same as our first <code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormal</code> C# function. It gets the world, gets the state, builds the parameters, calls <code>intersect_ray</code> to do the actual work, then writes the result out to the properties.</p><p>But look! No heap allocations, no <code>Dictionary</code>, and no <code>Variant</code>. This is more like it! We can predict that this will be a lot faster.</p><h3 id="timing-it"><span>Timing it</span><a href="#timing-it"><i></i></a></h3><p>Okay, I’ve made a lot of allusions to all of this overhead being dramatically problematic and we can easily see that it should be, but let’s put some actual numbers to this with benchmarks.</p><p>As we’ve seen above, <code>RayCast2D.ForceRaycastUpdate()</code> is pretty close to a minimalist call to the physics engine’s <code>intersect_ray</code>, so we can use this as a baseline. Remember that even this has some overhead from the pointer chasing function call. I’ve also benchmarked each of the versions of the code we’ve discussed. Each benchmark runs 10,000 iterations of the function under test, with warmup and outlier filtering. I disabled GC collection during the tests. I like to run my game benchmarks on weaker hardware so you may get better results if you repro, but it’s the relative numbers that we care about.</p><p>Our setup is a simple scene containing a single circle collider that our ray always hits. We’re interested in measuring binding overhead, not the performance of the physics engine itself. We’re dealing with timings for individual rays measured in nanoseconds, so these numbers may look inconsequentially small. To better illustrate their significance, I also report “calls per frame” giving the number of times the functions could be called in in a single frame at 60fps and 120fps if the game did nothing but trivial raycasts.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Time (μs)</th><th>Baseline multiple</th><th>Per frame (60fps)</th><th>Per frame (120fps)</th><th>GC alloc (bytes)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>ForceRaycastUpdate</code> (raw engine speed, not useful)</td><td>0.49</td><td>1.00</td><td>34,000</td><td>17,000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormalWithNode</code></td><td>0.97</td><td>1.98</td><td>17,200</td><td>8,600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><code>CachingRayCaster.GetDistanceAndNormal</code></td><td>7.71</td><td>15.73</td><td>2,200</td><td>1,100</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td><code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormal</code></td><td>24.23</td><td>49.45</td><td>688</td><td>344</td><td>728</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Those are some significant differences!</p><p>We might expect that the fastest way to do a raycast in a reasonable engine/API is to use the function exposed for doing exactly that, <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/ray-casting.html#raycast-query">which is taught as the canonical way in the documentation</a>. As we can see, if we do that, the binding/API overhead makes this 50X slower than the raw physics engine speed. Ouch!</p><p>Using that same API but being sensible (if awkward) about caching, we can get that down to only 16X overhead. This is better, but still awful.</p><p>If our aim here is to get practical performance, we have to sidestep the proper/canonical/advertised API completely, and instead clunkily manipulate scene objects to exploit them to do our query for us. In a sensible world moving objects around in the scene and asking them to do raycasts for us would be slower than calling the raw physics API, but in fact it’s 8X faster.</p><p>Even the node approach is 2X slower than the raw speed of the engine (which we’re actually underestimating). This means that half of the time in that function is being spent on setting two properties and reading three properties. The binding overhead is large enough that five property accesses takes as long as a raycast. Let that sink in. <em>Let’s not even think about the fact that in the real world we may well want to set and read even more properties, such as setting the layer mask and reading the hit collider</em>.</p><p>At the lower end, those numbers are actually very limiting. My current project needs more than 344 raycasts per frame, and of course it does a lot more than just raycasting. This test is a trivial scene with a single collider, if we were making the raycast do actual work in a more complex scene these numbers would be even lower! The documentation’s standard way of doing raycasts would grind my whole game to a halt.</p><p>We also can’t forget about the garbage creating allocations that happen in C#. I usually write games with a zero garbage per frame policy.</p><p><em>Just for fun, I also benchmarked Unity. It does a full useful raycast, with parameter setting and result retrieval, in about 0.52μs. Before Godot’s binding overhead, the core physics engines have comparable speed.</em></p><h2 id="have-i-cherrypicked"><span>Have I cherrypicked?</span><a href="#have-i-cherrypicked"><i></i></a></h2><p>When I posted the reddit thread, a number of people said that the physics API is uniquely bad and that it isn’t representative of the whole engine. I certainly didn’t intentionally cherrypick it - it just so happens that raycasting was the very first thing I attempted when checking out Godot. However, perhaps I’m being a little unfair, so let’s examine that.</p><p>If I had wanted to cherrypick a worse method, I wouldn’t have had to look far. Right next to <code>IntersectRay</code> are <code>IntersectPoint</code> and <code>IntersectShape</code>, both of which share all of the same problems as <code>IntersectRay</code> with the additional craziness that they can have multiple results, so they return a heap allocated managed <code>Godot.Collections.Array&lt;Dictionary&gt;</code>! Oh by the way, that <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code> is actually a typed wrapper around <code>Godot.Collections.Array</code>, so every 8 byte reference to a dictionary is actually stored as a 20 byte <code>Variant</code>. Clearly I haven’t picked the very worst method in the API!</p><p>If we scan the whole Godot API (via C# reflection) we luckily find that there aren’t that many things which return <code>Dictionary</code>. There’s an eclectic list including the <code>AnimationNode._GetChildNodes</code> method, the <code>Bitmap.Data</code> property, the <code>Curve2D._Data</code> property (and 3D), some things in <code>GLTFSkin</code>, some <code>TextServer</code> stuff, some <code>NavigationAgent2D</code> pieces, etc. None of those are great places to have slow heap allocated dictionaries, but none of them are as bad as the physics API.</p><p>However, in my experience, very few engine APIs get as much use as physics. If I look at the engine API calls in my gameplay code, they’re probably 80% physics and transforms.</p><p>Let’s also remember that <code>Dictionary</code> is only part of the problem. If we look a little wider for things returning <code>Godot.Collections.Array&lt;T&gt;</code> (remember: heap allocated, contents as <code>Variant</code>) we find lots from physics, mesh &amp; geometry manipulation, navigation, tilemaps, rendering, and more.</p><p>Physics may be a particularly bad (but essential) area of the API, but the heap allocated type problems, as well as the general slowness of the pointer chasing, are deeply rooted throughout.</p><h2 id="so-why-are-we-waiting-for-godot"><span>So why are we waiting for Godot?</span><a href="#so-why-are-we-waiting-for-godot"><i></i></a></h2><p>Godot’s primary scripting language is GDScript, a dynamically typed interpreted language where almost all non primitives are heap allocated, i.e. it doesn’t have a struct analogue. That sentence should have set off a cacophony of performance alarms in your head. I’ll give you a moment for your ears to stop ringing.</p><p>If we look at how Godot’s C++ core exposes its API we’ll see something interesting.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>This one shared mechanism is used to generate the bindings for all three scripting interfaces; GDSCript, C#, and GDExtensions. <code>ClassDB</code> collects function pointers and metadata about each of the API functions, which is then piped through various code generation systems to create the bindings for each language.</p><p>This means that every API function is designed primarily to serve the limitations of GDScript. <code>IntersectRay</code> returns an untyped dynamic <code>Dictionary</code> because GDScript doesn’t have structs. Our C# and even our GDExtensions C++ code has to pay the catastrophic price for that.</p><p>This way of handling binding via function pointers also leads to significant overhead, as we’ve seen from simple property accesses being slow. Remember, each call first does a memory lookup to find the function pointer it wants to call, then it does another lookup to find the function pointer of a secondary function which is actually responsible for calling the function, then it calls the secondary function passing it the pointer to the primary function. All along that journey there’s extra validation code, branching, and type conversions. C# (and obviously C++) has a fast mechanism for calling into native code via P/Invoke, but Godot simply doesn’t use it.</p><p><strong>Godot has made a philosophical decision to be slow.</strong> The only practical way to interact with the engine is via this binding layer, and its core design prevents it from ever being fast. No amount of optimising the implementation of <code>Dictionary</code> or speeding up the physics engine is going to get around the fact we’re passing large heap allocated values around when we should be dealing with tiny structs. While C# and GDScript APIs remain synchronised, this will always hold the engine back.</p><h2 id="okay-lets-fix-it-then"><span>Okay, let’s fix it then!</span><a href="#okay-lets-fix-it-then"><i></i></a></h2><h3 id="what-can-we-do-without-deviating-from-the-existing-binding-layer"><span>What can we do without deviating from the existing binding layer?</span><a href="#what-can-we-do-without-deviating-from-the-existing-binding-layer"><i></i></a></h3><p>If we assume that we still need to keep all of our APIs GDScript compatible, there are a few areas where we can probably improve things, although it won’t be pretty. Let’s go back to our <code>IntsersectRay</code> example.</p><ul><li><code>GetWorld2D().DirectStateSpace</code> could be compressed to one call instead of two by introducing <code>GetWorld2DStateSpace()</code>.</li><li>The <code>PhysicsRayQueryParameters2D</code> issues could be removed by adding an overload which takes all of the fields as parameters. This would bring us roughly inline with the <code>CachedRayCaster</code> performance (16X baseline) without having to do caching.</li><li>The <code>Dictionary</code> allocation could be removed by allowing us to pass in a cached/pooled dictionary to write into. This is ugly and clumsy compared to a struct, but it would remove the allocation.</li><li>The dictionary lookup process is still ridiculously slow. We might be able to improve on that by instead returning a class with the expected properties. The allocation here could be eliminated with the cached/pooled approach the same way it could with <code>Dictionary</code>.</li></ul><p>These options aren’t pretty or ergonomic for the user, but if we’re in the business of doing ugly patches to get things running, they would probably work. This would fix the allocations but we’d still probably only be about 4X the baseline because of all of the pointer chasing across the boundary and managing of cached values.</p><p>It may also be possible to improve the generated code for all of the pointer chasing shenanigans. I haven’t studied this in detail yet, but if there are wins to find there then they’d apply to the whole API across the board, which would be cool! We could probably at least get away with removing the validation and the <code>try</code> <code>finally</code> in release builds.</p><h3 id="what-if-were-allowed-to-add-additional-apis-for-c-and-gdextensions-which-arent-gdscript-compatible"><span>What if we’re allowed to add additional APIs for C# and GDExtensions which aren’t GDScript compatible?</span><a href="#what-if-were-allowed-to-add-additional-apis-for-c-and-gdextensions-which-arent-gdscript-compatible"><i></i></a></h3><p>Now we’re talking! If we open up this possibility* then in theory we could augment the <code>ClassDB</code> bindings with better ones that deal directly in structs and go through the proper P/Invoke mechanisms. This is the path to viable performance.</p><p>Unfortunately, duplicating the entire API with better versions like this would create quite a mess. There might be ways through this by marking things <code>[Deprecated]</code> and trying to guide the user in the right direction, but issues such as naming clashes would get ugly.</p><p>* Maybe this is already possible, but I haven’t found it yet. Let me know!</p><h3 id="what-if-we-tear-it-all-down-and-start-again"><span>What if we tear it all down and start again?</span><a href="#what-if-we-tear-it-all-down-and-start-again"><i></i></a></h3><p>This option obviously has a lot of short term pain. Godot 4.0 has only recently happened, and now I’m talking about a backcompat breaking complete API redux like a Godot 5.0. However, if I’m honest with myself, I see this as the only viable path to the engine being in a good place in three years time. Mixing fast and slow APIs as discussed above would leave us with headaches for decades - a trap I expect the engine will probably fall into.</p><p><del>In my opinion, if Godot were to go down this route, GDScript should probably be dropped entirely. I don’t really see the point of it when C# exists, and supporting it causes so much hassle. I’m clearly completely at odds with the lead Godot devs and the project philosophy on this point, so I have no expectation that this will happen. Who knows though - Unity eventually dropped UnityScript for full C#, maybe Godot will one day take the same step. Foreshadowing?</del></p><p>Edit: I’m taking the above out for now. I don’t personally care about GDScript, but other people do and I don’t want to take it away from them. I have no objection to C# and GDScript sitting beside each other with different APIs each optimised for the respective language’s needs.</p><h2 id="was-the-title-of-this-article-melodramatic-clickbait"><span>Was the title of this article melodramatic clickbait?</span><a href="#was-the-title-of-this-article-melodramatic-clickbait"><i></i></a></h2><p>Maybe a little. Not a lot.</p><p>There will be people who were making games in Unity who can make those same games in Godot without these issues mattering too much. Godot may be able to capture the lower end of Unity’s market. However, Unity’s recent focus on performance is a good indicator that there’s demand for it. I know that I certainly care about it. Godot’s performance is not just worse than Unity’s, it’s dramatically and systematically worse.</p><p>In some projects 95% of the CPU load is in an algorithm which never touches the engine APIs. In that case, none of this matters. (The GC always matters, but we can use GDExtensions to avoid that.) For many others, good programmatic interaction with physics/collisions and manually modifying the properties of large numbers of objects are essential to the project.</p><p>For many others, it’s important to know that they can do these things if they need to. Maybe you get two years into your project thinking it will barely need raycasts at all, then you make a late game decision to add some custom CPU particles that need to be able to check collisions. It’s a small aesthetic change, but suddenly you need an engine API and you’re in trouble. There’s a lot of talk right now about the importance of being able to trust that your engine will have your back in the future. Unity has that problem with their scummy business practices, Godot has that problem with performance.</p><p>If Godot wants to be able to capture the general Unity market (I don’t actually know that it does want that) it will need to make some rapid and fundamental changes. Many of the things discussed in this article will simply not be acceptable to Unity devs.</p><h2 id="discussion"><span>Discussion</span><a href="#discussion"><i></i></a></h2><p>I <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/16lti15/godot_is_not_the_new_unity_the_anatomy_of_a_godot/">posted this article on the r/Godot subreddit</a> and there’s quite an active discussion there.

<h3>from the <i>abusing-the-orange-book,-green-with-greed</i> dept</h3>

<p>For many, many years we’ve detailed how big pharma companies, who only care about the monopoly rents they can receive on medicine while under patent, have concocted <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/05/20/big-pharma-companies-accused-conspiring-to-inflate-prices-over-100-generic-drugs-up-to-1000/">all sorts</a> of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2009/12/07/pay-for-delay-agreements-again-show-how-pharma-abuses-patent-law-to-harm-us-all/">scams</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/24/why-are-drug-prices-so-high-because-asshole-mckinsey-consultants-figure-out-ways-to-re-patent-same-drugs-over-over/">schemes</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/10/thanks-to-evergreening-and-legal-threats-abbvie-has-earned-114-billion-since-2016-from-a-drug-whose-key-patent-expired-back-then/">avoid</a> having to compete with generic versions, even after their patents have expired (or been invalidated). But one of their older tricks is apparently popular yet again, though the FTC is now warning pharma that it <em>might</em> finally start cracking down.</p>
<p>If it does, it will just be reinforcing the kinds of actions the FTC used to bring. Twenty years ago, the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/0110046-bristol-myers-squibb-company-matter">FTC went after Bristol Meyer Squibb</a> for false listings in the Orange Book. The Orange Book, managed by the FDA, is where pharma companies list the FDA-approved drugs they have under patent, which alerts generic drug companies basically not to make generic versions of those drugs.</p>
<p>But, of course, this creates a very tempting scenario: if pharma can get drugs not actually under patent into the Orange Book, they effectively save themselves from generic competition, and they get to profit massively (at the expense of the public and their need for affordable medicine).</p>
<p>However, despite enforcement against such abuse years ago, it seems that the FTC and the FDA have kinda let these things slip over the past few years. And Big Pharma has really taken advantage of that. Thankfully, it looks like the FTC is finally interested in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-issues-policy-statement-brand-pharmaceutical-manufacturers-improper-listing-patents-food-drug">cracking down on this practice again</a>. In <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p239900orangebookpolicystatement092023.pdf">a new policy statement</a>, it warns pharma companies that it’s looking into the abuse of the Orange Book and sham patent inclusions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Brand drug manufacturers are responsible for ensuring their patents are properly listed. Yet certain manufacturers have submitted patents for listing in the Orange Book that claim neither the reference listed drug nor a method of using it. When brand drug manufacturers abuse the regulatory processes set up by Congress to promote generic drug competition, the result may be to increase the cost of and reduce access to prescription drugs.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this policy statement is to put market participants on notice that the FTC intends to scrutinize improper Orange Book listings to determine whether these constitute unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this raises some questions, including why do we make the pharma companies themselves the party responsible for making sure their patents are “properly” listed. Why don’t we have at least some process in place for these listings to be reviewed, whether when they’re submitted to the Orange Book or even if another party (such as the generic drug manufacturers) contest an Orange Book listing.</p>
<p>It seems the dumbest possible system is to assume that the Big Pharma companies will be honest in their Orange Book listings.</p>
<p>And, even though the FTC is now putting these companies “on notice,” the fact that the FTC has brought these cases in the past seems like it should be “notice” enough. Instead, it sounds like the FTC let enough pharma companies get away with this for long enough that the big pharma firms felt cleared to abuse the system this way and to delay competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The one thing I find interesting in this statement, is that they note that improperly listing things in the Orange Book may “constitute illegal monopolization.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The improper listing of patents in the Orange Book may also constitute illegal monopolization. Monopolization requires proof of “the willful acquisition or maintenance of [monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.” This requires proof that “the defendant has engaged in improper conduct that has or is likely to have the effect of controlling prices or excluding competition,” and courts have recognized that improperly listing patents in the Orange Book may constitute an “improper means” of competition. Accordingly, improperly listing patents in the Orange Book may also be worthy of enforcement scrutiny from government and private enforcers under a monopolization theory. Additionally, the FTC may also scrutinize a firm’s history of improperly listing patents during merger review</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems exactly correct, but notable in that very few people seem to recognize that (1) patents are government granted monopolies, and thus (2) an abuse of the patent system to get a patent or patent-like protections you don’t deserve are therefore an <em>illegal</em> monopoly seems like an important point. I would hope that this could get expanded to other abuses of patent and copyright law as well.</p>
<p>Still, given that we’ve been facing this and multiple other schemes from Big Pharma to delay generics for decades, I’m not sure anything is really going to change just yet, but at least the FTC is waking up (again?) to this issue. Now let’s see if it actually starts bringing cases…</p>

            <guid>37560787</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:24:32 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/apple-tv/">https://tailscale.com/blog/apple-tv/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37560787">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Today we’re expanding the list of devices that can run Tailscale, bringing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037?platform=appleTV">secure remote networking to the Apple TV</a>. The newly released tvOS 17 offers support for VPNs, and we’re proud to say Tailscale is among the first to use this new feature. You can now <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1280/appletv/">add your Apple TV directly to your tailnet</a>, unlocking three powerful new use cases that we’re excited to share.</p>

    
    

<figure>
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/assets/84113/1695058417-3840x2160bb.png?auto=format" alt="A screenshot of the Tailscale app for Apple TV in light mode." width="3840" height="2160">
    
</figure>

<p>First up, if you already have anything like a “media server” in your life, the benefits of integrating your Apple TV into the same Tailscale network are large. Lots of people already use Tailscale with Plex or Jellyfin servers, <a href="https://perfectmediaserver.com/">homelab set-ups</a>, and <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1074/connect-to-your-nas/">NAS devices</a> to securely share their collections and stream from them while on the go. Today’s release makes it that much simpler to do so right on your TV.</p>
<p>With up to three users available <a href="https://tailscale.com/pricing/">on our Free plan</a>, you’ve got tools to make a media drive available to other trusted people in your life. You can share a collection of family photos and home videos into a faraway relative’s tailnet, without worrying about locking down the server for public internet access.</p>
<p>But even if you don’t have a media server to connect to, you can use Tailscale’s Apple TV app to select another device in your tailnet, like a PC, a Raspberry Pi, or even an Android phone, to use as an exit node. This will route all your Apple TV’s traffic through that connection, providing an extra layer of privacy from the local network where you’re using the Apple TV and making your traffic appear to originate from the machine of your choice.</p>
<p>Compare that to a “traditional” VPN option, where your traffic is routed through a commercial data center (which itself may be blocked by sites and services) and where you must trust the VPN provider not to spy on or tamper with your traffic. With a Tailscale exit node, you’re in control and you get the internet connection you’re used to. This new feature could come in handy if you’re traveling with your Apple TV and want to access the same geo-restricted channels you can see from home.</p>
<p>Finally, the new Tailscale client allows an Apple TV to be an exit node itself for other machines in your tailnet. This one might require a little more explaining; after all, not a lot of Apple TV apps advertise features that are most useful when you’re away from your Apple TV.</p>
<p>But look at it this way: your Apple TV device is a capable little computer, and it stays connected to your tailnet even when it’s not in active use. Download and configure Tailscale now and you can securely route any of your other devices’ traffic through your Apple TV&nbsp; — and by extension, through your home internet connection — even when you’re on the other side of the planet. Whether you want another layer of security and privacy on sketchy Wi-Fi networks or just want to connect back through your personal internet connection when you’re on the road, you’re set with the Apple TV as an exit node.</p>
<p>At Tailscale, we’re the kind of nerds who have home server closets and who will stock up on Raspberry Pis just because they’re available again. Our favorite thing about bringing Tailscale to tvOS is you don’t have to be that kind of nerd to be able to tap into the power of Tailscale in your home.</p>
<p>If you’ve got an Apple TV running the new tvOS 17, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037?platform=appleTV">download the Tailscale app</a> today!</p>

<p>Hello Windows Insiders,</p>
<p>Today we are beginning to roll out an update for the Paint app to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels (version 11.2308.18.0 or higher). With this update, we are introducing support for layers and transparency!</p>
<p>You can now add, remove, and manage layers on the canvas to create richer and more complex digital art. With layers, you can stack shapes, text, and other image elements on top of each other. To get started, click on the new Layers button in the toolbar, which will open a panel on the side of the canvas. This is where you can add new layers to the canvas. Try changing the order of layers in this panel to see how the order of stacked image elements on the canvas changes. You can also show or hide and duplicate individual layers or merge layers together.</p>
<figure id="attachment_176579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176579"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2023/09/Paint_Layers.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2023/09/Paint_Layers-1024x642.png" alt="Paint composition of a cat utilizing multiple layers." width="1024" height="642"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176579">Paint composition of a cat utilizing multiple layers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We are adding support for transparency as well, including the ability to open and save transparent PNGs! When working with a single layer, you will notice a checkerboard pattern on the canvas indicating the portions of the image that are transparent. Erasing any content from the canvas now truly erases the content instead of painting the area white. When working with multiple layers, if you erase content on one layer, you will reveal the content in layers underneath.</p>
<figure id="attachment_176580" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176580"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2023/09/Paint_BGLayers.gif"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2023/09/Paint_BGLayers.gif" alt="Short animation showing the background getting removed in Paint." width="2063" height="1403"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176580">Short animation showing the background getting removed in Paint.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you combine layers, transparency, and other tools in Paint, you can create exciting new images and artwork! For example, when combined with the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/09/07/background-removal-in-paint-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">new background removal feature</a>, you can quickly create interesting layered compositions.</p>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK: Please file feedback in&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://aka.ms/paintfeedback"><strong>Feedback Hub (WIN + F)&nbsp;under Apps &gt; Paint</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><em>[PLEASE NOTE: We are beginning to roll these experiences out, so they may not be available to all Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels just yet as we plan to monitor feedback and see how it lands before pushing it out to everyone.]</em></p>
<p>We love getting feedback from the community and are looking forward to your feedback on these updates!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Dave Grochocki, Principal Product Manager Lead – Windows Inbox Apps</p>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>AirDrop makes it easier than ever to share with friends, family, and colleagues. NameDrop, a new AirDrop feature, lets users exchange contact information, including their Contact Poster, simply by bringing their iPhone devices together. With the same gesture, users can also share content or start SharePlay to listen to music, watch a movie, or play a game while in close proximity. And later this year, AirDrop will add the ability to continue transfers over the internet when a user steps out of AirDrop range.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Autocorrect receives a comprehensive update with a new transformer language model, a state-of-the-art on-device machine learning language model for word prediction —&nbsp;improving the experience and accuracy for users every time they type. Sentence-level autocorrections can fix more types of grammatical mistakes, and the refreshed design better supports typing by temporarily underlining corrected words and allowing users to revert back with just a tap. Inline predictive text helps quickly finish sentences, while Dictation’s new speech recognition model brings improved accuracy.&nbsp;

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Journal is a new iPhone app that helps users reflect on everyday moments and special events in their lives. To help inspire a user’s journal entry, personalized suggestions can be intelligently curated from a user’s recent activity, such as photos, people, places, workouts, and more, and scheduled notifications can help build a journaling habit. With the ability to lock the app, the use of on-device processing, and end-to-end encryption, Journal is built to protect a user’s privacy and ensure no one — including Apple — can access a user’s entries. With the new Journaling Suggestions API, developers will be able to add journaling suggestions to their apps. The Journal app and Journaling Suggestions API will be available in a software update later this year.

                 <div><ul>
<li>Profiles in <strong>Safari</strong> keep browsing — such as history, cookies, extensions, Tab Groups, and Favorites — separate for topics like work and personal. Private Browsing now locks when not in use and adds greater protection, both from trackers as a user browses, and from people who might have access to a user’s device.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li>For easier and more secure <strong>password and passkeys </strong>sharing, users can share passwords with a group of trusted contacts. Since sharing is through iCloud Keychain, it is end-to-end encrypted.</li>

                 <div><ul>
<li>The <strong>Health</strong> app offers new mental health features. Users can log their daily moods and momentary emotions; see what might be contributing to their state of mind; and easily access depression and anxiety assessments often used in clinics, plus resources available in their region. Additionally, increasing the distance the device is viewed from can help children lower their risk of myopia and gives adult users the opportunity to reduce digital eyestrain. Screen Distance in <strong>Screen Time</strong> uses the TrueDepth camera to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches from their face for an extended period of time.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<li><strong>Apple Music</strong> adds SharePlay support in the car, making it possible for all passengers to easily control the music right from their own devices, even if they don’t have an Apple Music subscription. Crossfade smoothly transitions between songs, and later this year, users will be able to collaborate on playlists in Apple Music, making listening to music with friends easier than ever before.</li>

<li>The <strong>Home</strong> app adds the ability for users to view up to 30 days of activity history across door locks, garage doors, alarm systems, and contact sensors.<sup>1 </sup>Additionally, two popular HomeKit lock features — tap to unlock and PIN codes — will become available for Matter-compatible locks, providing even more ways to connect the home.<sup>2</sup> Grid Forecast is a new tool in the Home app that shows when a customer’s electrical grid has cleaner energy sources available, so they can plan when to charge devices or run appliances.<sup>3</sup></li>

<li><strong>Maps</strong> adds offline maps, so users can download a specific area and access turn-by-turn navigation, see their estimated time of arrival, find places in Maps, and more while offline. Maps also makes it easier than ever to discover thousands of trails in parks across the United States, and supports electric vehicle drivers with real-time charging availability information.</li>

<li><strong>Privacy</strong> updates include Communication Safety expanding beyond Messages to help keep kids safe when sending and receiving content via AirDrop, Contact Posters, a FaceTime message, and when using the Photos picker to choose content to send. It also expands to cover video content in addition to still images. A new feature, Sensitive Content Warning, helps adult users avoid seeing unwanted nude images and videos. As with Communication Safety, all image and video processing for Sensitive Content Warning occurs on-device, so Apple does not get access to the content.</li>

<h2>The joys of maintenance programming</h2>
<p>26 Feb 2011</p>

<div>
  <p>In the old days when I started programming, green programmers trying to build their skills and get experience started out doing maintenance programming. Only the old hands got to write new code. The newbies cut their teeth debugging and fixing musty old code that still worked for the business. I’ve done my share of new development, but today I do maintenance programming almost exclusively. After working on way too many failed ground-up “green fields” projects I prefer to debug, fix, and enhance production software. I like working with real users rather than making up “use cases.” I prefer building confidence and making my clients happy with my work rather than arguing with them about features, specs, budget, and schedule. I like having a prioritized list of well-defined tasks that refer to existing code rather than trying to blue-sky specifications. I like charging by the hour instead of by the project, and not having clients balk at my rate.</p>

<p>I mainly work with web applications now, and I specialize in database-backed web sites. I rarely take on new development projects, but I frequently get called to salvage projects that went bad. Clients fire their developers (and vice-versa) leaving production code orphaned. Developers put their energy into new development and don’t respond to bugs or enhancement requests from old clients. I charge by the hour and I get the job because I don’t tell clients they need to throw everything away and start from scratch — something they get from other consultants.</p>

<p>Software often stays in use longer than anyone expected when it was written — until recently I supported a law office billing system that was written in 1986 using OMNIS 3 and wouldn’t run on any Macintosh newer than an SE/30. Clients who depend on legacy systems will pay plenty to keep those systems running, because they can’t risk their business on new software, and they can’t afford to fund new software development and the subsequent data migration and training. There’s a rich vein of maintenance work out there that most programmers turn up their noses at, preferring ground-up development projects that neither they nor their client are well-suited for.</p>

<h3 id="some-of-the-benefits-of-maintenance-programming">Some of the benefits of maintenance programming:</h3>

<h4 id="youll-learn-how-to-debug">You’ll learn how to debug</h4>
<p>Debugging someone else’s code requires more effort and rigor than debugging your own. You have to track down problems step by step; you can’t assume you know what’s wrong and jump to a quick fix. Reading and debugging foreign code makes you think about how the code works (or doesn’t) rather than what you think it should do.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-how-to-program-better">You’ll learn how to program better</h4>
<p>You can debug and extend good code easier than bad code, so you will learn how to tell them apart. You will have to reason about the code and deduce the original programmer’s intent. Skilled programmers recognize what makes good code good, and what makes bad code bad, and working with lots of code will impart that skill. You will develop a knack for finding your way around an unfamiliar code base and recognizing bad code smells.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-how-to-optimize">You’ll learn how to optimize</h4>
<p>The original programmers already made the premature optimizations, so you get to identify and fix real efficiency problems and performance bottlenecks. Ground-up development project teams often spend a lot of time and energy worrying about performance issues that may never materialize. Working systems have real, identifiable performance problems. Finding and fixing performance problems can be fun, and it’s a great skill. Clients always notice and appreciate you making their application more efficient.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-new-to-you-skills-and-tools">You’ll learn new (to you) skills and tools</h4>
<p>You may not get to work with the language du jour, but you will get to learn languages, libraries, tools, and production environments you probably wouldn’t learn otherwise. You’ll find a lot more work involving common, mainstream business tools. Ground-up development projects often bog down just deciding which language and tools to use. You won’t have to make those decisions, sell them to your client, or get blamed for them. You’ll spend time learning some obscure and proprietary tools and languages, but those can pay off too. Larger companies with their own IT departments do their own maintenance work, but often hire contractors with specialized knowledge and experience.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-to-value-data-and-databases">You’ll learn to value data and databases</h4>
<p>Applications still typically follow the input -&gt; process -&gt; output model from old data processing textbooks. You have to understand the data and how it moves through a system before the code makes sense. Almost all applications use a database of some kind, usually a relational database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). A skilled programmer knows relational concepts and how to navigate a production database. Not understanding databases cripples programmers and leads them to write lots of bad code to do what the DBMS should handle. I frequently refactor pages of slow, buggy application code away by replacing it with SQL.</p>

<h4 id="clients-will-appreciate-everything-you-do">Clients will appreciate everything you do</h4>
<p>Every bug you fix and enhancement you make improves an application people already use. Real users will notice the changes and give immediate feedback. When you develop new software from the ground up every spec change, delay, and additional expense can cause conflict with your client. When you address actual problems everything you deliver makes your client happy.</p>

<h4 id="you-will-have-better-specs-and-clear-constraints">You will have better specs and clear constraints</h4>
<p>Fixes and enhancements are smaller and better-defined tasks than ground-up development, and the existing code and environment constrains your choices. You have to focus on solving a real problem. You and your client can agree on the tasks with less chance of misunderstanding. With new clients I build the relationship by asking them to list just the top five pains they have with their software, then I offer to fix those, and promise not to charge if I can’t.</p>

<h4 id="easier-to-walk-away-from-bad-clients">Easier to walk away from bad clients</h4>
<p>We all get involved with clients we don’t want to work with. It’s a lot harder to get out of the relationship if you have a contract for a big development project, time and money invested, and the big expectations clients always have for new systems. Maintenance work is shorter-term and the tasks are smaller, so you have more opportunities to terminate the relationship without breaking a contract or either side losing money.</p>

<h4 id="agile-by-default">Agile by default</h4>
<p>Fixing bugs and making important enhancements let you work in agile mode without having to sell a methodology to your client. They will want things fixed right away, so you can make incremental releases, collaborate with real users and get immediate feedback, and work with a few bite-size tasks with a defined finish line.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-about-business">You’ll learn about business</h4>
<p>By definition, production software addresses at least some real business need. Learning how it does, and does not, work for the business, and working with real stakeholders familiar with the software forces you to learn something about the business. Knowing something about business applications will boost your career more than learning a new programming language.</p>

<h4 id="youll-learn-people-skills">You’ll learn people skills</h4>
<p>Programmers in ground-up development mainly work with each other. New systems don’t have real users; instead you get use cases and management stakeholders. Maintenance programmers get to work with real users, often the people on the floor who work directly with the application and experience the bugs and where the software doesn’t match the reality of their job. Learning to listen to and talk to people who don’t have the same assumptions and culture of programmers broadens your perspective and gets you out of the programmer shell.</p>

<h4 id="youll-get-follow-on-business-and-referrals">You’ll get follow-on business and referrals</h4>
<p>Who do you think gets more repeat business and referrals: a great car salesperson, or a great mechanic? People need their software fixed and enhanced more often than they need a new system developed. And your satisfied clients will send referrals your way because they have friends and colleagues who have broken software systems too.</p>

<h4 id="your-work-wont-be-off-shored">Your work won’t be off-shored</h4>
<p>But you may end up maintaining the results of your client’s off-shoring experiments.</p>



<h4 id="wc-27-february-2011-at-237-am">WC, 27 February 2011 at 2:37 am</h4>
<p>Good post! I chose the ‘bugfix’ position at my previous job because I really liked it. (Nobody else wanted it, though.) There’s a thrill in hunting down a bug and fixing it, and proving it was fixed. And the code is always better for it afterwards.</p>

<p>BTW: The input element for ’email’ is named ‘liame’ so non-programmers can’t submit comments.</p>

<h4 id="joe-lee-28-february-2011-at-658-am">joe Lee, 28 February 2011 at 6:58 am</h4>
<p>Thanks for the post! It’s refreshing to see a varied view point to the typical attitude towards maintenance programming.</p>

<p>I completely agree with many of the points above, especially the point of “You’ll learn to value data and databases”, I think “backend” developers who say ” I rather not write sql” rather surprising since that’s what most data interactions with a data store boil down to!</p>

<p>I also think you can potentially learn how to program better as you may be expose to a better way of doing things, but at the same time you can be exposed to a bad way and pick up the same bad habit.</p>

<h4 id="manu-28-february-2011-at-625-pm">Manu, 28 February 2011 at 6:25 pm</h4>
<p>I totally agree with all the points you have mentioned. If you are in consulting maintenance must be very lucrative. I would also say that a lot of maintenance work does get outsourced (for example development of the older releases of a product would get outsourced so the in-house team can focus on new releases). Many programmers might not consider maintenance as glamorous but it has several useful advantages mentioned in this post.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning that one should try to do a mix of maintenance and new development. Such a profile would be a killer profile. Maintenance will teach you how to write good code but new development will help you put into practice what you learned. Otherwise, that just remains good theoretical knowledge in your mind. I have been doing more maintenance work in a product development company (I sure do not regret it) and started looking for jobs at startups or young companies with small development teams. Such companies prefer that you have done more new development.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In recent years, the AI field has made tremendous progress in developing AI systems that can learn from massive amounts of carefully labeled data. This paradigm of supervised learning has a proven track record for training specialist models that perform extremely well on the task they were trained to do. Unfortunately, there’s a limit to how far the field of AI can go with supervised learning alone. </p><p>Supervised learning is a bottleneck for building more intelligent generalist models that can do multiple tasks and acquire new skills without massive amounts of labeled data. Practically speaking, it’s impossible to label everything in the world. There are also some tasks for which there’s simply not enough labeled data, such as training translation systems for low-resource languages. If AI systems can glean a deeper, more nuanced understanding of reality beyond what’s specified in the training data set, they’ll be more useful and ultimately bring AI closer to human-level intelligence. </p><p>As babies, we learn how the world works largely by observation. We form generalized predictive models about objects in the world by learning concepts such as object permanence and gravity. Later in life, we observe the world, act on it, observe again, and build hypotheses to explain how our actions change our environment by trial and error. </p><p>A working hypothesis is that generalized knowledge about the world, or common sense, forms the bulk of biological intelligence in both humans and animals. This common sense ability is taken for granted in humans and animals, but has remained an open challenge in AI research since its inception. In a way, common sense is the dark matter of artificial intelligence. </p><p>Common sense helps people learn new skills without requiring massive amounts of teaching for every single task. For example, if we show just a few drawings of cows to small children, they’ll eventually be able to recognize any cow they see. By contrast, AI systems trained with supervised learning require many examples of cow images and might still fail to classify cows in unusual situations, such as lying on a beach. How is it that humans can learn to drive a car in about 20 hours of practice with very little supervision, while fully autonomous driving still eludes our best AI systems trained with thousands of hours of data from human drivers? The short answer is that humans rely on their previously acquired background knowledge of how the world works. </p><p>How do we get machines to do the same?</p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/152694956_207655794383548_8489544025025665441_n.png?_nc_cat=102&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=pJx8xa60PiAAX_vHXjr&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfCeqd2C7vY9bmcrsAZbmv1VOmT9vBzEgzM0YkvhOjoWdA&amp;oe=65236631" alt=""></p><p>We believe that self-supervised learning (SSL) is one of the most promising ways to build such background knowledge and approximate a form of common sense in AI systems.</p><p>Self-supervised learning enables AI systems to learn from orders of magnitude more data, which is important to recognize and understand patterns of more subtle, less common representations of the world.

We’re also highlighting what we believe are some of the most promising new directions of energy-based models for prediction in the presence of uncertainty, joint embedding methods and latent-variable architectures for self-supervised learning and reasoning in AI systems. </p><h2>Self-supervised learning is predictive learning</h2><p>Self-supervised learning obtains supervisory signals from the data itself, often leveraging the underlying structure in the data. The general technique of self-supervised learning is to predict any unobserved or hidden part (or property) of the input from any observed or unhidden part of the input. For example, as is common in NLP, we can hide part of a sentence and predict the hidden words from the remaining words. We can also predict past or future frames in a video (hidden data) from current ones (observed data). Since self-supervised learning uses the structure of the data itself, it can make use of a variety of supervisory signals across co-occurring modalities (e.g., video and audio) and across large data sets — all without relying on labels.</p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/148954125_461761118405979_2035914075893596810_n.png?_nc_cat=107&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=bY12gpB3nI4AX8eJSmA&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfAKi1MqcV_5HHxR2VnjbUFdATGK7G8waB5YkPBzoljjcw&amp;oe=65234BD9" alt=""></p><div><p>In self-supervised learning, the system is trained to predict hidden parts of the input (in gray) from visible parts of the input (in green).</p></div><p>As a result of the supervisory signals that inform self-supervised learning, the term “self-supervised learning” is more accepted than the previously used term “unsupervised learning.” Unsupervised learning is an ill-defined and misleading term that suggests that the learning uses no supervision at all. In fact, self-supervised learning is not unsupervised, as it uses far more feedback signals than standard supervised and reinforcement learning methods do. </p><h2>Self-supervised learning for language versus vision</h2><p>Self-supervised learning has had a particularly profound impact on NLP, allowing us to train models such as BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-R, and others on large unlabeled text data sets and then use these models for downstream tasks. These models are pretrained in a self-supervised phase and then fine-tuned for a particular task, such as classifying the topic of a text. In the self-supervised pretraining phase, the system is shown a short text (typically 1,000 words) in which some of the words have been masked or replaced. The system is trained to predict the words that were masked or replaced. In doing so, the system learns to represent the meaning of the text so that it can do a good job at filling in “correct” words, or those that make sense in the context.</p><p>Predicting missing parts of the input is one of the more standard tasks for SSL pretraining. To complete a sentence such as “The (blank) chases the (blank) in the savanna,” the system must learn that lions or cheetahs can chase antelope or wildebeests, but that cats chase mice in the kitchen, not the savanna. As a consequence of the training, the system learns to represent the meaning of words, the syntactic role of words, and the meaning of entire texts. </p><p> These techniques, however, can’t be easily extended to new domains, such as CV. Despite promising early results, SSL has not yet brought about the same improvements in computer vision that we have seen in NLP (though this will change). </p><p>The main reason is that it is considerably more difficult to represent uncertainty in the prediction for images than it is for words. When the missing word cannot be predicted exactly (is it “lion” or “cheetah”?), the system can associate a score or a probability to all possible words in the vocabulary: high score for “lion,” “cheetah,” and a few other predators, and low scores for all other words in the vocabulary. </p><p>Training models at this scale also required a model architecture that was efficient in terms of both runtime and memory, without compromising on accuracy. Fortunately, a recent innovation by FAIR in the realm of architecture design led to a new model family called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>RegNets</span></a> that perfectly fit these needs. RegNet models are ConvNets capable of scaling to billions or potentially even trillions of parameters, and can be optimized to fit different runtime and memory limitations.</p><p> But we do not know how to efficiently represent uncertainty when we predict missing frames in a video or missing patches in an image. We cannot list all possible video frames and associate a score to each of them, because there is an infinite number of them. While this problem has limited the performance improvement from SSL in vision, new techniques SSL techniques such as SwAV are starting to beat accuracy records in vision tasks. This is best demonstrated by the SEER system that uses a large convolutional network trained with billions of examples. </p><h2>Modeling the uncertainty in prediction </h2><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/148662482_469317657771087_6509708649537324681_n.png?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=pdmXmz1tvqsAX_N35vf&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfA0a3ZJ2CNDAMiPWjggJb6lBqM9bomANM7uhpwDmmjueA&amp;oe=65234489" alt=""></p><p> To better understand this challenge, we first need to understand the prediction uncertainty and the way it’s modeled in NLP compared with CV. In NLP, predicting the missing words involves computing a prediction score for every possible word in the vocabulary. While the vocabulary itself is large and predicting a missing word involves some uncertainty, it’s possible to produce a list of all the possible words in the vocabulary together with a probability estimate of the words’ appearance at that location. Typical machine learning systems do so by treating the prediction problem as a classification problem and computing scores for each outcome using a giant so-called softmax layer, which transforms raw scores into a probability distribution over words. With this technique, the uncertainty of the prediction is represented by a probability distribution over all possible outcomes, provided that there is a finite number of possible outcomes. </p><p>In CV, on the other hand, the analogous task of predicting “missing” frames in a video, missing patches in an image, or missing segment in a speech signal involves a prediction of high-dimensional continuous objects rather than discrete outcomes. There are an infinite number of possible video frames that can plausibly follow a given video clip. It is not possible to explicitly represent all the possible video frames and associate a prediction score to them. In fact, we may never have techniques to represent suitable probability distributions over high-dimensional continuous spaces, such as the set of all possible video frames. </p><p>This seems like an intractable problem.</p><h2>A unified view of self-supervised methods</h2><p>There is a way to think about SSL within the unified framework of an energy-based model (EBM). An EBM is a trainable system that, given two inputs, x and y, tells us how incompatible they are with each other. For example, x could be a short video clip, and y another proposed video clip. The machine would tell us to what extent y is a good continuation for x. To indicate the incompatibility between x and y, the machine produces a single number, called an energy. If the energy is low, x and y are deemed compatible; if it is high, they are deemed incompatible. </p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/157272588_1389905731371138_8776386318723848066_n.png?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=w6Ar2la-WJEAX9YLZv1&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfAJJyDyLHEc8uIYQsYsPpZXtApBl5SPdhZGY05wnCUODg&amp;oe=652349AE" alt=""></p><div><p>An energy-based model (EBM) measures the compatibility between an observation x and a proposed prediction y. If x and y are compatible, the energy is a small number; if they are incompatible, the energy is a larger number.</p></div><p>Training an EBM consists of two parts: (1) showing it examples of x and y that are compatible and training it to produce a low energy, and (2) finding a way to ensure that for a particular x, the y values that are incompatible with x produce a higher energy than the y values that are compatible with x. Part one is simple, but part two is where the difficulty lies. </p><p>For image recognition, our model takes two images, x and y, as inputs. If x and y are slightly distorted versions of the same image, the model is trained to produce a low energy on its output. For example, x could be a photo of a car, and y a photo of the same car that was taken from a slightly different location at a different time of day, so that the car in y is shifted, rotated, larger, smaller, and displaying slightly different colors and shadows than the car in x. </p><h3>Joint embedding, Siamese networks</h3><p> A particular well-suited deep learning architecture to do so is the so-called Siamese networks or joint embedding architecture. The idea goes back to papers from Geoff Hinton’s lab and Yann LeCun’s group in the early 1990s (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/355161a0" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a> and <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218001493000339" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a>) and mid-2000s (<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2004/hash/42fe880812925e520249e808937738d2-Abstract.html" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1467314" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a>, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1640964" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>here</span></a>). It was relatively ignored for a long time but has enjoyed a revival since late 2019. A joint embedding architecture is composed of two identical (or almost identical) copies of the same network. One network is fed with x and the other with y. The networks produce output vectors called embeddings, which represent x and y. A third module, joining the networks at the head, computes the energy as the distance between the two embedding vectors. When the model is shown distorted versions of the same image, the parameters of the networks can easily be adjusted so that their outputs move closer together. This will ensure that the network will produce nearly identical representations (or embedding) of an object, regardless of the particular view of that object. </p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/149794655_780907256142255_4794526832594825319_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=fI5DiGbWpN8AX_3zPVb&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfAisGE90k9wterjTaMzrBJoQ3DYN_s1BhpKo8m-sQMc_w&amp;oe=65234375" alt=""></p><div><p>Joint embedding architecture. The function C at the top produces a scalar energy that measures the distance between the representation vectors (embeddings) produced by two identical twin networks sharing the same parameters (w). When x and y are slightly different versions of the same image, the system is trained to produce a low energy, which forces the model to produce similar embedding vectors for the two images. The difficult part is to train the model so that it produces high energy (i.e., different embeddings) for images that are different.</p></div><p>The difficulty is to make sure that the networks produce high energy, i.e. different embedding vectors, when x and y are different images. Without a specific way to do so, the two networks could happily ignore their inputs and always produce identical output embeddings. This phenomenon is called a collapse. When a collapse occurs, the energy is not higher for nonmatching x and y than it is for matching x and y. </p><p>There are two categories of techniques to avoid collapse: contrastive methods and regularization methods.</p><h3>Contrastive energy-based SSL </h3><p>Contrastive methods are based on the simple idea of constructing pairs of x and y that are not compatible, and adjusting the parameters of the model so that the corresponding output energy is large. </p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/127784209_262471582050413_7179678990272222350_n.gif?_nc_cat=104&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=60iCzPquolkAX_nwICv&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfBgGo-2gVs1odmpRjzOnsv0wUzarDZJEXeLTvwNstFPEw&amp;oe=65233C87" alt=""></p><div><p>Training an EBM with a contrastive method consists in simultaneously pushing down on the energy of compatible (x,y) pairs from the training set, indicated by the blue dots, and pushing up on the energy of well chosen (x,y) pairs that are incompatible, symbolized by the green dots. In this simple example, x and y are both scalars, but in real situations, x and y could be an image or a video with millions of dimensions. Coming up with incompatible pairs that will shape the energy in suitable ways is challenging and expensive computationally. </p></div><p>The method used to train NLP systems by masking or substituting some input words belongs to the category of contrastive methods. But they don’t use the joint embedding architecture. Instead, they use a predictive architecture in which the model directly produces a prediction for y. One starts for a complete segment of text y, then corrupts it, e.g., by masking some words to produce the observation x. The corrupted input is fed to a large neural network that is trained to reproduce the original text y. An uncorrupted text will be reconstructed as itself (low reconstruction error), while a corrupted text will be reconstructed as an uncorrupted version of itself (large reconstruction error). If one interprets the reconstruction error as an energy, it will have the desired property: low energy for “clean” text and higher energy for “corrupted” text. </p><p>The general technique of training a model to restore a corrupted version of an input is called denoising auto-encoder. While early forms of this idea go back to the 1980s, it was <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1390156.1390294" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>revived in 2008</span></a> by Pascal Vincent and colleagues at the University of Montréal, introduced in the context of NLP by <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v12/collobert11a.html" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>Collobert and Weston</span></a>, and popularized by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><span>BERT paper</span></a> from our friends at Google.</p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/155526762_897797787644739_8022451761586606565_n.png?_nc_cat=108&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=DKakaVTcPHgAX_KXlgQ&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfAuzF4LAIo0VpyrTjqeqEym2HKuhXuqIgHPE6BDx69UmQ&amp;oe=65235FD6" alt=""></p><div><p>A masked language model, which is an instance of denoising auto-encoder, itself an instance of contrastive self-supervised learning.

Since the model must be able to predict multiple possible outcomes, the prediction is not a single set of words but a series of scores for every word in the vocabulary for each missing word location. </p><p>But we cannot use this trick for images because we cannot enumerate all possible images. Is there a solution to this problem? The short answer is no. There are interesting ideas in this direction, but they have not yet led to results that are as good as joint embedding architectures. One interesting avenue is latent-variable predictive architectures. </p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/151779454_861787841053485_9032472471565149785_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=75O6JveTH2cAX-2vn_Y&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfCWewOiy0Pr1ilRX1PdjtMx7iqgnSBMcBTWDN1sGMg0RQ&amp;oe=65234D03" alt=""></p><div><p>A latent-variable predictive architecture.

It is called latent because its value is never observed. With a properly trained model, as the latent variable varies over a given set, the output prediction varies over the set of plausible predictions compatible with the input x. </p><p>Latent-variable models can be trained with contrastive methods. A good example of this is a generative adversarial network (GAN). The critic (or discriminator) can be seen as computing an energy indicating whether the input y looks good. The generator network is trained to produce contrastive samples to which the critic is trained to associate high energy.</p><p>But contrastive methods have a major issue: They are very inefficient to train. In high-dimensional spaces such as images, there are many ways one image can be different from another. Finding a set of contrastive images that cover all the ways they can differ from a given image is a nearly impossible task. To paraphrase Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” This applies to any family of high-dimensional objects, it seems. </p><p>What if it were possible to make sure the energy of incompatible pairs is higher than that of compatible pairs without explicitly pushing up on the energy of many incompatible pairs?</p><h3>Non-contrastive energy-based SSL</h3><p>Non-contrastive methods applied to joint embedding architectures is possibly the hottest topic in SSL for vision at the moment.

Barlow Twins tries to minimize the redundancy between the individual components of the embedding vectors. </p><p>Perhaps a better alternative in the long run will be to devise non-contrastive methods with latent-variable predictive models. The main obstacle is that they require a way to minimize the capacity of the latent variable. The volume of the set over which the latent variable can vary limits the volume of outputs that take low energy.

<p>A pioneering study has shed new light on North African humid periods that have occurred over the past 800,000 years and explains why the Sahara Desert was periodically green.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>The research, published in <i>Nature Communications</i>, showed periodic wet phases in the Sahara were driven by changes in Earth's orbit around the sun and were suppressed during the ice ages.
</p><p>For the first time, climate scientists simulated the historic intervals of 'greening' of the Sahara, offering evidence for how the timing and intensity of these humid events were also influenced remotely by the effects of large, distant, high-latitude ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere.
</p><p>Lead author Dr. Edward Armstrong, a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+scientist/" rel="tag">climate scientist</a> at the University of Helsinki and University of Bristol, said, "The cyclic transformation of the Sahara Desert into savannah and woodland ecosystems is one of the most remarkable environmental changes on the planet."
</p><p>"Our study is one of the first climate modeling studies to simulate the African Humid Periods with comparable magnitude to what the paleoclimate observations indicate, revealing why and when these events occurred."
</p><p>There is widespread evidence that the Sahara was periodically vegetated in the past, with the proliferation of rivers, lakes and water-dependent animals such as hippos, before it became what is now desert. These North African Humid Periods may have been crucial in providing vegetated corridors out of Africa, allowing the dispersal of various species, including <a href="https://phys.org/tags/early+humans/" rel="tag">early humans</a>, around the world.
</p><p>The so-called "greenings" are thought to have been driven by changes in Earth's orbital conditions, specifically Earth's orbital precession. Precession refers to how Earth wobbles on its axis, which influences seasonality (i.e., the seasonal contrast) over an approximate 21,000-year cycle. These changes in precession determine the amount of energy received by the Earth in different seasons, which in turn controls the strength of the African Monsoon and the spread of vegetation across this vast region.
</p><p>A major barrier to understanding these events is that the majority of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+models/" rel="tag">climate models</a> have been unable to simulate the amplitude of these humid periods, so the specific mechanisms driving them have remained uncertain.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>This study deployed a recently-developed climate model to simulate the North African Humid periods to greatly advance understanding of their driving mechanisms.
</p><p>The results confirm the North African Humid Periods occurred every 21,000 years and were determined by changes in Earth's orbital precession. This caused warmer summers in the Northern Hemisphere, which intensified the strength of the West African Monsoon system and increased Saharan precipitation, resulting in the spread of savannah-type vegetation across the desert.
</p><p>The findings also show the humid periods did not occur during the ice ages, when there were large glacial ice sheets covering much of the high latitudes. This is because these vast ice sheets cooled the atmosphere and suppressed the tendency for the African monsoon system to expand. This highlights a major teleconnection between these distant regions, which may have restricted the dispersal of species, including humans, out of Africa during the glacial periods of the last 800,000 years.
</p><p>Co-author Paul Valdes, Professor of Physical Geography at the University of Bristol, said, "We are really excited about the results. Traditionally, climate models have struggled to represent the extent of the 'greening' of the Sahara. Our revised model successfully represents past changes and also gives us confidence in their ability to understand future change."
</p><p>The research, including <a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+scientists/" rel="tag">climate scientists</a> from the University of Birmingham, is part of a project at the University of Helsinki, which studies the impacts of climate on past human distributions and evolution of their ecological niche.
</p><p>Co-author Miikka Tallavaara, Assistant Professor of Hominin Environments at the University of Helsinki, said, "The Sahara region is kind of a gate controlling the dispersal of species between both North and Sub-Saharan Africa, and in and out of the continent."
</p><p>"The gate was open when Sahara was green and closed when deserts prevailed. This alternation of humid and arid phases had major consequences for the dispersal and evolution of species in Africa. Our ability to model North African Humid periods is a major achievement and means we are now also better able to model human distributions and understand the evolution of our genus in Africa."

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Spinning Up HyperDX</h2>
<p dir="auto">The HyperDX stack ingests, stores, and searches/graphs your telemetry data.
After standing up the Docker Compose stack, you'll want to instrument your app
to send data over to HyperDX.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can get started by deploying a complete stack via Docker Compose. After
cloning this repository, simply start the stack with:</p>

<p dir="auto">Afterwards, you can visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a> to access the HyperDX UI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If your server is behind a firewall, you'll need to open/forward port 8080,
8000 and 4318 on your firewall for the UI, API and OTel collector
respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We recommend at least 4GB of RAM and 2 cores for testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Enabling Self-instrumentation/Demo Logs</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">To get a quick preview of HyperDX, you can enable self-instrumentation and demo
logs by setting the <code>HYPERDX_API_KEY</code> to your ingestion key (go to
<a href="http://localhost:8080/team" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/team</a> after creating your
account) and then restart the stack.</p>
<p dir="auto">This will redirect internal telemetry from the frontend app, API, host metrics
and demo logs to your new HyperDX instance.</p>
<p dir="auto">ex.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="HYPERDX_API_KEY=<YOUR_INGESTION_KEY> docker compose up -d"><pre>HYPERDX_API_KEY=<span>&lt;</span>YOUR_INGESTION_KEY<span>&gt;</span> docker compose up -d</pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If you need to use <code>sudo</code> for docker, make sure to forward the environment
variable with the <code>-E</code> flag:
<code>HYPERDX_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_KEY&gt; sudo -E docker compose up -d</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hosted Cloud</h3>
<p dir="auto">HyperDX is also available as a hosted cloud service at
<a href="https://hyperdx.io/" rel="nofollow">hyperdx.io</a>. You can sign up for a free account and start
sending data in minutes.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Instrumenting Your App</h2>
<p dir="auto">To get logs, metrics, traces, session replay, etc into HyperDX, you'll need to
instrument your app to collect and send telemetry data over to your HyperDX
instance.</p>
<p dir="auto">We provide a set of SDKs and integration options to make it easier to get
started with HyperDX, such as
<a href="https://www.hyperdx.io/docs/install/browser" rel="nofollow">Browser</a>,
<a href="https://www.hyperdx.io/docs/install/javascript" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a>, and
<a href="https://www.hyperdx.io/docs/install/python" rel="nofollow">Python</a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can find the full list in <a href="https://www.hyperdx.io/docs" rel="nofollow">our docs</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OpenTelemetry</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, HyperDX is compatible with
<a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="nofollow">OpenTelemetry</a>, a vendor-neutral standard for
instrumenting your application backed by CNCF. Supported languages/platforms
include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Elixir</li>
<li>Rust</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">(Full list <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>
<p dir="auto">Once HyperDX is running, you can point your OpenTelemetry SDK to the
OpenTelemetry collector spun up at <code>http://localhost:4318</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">We welcome all contributions! There's many ways to contribute to the project,
including but not limited to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Opening a PR (<a href="https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contribution Guide</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx/issues/new">Submitting feature requests or bugs</a></li>
<li>Improving our product or contribution documentation</li>
<li>Voting on <a href="https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx/issues">open issues</a> or contributing use cases to a feature request</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Our mission is to help engineers ship reliable software. To enable that, we
believe every engineer needs to be able to easily leverage production telemetry
to quickly solve burning production issues.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, in our experience, the existing tools we've used tend to fall short in
a few ways:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>They're expensive, and the pricing has failed to scale with TBs of telemetry
becoming the norm, leading to teams aggressively cutting the amount of data
they can collect.</li>
<li>They're hard to use, requiring full-time SREs to set up, and domain experts
to use confidently.</li>
<li>They requiring hopping from tool to tool (logs, session replay, APM,
exceptions, etc.) to stitch together the clues yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">We're still early on in our journey, but are building in the open to solve these
key issues in observability. We hope you give HyperDX a try and let us know how
we're doing!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Open Source vs Hosted Cloud</h2>
<p dir="auto">HyperDX is open core, with most of our features available here under an MIT
license. We have a cloud-hosted version available at
<a href="https://hyperdx.io/" rel="nofollow">hyperdx.io</a> with a few <a href="https://www.hyperdx.io/docs/oss-vs-cloud" rel="nofollow">additional features</a> beyond what's
offered in the open source version.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our cloud hosted version exists so that we can build a sustainable business and
continue building HyperDX as an open source platform. We hope to have more
comprehensive documentation on how we balance between cloud-only and open source
features in the future. In the meantime, we're highly aligned with Gitlab's
<a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/stewardship/" rel="nofollow">stewardship model</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>TechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary. TechSpot means tech analysis and advice <a href="https://www.techspot.com/ethics.html" target="_blank">you&nbsp;can&nbsp;trust</a>.</p><div>
<p id="why-it-matters"><strong>What just happened?</strong> A newly approved bill will make life easier for Californian consumers wanting their data removed from online databases. Proponents of the bill are saying that deletion rights are now a "vital necessity," while lawyers and advertisers are depicting a decaying, byzantine Californian digital world. </p>
<p>On September 14, the final day of the 2023 legislative session, the California Senate finally passed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB362">Senate Bill 362</a>. Also known as the "Delete Act," the new law is designed to provide consumers in the most populous US state a new right to privacy against the commercial interests of data brokers. The bill will now need to be signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, who has until October 14 to comply.</p>
<p>According to Ashkan Soltani, executive director of the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), Newsom is expected to sign the bill in due time. The Delete Act establishes a new "accessible deletion mechanism," which will make deleting consumer information collected by data brokers much easier and faster.</p>
<p>Under the new law, the CPPA will be tasked with developing a new system by 2026. The system will give California residents the ability to make a single data deletion request against all the 500 data brokers officially operating in the state. CPPA will also need to enforce the law, ensuring that the brokers will actually delete a customer's personal information every 45 days after receiving a "verified" deletion request.</p>

<p>Democratic senator Josh Becker, who first introduced the Delete Act in California Senate, previously said that the bill would close a loophole within the California Consumer Privacy Act. Before the Delete Act, consumers had to contact every single data broker if they wished for their data to be erased. The Delete Act is based on a very simple premise, <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/california-legislature-passes-delete-act-for-pi-aggregated-by-data-brokers/">Becker said</a>: "Every Californian should be able to control who has access to their personal information and what they can do with it."</p>
<p>Data brokers spend "their days and nights" building dossiers with millions of people's data about reproductive healthcare, geolocation, and more, Becker stated, even purchasing data so they can later "sell it to the highest bidder." Tom Kemp, who advised lawmakers in drafting the bill and is an investor in multiple data deletion companies, said that in "post-abortion rights America" the selling of "very sensitive data" such as reproductive healthcare or precise geolocation has made things "intolerable for many people."</p>
<p>Opponents of the Delete Act include representatives from Kelley Drye &amp; Warren Partner. The law firm highlighted how the bill would make things much more complicated for companies, who need to invest money to comply with these new laws. Advertisers are fuming, with executives from the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) talking about a scheme conceived to "enrich pay-to-play deletion" services.</p>
<p>The Delete Act will encourage the mass deletion of data that is "the lifeblood of California's digital economy," ANA's executive VP Chris Oswald stated, and the bill also includes "glaring and dramatic failures." Without a "robust data marketplace," the advertisers said, Californians will fall victim to more fraud and identity theft because "their identities can't be verified."</p>

            <guid>37556719</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 14:38:03 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://akuity.io/blog/introducing-kargo/">https://akuity.io/blog/introducing-kargo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37556719">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are thrilled to announce Kargo, a multi-stage application lifecycle orchestrator for continuously delivering and promoting changes through environments. Kargo, brought to you by the creators of <a href="https://akuity.io/what-is-argo">the Argo Project</a>, is a reimagining of CD pipelines for the cloud-native era, with first-class GitOps support, progressive delivery features, and is 100% open source.</p><p>Kargo, as the name implies, is about transporting “freight” (what we call build and configuration artifacts) to multiple environments with a first-class GitOps approach. GitOps has been transformational in how it has elevated the practice of infrastructure-as-code to the next level. However, the practice of GitOps has created new challenges for traditional CI/CD pipelines. Pull-based GitOps operators, such as Argo CD, meant CI pipelines no longer had direct access to production environments. The async nature of Kubernetes declarative APIs and eventual consistency resulted in imperative processes like testing and analysis difficult to coordinate. Argo CD improved the situation by providing convenient interfaces to Kubernetes clusters, such as health assessments, sync hooks, and waved deployments, but it has not been enough.</p><p>As soon as there is a need to coordinate deployments over multiple environments, GitOps falls short. One of our most common conversations with customers is what to do after Argo CD is up and running. How can platform teams provide a user experience to their application developers and give them the autonomy to move their changes safely into production?</p><p>Until now, the answer to this question has been: cobbled-up scripts and bespoke, fragile automation. If we were to ask ten different organizations how they handle environment promotion, we would get ten different responses, everyone repeating the same patterns and even anti-patterns. Invariably, CI systems are over-leveraged to handle the job of CD.</p><p>At its core, the goals of CI are markedly different from the goals of CD. CI aims to build and produce an artifact as efficiently as possible. On the other hand, the objective of CD is to carry an artifact as safely as possible to production. Whereas CI is generally a short-lived job, CD is often a long, drawn-out process where promoting something from dev to production might take hours, if not days. And until now, adequate tooling has yet to reflect those needs.</p><p>Kargo aims to change all of that. Fundamentally, Kargo takes an entirely different approach to the problem of effecting change to multiple environments. Unlike CI, Kargo deployment pipelines are not generic “jobs” with a beginning, a middle, and an end, relying on executing shell commands against each environment.</p><p>Instead, Kargo Stages are used to model your environments and are the basic building blocks of your deployment pipeline. Stages are independently defined and loosely coupled with other Stages, linked together via subscriptions. They have their own lifecycle, testing, analysis, and conditions for deployment. Artifacts, which we call Freight, are promotable units of deployment that become qualified as they move from Stage to Stage. The final result is a deployment pipeline that is both easier to manage and more powerful than a Jenkinsfile or GitHub action could ever hope to be.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Drawing from our experience with Argo CD, we recognize the crucial importance of a positive developer experience. As a result, we are dedicating significant focus to enhancing Kargo's user interface. We anticipate end-user developers to visit Kargo’s interface on a daily basis, as they promote, manage, and observe their environments. Within Kargo’s user interface, developers can understand their environments at a glance: what is running, where artifacts have been deployed, and how things are progressing through the pre-defined Stages.</p><p>What we’re announcing today barely scratches the surface of the problems a tool like Kargo can solve. We’re excited about its future and are looking for key design partners as well as fostering a community around the project. <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1116947746742/WN_W434Plb8SnCfRt2jmjsGMg">Join us tomorrow for a live webinar</a> where together with Kelsey Hightower we will be demoing Kargo and talking about its core concepts.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><span></span><a id="executive-summary-0"></a><strong>Executive summary</strong>&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><p>Microsoft’s AI research team, while publishing a bucket of open-source training data on GitHub, accidentally exposed 38 terabytes of additional private data — including a disk backup of two employees’ workstations.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The backup includes secrets, private keys, passwords, and over 30,000 internal Microsoft Teams messages.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The researchers shared their files using an Azure feature called SAS tokens, which allows you to share data from Azure Storage accounts.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The access level can be limited to specific files only; however, in this case, the link was configured to share the entire storage account — including another 38TB of private files.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This case is an example of the new risks organizations face when starting to leverage the power of AI more broadly, as more of their engineers now work with massive amounts of training data. As data scientists and engineers race to bring new AI solutions to production, the massive amounts of data they handle require additional security checks and safeguards.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><span></span><a id="introduction-and-microsoft-findings-2"></a><strong>Introduction and Microsoft findings</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>As part of the Wiz Research Team’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbHALyrxj0Y">ongoing work</a> on accidental exposure of cloud-hosted data, the team scanned the internet for misconfigured storage containers. In this process, we found a GitHub repository under the Microsoft organization named <code>robust-models-transfer</code>. The repository belongs to Microsoft’s AI research division, and its purpose is to provide open-source code and AI models for image recognition. Readers of the repository were instructed to download the models from an Azure Storage URL:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The exposed storage URL, taken from Microsoft’s GitHub repository</p><p>However, this URL allowed access to more than just open-source models. It was configured to grant permissions on the entire storage account, exposing additional private data by mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>Our scan shows that this account contained 38TB of additional data — including Microsoft employees’ personal computer backups. The backups contained sensitive personal data, including passwords to Microsoft services, secret keys, and over 30,000 internal Microsoft Teams messages from 359 Microsoft employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Exposed containers under the 'robustnessws4285631339' storage account </p><p>A small sample of sensitive files found on the computer backups</p><p>Redacted Teams conversation between two Microsoft employees</p><p>In addition to the overly permissive access scope, the token was also misconfigured to allow “full control” permissions instead of read-only. Meaning, not only could an attacker view all the files in the storage account, but they could delete and overwrite existing files as well.&nbsp;</p><p>This is particularly interesting considering the repository’s original purpose: providing AI models for use in training code. The repository instructs users to download a model data file from the SAS link and feed it into a script. The file’s format is <code>ckpt</code>, a format produced by the TensorFlow library. It’s formatted using Python’s <code>pickle</code> formatter, which is <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-pickle">prone to arbitrary code execution</a> by design. Meaning, an attacker could have injected malicious code into all the AI models in this storage account, and every user who trusts Microsoft’s GitHub repository would’ve been infected by it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, it’s important to note this storage account wasn’t directly exposed to the public; in fact, it was a private storage account. The Microsoft developers used an Azure mechanism called “SAS tokens”, which allows you to create a shareable link granting access to an Azure Storage account’s data — while upon inspection, the storage account would still seem completely private.&nbsp;</p><h2><span></span><a id="introduction-to-sas-tokens-16"></a><strong>Introduction to SAS tokens</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>In Azure, a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token is a signed URL that grants access to Azure Storage data. The access level can be customized by the user; the permissions range between read-only and full control, while the scope can be either a single file, a container, or an entire storage account. The expiry time is also completely customizable, allowing the user to create never-expiring access tokens. This granularity provides great agility for users, but it also creates the risk of granting too much access; in the most permissive case (as we’ve seen in Microsoft’s token above), the token can allow full control permissions, on the entire account, forever – essentially providing the same access level as the account key itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are 3 types of SAS tokens: Account SAS, Service SAS, and User Delegation SAS. In this blog we will focus on the most popular type – Account SAS tokens, which were also used in Microsoft’s repository.&nbsp;</p><p>Generating an Account SAS is a simple process. As can be seen in the screen below, the user configures the token’s scope, permissions, and expiry date, and generates the token. Behind the scenes, the browser downloads the account key from Azure, and signs the generated token with the key. This entire process is done on the client side; it’s not an Azure event, and the resulting token is not an Azure object.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating a high privilege non-expiring SAS token</p><p>Because of this, when a user creates a highly-permissive non-expiring token, there is no way for an administrator to know this token exists and where it circulates. Revoking a token is no easy task either — it requires rotating the account key that signed the token, rendering all other tokens signed by same key ineffective as well. These unique pitfalls make this service an easy target for attackers looking for exposed data.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the risk of accidental exposure, the service’s pitfalls make it an effective tool for attackers seeking to maintain persistency on compromised storage accounts. A recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/09/07/cloud-storage-security-whats-new-in-the-threat-matrix/#:~:text=Create%20SAS%20Token">Microsoft report</a> indicates that attackers are taking advantage of the service’s lack of monitoring capabilities in order to issue privileged SAS tokens as a backdoor. Since the issuance of the token is not documented anywhere, there is no way to know that it was issued and act against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><span></span><a id="sas-security-risks-24"></a><strong>SAS security risks</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>SAS tokens pose a security risk, as they allow sharing information with external unidentified identities. The risk can be examined from several angles: permissions, hygiene, management and monitoring.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="permissions-27"></a><strong>Permissions</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>A SAS token can grant a very high access level to a storage account, whether through excessive permissions (like read, list, write or delete), or through wide access scopes that allow users to access adjacent storage containers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="hygiene-29"></a><strong>Hygiene</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>SAS tokens have an expiry problem — our scans and monitoring show organizations often use tokens with a very long (sometimes infinite) lifetime, as there is no upper limit on a token's expiry. This was the case with Microsoft’s token, which was valid until 2051.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="management-and-monitoring-31"></a><strong>Management and monitoring</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Account SAS tokens are extremely hard to manage and revoke. There isn't any official way to keep track of these tokens within Azure, nor to monitor their issuance, which makes it difficult to know how many tokens have been issued and are in active use. The reason even issuance cannot be tracked is that SAS tokens are created on the client side, therefore it is not an an Azure tracked activity, and the generated token is not an Azure object. Because of this, even what appears to be a private storage account may potentially be widely exposed.&nbsp;</p><p>As for revocation, there isn't a way to revoke a singular Account SAS; the only solution is revoking the entire account key, which invalidates all the other tokens issued with the same key as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Monitoring the usage of SAS tokens is another challenge, as it requires enabling logging on each storage account separately. It can also be costly, as the pricing depends on the request volume of each storage account. &nbsp;</p><h2><span></span><a id="sas-security-recommendations-35"></a><strong>SAS security recommendations</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>SAS security can be&nbsp;significantly improved with the following recommendations.</p><h3><span></span><a id="management-37"></a><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Due to the lack of security and governance over Account SAS tokens, they should be considered as sensitive as the account key itself. Therefore, it is highly recommended to avoid using Account SAS for external sharing. Token creation mistakes can easily go unnoticed and expose sensitive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For external sharing, consider using a Service SAS with a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/define-stored-access-policy">Stored Access Policy</a>. This feature connects the SAS token to a server-side policy, providing the ability to manage policies and revoke them in a centralized manner.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to share content in a time-limited manner, consider using a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/create-user-delegation-sas">User Delegation SAS</a>, since their expiry time is capped at 7 days. This feature connects the SAS token to Azure Active Directory’s identity management, providing control and visibility over the identity of the token’s creator and its users.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, we recommend creating dedicated storage accounts for external sharing, to ensure that the potential impact of an over-privileged token is limited to external data only.&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid SAS tokens completely, organizations will have to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/shared-key-authorization-prevent">disable SAS access</a> for each of their storage accounts separately. We recommend using a CSPM to track and enforce this as a policy.&nbsp;</p><p>Another solution to disable SAS token creation is by blocking access to the “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storagerp/storage-accounts/list-keys">list storage account keys</a>” operation in Azure (since new SAS tokens cannot be created without the key), then rotating the current account keys, to invalidate pre-existing SAS tokens. This approach would still allow creation of User Delegation SAS, since it relies on the user’s key instead of the account key.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="monitorin-g-44"></a><strong>Monitorin</strong><strong><u>g</u></strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>To track active SAS token usage, you need to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/manage-storage-analytics-logs">enable Storage Analytics logs</a> for each of your storage accounts. The resulting logs will contain details of SAS token access, including the signing key and the permissions assigned. However, it should be noted that only actively used tokens will appear in the logs, and that enabling logging comes with extra charges — which might be costly for accounts with extensive activity.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-storage-monitoring-scenarios">Azure Metrics</a> can be used to monitor SAS tokens usage in storage accounts. By default, Azure records and aggregates storage account events up to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics#retention-of-metrics">93 days</a>. Utilizing Azure Metrics, users can look up SAS-authenticated requests, highlighting storage accounts with SAS tokens usage.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="secret-scanning-47"></a><strong>Secret scanning</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>In addition, we recommend using secret scanning tools to detect leaked or over-privileged SAS tokens in artifacts and publicly exposed assets, such as mobile apps, websites, and GitHub repositories — as can be seen in the Microsoft case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on cloud secret scanning, please check out our recent talk from the fwd:cloudsec 2023 conference, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbHALyrxj0Y">"Scanning the internet for external cloud exposures"</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="for-wiz-customers-50"></a><strong>For Wiz customers</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Wiz customers can leverage the Wiz secret scanning capabilities to identify SAS tokens in internal and external assets and explore their permissions.

This poses inherent security risks tied to high-scale data sharing. It is crucial for security teams to define clear guidelines for external sharing of AI datasets. As we’ve seen in this case, separating the public AI data set to a dedicated storage account could’ve limited the exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>The second is the risk of <strong>supply chain attacks</strong>. Due to improper permissions, the public token granted write access to the storage account containing the AI models. As noted above, injecting malicious code into the model files could’ve led to a supply chain attack on other researchers who use the repository’s models. Security teams should review and sanitize AI models from external sources, since they can be used as a remote code execution vector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><span></span><a id="takeaways-59"></a><strong>Takeaways&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The simple step of sharing an AI dataset led to a major data leak, containing over 38TB of private data. The root cause was the usage of Account SAS tokens as the sharing mechanism. Due to a lack of monitoring and governance, SAS tokens pose a security risk, and their usage should be as limited as possible. These tokens are very hard to track, as Microsoft does not provide a centralized way to manage them within the Azure portal. In addition, these tokens can be configured to last effectively forever, with no upper limit on their expiry time. Therefore, using Account SAS tokens for external sharing is unsafe and should be avoided.&nbsp;</p><p>In the wider scope, similar incidents can be prevented by granting security teams more visibility into the processes of AI research and development teams. As we see wider adoption of AI models within companies, it’s important to raise awareness of relevant security risks at every step of the AI development process, and make sure the security team works closely with the data science and research teams to ensure proper guardrails are defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft's account of this issue is available on the <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/microsoft-mitigated-exposure-of-internal-information-in-a-storage-account-due-to-overly-permissive-sas-token/">Microsoft Security Response Center blog</a>.</p><h2><span></span><a id="timeline-63"></a><strong>Timeline</strong>&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Jul. 20, 2020</strong> – SAS token first <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/robust-models-transfer/blob/e61568d613c025adfd07f61f2639f3ae78852143/README.md?plain=1#L36">committed</a> to GitHub; expiry set to Oct. 5, 2021&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Oct. 6, 2021</strong> – SAS token expiry <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/robust-models-transfer/commit/a9e0e80bcd49bd8651c0b3198c7dc89179b2c0ac">updated</a> to Oct. 6, 2051&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jun. 22, 2023</strong> – Wiz Research finds and reports issue to MSRC&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jun. 24, 2023</strong> – SAS token invalidated by Microsoft&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jul. 7, 2023</strong> – SAS token <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/robust-models-transfer/commit/c26ebfff3d01bd2a52a6c14febb8b7ea0234431d">replaced</a> on GitHub&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Aug. 16, 2023</strong> – Microsoft completes internal investigation of potential impact&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Sep. 18, 2023</strong> – Public disclosure&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><span></span><a id="stay-in-touch-65"></a><strong>Stay in touch!</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Hi there!

    <p>Satellite observations of one of the world’s biggest ecological experiments on the island of Borneo have revealed that replanting logged forests with diverse mixtures of seedlings can significantly accelerate their recovery. The results have been published today in the journal&nbsp;<em>Science Advances</em>.</p><p>The experiment was set up by the University of Oxford’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-andrew-hector" target="_blank">Professor Andy Hector</a>&nbsp;and colleagues over twenty years ago as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.searrp.org/" target="_blank">SE Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP)</a>. This assessed the recovery of 125 different plots in an area of logged tropical forest that were sown with different combinations of tree species. The results revealed that plots replanted with a mixture of 16 native tree species showed faster recovery of canopy area and total tree biomass, compared to plots replanted with 4 or just 1 species. However, even plots that had been replanted with 1 tree species were recovering more quickly than those left to restore naturally.</p><p>Lead Scientist of the study,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-andrew-hector" target="_blank">Professor Andy Hector</a>&nbsp;(Department of Biology, University of Oxford) said: ‘Our new study demonstrates that replanting logged tropical forests with diverse mixtures of native tree species achieves multiple wins, accelerating the restoration of tree cover, biodiversity, and important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration.’</p><h2>Greater diversity gives greater resilience</h2><p>According to the researchers, a likely reason behind the result is that different tree species occupy different positions, or ‘niches’, within an ecosystem. This includes both the physical and environmental conditions that the species is adapted to, and how it interacts with other organisms. As a result, diverse mixtures complement each other to increase overall functioning and stability of the ecosystem. For instance, some tropical tree species are more tolerant of drought because they produce a greater amount of protective chemicals, giving the forest resilience to periodic times of low rainfall.</p><p>Professor Hector added: ‘Having diversity in a tropical forest can be likened to an insurance effect, similar to having a financial strategy of diverse investment portfolios.’</p><p>In turn, a diverse mix of trees can support a much wider range of animal life. For instance, hornbills specifically require large mature trees with holes where the females can nest.</p><h2>One of the world’s biggest ecological experiments</h2><p>Tropical forests cover just 6% of the planet’s land surface&nbsp;<a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/forests_practice/importance_forests/tropical_rainforest/" target="_blank">but are home to around 80% of the world’s documented species (WWF),&nbsp;</a>and act as major carbon sinks. However, these critical habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate, chiefly due to logging for timber and conversion to palm oil plantations. Between 2004 and 2017,&nbsp;<a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/forests_practice/importance_forests/tropical_rainforest/" target="_blank">43 million hectares of tropical forest were lost</a>&nbsp;- an area roughly the size of Morocco (WWF).</p><p>Restoring logged tropical forests is a crucial component of efforts to tackle both the nature and climate crises. Up to now, however, it has been unclear whether this is best achieved through allowing forests to restore themselves naturally (using dormant seeds in the soil) or through active replanting.</p><div><h2>Want more breaking news?</h2><div><p>Subscribe to <i>Technology Networks</i>’ daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.</p><p><a href="https://go.technologynetworks.com/subscribe-to-breaking-science-news" target="_blank"><span>Subscribe for FREE</span></a></p></div></div><p>To investigate this, the researchers collaborated with local partners to set up the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment on 500 hectares of logged forest in the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of Borneo. This was divided into 125 experimental plots that were either left to recover naturally or planted with mixtures of either 1, 4, or 16 tree species that are frequently targeted for logging. The 16 species included several endangered species and the worlds’ tallest species of tropical tree (<em>Shorea faguetiana</em>) which can reach over 100 m in height. The first trees were planted in 2002, with nearly 100,000 planted in total over the following years.</p><p>The recovery of the plots was assessed by applying statistical models to aerial images captured by satellites. Within a few years, it became apparent that those with 1 species did worse than those planted with a mixture of 4 species, and those enriched with 16 species did best of all.</p><p>Lead author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/ryan-veryard" target="_blank">Ryan Veryard</a>&nbsp;(who analysed the data as part of his PhD at the University of Oxford), said: ‘Importantly, our results show that logged forest can recover so long as it is not converted to agricultural uses like oil palm plantation. They also emphasise the need to conserve biodiversity within undisturbed forests, so that we can restore it in areas that have already been logged.’</p><p>The Sabah Biodiversity Experiment team are now starting a new three-year project funded by the UK Natural Environmental Research Council to take a census of all the surviving trees in the experiment. This will be combined with a wider range of remote sensing methods (including lidar sensors carried by a helicopter and smaller sensors carried by drones) to give a more comprehensive analysis of forest health.</p><p><b>Reference:&nbsp;</b><span>Veryard R, Wu J, O’Brien MJ, et al.

The unidentified pilot ejected safely and was taken to a local hospital in a stable condition.</p>                                    <p>Joint Base Charleston called on the public to cooperate with military and civilian authorities as the search for the F-35 jet continues. The air base said it was working with Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort to search for the plane north of North Charleston around Lake Moultrie and Lake Marion, based on its last-known location.</p>                  <h3>More From TIME</h3>                    
                  <p>Lockheed Martin Corp is the manufacturer behind the F-35, a single-seat fighter craft used by militaries around the world. The aircraft was a vertical take-off version used by in the US Marine Corps, and the jet is popular for its stealth qualities that make it difficult to detect by radar.&nbsp;</p>                                    <p>The F-35 program, the most expensive US weapons program ever, is projected to cost $400 billion in development and acquisition, plus an additional $1.2 trillion to operate and maintain the fleet over more than 60 years. Each jet can cost more than $160 million, depending on the variant.</p>                  <p>It’s not the first time an F-35 has been in trouble. An F-35B version crashed in 2018 in Beaufort County, South Carolina, because of a manufacturing defect in a fuel tube, according to the Government Accounting Office’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-336sp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>. The following year, a Japanese F-35A stealth fighter plunged into the ocean during an exercise over the Pacific Ocean, which Japan blamed on pilot disorientation, rather than technical issues.</p>                                    <p>The missing aircraft in the US swiftly drew online mockery, from postings with&nbsp;<em>Missing-Jet</em>&nbsp;fliers on lamp posts and notices on milk cartons, to mashed up&nbsp;<em>Dude, Where’s My F-35</em>&nbsp;movie posters.</p>                  <p>“Now that I got that out of the way. How in the hell do you lose an F-35?” South Carolina Republican Representative Nancy Mace said on social media. “How is there not a tracking device and we’re asking the public to what, find a jet and turn it in?”</p>                  <div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="https://www.getlago.com/blog"><p>Blog</p></a><p>The 4 biggest problems with homemade billing systems</p></div><div><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentpochet/" target="_blank">Vincent Pochet</a>, Senior Backend Developer at Lago.</p><p>——</p><p>In 2017, I joined Qonto, a B2B neobank in the making (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank">now worth more than $5B</a>), and got involved in the design of the billing system.</p><p>As the company was scaling from cradle to unicorn, we faced many billing challenges: monthly and yearly plans, “pay-as-you-go” components (percentage on FX transfers, fixed fee on ATM withdrawals, user seats, printed cards, etc.), creation of invoices at scale, taxes, accounting… It was a never-ending nightmare.</p><p>Now, when someone asks for advice about their billing system, my answer is clear: <strong>DO NOT build it yourself</strong>.</p><p>It may look like an interesting project at the beginning, but you’ll soon regret it. And believe me, it only gets worse. As an engineer, if you’re told it’s a “two-month project”, run as far as you can before it’s too late and you become the “billing guy”!</p><p>‍</p><h3>#1 Pricing changes all the time and billing needs to follow</h3><p>After creating the first billing engine of Qonto, we were pretty happy with what we had built. We could ingest <strong>millions of events every week</strong>, our calculations were correct, we could generate sequential invoices, we were able to apply marketing coupons and we managed to debit our internal ledger. Everything was going well!</p><p>But then…</p><p>‍</p><h4>The marketing team came up with a new yearly plan</h4><p>Billing was performed on a monthly basis. At the end of each month, we had to query the database to compute fees and display them as billing items on the invoices. Customers were able to switch from a “monthly_solo” plan to a “monthly_premium” plan (and vice versa), and the upgrade/downgrade logic was working well (although it had been difficult to implement).</p><p>When the marketing team devised a new yearly plan to secure revenue for the next 12 months, I started to freak out: <strong>the entire billing logic was based on monthly boundaries</strong>. It took us two months to modify this logic. The hardest part was that the subscription fee had to be billed in advance, at the beginning of the annual period, but the overage related to usage-based features still had to be billed on a monthly basis.</p><p>‍</p><h4>The finance team asked to switch from anniversary to calendar dates</h4><p>At the time, customers were billed based on the anniversary date of their contract. For instance, if a customer had signed up for a monthly plan on March 16th, they were billed on the 16th of each month.</p><p>One day, the finance team requested a meeting with the engineering team and the CFO said:</p><p>‍</p><blockquote><em>“It would be easier for everyone if we switched from anniversary dates to calendar dates for subscriptions. Right now it’s a mess from an accounting perspective, so let’s bill everyone at the beginning of the calendar period.”</em></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>In other words, they wanted to switch from this…</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce28312ccbe4_632c2492bb03b806277bb038_anniversary-billing.png" alt="Anniversary billing periods"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>To this...</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce59c22ccbe5_632c24bc129a6f15e47f56a7_calendar-billing.png" alt="Calendar billing periods"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>100,000 customers were affected</strong> by this migration. The accounting mess turned into an engineering nightmare, resulting in a three-month project.</p><p>Implementing billing logics takes time and things get incredibly complicated over time. Other typical organic changes include (but are not limited to):</p><p>• New features to be added to the pricing;<br>• New country launch, with a different pricing;<br>• New business line, when you start selling a white-label version of your product for instance;<br>• Changes in tax legislation; and<br>• Custom plans for “Enterprise” customers.</p><p>‍</p><h3>#2 Your billing system needs to scale with your user base</h3><p>A home-made billing system is not scalable if you don’t maintain it. At Qonto, our billing database contained millions of rows. This database was linked to our internal ledger, which was used to deduct fees from our customers’ accounts. Processing high volumes of events is hard, and when something breaks, you need to check whether past events need to be computed again (but you can’t afford to ingest the same event twice).</p><p>Generating invoices is also an important task. It’s not hard to create PDF files with line items on it. We used a library called <a href="https://gotenberg.dev/" target="_blank">Gotenberg</a> to display backend aggregations on a beautiful HTML template. However, it’s hard to process fees and generate millions of invoices at the same time. Your backend queries and aggregates millions of rows asynchronously, and the calculation must be correct for each customer.</p><p>The more complex the pricing, the more complicated the calculations. And the more customers you have, the more IT resources you need.</p><p>‍</p><h3>#3 Grandfathering causes headaches</h3><p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.getlago.com/blog/pricing-billing-open-source-interview-with-algolias-co-founder" target="_blank">we interviewed Nicolas Dessaigne</a>, founder of Algolia and Group Partner at YC. He told us about their terrible experience with pricing and billing. After a series of “minor” changes to their price plans, they decided a few months ago to adopt a full usage-based pricing model and had to rebuild the entire billing logic.</p><p>As most customers had signed long-term contracts based on existing plans, they had to exclude them from the migration. This is called “<strong>grandfathering</strong>”. In this situation, engineers must not only implement new billing rules, but they also need to maintain the old logic for grandfathered plans.</p><p>In 2013, the pricing of Algolia was like this...</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce1d8e2ccbe8_632c24e7491cef6fe07397bc_algolia-2013.png" alt="The pricing of Algolia in 2013"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Then in 2015 it was like this...</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce34662ccbe6_632c2505090891f38d817c95_algolia-2015.png" alt="The pricing of Algolia in 2015"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>And here is the 2022&nbsp;update!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce64ad2ccbe7_632c25151344fba10f40b3eb_algolia-2022.png" alt="The pricing of Algolia in 2022"></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>#4 You must be prepared to staff an entire team</h3><p>Billing is never considered an expertise. It’s perceived as a background task and not as a prestigious project that engineers will fight for (they may even leave if they’re forced to work on it for a long time).</p><p>However, sooner or later, billing will be a full-time job for at least one engineer. Because of pricing changes, scalability challenges and grandfathered plans, complexity increases and so does the workload. Billing is built around your company’s product, it’s a living organism, not a feature.</p><p>At Qonto, the billing project was supposed to be completed by a single backend engineer in only two months. One year later, two backend engineers were still working on it full time.</p><p>Then <strong>the team of two backend engineers grew into a team of 20 people</strong>, including product managers, backend engineers and frontend engineers as well. Hiring, onboarding and retaining people to take care of our billing system was a constant challenge. They would have preferred to work on our core product, and our management team also wanted to downsize the team.</p><p>We considered implementing an off-the-shelf billing solution but there was nothing flexible enough and <strong>the switching costs were too high</strong>. Algolia also tried to migrate to Zuora before backing out and rebuilding their billing system for the fourth time. This is a decision you have to make in the early days, otherwise, at some point, your billing will be too complex and won’t fit any software product.</p><p>I left Qonto in March 2021 and I still get phone calls from engineers currently working there and struggling with billing. They learned these four lessons the hard way. They now know what it costs to build a homemade billing system.</p></div></div>]]></description>

					Enums (or tagged unions) whose variants vary in size are prone to significant 
					memory fragmentation in Rust. That's because we need to allocate enough 
					data to accommodate the largest variant.

					</p><figure>
						<div>
						<p><b>Figure 1:</b> Consider the following enum:
</p><div>
<pre>pub enum Foo { 
  A(u8), 
  B(u16),
  C(u32),
  D(u64),
}

</pre></div><p>
						Because of the space needed for tagging and alignment, this type is 16 bytes long.
						</p></div>
						<p><img alt="A visualization of an enum with variants of different sizes, and their respective memory fragmentation." src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/img1.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					This presents real pain when collecting a large number of them into a 
					<span>Vec</span> or <span>HashMap</span>. 
					The padding can be dealt with using some form of 
					<i>struct of arrays</i> (SoA)
					transformation that stores the tag in a separate allocation. 
					However, reducing the variant fragmentation is not so trivial. 
					</p>

					<p>
					You could hand-roll specialized data structures for <i>a particular enum</i>
					that reduce fragmentation to a minimum; but doing this generically 
					for an arbitrary enum with maximum memory efficiency is close to 
					impossible in Rust. The only options we have are proc-macros, which 
					compose poorly (no <span>#[derive]</span> on third-party code or type aliases) 
					and are not type aware (unless using workarounds based on 
					<span>generic_const_expr</span>, which infect the call graph with verbose trait 
					bounds and don't work with generic type parameters). Zig on the 
					other hand let's us perform the wildest data structure transformations 
					in a generic and concise way. 
					</p>

					<p>
					Before I go into the implementation details, I'd like to explain why 
					reducing the aforementioned memory fragmentation is useful in practice. 
					</p>

					<p>Background</p>
					<p>
					To me, one of the biggest motivators for efficient enum arrays 
					has been compilers. One problem that keeps coming up when designing 
					an AST is figuring out how to reduce its memory footprint. Big ASTs 
					can incur a hefty performance penalty during compilation, because 
					memory bandwidth and latency are a frequent bottleneck in compiler 
					frontends. Chandler Carruth's 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI198eFghJk">video on the Carbon compiler</a> has been 
					making the rounds on language forums. In it he describes how a 
					parsed clang AST regularly consumes 50x more memory than the 
					original source code!
					</p>

					<p>
					Alright, so what does this have to do with enums? Well, the 
					most common way of representing syntax tree nodes is via some kind 
					of recursive (or recursive-like) data structure. Let's define a node 
					for expressions in Rust, using newtype indices for indirection:
					</p>
					<div>
<pre>enum Expr {
    Unit,
    Number,
    Binary(Operation, ExprId, ExprId),
    Ident(Symbol),
    Eval(ExprId, ExprSlice),
    BlockExpression(ExprId, StatementSlice)
}
</pre></div>

					<div>
					<p><b>Note:</b> We can write an AST node in OCaml for comparison:
</p><div>
<pre>type expr = 
  | Unit
  | Number
  | Binary of op * expr * expr
  | Ident of symbol
  | Eval of expr * stmt list

</pre></div><p>
					A big difference compared to Rust is that we can express truly 
					recursive data types without any form of explicit indirection. 
					That's because the runtime system and garbage collector take care 
					of the memory bookkeeping for us.
					</p></div><p>

					The problem we have now is that we want to improve the <i>packing efficiency</i>
					of those enums. A simple <span>Vec(Expr)</span> will consume <span>sizeof(Enum)</span> 
					amount of memory for every element, which corresponds to the size of 
					the largest variant + tag + padding. Luckily, there are some ways 
					of dealing with this.

					</p><p>Reducing Fragmentation</p><p>
					Let's take a simple example of a 3-variant enum with member sizes 
					8, 16 and 32 bits. Storing those in a regular <span>Vec</span> will look like this:

					</p><figure>
						<p><b>Figure 2:</b> 
						Here every element reserves a large amount of space to accommodate the 32-bit variant and to satisfy its alignment. 
						</p>
						<p><img alt="A visualization of an array of enum values, with varying fragmentation levels per element" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout1.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					The most common way to improve packing efficiency is by just keeping the enum variants as small as possible using tagged indices (*). 
					</p><p>
					(*): For examples in Rust, take a look at the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustc_data_structures/tagged_ptr/index.html#">tagged_index crate</a> used in the compiler 
					or check out this recent <a href="https://mcyoung.xyz/2023/08/09/yarns/">blog post on small-string optimization</a>. 
					You'll find these optimizations all the time in high-performance code 
					like language runtimes, garbage collectors, compilers, game engines or OS kernels.
					</p>
					

					<p>
					Unfortunately, that doesn't completely solve the fragmentation issue. The other way is to tackle the container type directly! We could use a struct-of-arrays approach to store discriminant and value in two separate allocations. In fact, that's what the self-hosted Zig compiler actually does.
					</p>

					<figure>
						<p><b>Figure 3:</b> 
						The tags and union values are stored in two separate allocations, so we're not paying for padding anymore. However, the union collection still has variant fragmentation. 
						</p>
						<p><img alt="A struct-of-arrays transformation of an enum array" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout2.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					Because of Zig's staged compilation, we can have container types that 
					perform this SoA transformation generically for any type. In Rust, 
					we're constrained to proc-macros like <span>soa_derive</span> 
					which has several downsides (e.g. we can't place <span>#[derive]</span> 
					on third-party types without changing their source).
					</p>

					<p>Reducing Variant Fragmentation</p><p>
					This SoA transformation reduces a lot of wasted padding introduced by 
					the enum tag, but still isn't optimal. To really get rid of fragmentation 
					in the values, we can create one vector <i>per variant</i>. 

					</p><figure>
						<p><b>Figure 4:</b> 
						Compared to the SoA layout from before, we have a partial order instead of a total order. So upon insertion, we get back a tagged index that holds both the enum tag and the index in the particular variant array. 
						</p>
						<p><img alt="Visualization of a simple AoVA layout" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout6.webp">
						</p>
					</figure><p>

					I don't think there's a name for this collection, so I call it <i>array of variant arrays</i> (or AoVA). This can be implemented in Rust and Zig, using proc-macros and comptime respectively.

					</p><p>Size Equivalence Classes</p>
					<p>
					We could stop here, but let's consider enums that have <i>lots</i> of variants that can be grouped into a small number of clusters with the same type size:
					</p><div>
<div>
<pre>enum Foo {
    A(u8, u8),
    B(u16),
    C(u16),
    D([u8; 2]),
    E(u32),
    F(u16, u16),
    G(u32),
    H(u32),
    I([u8; 4]),
    J(u32, u32),
    K(u32, (u16, u16)),

						</p>
					</figure>
					</div>

					<p>
					As you can see, the one-vec-per-variant approach would add 15 vectors. 
					It's likely that the number of (re)allocations and system calls would
					increase substantially, and require a lot of memory to amortize
					compared to the naive <span>Vec<foo></foo></span>. 
					The vectors may also be arbitrarily spread in memory, 
					leading to a higher chance of cache conflicts. The AoVA collection itself
					also consumes a lot of memory, bloating any structure it's embedded in. 
					</p>

					<p>
					Now, if we group every variant by size, we get three clusters: 2, 4, and 8 bytes. Such clusters can be allocated together into the same vector - thereby reducing the number of total vectors we have in our container by 80%. So we could realistically store variants of <span>Foo</span> in three clusters:
					</p>
					<div>
<div>
<pre>struct FooVec {
    c_2: Vec&lt;[u8; 2]&gt;, // A - D
    c_4: Vec&lt;[u8; 4]&gt;, // E - I
    c_8: Vec&lt;[u8; 8]&gt;, // J - O
}
</pre></div>
					<figure>
						<p><img alt="The dense AoVA version reduces our vector count to 3" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout5.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>
					</div>

					<p>
					You could say this is a <i>dense</i> version of our AoVA pattern. 
					However, once we colocate different variants in the <i>same allocation</i>,
					we lose the ability to iterate through the vector in a type-safe way. 
					The only way to access elements in such a container is via the tagged 
					pointer that was created upon insertion. If your access pattern does 
					not require blind iteration (which can be the case for flattened, 
					index-based tree structures), this might be a worthwhile trade-off.  
					</p>
					
					<p>
					I've implemented a <a href="https://github.com/dist1ll/osmium">prototype of this data structure in Zig</a>. 
					The most important pieces are the compiler built-ins that allow reflection on
					field types, byte and bit sizes, as well as inspecting the discriminant.
					</p>

					<figure>
					<p><b>Snippet:</b> At its core, it performs straightforward compile-time 
					reflection to compute the clusters and field-to-cluster mappings. We do
					pseudo-dynamic allocation using a stack-allocated vector. 
					The cluster information is used to construct the AoVA data structure.  
					Exact <a href="https://github.com/dist1ll/osmium/blob/127145584fb22b48c05b5dbb14c670001318a81c/src/osmium.zig#L54-L71">source of the snippet is here</a>.
					</p>
<div>
<pre>// determine kind of type (i.e. struct, union, etc.)
switch (@typeInfo(inner)) {
    .Union =&gt; |u| {
        // store mapping from union field -&gt; cluster index
        var field_map = [_]u8{0} ** u.fields.len;

        // iterate over union fields
        for (u.fields, 0..) |field, idx| {
            // compute size
            const space = @max(field.alignment, @sizeOf(field.type));

            // insert into hashtable 
            if (!svec.contains_slow(space)) {
                svec.push(space) catch @compileError(ERR_01);
            }

            field_map[idx] = svec.len - 1;
        }

        // return clusters
        return .{ .field_map = field_map, .sizes = svec };
    },
    else =&gt; @compileError("only unions allowed"),
}
</pre></div>
					</figure>

					<p>
					If you do want type-safe iteration, you could pay the cost of padding, and add the tag back in:
					</p>

					<figure>
						<p><b>Figure 5:</b> 
						We've essentially partitioned the enum on the <i>data-level</i>, 
						leaving the interpretation at the type-level untouched
						</p>
						<p><img alt="Dense AoVA layout with additional tag and padding" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout3.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					If the padding is too much, you can do an SoA transformation on each of the variant arrays.
					</p>

					<figure>
						<p><b>Figure 6:</b> Here we have a similar partitioning, but without
						the padding. The downside is that we're doubling the vector count.
						</p>
						<p><img alt="Dense AoVA layout, with tag and per-cluster SoA transformation" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout4.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					So as you can see, there's quite a few trade-offs we can make in this space - 
					and they all depend on the concrete memory layout of our enum. 
					</p>

					<p>
					While creating such data structures is pretty straightforward in Zig, 
					creating any of these examples in Rust using proc macros is basically 
					impossible - the reason being that proc macros don't have access to 
					type information like size or alignment. While you could have a proc 
					macro generate a <span>const fn</span> that computes the clusters for a particular 
					enum, this function cannot be used to specify the length of an array 
					for a <i>generic</i> type.
					</p>

					<p>
					Another limit to Rust's generics is that the implementation of a 
					generic container cannot be conditioned on whether the given type is 
					an enum or a struct. 
					In Zig, we can effectively do something like this:
					</p>

					<figure>
<div>
<pre>// this is pseudocode
struct EfficientContainer<t> {
    if(T.isEnum()) {
        x: EfficientStructArray<t>,
    } else {
        x: EfficientEnumArray<t>,
    }
}
</t></t></t></pre></div>
					</figure>
					<p>
					We can also specialize the flavor of our AoVA implementation based on the enum. Maybe the benefits of colocating different variants only starts to make sense if we reduce the number of vectors by more than 90%. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					So ultimately we gain a lot of fine-grained control over data structure selection. And if we have good heuristics, we can let the type-aware staging mechanism select the best implementation for us. To me, this represents a huge step in composability for high-performance systems software. 
					</p>

					<p>Bonus: Determining Index Bitwidth at Compile Time</p>
					<p>
					There's another pretty crazy feature that Zig's staged compilation 
					model gets you: if you know the maximum capacity of your data structure 
					at compile time, you can pass that information to the type-constructing function
					and let it determine the bitwidth of the returned tagged index.
					</p>

					<p>
					When this tagged index is included in a subsequent data structure, let's say another enum, this information carries over naturally, and the bits that we didn't need can be used for the discriminant!
					</p>

					<p>
					So what Zig gives you is <i>composable</i> memory efficiency. By being 
					specific about the number of bits you need, different parts of the code 
					can take advantage of that. And with implicit widening integer coercion, 
					dealing with APIs of different bitwidths stays ergonomic. In a way, 
					this reminds me a lot of refinement typing and ranged integers, so this 
					ties in a lot with my <a href="https://alic.dev/blog/custom-bitwidth">post on custom bitwidth integers</a>. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Conclusion</p><p>
					Writing extremely efficient generic data structures in Rust is not 
					always easy - in some cases they incur lots of accidental complexity, 
					in some others they're essentially impossible to implement. I think 
					one of the biggest takeaways for me with regards to staged compilation 
					was the ability to be composable on a memory layout level. If you're 
					developing a systems programming language that embraces efficiency and 
					zero-cost abstractions, you should absolutely take another look at 
					staged programming and in particular Zig's comptime.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This is outside of my normal software-focused beat, but I met some folks who were very interested in public policy recently. I found, to my surprise, that I probably understand one innovative Japanese tax policy better than very well-informed people who geek out about tax policy [<a href="#footnote-0">0</a>].</p>

<p>This post hopefully fixes that bug. (Hat tip to <a href="http://www.gwern.net/">gwern</a> for suggesting I write it up.)</p>

<h2 id="two-countries-in-one-border">Two countries in one border</h2>

<p>The Japanese employment market has a curious feature: there are regions of Japan with extremely high economic productivity (such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, but for the purpose of this issue think “Tokyo” and you won’t be wrong) and regions with low economic productivity (substantially everywhere else). This counsels that a young person born and educated in e.g. Gifu move to Tokyo after graduation to earn a living.</p>

<p>Many, many do. While Japan’s overall population is declining, Tokyo’s increases by about 100,000 people per year.</p>

<p>The regions in Japan are not thrilled about this state of affairs for many reasons. Tokyo isn’t just the seat of Japanese commerce; it also houses the government, media, cultural institutions, etc etc. There is a real sense that your children moving to Tokyo causes them to lose connection with their culture and that the rewards from the national enterprise aren’t being allocated fairly. Tokyo, for its perspective, views the regions with the noblesse oblige that you would expect a cosmopolitan center of culture and learning to have with respect to their benighted country bumpkin cousins.</p>

<p>(If this sounds like it echoes the political economy of, say, two large English-speaking nations recently, well, folks greatly overestimate how different Western nations are from each other.)</p>

<h2 id="a-misalignment-in-incentives-for-human-capital-development">A misalignment in incentives for human capital development</h2>

<p>Educating children is incredibly expensive. The regions are quite annoyed that they pay to educate their children but that Tokyo reaps all the benefits. This state of affairs has continued for decades.</p>

<p>But Japan has a policy response for it, and it is sort of beautiful. Called ふるさと納税 (<em>Furusato Nouzei</em> or, roughly, the Hometown Tax System), it works something like this:</p>

<p>A substantial portion of Japan’s income-based taxes are residence taxes, which are paid to the city and prefecture (think state) that one resides in, based on one’s income in the previous year. The rate is a flat 10% of taxed income; due to quirks of calculating this which almost certainly aren’t relevant to you, you can estimate this as 8% of what white collar employees think their salary is.</p>

<p>Furusato Nouzei allows you to donate up to 40% of next year’s residence tax to one or many cities/prefectures of your choice, in return for a 1:1 credit on your tax next year. This is entirely opt-in. Anyone can participate, regardless of where they live.</p>

<p>In principle, the idea is to donate to one’s hometown. Importantly, one actually has unfettered discretion as to which city/prefecture one donates to. This has some very important implications discussed later.</p>

<p>Relevantly to your understanding of the incentives here: most Japanese people do not file taxes every year. Income-based taxes are calculated and remitted by employers directly on the behalf of their employees. Participating in the system requires friction which is somewhat above e.g. changing your direct deposit information but far below e.g. filing a tax return.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-the-idea-here">What was the idea here?</h2>

<p>Tokyo and the regions could have resolved their differences through the democratic process, in which the regions outvote Tokyo and could have altered Japan’s national tax and economic policies to their advantage. Tokyo obviously doesn’t want this, and instead agreed to an opt-in system which allays some of the regions’ concerns.</p>

<p>To the extent that taxpayers donate to their hometowns, Tokyo no longer freerides on the substantial public expenditures required to raise and educate internal migrants.</p>

<p>Putting potentially 40% of Tokyo’s residence tax in play is <em>not a small carrot</em>. Individual residence tax is roughly 45% of the city’s revenue. That works out to roughly <a href="http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/FINANCIAL/financial02.htm">$30 billion a year.</a></p>

<p>Now if you were a negotiator for Tokyo back in ~2006 when this was being debated, you might have thought “Hmm, while this <em>sounds</em> like it is putting $12 billion a year into play, it’s not actually nearly that bad for us. People have to take affirmative steps to transfer the money to their city of choice, and they have to float the money for most of a year, because of the donate-then-credit mechanism. Uptake on that won’t be that high. Maybe we’ll lose a few tens of millions of dollars; no biggie. Silly country bumpkins; can’t even math.”</p>

<p>But after the system was created, city governments started getting really creative. And what happened next is by parts beautiful and crazy.</p>

<h2 id="incentives-rule-everything-around-me">Incentives rule everything around me</h2>

<p>There exists a culture in Japan of reciprocating gifts. While it varies based on where you live, in the areas I’ve lived, the general rule of thumb is 30%: if you give someone $300 cash on the occasion of their wedding, as is customary for gainfully employed people with respect to someone outside their immediate family, they’re socially obligated to find a way to give you $90 of value back. (The mechanisms for doing this could merit their own post; the word is 返礼品. A dictionary translates this as “quid pro quo”, but the sentiment does not match the common English usage of that phrase. This is simply a ritual; to not participate in it would be non-normative.)</p>

<p>While not formally defined in the legislation for the Furusato Nouzei system, someone at a city government figured that it was just not appropriate to let someone just give ~3% of their salary to the city without receiving a token of appreciation in return. So they sent something back; a can of locally-produced plums, say, to remind you of the tastes of your childhood.</p>

<p>And this was a beautiful idea! It directly improved the ability of the system to cement relationships between internal migrants and their hometowns, one of the declared goals of the system. It motivated people to fill out paperwork and float the city a bit of money for part of a year, because who doesn’t like free plums. (You might sensibly object that they aren’t free given the time value of money, but prevailing interest rates in Japan are indistinguishable from zero.) And it let cities specialize in marketing this initiative.</p>

<p>And specialize they did.</p>

<p>A number of cities in Japan, including my adoptive home town of Ogaki, have made this offer: for a no-cost-to-you donation of $100 or more, the city will send someone out to any grave in the city limits. That person will clean the grave, make an appropriate offering, and send you a photo. This is a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>Most of the gifts are more prosaic. Locally produced food is very popular. If you miss the taste of home, they’ve got you covered.</p>

<p>Cities partnered with local firms to handle the e-commerce aspect, and eventually with platforms to bundle many different items into a single donation; think of it as a shopping cart you could fill with donated money.</p>

<p>And then someone asked a fateful question.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-your-hometown-anyway">Where is your hometown, anyway?</h2>

<p>The Furusato Nouzei system does not define what a “hometown” is. This is mostly by design; Japan historically has a <em>very</em> long-lasting official record of birthplaces which follows one throughout life called the Family Register, and (for reasons outside the scope of this post) it is a major societal issue. Additionally, there was some sentiment that one could have a it-feels-like-home connection to a city that wasn’t necessarily one’s birthplace.</p>

<p>Maybe you were born in Tokyo but lived 30 years in a small town in Aichi, like my wife. Maybe you were born abroad but lived 10 years in Ogaki, like me. Maybe you just loved the onsen in Gero and wanted to subsidize them. The government wasn’t willing to adjudicate one’s “true” hometown; 帰る場所 is where the heart is.</p>

<p>And then some bureaucrat realized that this created a market: you, as a city government, can bid for taxpayers to select you as a hometown.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-that-work">How does that work?</h2>

<p>Well, remember the sites which are acting as brokers for donations? They all have search engines, so that you can search by e.g. who has wagyu available if that is your thing.</p>

<p>Your thing could, plausibly, be travel to your hometown. So your hometown could, plausibly, buy you tickets back to home. But this would be gratuitously operationally intensive.</p>

<p>You have to call city hall. They have to arrange transport. Why do this when Japan is a country with perfectly functioning travel agencies? It would be far better for everyone for your hometown to just send you a gift card to a travel agency.</p>

<p>See where this is going yet? A gift card for e.g. Japan’s largest travel agency is a highly liquid cash equivalent. In addition to using it for any good or service from that travel agency, you could liquidate it for about 97 cents on the dollar in any gift certificate exchange in the country. (These are extraordinarily common in Japan.)</p>

<p>A few rounds of vigorous capitalism later, many rural towns without large expatriate (inpatriate?) populations and without much to differentiate them in terms of local food had bid the consideration for a donation up, up, up. Eventually the central government stepped in and said that the maximum they’d allow is you rewarding a taxpayer with 50% of the donation in consideration.</p>

<p>So, if you “donate” ~3% of your gross salary to one of these cities (which is 1:1 matched by e.g. Tokyo; you’re donating someone else’s money), they will give you ~1.5% of it back in all-but-cash.</p>

<p>In 2008, about 33,000 people participated in the Furusato Nouzei system, principally out of genuine charitable concern. In 2016, it was about 2.2 million. They donated on the order of $2.5 billion. The primary accelerant was the bidding war. A contributor was the popularization of Internet sites to broker the donations, which substantially reduce the friction required to participate.</p>

<p>Running a site is a very good business to be in; it’s like running an e-commerce business with the special wrinkle that your customers are entirely price insensitive. There are a variety of smaller concerns, but the large Japanese Internet giants (Rakuten, Yahoo, etc) all use their massive built-in distribution and relationships to get an edge here. (The business model is simple: take the money from taxpayers, deduct a cut, spend some on gifts authorized by the city, and remit the remainder to the city periodically. You then periodically give the city an Excel file full of taxpayers. The city periodically sends their donors the requisite paperwork to get the tax credit the next year.)</p>

<p>I’d estimate that intermediaries probably soak up somewhere between 5% and 10% of the total donated. This is quite inefficient to accomplish a government-to-government reallocation of resources, but by the standards of Japanese public works projects it is practically free.</p>

<p>(Jokes aside: my estimate is informed by the fact that the margins are rich enough such that the intermediaries will <em>happily</em> support you making a donation on credit cards. The actual numbers are probably in a public disclosure somewhere but I don’t have enough time to go looking.)</p>

<h2 id="is-this-sustainable">Is this sustainable?</h2>

<p>Probably? There has been some talk of rolling back the bidding war via administrative fiat, but the cities are quite opposed to this. It’s a great game theory problem: unless a supermajority of cities collectively agrees to limit gifts to a token number, it’s strongly in a city’s interest to duck the central government’s questionnaires and not express any objection to the status quo. (Also remember that the natural anchor for reciprocation is set quite high across much of Japan; the government might succeed in capping reciprocation at 30% but that might be a hard floor for the ceiling.)</p>

<p>The penetration rate of this system will likely continue quickly increasing. It’s socially viral: a tax optimization that virtually anyone can take advantage of, has the explicit backing of the government, and feels wholesome. If you’re one of the relatively few taxpayers in Japan who has an accountant, expect them to tell you about this in detail and strongly recommend you max our your contribution every year.</p>

<p>Widespread gaming or no, the system pretty much works according to the internal aims. Cities get a list of their internal diaspora, and do make considerably more effort to stay in touch with them than they did previously. (This includes lovely holiday cards and sometimes even I-can’t-believe-they’re-not-alumni-magazines.) You really do get plums from childhood in your mail from your hometown (if you don’t optimize for cash equivalents). Cities with declining local tax bases really do get enough money to do material projects with. Tokyo takes a hit to revenue but can afford it.</p>

<p>And there, that’s Japan’s most novel redistribution program in a nutshell.</p>

<p>If you live in Japan and want to take advantage of this, hit up your local Google; many sites are happy to make it happen for you. (I don’t endorse any in particular, but any of the top brands or organic search results will work substantially as advertised.)</p>

<p><a name="footnote-0"></a>
[0]: I had been of the impression up until today that it was literally not on the English-speaking Internet, but this seems to have changed in the last few years. That said, nobody seems to have written about the policy angle in English yet, so here we are.</p>
