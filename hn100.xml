</figcaption>  </figure><p>Since then further negative headlines for Boeing linked to safety issues have harmed its reputation, to the point that a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/americans-will-pay-more-avoid-boeing-1887254" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of Americans would pay more to avoid flying on its aircraft</a>, according to a recent poll. <em>Newsweek</em> contacted Spirit and Boeing for comment by email early on Thursday.</p><p>Dean, then a quality auditor at Spirit, had flagged lax standards and the presence of an "excessive amount of defects" at a Boeing manufacturing plant in Wichita, Kansas, back in October 2022, according to a December 2023 lawsuit mentioned by NPR in January.</p><p>A mechanical engineer with years of experience, Dean had initially been employed by Spirit between March 2019 and May 2020, when he was among the many staffers being let go by the company during mass layoffs, according to the lawsuit. He returned to Spirit in late May 2021 as a product and process verification (PPV) core quality auditor. He later became a level 2 stress engineer, until his contract was terminated by the company in late April 2023.</p><p>In October 2022, he flagged what he said were serious manufacturing defects to management, but said that nothing was done. According to the lawsuit, Spirit "concealed" the issues flagged by Dean from investors until they were revealed by independent reporting in August 2023, 10 months later.</p>	<figure data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action="Click">
</figure><p>The whistleblower claimed that the company had fired him in retaliation for flagging the defects at the Wichita plant, using a "false justification" (the failure to spot a manufacturing flaw in the fittings that attach the vertical tail fin to the fuselage during an audit) as a pretext to "scapegoat and silence him," the lawsuit reads.</p><p>Dean had also filed a complaint against Spirit with the Federal Aviation Administration, accusing the company of "serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line" at the manufacturer. The investigation concluded that Dean's allegations had substance, but did not provide further details.</p><p>Dean's sudden death at the age of 45 was announced by his aunt and sister on social media on Tuesday. His mother wrote on <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/facebook" data-sys="1">Facebook</a> that he had contracted pneumonia in April and suffered a stroke following an MSRA infection.</p><p><em>The Seattle Times</em> wrote that Dean "had been in good health and was noted for having a healthy lifestyle," but had died after contracting "a sudden, fast-spreading infection."</p><p>Dean's lawyer Brian Knowles described his death to Al-Jazeera as a "loss to the aviation community and the flying public." <em>Newsweek</em> contacted Knowles Law Firm for comment by email early on Thursday.</p><p>"Our thoughts are with Josh Dean's family. This sudden loss is stunning news here at Spirit and for his loved ones," a spokesperson for Spirit told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p><p>Barnett was found dead in an apparent suicide in March in the midst of giving depositions against Boeing, alleging that the company retaliated against him for exposing safety issues with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. An investigation into his death is still ongoing.</p><p><em>If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text "988" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to </em><a rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank"><em>988lifeline.org</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Update, 5/2/2024, 5:20 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to include more background information.</em></p><p><em>Update, 5/2/2024, 9:28 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with a comment from Spirit.</em></p><div><div><h2>Uncommon Knowledge</h2><p>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p></div><p>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p></div>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Former Spirit AeroSystems employee Joshua Dean dies after sudden illness, family says.</em></p></div><div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p>A whistleblower who accused a Boeing supplier of ignoring defects in the production of the 737 MAX has died, family members and his lawyer have said.</p>
<p>Joshua Dean, a former Spirit AeroSystems employee who alleged he was fired in retaliation for flagging lax standards at the company’s Wichita, Kansas, manufacturing plant, died on Tuesday after a sudden illness, his aunts and sister said in posts on social media.</p>
<p>Dean’s lawyer Brian Knowles said his client’s death was a “loss to the aviation community and the flying public”.</p>
<p>“He possessed tremendous courage to stand up for what he felt was true and right and raised quality and safety issues. Aviation companies should encourage and incentivise those that do raise these concerns. Otherwise, safety and quality are truly not these companies’ top priorities,” Knowles told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Spirit AeroSystems said the company’s thoughts were with his family.</p>
<p>“This sudden loss is stunning news here at Spirit and for his loved ones,” a spokesperson told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Dean’s mother wrote in a Facebook post last month that her son was “fighting for his life” after contracting pneumonia and suffering a stroke following an MRSA infection.</p>
<p>The Seattle Times, which first reported his death, said Dean was 45 years old and had “been in good health and was noted for having a healthy lifestyle”.</p>
<p>Dean’s death comes less than two months after <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/3/12/boeing-whistleblower-found-dead">Boeing whistleblower John Barnett was found dead</a> from what South Carolina authorities said was an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>
<p>Barnett, 62, had been in the midst of a deposition in a lawsuit against Boeing after suffering retaliation for exposing safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, according to his lawyers.</p>
<p>Spirit AeroSystems has been under scrutiny since it emerged that it built the door panel that blew out of a 737 MAX 9 in mid-flight in January.</p>
<p>The near-disaster involving Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which is the subject of several probes, was the latest in a series of incidents to raise concerns about safety standards at Boeing.</p>
<p>Dean had filed a complaint against Spirit with the Federal Aviation Administration alleging serious quality failings at its production facility and testified in a shareholder lawsuit against the company.</p>
<p>Dean told US outlet NPR in February that he believed he had been fired to send a message to others thinking of speaking out.</p>
<p>“If you are too loud, we will silence you,” he was quoted as saying.</p>

<p dir="auto">The eSpeak NG is a compact open source software text-to-speech synthesizer for
Linux, Windows, Android and other operating systems. It supports
<a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/languages.md">more than 100 languages and accents</a>. It is based on the eSpeak engine
created by Jonathan Duddington.</p>
<p dir="auto">eSpeak NG uses a "formant synthesis" method. This allows many languages to be
provided in a small size. The speech is clear, and can be used at high speeds,
but is not as natural or smooth as larger synthesizers which are based on human
speech recordings. It also supports Klatt formant synthesis, and the ability
to use MBROLA as backend speech synthesizer.</p>
<p dir="auto">eSpeak NG is available as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/src/espeak-ng.1.ronn">command line</a> program (Linux and Windows) to speak text from a file or
from stdin.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/integration.md">shared library</a> version for use by other programs. (On Windows this is
a DLL).</li>
<li>A SAPI5 version for Windows, so it can be used with screen-readers and
other programs that support the Windows SAPI5 interface.</li>
<li>eSpeak NG has been ported to other platforms, including Solaris and Mac
OSX.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered.</li>
<li>Can produce speech output as a WAV file.</li>
<li>SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) is supported (not complete),
and also HTML.</li>
<li>Compact size.  The program and its data, including many languages,
totals about few Mbytes.</li>
<li>Can be used as a front-end to <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/mbrola.md">MBROLA diphone voices</a>.
eSpeak NG converts text to phonemes with pitch and length information.</li>
<li>Can translate text into phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a
front end for another speech synthesis engine.</li>
<li>Potential for other languages. Several are included in varying stages
of progress. Help from native speakers for these or other languages is
welcome.</li>
<li>Written in C.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">ChangeLog</a> for a description of the changes in the
various releases and with the eSpeak NG project.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <em>espeak-ng</em> binaries use the same command-line options as <em>espeak</em>, with
several additions to provide new functionality from <em>espeak-ng</em> such as specifying
the output audio device name to use. The build creates symlinks of <code>espeak</code> to
<code>espeak-ng</code>, and <code>speak</code> to <code>speak-ng</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The espeak <code>speak_lib.h</code> include file is located in <code>espeak-ng/speak_lib.h</code> with
an optional symlink in <code>espeak/speak_lib.h</code>. This file contains the espeak 1.48.15
API, with a change to the <code>ESPEAK_API</code> macro to fix building on Windows
and some minor changes to the documentation comments. This C API is API and ABI
compatible with espeak.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>espeak-data</code> data has been moved to <code>espeak-ng-data</code> to avoid conflicts with
espeak. There have been various changes to the voice, dictionary and phoneme files
that make them incompatible with espeak.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>espeak-ng</em> project does not include the <em>espeakedit</em> program. It has moved
the logic to build the dictionary, phoneme and intonation binary files into the
<code>libespeak-ng.so</code> file that is accessible from the <code>espeak-ng</code> command line and
C API.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">History</h2><a id="user-content-history" aria-label="Permalink: History" href="#history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The program was originally known as <strong>speak</strong> and originally written
for Acorn/RISC_OS computers starting in 1995 by Jonathan Duddington. This was
enhanced and re-written in 2007 as <strong>eSpeak</strong>, including a relaxation of the
original memory and processing power constraints, and with support for additional
languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">In 2010, Reece H. Dunn started maintaining a version of eSpeak on GitHub that
was designed to make it easier to build eSpeak on POSIX systems, porting the
build system to autotools in 2012. In late 2015, this project was officially
forked to a new <strong>eSpeak NG</strong> project. The new eSpeak NG project is a significant
departure from the eSpeak project, with the intention of cleaning up the
existing codebase, adding new features, and adding to and improving the
supported languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>historical</em> branch contains the available older releases of the original
eSpeak that are not contained in the subversion repository.</p>
<p dir="auto">1.24.02 is the first version of eSpeak to appear in the subversion
repository, but releases from 1.05 to 1.24 are available at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/files/espeak/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/files/espeak/</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">These early releases have been checked into the historical branch,
with the 1.24.02 release as the last entry. This makes it possible
to use the replace functionality of git to see the earlier history:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git replace 8d59235f 63c1c019"><pre><code>git replace 8d59235f 63c1c019
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The source releases contain the <code>big_endian</code>, <code>espeak-edit</code>,
<code>praat-mod</code>, <code>riskos</code>, <code>windows_dll</code> and <code>windows_sapi</code> folders. These
do not appear in the source repository until later releases, so have
been excluded from the historical commits to align them better with
the 1.24.02 source commit.</p>

<h2 id="org4b21c19"><span>1.</span> The problem</h2>
<div id="text-1">
<p>
Lisp programmers claim that their system of s-expression code in addition to its featureful macro system makes it a
metaprogrammable and generalized system. This is of course true, but there's something very broken with lisp: metaprogramming
and programming <i>aren't the same thing</i>, meaning there will always be rigid syntax within lisp
(its parentheses or the fact that it needs to have characters that tell lisp to <i>read ahead</i>). The left parenthesis tells
lisp that it needs to keep on reading until the right parenthesis in order to finish some process that allows it to stop
and evaluate the whole expression. This makes the left and right parenthesis unchangable from within the language (not
conceptually, but under some implementations it is not possible), and, more importantly, it makes the process of retroactively
changing the sequence in which these tokens are delimited <i>impossible</i>, without a heavy amount of string processing. Other
langauges have other ways in which they need to read ahead when they see a certain token in order to decide what to do.
This process of having a program read ahead based on current input is called <i>syntax</i>.
</p>

<p>
And as long as you read ahead, or assume a default way of reading ahead, you fall into the trap of having some form of syntax.
Cognition is different in that it uses an antisyntax that is fully <i>postfix</i>. This has similarities with concatenative
programming languages, but concatenative programming langauges also suffer from two main problems: first, the introduction
of the left and right bracket character (which is in fact prefix notation, as it needs to read ahead of the input stream),
and the quote character for strings. This is unsuitable for such a general language. You can even see the same problem
in lisp's C syntax implementation: escape characters everywhere, awkward must-have spaces delimit the start and end
of certain tokens (and if not, it requires post-processing). The racket programming language has its macro system,
but it is not <i>runtime dynamic</i>. It still utilizes preprocessing.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the percise solution to this connundrum? Well, it's beautiful; but it requires some <i>cognition</i>.

<h2 id="org3b97608"><span>2.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div id="text-2">
<p>
Cognition is an active research project that Matthew Hinton and I have been working on for the past
couple of months. Although my commit history for <a href="https://github.com/metacrank/cognition">this project</a> has not been impressive, we came up with
a lot of the theory together, working alongside each other in order to achieve one of the most generalized
systems of syntax we know of. Let's take a look at the conceptual reason why cognition needs to exist, as
well as some <i>baremetal cognition</i> code (you'll see what I mean by this later). There's a paper about this language
available about the language in the repository, for those interested. Understanding cognition might require a
lot of background in parsing, tokenization, and syntax, but I've done my best to write this in a very understandable way.
The repository is available at <a href="https://github.com/metacrank/cognition">https://github.com/metacrank/cognition</a>, for your information.

<h2 id="org77b69e3"><span>3.</span> Baremetal Cognition</h2>
<div id="text-3">
<p>
Baremetal cognition has a couple of perculiar attributes, and it is remarkably like the <i>Brainfuck</i> programming language.
But unlike its look-alike, it has the ability to do some <i>serious metaprogramming</i>. Let's take a look at what the
bootstrapping code for a <i>very minimal</i> syntax looks like:
</p>
<pre id="orgfa76d0a">ldfgldftgldfdtgl
df 
 
dfiff1 crank f
</pre>
<p>
And <b>do</b> note the whitespace (line 2 has a whitespace after df, line 3 has a whitespace, and the newlines matter).
Erm, okay. What?
</p>

<p>
So, our goal in this post is to get from a syntax that looks like <i>that</i> to a syntax that looks like <a href="https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz/blog/stem.html">Stem</a>.
But how on earth does this piece of code even work? Well, we have to introduce two new ideas: delimiters, and ignores.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgccf59e3">
<h3 id="orgccf59e3"><span>3.1.</span> Tokenization</h3>
<div id="text-3-1">
<p>
Delimiters allow the tokenizer to figure out when one token ends and another begins. The list of single character tokenizers
is public, allowing that list to be modified and read from within cognition itself. Ignored characters are characters
that are completely ignored by the tokenizer in the first stage of every read-eval-print loop; that is, at the start of
collecting the token, it fist skips a set of ignored characters. By default, every single character is a delimiter, and
no characters are ignored characters. The delimiter and ignored characters list allows you to toggle a flag to tell it
to blacklist or whitelist the given characters, adding brevity (and practicality) to the language.
</p>

<p>
Let's take the first line of code as an example:
</p>
<pre id="orgd8f2f2d">ldfgldftgldfdtgl
</pre>
<p>
because of the delimiter and ignored rules set by default, every single character is read as a token, and no character
is skipped. We therefore read the first character, <code>l</code>. By default, Cognition works off a stack-based programming language
design. If you're not familiar, see the <a href="https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz/blog/stem.html">Stem blogpost</a> for more detail (in fact if you're not familiar this <i>won't work</i>
as an explanation for you, so you should see it, or read up on the <i>Forth</i> programming language).
Though, we call them <i>containers</i>, as they are more general than stacks. Additionally, in this default environment, <i>no</i>
word is executed except for special <i>faliases</i>, as we will cover later.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the character <code>l</code> gets read in and is put on the stack. Then, the character <code>d</code> is read in and put on the stack.
But <code>f</code> is different. In order to execute words in Cognition, we must take a look at the falias system.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd968480">
<h3 id="orgd968480"><span>3.2.</span> Faliases</h3>
<p>
Faliases are a list of words that get executed when they are put on the stack, or container as we will call it in the future.
All of them in fact execute the equivalent of <code>eval</code> in stem but as soon as they are put on their container. Meaning, when
<code>f</code>, the default falias, is run, it doesn't go on the container, but rather executes the top of the container which is <code>d</code>.
<code>d</code> changes the delimiter list to the string value of a word, meaning that it changes the delimiters to <i>blacklist</i> only
the character <code>l</code> as a delimiter. Everything else by default is a delimiter because everything by default is parsed
into single character words.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfecc467">
<h3 id="orgfecc467"><span>3.3.</span> Delimiter Caveats</h3>
<div id="text-3-3">
<p>
Delimiters have an interesting rule, and that is that the delimiter character is excluded from the tokenized word
unless we have not ignored a character in the tokenization loop, in which case we collect the character as a part of
the current token and keep going. This is in contrast to a third kind of tokenization category called the singlet, which
<i>includes</i> itself into a token before skipping itself and ending the tokenization collection.
</p>

<p>
In addition, remember what I said about the <i>blacklist</i>? Well, you can toggle between <i>blacklisting</i> and <i>whitelisting</i>
your list of delimiters, singlets, and ignored characters. By default, there are no <i>blacklisted</i> delimiters, no
<i>whitelisted</i> singlets, and no <i>whitelisted</i> ignored characters.
</p>

<p>
We then also observe that all other characters will simply skip themselves while being collected as a part of the current
token, without ending this loop, therefore collecting new characters until the loop halts via delimiter or singlet rules.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orged57430">
<h3 id="orged57430"><span>3.4.</span> Continuing the Bootstrap Code</h3>
<div id="text-3-4">
<p>
So far, we looked at this part of the code:
</p>
<pre id="orgbd064f8">ldf
</pre>
<p>
which simply creates <code>l</code> as a non-delimiter. Now, for the rest of the code:
</p>
<pre id="org57ac2d1">gldftgldfdtgl
df 
  
dfiff1 crank f
</pre>
<p>
<code>gldf</code> puts <code>gl</code> on the stack due to <code>d</code> being a delimiter, and <code>f</code> is called on it, meaning that now <code>g</code> and <code>l</code> are
the only non-delimiters. Then, <code>tgl</code> gets put on the stack and they become non-delimiters with <code>df</code>. <code>dtgl</code> gets
put on the stack, and the newline becomes the only non-delimiter with <code>\ndf</code> (yes, the newline is actually a part of
the code here, and spaces need to be as well in order for this to work). Then, the space character, due to how delimiter
rules work (if you don't ignore, the first character is parsed normally even if it is a delimiter)
and <code>\n</code> gets put on the stack. Then, another <code>\ \n</code> word is tokenized (you might not see it, but there's another
space on line 3). The current stack looks like this (bottom to top):
</p>
<pre id="org9630bb4">3. dtgl
2. [space char]\n
1. [space char]\n
</pre>
<p>
<code>df</code> sets the non-delimiters to <code>\ \n</code>. <code>if</code> sets the ignores to <code>\ \n</code>, which ignores these characters at the start
of tokenization. <code>f</code> executes <code>dtgl</code>, which is a word that toggles the <i>dflag</i>, the flag that stores the whitelist/blacklist
distinction for delimiters. Now, all non-delimiters are delimiters and all delimiters are non-delimiters.
Finally, we're put in an environment where spaces and newlines are the delimiters for tokens, and they are ignored at the
start of tokenizing a token. Next, <code>1</code> is tokenized and put on the stack, and then the <code>crank</code> word, which is then executed
by <code>f</code> (the <code>1</code> token is treated as a number in this case, but everything textual in cognition is a word).
We are done our bootstrapping sequence! Now, you might wonder what <code>crank</code> does. That we will explain in a later section.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div id="outline-container-org7f6ffa3">
<h2 id="org7f6ffa3"><span>4.</span> Bootstrapping Takeaways</h2>
<p>
From this, we see a couple principles: first, cognition is able to change how it tokenizes on the fly and it can do it
programmatically, allowing you to program a program in cognition that would theoretically automate the process of changing
these delimiters, singlets, and ignores. This is something impossible in other languages, being able to
<i>program your own tokenizer for some foreign language from within cognition</i>, and have
<i>future code be tokenized exactly like how you want it to be</i>. This is solely possible because the language is postfix
and doesn't read ahead, so it doesn't require more than one token to be parsed before an expression is evaluated. Second,
faliases allow us to execute words without having to have prefix words or any default execution of words.
</p>
</div><div id="outline-container-org0457514">
<h2 id="org0457514"><span>5.</span> Crank</h2>
<div id="text-5">
<p>
The <i>metacrank</i> system allows us to set a default way in which tokens are executed on the stack. The <code>crank</code> word takes
a number as its argument and by effect executes the top of the stack for every <code>n</code> words you put on the stack. To make
this concept concrete, let's look at some code (running from what we call <i>crank 1</i> as we set our environment to
crank one at the end of the bootstrapping sequence):
</p>
<pre id="org9978e80">5 crank 2crank 2 crank
1 crank unglue swap quote prepose def
</pre>
<p>
the crank 1 environment allows us to stop using <code>f</code> in order to evaluate tokens. Instead, every <i>1</i> token that is
tokenized is evaluated. Since we programmed in a newline and space-delimited syntax, we can safely interpret this code
intuitively.
</p>

<p>
The code begins by trying to evaluate <code>5</code>, which evaluates to itself as it is not a builtin. <code>crank</code> evaluates and puts
us in 5 crank, meaning every <i>5th</i> token evaluates from here on. <code>2crank</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>crank</code>, <code>1</code> are all put on the stack,
leaving us with a stack that looks like so (notice that <code>crank</code> doesn't get executed even though it is a bulitin because
we set ourselves to using crank 5):
</p>
<pre id="org7d54adf">4. 2crank
3. 2
2. crank
1. 1
</pre>
<p>
<code>crank</code> is the 5th word, so it executes. Note that this puts us back in crank 1, meaning every word is evaluated.
<code>unglue</code> is a builtin that gets the value of the word at the top of the stack (as <code>1</code> is used up by the <code>crank</code> we
evaluated), and so it gets the value of <code>crank</code>, which is a builtin. What that in effect does is it gets the function
pointer associated with the crank builtin. Our new stack looks like this:
</p>
<pre id="orge55cca4">3. 2crank
2. 2
1. [CLIB]
</pre>
<p>
Where CLIB is our function pointer that points to the <code>crank</code> builtin. We then <code>swap</code>:
</p>
<pre id="orgd45a0ba">3. 2crank
2. [CLIB]
1. 2
</pre>
<p>
then <code>quote</code>, a builtin that quotes the top thing on the stack:
</p>
<pre id="org6db7950">3. 2crank
2. [CLIB]
1. [2]
</pre>
<p>
then prepose, a builtin like <code>compose</code> in stem, except that it preposes and that it puts things in what we call a VMACRO:
</p>
<pre id="orgfc72b7c">2. 2crank
1. ( [2] [CLIB] )
</pre>
<p>
then we call <code>def</code>. This defines a word <code>2crank</code> that puts <code>2</code> on the stack and then calls a function pointer pointing
us to the crank builtin. Now, we still have to define what VMACROs are, and in order to do that we might have to explain
some differences between the cognition stack and the stem stack.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgbc4ce5f">
<h3 id="orgbc4ce5f"><span>5.1.</span> Differeneces</h3>
<p>
In the stem stack, putting words on the stack directly is allowed. In cognition, words are put in containers when
they are put on the stack and not evaluated. This means words like <code>compose</code> in stem work on words (or more accurately
containers with a single word in them) as well as other containers, making the API for this language more consistent.
Additionally, words like <code>cd</code> as we will make use of this concept.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54f2537">
<h4 id="org54f2537"><span>5.1.1.</span> Macros</h4>
<p>
Macros are another difference between stem quotes and cognition containers. When macros are evaluated, everything in
the macro is evaluated, ignoring the crank. If bound to a word, evaluating that word evaluates the macro which will ignore
the crank completely and will only increment the cranker by one, while evaluating each statement in the macro. They
are useful for making crank-agnostic code, and expanding macros is very useful for the purpose of optimization, although
we will actually have to write the word <code>expand</code> from more primitive words later on (hint: it uses recursive <code>unglue</code>).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org685ef23">
<h3 id="org685ef23"><span>5.2.</span> More Code</h3>
<div id="text-5-2">
<p>
Here is te rest of the code in <code>bootstrap.cog</code> in <code>coglib/</code>:
</p>
<pre id="org2a708c8">getd dup _ concat _ swap d i 
_quote_swap_quote_compose_swap_dup_d_i eval 

2crank ing 0 crank spc
2crank ing 1 crank swap quote def

2crank ing 1 crank swap quote def
2crank ing 1 crank

2crank ing 2 crank swap unglue concat unglue fread unglue evalstr unglue
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast def
2crank ing 1 crank
2crank ing 1 crank getargs 1 split swap drop 1 split drop
2crank ing 1 crank
2crank ing 1 crank epop drop
2crank ing 1 crank INDEX spc OUT spc OF spc RANGE
2crank ing 1 crank concat concat concat concat concat concat =

2crank ing 1 crank
2crank ing 0 crank fread evalstr
2crank ing 1 crank compose
2crank ing 1 crank
2crank ing 1 crank if
</pre>
<p>
Okay, well, the syntax still doesn't look so good, and it's still pretty hard to get what this is doing. But the
basic idea is that <code>2crank</code> is a macro and is therefore crank agnostic, and we guarantee its execution with <code>ing</code>, another
falias (because it's funny). Then, we execute an <code>n crank</code>, which standardizes what crank each line is in (you might
wonder what <code>ing</code> and <code>f</code>'s interaction is with the cranker. It actually just guarantees the evaluation of the previous
thing, so if the previous thing already evaluated <code>f</code> and <code>ing</code> both do nothing). In any case, this defines words that
are useful, such as <code>load</code>, which loads something from the coglib. It does this by <code>compose</code>-ing things into quotes and
then <code>def</code>-ing those quotes.
</p>

<p>
The crank, and by extension, the metacrank system is needed in order to discriminate between <i>evaluating</i> some tokens
and <i>storing</i> others for metaprogramming without having to use <code>f</code>, while also keeping the system postfix. Crank
is just one word that allows for this type of behavior; the more general word, <code>metacrank</code>, allows for much more
interesting kinds of syntax manipulation. We have examples of <code>metacrank</code> down the line, but for now I should explain
the <i>metacrank word</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcf6ff88">
<h3 id="orgcf6ff88"><span>5.3.</span> Metacrank</h3>
<div id="text-5-3">
<p>
<code>n m metacrank</code> sets a periodic evaluation <code>m</code> for an element <code>n</code> items down the stack. The <code>crank</code> word is therefore
equivalent to <code>0 m metacrank</code>. Only one token can be evaluated per tokenized token, although <i>every</i> metacrank is incremented
per token, where lower metacranks get priority. This means that if you set two different metacranks, only <i>one</i> of them
can execute per token tokenized, and the lower metacrank gets priority. Note that metacrank and, by extension, crank,
don't <i>just</i> depend on tokenized words; they also work while evaluating word definitions recursively, meaning if a word
is evaluated in <code>2 crank</code>, one out of two words will execute in each level of the evaluation tree. You can play around
with this in the repl to get a sense of how it works: run <code>../crank bootstrap.cog repl.cog devel.cog load</code>
in the coglib folder, and use stem like syntax in order to define a function. Then, run that function in <code>2 crank</code>.
You will see how the evaluation tree respects cranking in the same way that the program file itself does.
</p>

<p>
Metacrank allows for not only metaprogramming in the form of code building, but also
direct syntax manipulation (i.e. <i>I want to execute this token once I have read n other token(s)</i>). The advantages to
this system compared to other programming languages' systems are clear: you can program a prefix word and <code>undef</code> it
when you want to rip out that part of syntax. You can write a prefix character that doesn't stop at an ending character
but <i>always</i> stops when you read a certain number of tokens. You can feed user input into a math program and feed the
output into a syntax system like metacrank. The possibilities are endless! And with that, we will slowly build up the
<code>stem</code> programming language, v2, now with macros and from within our own <i>cognition</i>.

<h2 id="orge84673e"><span>6.</span> The Stem Dialect, Improved</h2>
<div id="text-6">
<p>
In this piece of code, we define the <i>comment</i>:
</p>
<pre id="org4c9a355">2crank ing 0 crank ff 1
2crank ing 1 crank cut unaliasf
2crank ing 0 crank 0
2crank ing 1 crank cut swap quote def
2crank ing 0 crank
2crank ing 0 crank #
2crank ing 0 crank geti getd gets crankbase f d f i endl s
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose
2crank ing 0 crank drop halt crank s d i
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast quote compose
2crank ing 0 crank halt 1 quote ing 1 quote ing metacrank
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast
2crank ing 1 crank def
2crank ing 2 crank # singlet # delim
2crank ing 1 crank #comment: geti getd gets crankbase '' d '' i '\n' s ( drop halt crank s d i ) halt 1 1 metacrank
</pre>
<p>
and it is our first piece of code that builds something <i>truly</i> prefix. The comment character is a prefix that drops
all the text before the newline character, which is a type of word that tells the parser to <i>read ahead</i>. This is our
first indication that everything that we thought was possible within cognition truly <i>is</i>.
</p>

<p>
But before that, we can look at the first couple of lines:
</p>
<pre id="org2c444c5">2crank ing 0 crank ff 1
2crank ing 1 crank cut unaliasf
2crank ing 0 crank 0
2crank ing 1 crank cut swap quote def
2crank ing 0 crank
</pre>
<p>
which simply unaliases <code>f</code> from the falias list, with <code>ing</code> being the only remaining falias. In cognition, even these
faliases are changeable.
</p>

<p>
Since we can't put <code>f</code> directly on the stack (if we try by just using <code>f</code>, it would execute), we instead utilize some
very minimal string processing to do it, putting <code>ff</code> on the stack and then cutting the string in half to get two copies
of <code>f</code>. We then want <code>f</code> to mean false, which in cognition is just an empty word. Therefore, we make an empty word by
calling <code>0 cut</code> on this string, and then <code>def</code>-ing f to the empty string. The following code is where the comment is
defined:
</p>

<pre id="org7cec6fa">2crank ing 0 crank #
2crank ing 0 crank geti getd gets crankbase f d f i endl s
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose
2crank ing 0 crank drop halt crank s d i
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast quote compose
2crank ing 0 crank halt 1 quote ing 1 quote ing metacrank
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast
2crank ing 1 crank def
2crank ing 2 crank # singlet # delim
2crank ing 1 crank #comment: geti getd gets crankbase '' d '' i '\n' s ( drop halt crank s d i ) halt 1 1 metacrank
</pre>
<p>
Relevant: <code>halt</code> just puts you in 0 for all metacranks, and <code>VMACRO cast</code> just turns the top thing on the stack from a
container to a macro. <code>geti</code>, <code>getd</code>, <code>gets</code> gets the ignores, delims, and singlets respectively as a string; <code>drop</code> is
<code>dsc</code> in stem. <code>singlet</code> and <code>delim</code> sets the singlets and delimiters. <code>endl</code> is defined withint <code>bootstrap.cog</code> and just
puts the newline character as a word on the stack. <code>crankbase</code> gets the current crank.
</p>

<p>
we call a lot of <code>compose</code> words in order to build this definition, and we make the <code>#</code> character a singlet delimiter in
order to allow for spaces after the comment. We put ourselves in <code>1 1 metacrank</code> in the <code>#</code> definition while altering
the tokenization rules beforehand in order to tokenize everything until a newline as a token while calling <code>#</code> on said word
in order to effectively drop that comment and get ourselves back in the original crank and metacrank. Thus, the brilliant
<code>#</code> character is written, operating on a token that is tokenized <i>in the future</i>, with complete default postfix syntax.
With the information above, one can work out the specifics of how it works; the point is that it <i>does</i>, and one can test
that it does by going into the <code>coglib</code> folder and running <code>../crank bootstrap.cog repl.cog devel.cog load</code>, which will load
the REPL and load <code>devel.cog</code>, which will in turn load <code>comment.cog</code>.

<div id="outline-container-org44f030d">
<h3 id="org44f030d"><span>6.1.</span> The Great Escape</h3>
<div id="text-6-1">
<p>
Here, we accelerate our way out of this primitive syntax, and it all starts with the great escape character. We make
many great leaps in this section that aren't entirely explained for the sake of brevity, but you are free to play around
with all of these things by using the repl. In any case, I hope you will enjoy this great leap in syntax technology; by
the end, we will have reached something with real <i>structure</i>.
</p>

<p>
Here we define a preliminary prefix escape character. Also you will notice that <code>2crank ing 0 crank</code> is used as
padding between lines:
</p>
<pre id="org0e3b3d9">2crank ing 2 crank comment.cog load
2crank ing 0 crank
2crank ing 1 crank # preliminary escape character \
2crank ing 1 crank \
2crank ing 0 crank halt 1 quote ing crank

2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose
2crank ing 2 crank VMACRO cast
2crank ing 1 crank def
2crank ing 0 crank
2crank ing 0 crank
</pre>
<p>
This allows for escaping so that we can put something on the stack even if it is to be evaluated,
but we want to redefine this character eventually to be compatible with stem-like quotes. We're
even using our comment character in order to annotate this code by now! Here is the full quote definition (once we have
this definition, we can use it to improve itself):

Um, it's quite the spectacle how Matthew Hinton ever came up with this thing, but alas, it exists. Then, we use it in
order to redefine itself, but better as the old quote definition can't do recursive quotes
(we can do this because the definition is <i>used</i> before you redefine the word due to postfix <code>def</code>, a
development pattern seen often in low level cognition):
</p>
<pre id="org83d40ff">\ [

<p>
Okay, so now we can use recursive quoting, just like in stem. But there are still a couple things missing that we probably
want: a good string quote implementation, and probably escape characters that work in the brackets. Also, since Cognition
utilizes macros, we probably want a way to notate those as well, and we probably want a way to expand macros. We can do
all of that! First, we will have to redefine <code>\</code> once more:
</p>
<pre id="org4a03906">\ \
[ [ 1 ] metacrankbase [ 1 ] = ]
[ halt [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank quote compose [ dup ] dip swap ]
\ VMACRO cast quote quote compose
[ halt [ 1 ] crank ] VMACRO cast quote quote compose
[ if halt [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank ] compose \ VMACRO cast
def
</pre>
<p>
This piece of code defines the bracket but for macros (split just splits a list into two):
</p>
<pre id="org0010001">\ (
\ [ unglue
[ 11 ] split swap [ 10 ] split drop [ macro ] compose
[ 18 ] split quote [ prepose ] compose dip
[ 17 ] split eval eval
[ 1 ] del [ \ ) ] [ 1 ] put
quote quote quote [ prepose ] compose dip
[ 16 ] split eval eval
[ 1 ] del [ \ ) ] [ 1 ] put
quote quote quote [ prepose ] compose dip
prepose
def
</pre>
<p>
We want these macros to automatically expand because it's more efficient to bind already expanded macros to words,
and they functionally evaluate identically (<code>isdef</code> just returns a boolean where true is a non-empty string, false
is an empty string, if a word is defined):
</p>
<pre id="org6f539f6">\ (
( crankbase [ 1 ] metacrankbase dup [ 1 ] =
  [ ( dup \ ) =
      ( drop swap drop swap [ 1 ] swap metacrank swap crank quote compose ( dup ) dip swap )
      ( dup dup dup \ [ = swap \ ( = or swap \ \ = or
        ( eval )
        ( dup isdef ( unglue ) [ ] if compose ( dup ) dip swap )
        if )
      if ) ]
  [ ( dup \ ) =
      ( drop swap drop swap [ 1 ] swap metacrank swap crank )
      ( dup dup dup \ [ = swap \ ( = or swap \ \ = or
        ( eval )
        ( dup isdef ( unglue ) [ ] if compose ( dup ) dip swap )
        if )
      if ) ]
  if dup macro swap
  [ 0 ] crank [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank ) def
</pre>
<p>
and you can see that as we define more things, our language is beginning to look more or less like it has syntax!
In this <code>quote.cog</code> file which we have been looking at, there are more things, but the bulk of it is pretty much done.
From here on, I will just explain the syntax programmed by quote.cog instead of showing the specific code.
</p>

<p>
As an example, here is <code>expand</code>:
</p>
<pre id="org5e3961a"># define basic expand (works on nonempty macros only)
[ expand ]
( macro swap
  ( [ 1 ] split
    ( isword ( dup isdef ( unglue ) ( ) if ) ( ) if compose ) dip
    size [ 0 ] &gt; ( ( ( dup ) dip swap ) dip swap eval ) ( ) if )
  dup ( swap ( swap ) dip ) dip eval drop swap drop ) def

# complete expand (checks for definitions within child first without copying hashtables)
[ expand ]
( size [ 0 ] &gt; ( type [ VSTACK ] = ) ( return ) if ?
  ( macro swap
    macro
    ( ( ( size dup [ 0 ] &gt; ) dip swap ) dip swap
      ( ( ( 1 - dup ( vat ) dip swap ( del ) dip ) dip compose ) dip dup eval )
      ( drop swap drop )
      if ) dup eval
    ( ( [ 1 ] split
        ( isword
          ( compose cd dup isdef
            ( unglue pop )
              ( pop dup isdef ( unglue ) ( ) if )
            if ) ( ) if
          ( swap ) dip compose swap ) dip
        size [ 0 ] &gt; ) dip swap
      ( dup eval ) ( drop drop swap compose ) if ) dup eval )
  ( expand )
  if ) def
</pre>
<p>
Which recursively expands word definitions inside a quote or macro, using the word <code>unglue</code>. We've used the <code>expand</code>
word in order to redefine itself in a more general case.

<h2 id="org2f4962b"><span>7.</span> The Brainfuck Dialect</h2>
<div id="text-7">
<p>
And returning to whence we came, we define the <i>Brainfuck</i> dialect with our current advanced stem dialect:
</p>
<pre id="orgda535e1">comment.cog load
quote.cog load

[ ] [ ] [ 0 ]

[ &gt; ] [[ swap [[ compose ]] dip size [ 0 ] = [ [ 0 ] ] [[ [ 1 ] split swap ]] if ]] def

    if )
  dup [ 1 ] swap f swap halt [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank

&gt;&lt;+-,.[] dup ( i s itgl f d ) eval
</pre>
<p>
test with <code>../crank -s 2 bootstrap.cog helloworld.bf brainfuck.cog</code>. You may of course load your favorite brainfuck
file with this method. Note that brainfuck.cog isn't a brainfuck parser in the ordinary sense; it actually
<i>defines brainfuck words</i> and <i>tokenizes</i> brainfuck, running it in the native cognition environment.
</p>

<p>
It's very profound, as well, how our current syntax allows us to define an <i>alternate</i> syntax with great ease. It might
make you wonder if it's possible to <i>specifically craft</i> a syntax whose job is to write other syntaxes. Another interesting
observation you might have is that Cognition defines syntax by defining a prefix character as a <i>word</i> that uses metacrank,
rather than reading symbols and deciding what to do based on symbols. It's almost as if the syntax becomes <i>inherent</i> to the
word that's being defined.
</p>

<p>
These two ideas synthesize to create something truly exciting, but that hasn't yet been implemented in the standard library
(though we very much know that it is possible). Introducing: the <i>dialect dialect</i> of Cognition…
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge3e7aa3">
<h3 id="orge3e7aa3"><span>7.1.</span> The Dialect Dialect</h3>
<div id="text-7-1">
<p>
Imagine a word <code>mkprefix</code>, that takes two input words (say for example <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>), and an operation, and
<i>automatically defines</i> <code>[</code> to apply said operation until it hits a <code>]</code> character. This is possible because constructs
like <code>metacrank</code> and <code>def</code> are all just <i>regular words</i>, so it's possible to use <i>them</i> as words to metaprogram with.
In fact, <i>everything</i> is just a word (even <code>d</code>, <code>i</code>, and <code>s</code>), so you can imagine a hyperabstract dialect that includes
words like <code>mkprefix</code>, using syntax to automate the process of implementing more syntax. Such a construct I have not
encountered in <i>any other programming language</i>. Yet, in your own <i>Cognition</i>, you can make nearly anything a reality.
</p>

<p>
Such creative things Matthew Hinton and I have discussed as possibilities regarding the standard library. Right now, the
standard library has metawords that generate abstract words automatically and call them. This is possible through string
concatenation and using <code>def</code> in the definition of another word also (this is also possible in my prior programming
language Stem). We have discussed the possibility of a word that searches for word-generators to abstract its current
wordlist automatically, and we have talked about the possibility of directing this abstraction framework for the purpose
of solving a problem. These are conceptually possible words to write within cognition, and this might give you an idea
of how <i>powerful</i> this idea is.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div id="outline-container-org4746985">
<h2 id="org4746985"><span>8.</span> Theoretical Musings</h2>
<p>
There are a couple of things about Cognition that make it interesting beyond its quirks. For instance,
string processing in this language is equivalent to tokenizer postprocessing, which makes string operations inherently
extremely powerful in this language. It also has potential applications in Symbolic AI and in syntax and grammar research,
where prototypes of languages and metalanguages can be tested with ease. I'd imagine that anyone configuring a program
that reads a configuration file would really want their configuration language to be something like this, where they can
have full freedom over the syntax (and metasyntax) in which they program in (think about a Cognition based shell,
or a Cognition based operating system!). Though, the point of working on this language was never its applications;
its intrinsic beauty is its own philosophical statement.
</p>
</div><div id="outline-container-org089e302">
<h2 id="org089e302"><span>9.</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>
You can imagine cognition can program basically any syntax you would want, and in this article, we demonstrate the power
of the already existing code that makes cognition work. In short, the system allows for true <i>syntax as code</i>, as my
friend Andrei put it; one can <i>dynamically program</i> and even <i>automate</i> the production of syntax. In this article, we
didn't have the space to cover other important Cognition concepts like the <i>Metastack</i> and words like <code>cd</code>, but this
can be done in a part 2 of this blog post. For now, let's leave off here, and we can meet here once more for a <i>part two</i>.

            <p>Researchers at the University of Florida report they have developed an mRNA cancer vaccine that quickly reprograms the immune system to attack glioblastoma in a first-ever human clinical trial of four adult patients.</p>
<p>Their results published in <em><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(24)00398-2">Cell</a> </em>mirror those from preclinical mouse studies, and from a newly reported trial with the mRNA vaccine in 10 pet dogs that developed spontaneous brain tumors. The dogs’ owners had approved their animals’ treatment using the new vaccine as there were no other therapy options. The researchers say the aim is to progress the mRNA vaccine into an expanded Phase I clinical trial involving adult and pediatric brain cancer patients.</p>
<p>The new strategy uses the patient’s own tumor cells to create a personalized vaccine, and also harnesses an engineered complex lipid particle (LP) delivery mechanism, generating multi-lamellar LP aggregates (LPA) that can simultaneously function as vaccines and as immunomodulating agents.</p>
<p>“Instead of us injecting single particles, we’re injecting clusters of particles that are wrapping around each other like onions, like a bag full of onions,” said Elias Sayour, MD, PhD, a UF Health pediatric oncologist who pioneered the new vaccine. “And the reason we’ve done that in the context of cancer is these clusters alert the immune system in a much more profound way than single particles would.” Results from the canine trial showed how the vaccine reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment (TME) within days, allowing the activated immune system cells to fight the tumor.</p>
<p>Among the most impressive findings from the reported study was how quickly the new vaccine, delivered intravenously, triggered a vigorous immune-system response to reject the tumor, said Sayour, who is principal investigator of the RNA Engineering Laboratory within UF’s&nbsp;Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy&nbsp;and a UF Health Cancer Center and McKnight Brain Institute investigator.</p>
<p>“In less than 48 hours, we could see these tumors shifting from what we refer to as ‘cold’—immune cold, very few immune cells, very silenced immune response—to ‘hot,’ very active immune response. That was very surprising given how quick this happened, and what that told us is we were able to activate the early part of the immune system very rapidly against these cancers, and that’s critical to unlock the later effects of the immune response.”</p>
<p>In their paper, the team stated, “In a first-in-human trial, RNA-LPAs elicited rapid cytokine/chemokine release, immune activation/trafficking, tissue-confirmed pseudoprogression, and glioma-specific immune responses in glioblastoma patients … These data support RNA-LPAs as a new technology that simultaneously reprograms the TME while eliciting rapid and enduring cancer immunotherapy.”</p>
<p>Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal type of brain tumor, with a median survival time of around 15 months. Current standard of care involves surgery, radiation, and some combination of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>The new publication is the culmination of promising translational results over seven years of studies, starting in preclinical mouse models and then progressing to a study involving 10 pet dogs that had spontaneously developed terminal brain cancer and had no other treatment options. Dogs offer a naturally occurring model for malignant glioma because they are the only other species that develops spontaneous brain tumors with some frequency, said Sheila Carrera-Justiz, DVM, a veterinary neurologist at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine who is partnering with Sayour on the clinical trials. Gliomas in dogs are universally terminal, she noted.</p>
<p>The canine study yielded promising results, the team reported. “In client-owned canines with terminal gliomas, RNA-LPAs improved survivorship and reprogrammed the TME, which became ‘hot’ within days of a single infusion.” After treating the pet dogs with personalized mRNA vaccines, Sayour’s team then advanced the research to a small FDA-approved clinical trial in four human patients with primary MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma. The study was designed to ensure safety and test feasibility before expanding to a larger trial.</p>
<p>The vaccine was personalized to each patient, with the aim of maximizing immune system response. To generate each vaccine RNA was first extracted from each patient’s own surgically removed tumor, and then the messenger RNA was amplified and wrapped in the newly designed packaging of biocompatible lipid nanoparticles, to make tumor cells “look” like a dangerous virus when reinjected into the bloodstream and prompt an immune-system response.</p>
<p>“In a first-in-human accelerated-dose titration [ADT] study (n = 3), we show that RNA-LPAs elicit rapid cytokine/chemokine release, immune activation/trafficking, and expansion of T cell immunity in immunotherapy-refractory MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma patients,” the team stated. “In the first subject treated on the expanded Phase I trial, we observed significant immunologic response after the fourth vaccine, including tissue-confirmed pseudoprogression, supporting the ability of RNA-LPAs to act as both the peripheral and intratumoral immunomodulators while simultaneously eliciting antigen-specific immunity against glioma-associated antigens.”</p>
<p>Co-author Duane Mitchell, MD, PhD, director of the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute and the UF Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program, further stated, “The demonstration that making an mRNA cancer vaccine in this fashion generates similar and strong responses across mice, pet dogs that have developed cancer spontaneously, and human patients with brain cancer is a really important finding, because oftentimes we don’t know how well the preclinical studies in animals are going to translate into similar responses in patients. And while mRNA vaccines and therapeutics are certainly a hot topic since the COVID pandemic, this is a novel and unique way of delivering the mRNA to generate these really significant and rapid immune responses that we’re seeing across animals and humans.”</p>
<p>The authors acknowledged that it is too early in the trial to assess the clinical effects of the vaccine, but the canine patients lived a median of 139 days, compared with a median survival of 30–60 days typical for dogs with the condition. The authors also noted that one limitation is continued uncertainty about how best to harness the immune system while minimizing the potential for adverse side effects. “Although innate and adaptive responses are critical for cancer immunotherapy, it is not clear how to time the administration of RNA-LPAs (neoadjuvant versus adjuvant treatment) and booster infusions (weekly, biweekly, monthly), or the associated frequency (number of total vaccines), all while reconciling these administrations with standard-of-care approaches including chemoradiation,” they added. With this knowledge, they suggested, it may be possible to develop mRNA backbone constructs that then balance innate and adaptive immunity to maximize the effects.</p>
<p>But despite the noted limitations, the authors wrote, “The work herein reports a distinct approach to reprogram innate immunity while simultaneously polarizing adaptive immune responses. These data highlight the importance of innate immunity in overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression, which is essential for the long-term success of adaptive immunotherapy in many immunologically ‘‘cold’’ tumors.” The results, they pointed out, “… show that RNA-LPAs rapidly reprogram the TME in less than 24 h, allowing simultaneously activated T cells to exert their effector functions. This approach overcomes the first step necessary for successful cancer immunotherapy, tumor immunosuppression and systemic tolerance, allowing effector cells to compete in a hostile immunoregulatory host system to engender rapid and long-lasting immunologic responses across murine, canine, and human cancer.”</p>
<p>The next step will be an expanded Phase I clinical trial, including up to 24 adult and pediatric patients, to validate the initial findings. Once an optimal and safe dose is confirmed, an estimated 25 children would participate in Phase II, said Sayour, an associate professor in the Lillian S. Wells Department of Neurosurgery and the department of pediatrics in the UF College of Medicine, part of UF Health.</p>
<p>For the new clinical trial, Sayour’s lab will partner with a multi-institution consortium, the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, to send the immunotherapy treatment to children’s hospitals across the country. They will do this by receiving an individual patient’s tumor, manufacturing the personalized vaccine at UF and sending it back to the patient’s medical team, said Sayour, co-leader of the Immuno-Oncology and Microbiome research program at the UF Health Cancer Center.</p>
<p>The researchers are hopeful that this could be a new paradigm for how patients are treated and a new platform technology for how the immune system can be modulated. “I am hopeful for how this could now synergize with other immunotherapies and perhaps unlock those immunotherapies,”concluded Sayour. “We showed in this paper that you actually can have synergy with other types of immunotherapies, so maybe now we can have a combination approach of immunotherapy.”</p>

    <p>Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems and one of the first whistleblowers to allege Spirit leadership had ignored manufacturing defects on the 737 MAX, died Tuesday morning after a struggle with a sudden, fast-spreading infection.&nbsp;</p><p>Known as Josh, Dean lived in Wichita, Kan., where Spirit is based. He was 45, had been in good health and was noted for having a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>He died after two weeks in critical condition, his aunt Carol Parsons said.</p><p>Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino said: “Our thoughts are with Josh Dean’s family. This sudden loss is stunning news here and for his loved ones.”</p><p>Dean had given a deposition in a Spirit shareholder lawsuit and also filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration alleging “serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line” at Spirit.</p><p>Spirit fired Dean in April 2023, and he had filed a complaint with the Department of Labor alleging his termination was in retaliation for raising concerns related to aviation safety.</p>
<p>Parsons said Dean became ill and went to the hospital because he was having trouble breathing just over two weeks ago. He was intubated and developed pneumonia and then a serious bacterial infection, MRSA.</p><p>His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was airlifted from Wichita to a hospital in Oklahoma City, Parsons said.

<p>Dean was represented by a law firm in South Carolina that also represented Boeing whistleblower John “Mitch” Barnett. </p><p>Barnett was <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-787-whistleblower-found-dead-in-apparent-suicide/">found dead in an apparent suicide in March</a>. He was in the midst of giving depositions alleging Boeing retaliated against him for complaints about quality lapses when he was found dead from a gunshot wound in Charleston, S.C., where Boeing has its 787 manufacturing facility.&nbsp;</p><p>The Charleston County Coroner’s Office reported Barnett’s death appeared to be “from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.”&nbsp;Almost two months later, the police investigation into his death is still ongoing.</p><p>Brian Knowles, one of Dean’s lawyers, said he didn’t want to speculate about the close timing and circumstances of the two deaths.</p><p>“Whistleblowers are needed. They bring to light wrongdoing and corruption in the interests of society. It takes a lot of courage to stand up,” Knowles said. “It’s a difficult set of circumstances. Our thoughts now are with John’s family and Josh’s family.”</p><p>Dean, a mechanical engineer, began working at Spirit in 2019. He was laid off the next year following pandemic-related job cuts and returned to Spirit in May 2021 as a quality auditor.</p>
<p>In October 2022, Dean said he found a serious manufacturing defect: mechanics improperly drilling holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of the MAX. When he flagged this issue with management, he said nothing was done. </p><p>Focused on those defects, he said he missed during that same audit <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-737-max-production-hit-by-a-new-defect-in-supplier-part/">a separate manufacturing flaw in the fittings that attach the vertical tail fin to the fuselage</a>. When that was discovered in April and caused a delivery pause at Boeing’s Renton plant, Dean was fired.</p><p>Then in August, Spirit announced <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-cfo-says-latest-737-max-defect-will-impact-deliveries-and-profits/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-cfo-says-latest-737-max-defect-will-impact-deliveries-and-profits/">the discovery of improperly drilled holes in the MAX’s aft pressure bulkhead</a>, a flaw that was present in MAXs built as early as 2019. This caused another delivery halt in Renton.</p>      <p>With that discovery, Dean filed a safety complaint with the FAA. He said Spirit had used him as a scapegoat and had lied to the FAA about the aft pressure bulkhead defects.</p><p>“After I was fired, Spirit AeroSystems [initially] did nothing to inform the FAA, and the public” about their knowledge of the aft pressure bulkhead defects, he wrote in his complaint.</p><p>In November, the FAA sent Dean a letter stating that it had completed an investigation of the safety issues he had flagged. The letter cloaks the outcome though it seems to confirm that his allegations had substance.</p>
<p>“The investigation determined that your allegations were appropriately addressed under an FAA-approved safety program,” the FAA wrote. “However, due to the privacy provisions of those programs, specific details cannot be released.” </p><p>That same month, Dean filed his aviation whistleblower complaint with the Department of Labor, alleging wrongful termination and “gross misconduct of senior level Spirit AeroSystems Quality Managers.” </p><p>That case was still pending.</p><p>After he left Spirit, Dean took a job for a short time at Boeing Wichita, then left to work for another company.</p><p>The shareholder lawsuit alleging that Spirit management withheld information on the quality flaws and harmed stockholders was filed in December. Supporting the suit, Dean provided a deposition detailing his allegations.</p><p>After a panel blew off a Boeing 737 MAX plane in January, bringing new attention to the quality lapses at Spirit, one of Dean’s former Spirit colleagues <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/with-boeing-in-hot-seat-claims-against-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-take-shape/">confirmed some of Dean’s allegations</a>.</p>

On the Mac, the alternative to Hypercard was to layout UI widgets in code, with no GUI builder at all, or eventually to pay $$$ for a professional-grade IDE like CodeWarrior. As an entry-level user with no budget, if you wanted a GUI builder for the Mac, you got Hypercard, or nothing. This created a community of Hypercard enthusiasts.</p><p>Furthermore, when Hypercard launched, Macs had a standard screen resolution. Every Mac sold had a screen resolution of 512x342 pixels, so you could know for sure how your cards would look on any Mac. Supporting resizable GUIs is one of the hardest things to do in any GUI builder. (How should the buttons layout when the screen gets very small, like a phone? Or very wide, like a 16:9 monitor?) Today, Xcode uses a sophisticated constraint solver / theorem prover to allow developers to build resizable UIs in a GUI; it works pretty well, I think, but it's never going to be as easy to learn as "drag the button onto the screen and it's going to look <i>exactly</i> like that everywhere."</p><p>The last issue is the real killer for modern Hypercard wannabes: it's a small step from a web GUI builder to raw HTML/CSS. You don't have to pay big bucks to have access to professional-grade HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sure, they're not that easy to learn, but you can teach a kid to write interactive web pages, no problem.</p><p>As a result, the demand for a simple GUI builder is lower than it was for Hypercard, and even when you do capture a user, they tend to outgrow your product, and there are a zillion competitors, so none of them can build a community with real traction.

(I <i>loved</i> HyperCard as a kid and built a ton of stuff with it.) My only complaint about Decker as-is (last time I played with it) is that it has no ability out-of-the-box to make any kind of network connection to do anything. e.g. grabbing some data, triggering some webhook, etc. is all a no-go. Decker is completely self-contained and oblivious about the internet (a lot like HyperCard was).<p>Theoretically, it's possible to add network fetching to Decker, but it's an exercise left to the reader.</p><p>Leaving out networking feels very intentional in Decker, and if you start to go down that rabbit hole, I imagine it quickly devolves into all the pain and complexity of modern webdev.</p><p>(Would be happy if I'm wrong and happy to find out it's all there in Decker now.)

But they're very frustrating because the delta between what you want and what you can do is so large, especially now that we're miles beyond hypercard/scratch in functionality.</p><p>The essential idea of coding is encoding: what behavior do you want, and how can you (most economically) represent the data and processes required?</p><p>Consider whether thought experiments would be a better way for your son and you (as a marketer) together to learn about encoding.  If you focus together on learning how to think like a coder, it could be fun (instead of frustrating to drag through arcane syntax of toy languages).</p><p>The most powerful encodings are scale-invariant; the most interesting are generative.  So you could start by thinking about the game of life, or fractals.</p><p>The other thing for an 11-year-old is teaching them to learn how to learn.  Go with him down a rabbit hole of programming tiktoks/videos, and then step back to reflect on each, try to come up with categories, figure out how to find related topics and approaches, and summarize your results - then review them later and pull them into conversations to reinforce them.  Start to see the math and encoding of life situations.  Build mental models for getting frustrated (and reward systems generally), the game theory of competition, etc.  -- things that will be relevant in teen years.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Years of accumulated security debt at Microsoft are seemingly crashing down upon the company in a manner that many critics warned about, but few ever believed would actually come to light.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft is an entrenched enterprise provider, owning nearly one-quarter of the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-gets-its-mojo-back-q4-increase-in-cloud-spending-reaches-new-highs"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>global cloud infrastructure services</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> market and, as of Q1 last year, nearly 20% of the worldwide SaaS application market, according to Synergy Research Group.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Though not immune to scandal, in the wake of two major nation-state breaches of its core enterprise platforms, Microsoft is facing one of its most serious reputational crises.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>



<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It’s certainly not the first time a nation-state adversary has breached Microsoft’s cloud environments and after so many instances, empty promises of improved security are no longer enough,” </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Adam Meyers, SVP of counter adversary operations at CrowdStrike</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, said via email.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In January, Microsoft said a Russia-backed threat group called Midnight Blizzard, </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/federal-agencies-credentials-exposed/713064/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>gained access to emails</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, credentials and other sensitive information from top Microsoft executives, certain corporate customers and a number of federal agencies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Then in early April, the federal Cyber Safety Review Board</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cyber-safety-review-board-releases-report-microsoft-online-exchange-incident-summer-2023">released a long-anticipated report</a> which showed the company failed to prevent a massive 2023 hack of its Microsoft Exchange Online environment. The hack by a People’s Republic of China-linked espionage actor led to the theft of </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>60,000 State Department emails and gained access to other high-profile officials.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Just weeks ago, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/federal-agencies-credentials-exposed/713064/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>issued an emergency directive</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, which orders federal civilian agencies to mitigate vulnerabilities in their networks, analyze the content of stolen emails, reset credentials and take additional steps to secure Microsoft Azure accounts. While the order only applies to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, CISA warned other organizations could be impacted.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For many critics of Microsoft, the events of the past nine months are the logical conclusion of a company that has ridden the wave of market dominance for decades and ignored years of warnings that its product security and practices failed to meet the most basic standards.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>


<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“In a healthy marketplace, these would be fireable offenses,” said </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>AJ Grotto, director of the Program of Geopolitics, Technology and Governance at the Stanford Cyber Policy Center and a former White House director for cyber policy</span>. “Regrettably, the marketplace is far from healthy — Microsoft has the government locked in as a customer, so the government’s options for forcing change at Microsoft are limited, at least in the short term.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The concern was, and is, that Microsoft's security gaps would potentially lead to catastrophic outcomes.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft needs to dedicate its internal resources towards zero-trust initiatives and make new investments in its infrastructure, according to</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> Karan Sondhi,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>CTO, public sector at Trellix.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Currently, Microsoft directs the vast majority of their security investments in revenue generating roles instead of internal security roles,” Sondhi said via email.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft has a considerable stake in the cloud security space. Not only is Microsoft one of the world’s largest cloud providers, but it is also a major security provider to the enterprise. </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft has more than 1 million security customers, with 700,000 using four or more of its security products, CEO Satya Nadella said during the company’s fiscal second quarter conference call in January</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The company generates more than $20 billion in revenue per year from its security business.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Vulnerable ecosystem</span></span></strong></span></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The state-linked activity targeting Microsoft systems also impacted on other companies that use Microsoft products —&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/hpe-cyberattack-email-stolen/705615/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Hewlett Packard Enterprise disclosed</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> it was impacted by ongoing activity from the threat group as well.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>HPE in January said Midnight Blizzard gained access to a small number of company mailboxes dating back to May 2023, stealing data from executives in cybersecurity and other key departments, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The activity appears to be related to the access and exfiltration of SharePoint files, according to the filing.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>HPE in January told Cybersecurity Dive the threat actor “used a compromised account to gain unauthorized access to the Office 365 email environment." HPE has declined to comment further on the Midnight Blizzard threat activity beyond its SEC filings.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/node/32471/html#d808756dex991.htm"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>in a March filing with the SEC</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, said Midnight Blizzard was trying to use various secrets it stole from the company. Microsoft said it had shared secrets with certain customers via email, and was reaching out to those customers to help them take mitigation steps.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Midnight Blizzard has repeatedly launched attacks against Microsoft customers using a variety of means, including password spray attacks and social engineering.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>CISA and other officials are still assessing the ongoing threat from the Midnight Blizzard attacks to federal agencies and other Microsoft customers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Center for Internet Security, through the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, provided “intelligence and response information regarding the campaign of activity targeting Microsoft products,” said </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Randy Rose, VP of security operations and intelligence at CIS.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Rose confirmed a “low number” of MS-ISAC participants were notified that they were likely impacted. However, there were no reports of external activity linked to this and no reports of incident response.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Indeed, the CSRB report </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/04/02/cyber-safety-review-board-releases-report-microsoft-online-exchange-incident-summer"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>laid out a blistering assessment of a corporate culture</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> that has failed for years to take cybersecurity seriously.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>


<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The report was designed to assess the company’s response to the summer 2023 breach from the People’s Republic of China-linked threat actor that breached the company’s Microsoft Online Exchange environment.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>However, it also laid out a security culture that failed to adhere to the most basic standards, given the enormous market power that Microsoft yields across modern business applications in government and the private sector.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>One of the more damaging findings was that Microsoft learned of the attacks only because the State Department had set up an internal alert system after purchasing a G5 license from the company. Customers who failed to purchase the enhanced license, were not able to see the extensive logging capabilities that would have alerted them to a breach.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Failure of accountability </span></span></strong></span></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Many in the security community see the CSRB report and the recent CISA emergency directive as direct indictments not only of Microsoft’s security culture, but a government that has allowed Microsoft to maintain lucrative government contracts with no fear of competition across many of its services.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“The federal government gets off the hook a little easy in this report,” said </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Mark Montgomery, senior director at the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>. “</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Despite significant encouragement from outside experts, the Biden administration, and its predecessors, have failed to treat cloud computing as a national critical infrastructure, that is itself critical to maintaining the security of our national critical infrastructures.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_cisa_doj_ftc_re_2023_microsoft_breach.pdf"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>who called for a federal investigation</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> following the State Department email hack, said the federal government shared responsibility for the negligent behavior disclosed in the report.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Wyden said Microsoft has been rewarded with billions of dollars in federal contracts, while not being held to account for even the most basic security standards.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>“Many switched to Exchange Online or Microsoft 365 to get away from on-premise servers and [managed service providers]. If the other choice is going 'back' —&nbsp;or a potentially disruptive switch to another platform like Google Workspace —&nbsp;they most often just ride it out and trust Microsoft to fix the issues.”</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“The government’s dependence on Microsoft</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>poses a serious national security threat, which requires strong action,” Wyden told Cybersecurity Dive after the CSRB report was released earlier this month.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Technology vendors should be held to strict cybersecurity standards, use independent audits to make sure vendors are adhering to those standards and if violated, the company and senior executives must be held accountable, Wyden said.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft officials said they understand the larger concerns raised by the summer 2023 attacks and the continued threat from Midnight Blizzard and other nation-state actors. The company is working to make extensive changes in its engineering processes, improve its relationships with the security community and its responsiveness to customer needs.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“We are energized and focused on executing Microsoft’s Secure Future Initiative commitments,” </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Bret Arsenault, corporate VP and chief cybersecurity advisor at Microsoft,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>said in a statement. “And this is just the beginning. We commit to sharing transparent learnings and future milestones as part of our efforts to strengthen all systems against attacks.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the larger shakeup of Microsoft’s security operations, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie--bell/recent-activity/all/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft in December named</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> Igor Tsyganskiy to take over as the new global CISO effective Jan. 1, moving Arsenault out of that role after 14 years.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Aresenault pointed out that since launching the company’s Secure Future Initiative in November, the company has </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/03/06/enhancing-protection-updates-on-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>sped up related engineering work</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> in several areas:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft has accelerated the lifecycle management of tenants, with a focus on either unused or older systems. The company eliminated more than 1.7 million Entra ID systems related to used, aging or legacy technology. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;It has also made multifactor authentication enforcement automatic across more than 1 million Entra ID tenants.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>More than 730,000 apps have been removed across production and corporate tenants that were either out of lifecycle or not meeting current SFI standards.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>New employees and vendors are given short-term credentials to make impersonation and credential theft more difficult. More than 270,000 have been implemented thus far.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The company’s internal MFA implementation using Microsoft authenticator has been enhanced, by eliminating a call feature and relying on an in-app login feature. This change covers more than 300,000 employees and vendors.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Customer renewal or rejection</span></span></strong></span></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>How private industry and government agencies respond to these security challenges is a near-term concern for Microsoft.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Dante Stella, an attorney at Dykema and specialist in incident response</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, says enterprise customers do not usually walk away in the face of nation-state threats against Microsoft, in part due to its enormous presence as a cloud provider.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Many switched to Exchange Online or Microsoft 365 to get away from on-premise servers and [managed service providers]," Stella said via email. “If the other choice is going 'back' —&nbsp;or a potentially disruptive switch to another platform like Google Workspace —&nbsp;they most often just ride it out and trust Microsoft to fix the issues.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Attacks like these will spur proactive security measures at many companies, for example increasing employee training, upgrading email security to an E5 level, adopting the use of audit logs and increasing the use of encryption during file transfers, Stella said.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>E5 is considered the premium tier for Microsoft 365 customers, offering enhanced security and other services, he said.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Though Nadella says security is </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/microsoft-ceo-security-priority/714450/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft's No. 1 priority</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, the company also has raced to develop artificial intelligence and incorporate it into its products.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft has placed a major bet that customers will embrace its effort to incorporate AI into its security product platforms. Microsoft said, after months of testing with customers, that Security Copilot helped security analysts be 22% faster and 7% more accurate.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, the company sees a larger number of Microsoft 365 customers embracing E5, which provides enhanced security protection and is reflected in higher average revenue per user.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/03/13/microsoft-copilot-for-security-is-generally-available-on-april-1-2024-with-new-capabilities/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>made Security Copilot generally available earlier this month</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> and is offering the technology on a pay as you go basis to make it more affordable to a wider range of customers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html">4 am in the morning</a>, a quiet revolution in computing began at Dartmouth College. That's when mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the first program written in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the college's General Electric GE-225 mainframe.</p>
<p>Little did they know that their creation would go on to democratize computing and inspire generations of programmers over the next six decades.</p>
<h2>What is BASIC?</h2>
<p>In its most traditional form, BASIC is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreted</a> programming language that runs line by line, with line numbers. A typical program might look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 PRINT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME?"</p>
<p>20 INPUT N$</p>
<p>30 PRINT "HELLO, ";N$</p></blockquote>
<p>Programs could jump between lines using commands like GOTO, which often led to simple looping programs created by beginners that would fill the screen with repeating words. Or one could quickly write a program that counted upward toward infinity like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 LET X=X+1</p>
<p>20 PRINT X</p>
<p>30 GOTO 10</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, most programming languages use different types of structural paradigms (such as functions and object-oriented programming), but the easy-to-grasp syntax of BASIC, with its plain English keywords, proved popular and easy to use for beginners.</p>
<h2>The journey to BASIC</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/825555/where-did-the-term-computer-user-come-from/">Before</a> early computers became small, inexpensive, and "personal," they were difficult to use. At first, programming a computer involved literally connecting wires, then flipping switches, and even punching paper cards. Over time, engineers <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/2580/vcg-anthology-the-evolution-of-computer-displays#more-2580">developed ways</a> to abstract away low-level programming operations with a more friendly interface. That's where programming languages come in.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GE_210_advertisement.jpg" data-height="1440" data-width="1920" alt="A brochure for the GE 210 computer from 1964.

BASIC's creators used a similar computer four years later to develop the programming language.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Prior to BASIC, programming languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">Algol</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> proved complex and were primarily used by professionals. Kemeny and Kurtz saw a need for amateurs who were not dedicated computer engineers to be able to use computers as well. Their journey to create a more user-friendly language began in 1956 with Dartmouth Simplified Code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARSIMCO">DARSIMSCO</a>), followed by the Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Oversimplified_Programming_Experiment">DOPE</a>). While DOPE proved too simple to be of much use, the lessons learned from these projects informed the development of BASIC, which started in 1963.</p>
<p>In the same year, Kemeny applied for a National Science Foundation grant to bring a <a href="https://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/GE225.html">GE-225 computer</a> to Dartmouth and build the first fully functional general-purpose time-sharing system. Despite the grant referees' doubts about his plan to accomplish the work with a group of undergraduates, Kemeny secured the funding.</p>
<p>Together with Kurtz and a group of undergraduate students, Kemeny built a time-sharing system to open computer access to all at Dartmouth. The simplicity and power of BASIC quickly made it a favorite among students and faculty alike.</p>
<h2>BASIC goes PC</h2>

<p>As part of the deal to buy the GE 225 computer, Kemeny, Kurtz, and others had earlier built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Time_Sharing_System">time sharing operating system</a> for General Electric. BASIC running on this operating system allowed colleges, high schools, and individuals across the country to dial into mainframe computers and write programs using the language. The impact of BASIC began to extend far beyond Dartmouth's campus.</p>                                            
                                                        

<p>In 1975, Paul Allen and Bill Gates adapted the language for personal computers like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair 8800</a>, expanding its reach to a new audience of small computer owners and founding Microsoft in the process. In 1976, Steve Wozniak <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-steve-wozniak-wrote-basic-for-the-original-apple-fr-1570573636">developed a BASIC interpreter from scratch</a> for the Apple I using self-taught methods and minimal resources. This became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_BASIC">Integer BASIC</a> for the Apple II a year later, and BASIC (as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC">Applesoft BASIC</a>) remained a key part of the Apple II throughout the platform's lifespan.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, BASIC continued its prominent role as a programming interface and quasi-operating system for popular home computers such as the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432140/how-atari-took-on-apple-in-the-1980s-home-pc-wars">Atari 800</a>, TRS-80, Commodore VIC-20, Commodore 64, TI-99/4A, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/bbc-basic-keeps-evolving-and-now-you-can-run-it-on-nearly-any-platform/">BBC Micro</a>, and the IBM PC, where it either came preinstalled in ROM as part of the operating system or shipped as an easily accessible programming environment. Early computer magazines such as Compute! <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2018/11/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/">printed BASIC code listings</a> that could be typed in line by line.</p>
<h2>BASIC today</h2>
<p>Today, BASIC remains popular in hobbyist retrocomputing circles, but few use it as a practical language. And yet it never truly died out—instead, it continued to evolve.</p>
<p>Many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#Post-1990_versions_and_dialects">BASIC dialects</a> exist today for different platforms, but some of Microsoft's are most commonly used. After Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC">QuickBasic</a>, descendants of BASIC such as <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/28/nostalgic_for_basic/">Visual Basic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications">Visual Basic for Applications</a> (VBA), and <a href="https://smallbasic-publicwebsite.azurewebsites.net/">Microsoft Small Basic</a> live on. Visual Basic, introduced by Microsoft in 1991, became a popular choice for developing Windows applications, while VBA is widely used for scripting and automation in Microsoft Office applications. Microsoft Small Basic, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/11/yet-another-programming-language-from-microsoft-small-basic/">released in 2008</a>, serves as an educational tool for teaching programming concepts to beginners.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other modern languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, have taken on roles similar to those once filled by BASIC. These languages prioritize simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making them popular choices for introductory programming courses and rapid application development.</p>
<p>Despite the decline in its practical use, BASIC's legacy lives on through its influence on subsequent programming languages and its role in making computing accessible to a broader audience. As we commemorate the 60th anniversary of BASIC, let's raise a glass to Kemeny and Kurtz for empowering several generations of young computer programmers.</p>
