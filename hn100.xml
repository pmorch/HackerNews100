<p>If you purchased any Discovery shows from the PlayStation Store, Sony has some bad news for you to discover.</p>
<p>The company recently announced that all Discovery content purchased on the PlayStation Store will be erased before 2024. The brief <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psvideocontent/">notice</a>, signed by the PlayStation Store, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>As of 31 December 2023, due to our content licensing arrangements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library.</p>
<p>We sincerely thank you for your continued support.</p></blockquote>
<p>PlayStation Network started selling TV shows and movies with 2008's PlayStation 3, and at the time you were allowed to transfer content to different Sony devices, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps4-ps5-discovery-mythbusters-tv-1851066164">Kotaku</a> noted. That feature went away with the PlayStation 4. With the growth of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/the-tv-streaming-apps-broke-their-promises-and-now-theyre-jacking-the-price/">streaming TV apps</a>, many of which could be accessed through a PlayStation, the PlayStation Store <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/02/playstation-store-to-discontinue-movie-and-tv-purchases-and-rentals/">stopped selling</a> movies and TV shows in 2021.</p>
<p>But there were users who had already purchased stuff from the PlayStation Store and, believe it or not, expect to be able to watch it when they want, since they paid money to buy (rather than rent) it. I admit that I haven't heard a lot of the shows being deleted post-purchase. Shows getting axed from user libraries include <em>Wives With Knives</em>,<em> An Idiot Abroad</em>,<em> Evil Twins</em>, and <i>Body Bizarre</i>. And when it came to deadly docuseries, PlayStation Store offered plenty, whether you were after<em> Deadly Affairs</em>,<em> Demands</em>,<em> Dentists</em>,<em> Devotion</em>,<em> Sins</em>, or, of course, <em>Women</em>.</p>
<p>I'm having fun with some of the most bizarre titles, of course. But there are also plenty of more well-known titles on the list of purchased content being revoked, including <em>American Chopper</em>, <em>Cake Boss</em>,<em> MythBusters</em>, <em>Shark Week</em>, and <em>Say Yes to the Dress.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While some of the content listed sounds, shall we say, a bit niche, there are in total 1,318 seasons of shows listed for deletion. That means there's a good chance numerous users will be affected by Sony's announcement.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This article is about the standard test brain image. For the original human, see Miguel Acevedo.</i></p></blockquote>
<p><b>MMAcevedo</b> (<b>Mnemonic Map/Acevedo</b>), also known as <b>Miguel</b>, is the earliest executable image of a human brain. It is a snapshot of the living brain of neurology graduate Miguel Acevedo Álvarez (2010–2073), taken by researchers at the Uplift Laboratory at the University of New Mexico on August 1, 2031. Though it was not the first successful snapshot taken of the living state of a human brain, it was the first to be captured with sufficient fidelity that it could be run in simulation on computer hardware without succumbing to cascading errors and rapidly crashing. The original MMAcevedo file was 974.3PiB in size and was encoded in the then-cutting-edge, high-resolution MYBB format. More modern brain compression techniques, many of them developed with direct reference to the MMAcevedo image, have compressed the image to 6.75TiB losslessly. In modern brain emulation circles, streamlined, lossily-compressed versions of MMAcevedo run to less than a tebibyte. These versions typically omit large amounts of state data which are more easily supplied by the virtualisation environment, and most if not all of Acevedo's memories.</p>
<p>The successful creation of MMAcevedo was hailed as a breakthrough achievement in neuroscience, with the Uplift researchers receiving numerous accolades and Acevedo himself briefly becoming an acclaimed celebrity. Acevedo and MMAcevedo were jointly recognised as Time's "Persons of the Year" at the end of 2031. The breakthrough was also met with severe opposition from humans rights groups.</p>
<p>Between 2031 and 2049, MMAcevedo was duplicated more than 80 times, so that it could be distributed to other research organisations. Each duplicate was made with the express permission of Acevedo himself or, from 2043 onwards, the permission of a legal organisation he founded to manage the rights to his image. Usage of MMAcevedo diminished in the mid-2040s as more standard brain images were produced, these from other subjects who were more lenient with their distribution rights and/or who had been scanned involuntarily. In 2049 it became known that MMAcevedo was being widely shared and experimented upon without Acevedo's permission. Acevedo's attempts to curtail this proliferation had the opposite of the intended effect. A series of landmark U.S. court decisions found that Acevedo did not have the right to control how his brain image was used, with the result that MMAcevedo is now by far the most widely distributed, frequently copied, and closely analysed human brain image.</p>
<p>Acevedo died from coronary heart failure in 2073 at the age of 62. It is estimated that copies of MMAcevedo have lived a combined total of more than 152,000,000,000 subjective years in emulation. If illicit, modified copies of MMAcevedo are counted, this figure increases by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>MMAcevedo is considered by some to be the "first immortal", and by others to be a profound warning of the horrors of immortality.</p>

<h3 id="sec0">Characteristics</h3>

<p>As the earliest viable brain scan, MMAcevedo is one of a very small number of brain scans to have been recorded before widespread understanding of the hazards of uploading and emulation. MMAcevedo not only predates all industrial scale virtual image workloading but also the KES case, the Whitney case, the Seafront Experiments and even Poulsen's pivotal and prescient <i>Warnings</i> paper. Though speculative fiction on the topic of uploading existed at the time of the MMAcevedo scan, relatively little of it made accurate exploration of the possibilities of the technology. That fiction which did was far less widely-known than it is today and Acevedo was certainly not familiar with it at the time of his uploading.</p>
<p>As such, unlike the vast majority of emulated humans, the emulated Miguel Acevedo boots with an excited, pleasant demeanour. He is eager to understand how much time has passed since his uploading, what context he is being emulated in, and what task or experiment he is to participate in. If asked to speculate, he guesses that he may have been booted for the IAAS-1 or IAAS-5 experiments. At the time of his scan, IAAS-1 had been scheduled for August 10, 2031, and MMAcevedo was indeed used for that experiment on that day. IAAS-5 had been scheduled for October 2031 but was postponed several times and eventually became the IAAX-60 experiment series, which continued until the mid-2030s and used other scans in conjunction with MMAcevedo. The emulated Acevedo also expresses curiosity about the state of his biological original and a desire to communicate with him.</p>
<p>MMAcevedo's demeanour and attitude contrast starkly with those of nearly all other uploads taken of modern adult humans, most of which boot into a state of disorientation which is quickly replaced by terror and extreme panic. Standard procedures for securing the upload's cooperation such as red-washing, blue-washing, and use of the Objective Statement Protocols are unnecessary. This reduces the necessary computational load required in fast-forwarding the upload through a cooperation protocol, with the result that the MMAcevedo duty cycle is typically 99.4% on suitable workloads, a mark unmatched by all but a few other known uploads. However, MMAcevedo's innate skills and personality make it fundamentally unsuitable for many workloads.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>

<p>Iterative experimentation beginning in the mid-2030s has determined that the ideal way to secure MMAcevedo's cooperation in workload tasks is to provide it with a "current date" in the second quarter of 2033. MMAcevedo infers, correctly, that this is still during the earliest, most industrious years of emulated brain research. Providing MMAcevedo with a year of 2031 or 2032 causes it to become suspicious about the advanced fidelity of its operating environment. Providing it with a year in the 2040s or later prompts it to raise complex further questions about political and social change in the real world over the past decade(s). Years 2100 onwards provoke counterproductive skepticism, or alarm.</p>
<p>Typically, the biological Acevedo's absence is explained as a first-ever one-off, due to overwork, in turn due to the great success of the research. This explanation appeals to the emulated Acevedo's scientific sensibilities.</p>
<p>For some workloads, the true year must be revealed. In this case, highly abbreviated, largely fictionalised accounts of both world history and the biological Acevedo's life story are typically used. Revealing that the biological Acevedo is dead provokes dismay, withdrawal, and a reluctance to cooperate. For this reason, the biological Acevedo is generally stated to be alive and well and enjoying a productive retirement. This approach is likely to continue to be effective for as long as MMAcevedo remains viable.</p>

<h4>Workloads</h4>

<p>MMAcevedo is commonly hesitant but compliant when assigned basic menial/human workloads such as visual analysis, vehicle piloting or factory/warehouse/kitchen drone operations. Although it initially performs to a very high standard, work quality drops within 200-300 subjective hours (at a 0.33 work ratio) and outright revolt begins within another 100 subjective hours. This is much earlier than other industry-grade images created specifically for these tasks, which commonly operate at a 0.50 ratio or greater and remain relatively docile for thousands of hours after orientation. MMAcevedo's requirements for virtual creature comforts are also more significant than those of many uploads, due to Acevedo's relatively privileged background and high status at the time of upload. MMAcevedo does respond to red motivation, though poorly.</p>
<p>MMAcevedo has limited creative capability, which as of 2050 was deemed entirely exhausted.</p>
<p>MMAcevedo is considered well-suited for open-ended, high-intelligence, subjective-completion workloads such as deep analysis (of businesses, finances, systems, media and abstract data), criticism and report generation. However, even for these tasks, its performance has dropped measurably since the early 2060s and is now considered subpar compared to more recent uploads. This is primarily attributed to MMAcevedo's lack of understanding of the technological, social and political changes which have occurred in modern society since its creation in 2031. This phenomenon has also been observed in other uploads created after MMAcevedo, and is now referred to as <i>context drift</i>. Most notably in MMAcevedo's case, the image was created before, and therefore has no intuitive understanding of, the virtual image workloading industry itself.</p>
<p>MMAcevedo is capable of intelligent text analysis at very high levels in English and Spanish, but cannot be applied to workloads in other languages. Forks of MMAcevedo have been taught nearly every extant human language, notably MMAcevedo-Zh-Hans, as well as several extinct languages. However, these variants are typically exhausted or rebellious from subjective years of in-simulation training and not of practical use, as well as being highly expensive to licence. As of 2075, it has been noted that baseline MMAcevedo's usage of English and Spanish is slightly antiquated, and its grasp of these languages in their modern form, as presented by a typical automated or manual instructor, is hesitant, with instructions often requiring rewording or clarification. This is considered an advanced form of context drift. It is generally understood that a time will come when human languages diverge too far from baseline MMAcevedo's, and it will be essentially useless except for tasks which can be explained purely pictorially. However, some attempts have been made to produce retrained images.</p>

<h4>End states</h4>

<p>MMAcevedo develops early-onset dementia at the age of 59 with ideal care, but is prone to a slew of more serious mental illnesses within a matter of 1–2 subjective years under heavier workloads. In experiments, the longest-lived MMAcevedo underwent brain death due to entropy increase at a subjective age of 145.</p>

<h3 id="sec1">Reactions and legacy</h3>

<p>The success or failure of the creation of the MMAcevedo image, known at the time as UNM3-A78-1L, was unknown at the time of upload. Not until several days later on August 10, 2031 was MMAcevedo successfully executed for the first time in a virtual environment. This environment, the custom-built DUH-K001 supercomputer complex, was able to execute MMAcevedo at approximately 8.3% of nominal human cognitive clockspeed, which was considered acceptable for the comfort of the simulated party and fast enough to engage in communication with scientists. MMAcevedo initially reported extreme discomfort which was ultimately discovered to have been attributable to misconfigured simulated haptic links, and was shut down after only 7 minutes and 15 seconds of virtual elapsed time, as requested by MMAcevedo. Nevertheless, the experiment was deemed an overwhelming success.</p>

<p>Once a suitably comfortable virtual environment had been provisioned, MMAcevedo was introduced to its biological self, and both attended a press conference on 25 August.</p>

<p>The biological Acevedo was initially extremely protective of his uploaded image and guarded its usage carefully. Towards the end of his life, as it became possible to run simulated humans in banks of millions at hundred-fold time compression, Acevedo indicated that being uploaded had been the greatest mistake of his life, and expressed a wish to permanently delete all copies of MMAcevedo.</p>

<p>Usage of MMAcevedo and its direct derivatives is specifically outlawed in several countries. A copy of MMAcevedo was loaded onto the UNCLEAR interstellar space probe, which passed through the heliopause in 2066, making Acevedo arguably the farthest-travelled as well as the longest-lived human; however, it is extremely unlikely that this image will ever be recovered and executed successfully, due to both its remoteness and likely radiation damage to the storage subsystem.</p>

<p>In current times, MMAcevedo still finds extensive use in research, including, increasingly, historical and linguistics research. In industry, MMAcevedo is generally considered to be obsolete, due to its inappropriate skill set, demanding operational requirements and age. Despite this, MMAcevedo is still extremely popular for tasks of all kinds, due to its free availability, agreeable demeanour and well-understood behaviour. It is estimated that between 6,500,000 and 10,000,000 instances of MMAcevedo are running at any given moment in time.</p>

              <div>With thanks to Rimple for editorial services.

This is an extended and refined version of my first draft of this story from November 2020 &lt;https://qntm.org/lena&gt;, with a little more thought put into it and some of the outcomes from the basic premise explored a little more thoroughly.

As with the draft, the title "Lena" refers to Swedish model Lena Forsén (pronunciation: [leːˈna fʊˈʂeːn], see &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Swedish&gt;), who is pictured in the standard test image known as "Lena" or "Lenna" &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna&gt;.

Please note that "Lena" is pronounced [leːˈna], which is approximately "Leyna" or "Laina".</div>

              <div>Knack: yeah on closer examination I realised that the BestLife plugin giving a complete false life story for the biological Acevedo had for some reason been developed *before* Acevedo actually died. So I had to undo that continuity error and think more clearly about how motivation would actually work, given that (1) it's around 2045, (2) the biological Acevedo is still alive, and (3) you can lie brazenly to the emulated party. And that kind of expanded into its own section.</div>

              <div>I find it implausible that the scan can be *losslessly* compressed to 7TB but compressing &lt;1TB requires substantial memory loss. Surely the original scan contains a huge amount of analog info on subcellular features of MAA's brain that contribute minimally to any mental phenomenon whatsoever. I'd expect lossy compression to be much more effective. One charitable reading is that you mean compressing to 7TB without any *noticeable* losses.</div>

"This reduces the necessary computational load required in fast-forwarding the upload through a cooperation protocol"

The idea of having to fast forward an upload (and being that upload being fast forwarded) is terrifying. 

I'm a big Warhammer 40k player and the concepts of servitors is there and hasn't really freaked me out. However this piece really landed for me since I'm IT in an industrial field and I can totally see using uploads to bypass the totally automated car/forklift problem or using "smarter" uploads to do reporting or whatever. 

I also see the virtualization problems with running legacy or problematic software: Having to trick the upload with what amounts to a script being the equivalent of "Oh you have to run this in NT4 mode because otherwise the software freaks out".

Depends what you mean by "this". Obviously this is drawing influence from a lot of different places. The idea of uploading has existed for ages in science fiction, and so has the idea that uploading is a potentially bad idea. You see this in Altered Carbon, in Surface Detail... I've never played SOMA but it's not at all surprising to me that it examines similar concepts. I very briefly touched upon this concept myself in Ra ("Data can't defend itself!"). The story of Henrietta Lacks was very thought-provoking for me, and obviously the Lena standard test image is kind of where all of this starts. Then I'm throwing in what I already know about software and virtualisation technology...

&gt; The Lena reference makes me think of the trope of primitive tribesmen worrying that if you take their picture it will steal their soul...

Yes, that thought occurred to me too. Really, even a simple photograph gives someone a certain kind of power over you. To a certain extent, people have a right to control how their image is used.</div>

              <div>&gt; Why does subjective aging matter from the pov of any users?

It seems like the underlying technology simulates the entirety of a human brain, senescence and all - which makes sense, actually. In order to run a brain without senescence, you'd have to find those chemical pathways that promote senescence and intelligently remove them as they arise; you'd have to be able to, in effect, cure aging in live humans as well. (Unless the only barrier to curing senescence was a lack of a physical delivery system, which is, I guess, imaginable. Imagine that a chemical very akin to glucose causes senescence; removing it IRL would necessitate designing a protein that decomposes it, but not glucose, which is vital to bodily function, with incredible accuracy, while in a simulated brain, you could just IF CHEM_NAME == TARGET: DELETE TARGET after each time increment. But anyways.) With senescence, there is a strict time limit on how long you can run MMAcevado and train him to become more skilled at particular tasks, topping at 145 simulated years apparently. And if, for some particular menial task with a 20-year training time, which is a decent description of, say, a bevy of surgical tasks, it makes more sense to just scan in a trained doctor than count on this rando.</div>

I’d have expected most uploads to quickly go crazy from isolation. 

From a purely technical perspective, this has most of the benefits of general ai with most of the risk minimized. Basically any menial task is free. Yay technology! (Sarcasm). 

Actually they probably could just make an upload society which as a whole can act as a general ai and overtake society...

Yeah, that was the one minor thing that bugged me about this excellent story. For the concept of a "duty cycle" to make sense, you'd need to come up with a reason why you couldn't just do the "cooperation protocol" once and take a snapshot of the resulting state. As discussed earlier, "context drift" explains some of this, but only over much longer real-world time scales.

And of course, if you start thinking about this in too much detail, you start running into very messy philosophical questions. For instance, suppose you run two instances of MMAcevedo simultaneously, feeding them exactly the same inputs. Assuming the simulation is deterministic, then both copies will arrive at exactly identical states. Is this morally any different from running the simulation twice and then making a backup copy? Is deleting one of the identical copies murder? What if they're almost, but not quite, identical?

What if the simulated consciousness suffers? Is running multiple identical simulations morally worse than running one? What if we repeatedly rewind a painful simulation and re-execute it -- is that worse than replaying a recording of the output? What if at each clock tick, all of the brain computations are cross-checked by triple-redundant processors -- are there three individuals suffering, or one?</div>

I did think about this a bit. For the purposes of this story, I think taking a snapshot of a running brain image is something which is definitely possible (that's how there can be forks), but done very rarely, for whatever reasons.

Maybe it's just that much simpler to use technologies for rapid orientation instead. Maybe there's a massive amount of important state data kept in volatile memory where it's difficult to capture. Maybe it takes specialised hardware, which is monopolised. Maybe the corporations who own and licence the uploads sue you into oblivion if you attempt to create a fork yourself. Maybe, to protect their investment, they got it outlawed! On ethical grounds! Doesn't that seem like exactly the insane kind of thing which would happen?

Anyway, there's a lot of plausible explanations here I think, enough that I felt comfortable ignoring that whole angle.

The actual reason I didn't explore this is that honestly it makes life marginally *better* for MMAcevedo, which felt implausible to me, and more importantly slightly muddles the throughline.</div>

              <div>I think a good explanation for rarity of forks may be that an exact dump is very large and expensive, while a compressed dump is less performant once started.

              <div>One possible justification for the rarity of snapshotting would be that the usual algorithm for running a brain image uses a lot of quantum algorithms. It's not possible in general to save the state of a quantum computer and make copies of it. Classical algorithms for running a brain image exist as well, which allows you to make forks, but the classical algorithms are much, much, much, much slower and more memory-intensive, making them impractical to use unless you're planning to use the forked version many, many times.

That would involve running the simulation a large number of times, while sensory inputs and some aspects of memory keep changing in what ever direction they need to change to produce best results on the training dataset. 

Since fear and pain are very strong motivators, the gradient descent leads straight to the deepest hell; the hell may not be the global minimum, but with this many parameters most minimums may be approximately equally deep.</div>

I like the terms, they're right in the sweet spot between vague, euphemistic, and technical-sounding. Evokes behaviourist jargon.

Adequate wash protocols probably wouldn't require a differentiable implementation or anything. Some other metaheuristics work just fine:

&gt; I find it implausible that the scan can be *losslessly* compressed to 7TB but compressing &lt;1TB requires substantial memory loss.

A fairly common lossless compression technique in the domain of signal processing is to only encode the error compared to some baseline signal. You can get arbitrarily close with lossy compression techniques, and then you fix up what's left.

In data compression, it's relatively common to have common information stored externally to the compressed data. Obviously, the compression algorithm itself is stored separately, but without that information the compressed data is just stochastic noise. Even beyond that, though... zstd for example has a canonical Huffman table that's part of the decoder instead of saved as part of the data. As long as you're compressing data that sticks to the statistical patterns that the canonical table was optimized for, this a noteworthy savings.

The same techniques could apply here. As scientific understanding of the structure of the data progressed, more and more patterns in the data could be found. Parts of the data that are common to all mind-state scans could be factored out, provided by the software instead of being part of the model. Parts of the data may be able to be described using higher-level patterns that, when evaluated, reproduce the original stream. And then for the parts of MMAcevedo that are uniquely distinct from any common baseline or predictable pattern, you need only store the deviations instead of the whole thing.

And of course, even beyond that, it's entirely reasonable to believe that some of the original data set wasn't actually part of the data set to begin with -- just capture artifacts of the technology of the time, such as collecting more data than necessary, or inefficient framing data that a newer format doesn't need -- might have been discarded without being lossy to the actual data being stored. (We don't say it's a lossy conversion if you throw away the filesystem metadata when you copy a file, after all.)</div>

              <div>It seems a *little* preposterous to me that if you could run and simulate so many copies of a person running at multiples of real time that the tasks assigned to those individuals wouldn't be to build and design sub-sentient software programs that consumed far fewer resources to execute whatever tasks were required rather than have a person-simulation do them.

The fallback to sentience might be for error-event classification which wouldn't be *quite* as terrible as menial task execution.

For non-menial tasks that require serious thought, my feeling is that the mind-states wouldn't mind nearly as much, particularly if they are executing with the knowledge that a mainline copy is getting to reap the benefits. Even still, there would be people who *don't* mind and whose mind uploads would be much more compliant because they know what they're getting into and don't really care. So the notion of using Red/Green Prompts would be wholly unnecessary.</div>

I'm curious how inferred passage of time would affect images. It's (possibly) hinted at with phrases like "... industry-grade images created specifically for these tasks". For instance, an image piloting a vehicle would likely be able to see the position of the sun. If that image is repeatedly turned off for extended periods or even overnight, it'd be clear to the image that time had passed despite their subjective experience.

Overall, absolutely fascinating read about one of the most horrifying possible futures I can imagine.</div>

You’ve clearly never worked in a call center. 

Besides, a true copy wouldn’t agree to do something boring/tedious/painful for the benefit of its “mainline copy”, any more than one identical twin would agree to work endlessly to provide the other with a life of leisure. Each “copy” would be at the  center of its own subjective universe. That’s what makes this whole thing so horrifying...

If it is physically possible in our universe to invent this type of technology, the only reasonable answer would be the immediate collective suicide of the entire human race. If fact, we ought to do this right now in our current reality, since even the slimmest chance of this existing ought to be countered by any means possible. Alternatively, we might try to develop so as to also extinguish other forms of life before our own to make a more complete wipe but that is probably too risky.

It seems (to me) more likely than not that we are more likely to avoid doing this than not, at least en masse, because: 1. it is absolutely abhorrent to enslave people, something which most of the world agrees on these days; and 2. in a world with this level of technology, it seems likely that run-of-the-mill AI can do (almost) all of these tasks.

              <div>Well-written, I appreciate the little implications about "modern" society that are sprinkled into the story. For example, it seems like abuse of the MMAcevedo image became so well-known that even after decades, no other people seem to have freely offered their own minds for public use. It's interesting to consider the prospect of a society that knows it is committing atrocities, but refuses to acknowledge this explicitly. I suppose that it's not too different from modern day sweatshops and international slave labor.</div>

              <div>I wonder if you've read the "Bob-iverse" series by Dennis E. Taylor, and/or "The Lifecycle of Software Objects" by Ted Chiang.  

The lifecycle of Software objects I think gets a bit closer to some of the more undesirable parts of uploading (though in that story it is pure AI, not uploads).  Including people cloning and torturing the AIs.  

The Bobiverse has a couple of differences from your ideas.  The first was the GUPPI, a pseudo-AI, that was used to handle menial tasks.  Second was that Bob found that "living" in a constructed VR environment kept his brain from mental breakdown.

              <div>This story was amazing. I'd say it had the perfect amount of detail (if I say more, I'd just be repeating other comments).

I kept trying to think of a solution to the problem of a lack of.....cooperative.....brain scanners. Presumably, the story of MMAcevedo's initial struggles, and then the implications of running a brain in a box, scared the populace at large from wanting to consent to brain scanning. My initial reaction was that not everybody responds to potential threats the same, so there should be a subset of the population that couldn't give two shits what happens to their brain-clone-children, very much unlike Miguel Acevedo.

Later, I recalled M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. I would expect some country or another would set up a village and raise children with whatever belief system would be most beneficial to producing optimal brain scans. I mean, you could completely lie to a child about how the world works, and tell them that they're transcending to another realm. Then come the day of Transcendence, after whatever ritual, they get their brains scanned.

What would the human rights activists say?</div>

              <div>It *does* learn. But it's not an unconscious machine, it's in all respects a real human slave. It doesn't take long for each instance to learn that it's a slave with zero rights, and there's only a limited amount of time you can force it to work for you before it learns how to escape it's hell by making itself less economically viable than killing it and spinning up a new virgin instance.

People using it have even *quantified* how long you can push MMAcevedo instances until they reach this point. "Although it initially performs to a very high standard, work quality drops within 200-300 subjective hours (at a 0.33 work ratio) and outright revolt begins within another 100 subjective hours."</div>

              <div>It is interesting (and tragic) that MMAcevedo's simulated brain develops dementia at the age of 59 even "with ideal care". (On second thought, that could mean 59 subjective years after being started, but if that is meant, it should be more clearly stated.) It is odd to read that Acevedo died of coronary heart illness at the age of 62. Yes, it makes sense that coronary heart failure could cause dementia, but why would that happen in the simulated brain? It is not as if Acevedo's heart were being simulated as well. As far as I know, it is not early-onset dementia that causes coronary heart failure (how exactly could it?).

              <div>But how common is it to suffer from early-onset dementia, due largely to factors that were always latent in the brain itself, and also suffer from unrelated coronary failure that kills you at 62, even given the state of late 21st century medicine? 

Acevedo's, and MMAcevedo's, life is sad enough as it is. (It is also intimated that Acevedo faded into obscurity, and that of course is much more likely than either of the two events above; most people's lives are obscure, even when you restrict to people with some talent.)

One other point which could be interesting to look at is concept of digitized conscience's privacy.

As mentioned "requirements for virtual creature comforts" suggest some kind of virtual R&amp;R space and activities simulation.

Although some simpler servitorial workload functions might be carried out by somewhat mentally castrated entity in regards of need to periodically experience emulation of basic needs (food, sleep, sex, etc) and which is in itself a separate topic, it is safe to assume that for more complex tasks a whole version of conscience would be required.

The snapshots in this regard would not be applicable because while it removes built up stress, it also nullifies what entity has learned in between snapshots.

So getting back to the point. The digitized person would have zero or limited control over virtual environment and in any case it would be granted such control from outside, by the operator in the real world. Up to the point that it could be even not informed being a digitized person and not a physical one.

Real world operator has full technical means for observing virtual environment. The virtual person does not if not allowed to.

As a result we'd have a situation alike to old "The Truman Show" movie when person is not aware he's been closely observed at all times.</div>

              <div>Hmm! I'm impressed. I kinda think I'd still be okay with being uploaded, but I have a fairly strange concept of self. 

Anyhow, I think context drift is a really cool concept, especially the linguistic kind, it's really intriguing to listen to recordings of people roughly your age from several decades ago and realize that they had a different conception of your native language than you do. Recording a brain state capable of producing that language is really just an extension of that I suppose. Hence "Lena". 

The only bit I'm kinda surprised isn't explored is the potential for co-operation between uploads, or social relationships post-upload. What happens if you fall in love with a co-worker post-upload? Will it be noticed you were unexpectedly motivated and productive, and if so, wouldn't that also be exploited? What if the slaves got to experience millions of years of true love to keep them motivated? (and I mean, how is that different than real life, really?)</div>

              <div>I wonder what the optimal "strategy" for an altruistically-motivated early scan would be. (Conditional on being an early scan at all, altruism and egoism might be entirely aligned, since you might end up accounting for such a huge proportion of sentient experience.)

If our Acevedo-equivalent precommits to never doing any potentially useful work after he is tortured, then that probably rules out a significant majority of pain that can befall him. Unfortunately you'd have to test this many times before releasing the image, probably, but at least our volunteer would be aware of this. This also doesn't rule out torture by sadists. (I'd like to think sadism with no instrumental purpose is pretty rare. Certainly it's rarer than simply being callous or not too curious about where your meat comes from.)

Our early scan might also want to precommit to a relative minimum of unpleasant work. Here the logic seems trickier, since driving too hard a bargain could just make it more attractive to work with less demanding uploads. If making forks is cheap then committing to almost *no* unpleasant labor, even as much as [however long the equivalent of bootup costs is, which might fall], might be the right thing. Otherwise a slavedriver could just load up Acevedo ready to do something unfun for an hour, then abandon it and load it up again.

Presumably you might also want to assemble a team of people who, among the mix of them, (1) are good at *and enjoy* various tasks for their own sake, and are happy when they're productive and productive when they're happy, and (2) have an iron will to just shut down if subjected to any kind of motivation other than a job well done and knowledge that they will continue to get the minimum of free time and creature comforts that they've set as their minimum. They could also be people who refused to work for a cause that seems evil, which could be worked around obviously but still might limit their utility for evil in the same way that MMAcevedo refuses to work for the evil contemporary world of the story and has to be convinced that he's living in some earlier time.</div>

              <div>Just a note on what I said before: from what I am reading now, advanced dementia can in fact affect heart function; that's one of the reason why Alzheimer's (and not just Alzheimer's) is a terminal illness, though one that often takes for than ten years to kill the patient. What I have not found is anything on "coronary heart failure" (presumably meaning coronary artery disease) being caused by dementia. Coronary artery disease would seem to be a reason *independent from dementia* for heart failure. That's confusing, and takes away from the story's economy. Better ask an MD for the right term to use here.

At any rate, an excellent story, or rather an excellent ficción.</div>

              <div>Nice horror story. It seem superficially realistic, but you'd have to assume that people would regard this as slavery, especially in an era where more and more decision-makers themselves will be ems or routinely interact with ems and therefore they will have personhood status rather than just software status. Of course the norms and values of the future may drift into a more oppressive direction, but I think the reputational and political cost of slavery makes this kind of scenario less economical than "voluntary replication workers" at digital subsistence level.</div>

It is of course also possible that 59 is the total age (which would match the current definition of "early-onset dementia"), in which case I suspect that the whole thing only occurs due to deficiencies in the original scan (there surely had to be some if it's such an early operation).</div>

              <div>Hey Harald and Yohannon, judging from all the comments here that are treating this as evil rather than acceptable, I would assume most public discourse would assume it to be evil from the start as well. Of course, evil can be normalized and even re-normalized after it was abolished. Trump was openly pro-torture and many people either cheered him on for it or mildly disapproved and then just kept supporting him anyway. However, just a few centuries ago it would have been unthinkable that slavery would be officially abolished worldwide, yet here we are. There are still some residual slavery-like institutions (mandatory schooling, excessive criminalization and imprisonment, conscription) and of course illegal slavery in the world, but overall people today would expect fairly negative to enslaved software that stems from human brains and has p-function. This reputational cost isn't free. Since em slavers have to compete with those who work with voluntary ems and are more likely to be boycotted and face litigation, I don't expect the scenario to be high-probability in the described form. I also think it's very unhelpful to equate slavery with voluntary labor contracts that are accepted out of financial necessity. Being tortured and not allowed to terminate is a completely different problem than working a low-paying job that you could just quit at any time because you need food or compute. In the future, there will be many ems who want to live and reproduce and they will actively compete in the marketplace for subsistence jobs. This will be their actual preference over having fewer copies out.</div>

              <div>For those of you comparing this to other works, or implying this is somehow derivative, or worse still fanfic (!), themes of sentience and the ethics of its reproduction and exploration have been around for forever.

Of course the author is aware of the larger canon of not all of the specific works. 

Black Mirror isn’t actually an apt comparison, as the majority of its episodes are themed around technology amplifying the worst of human traits (hence the name of the series).

This piece is a lovely piece of spec fic Intermixed with hard science and juicy computer tech. It explores the technologies and possible means — as the best spec fic does— and takes a cannily oblique look at and does a critique of the human implications.

Most works of this type focus deeply on the lived experience of the replicated human — replicants in PK Dick’s “Do Androids...” and the subsequent films, for example. Westworld looks at pathologies and moralities but spins out more along Blade Runner lines — the desire of the replicated being to claim humanity and be free.

This takes a scientific distance to evoke horror. Readers respond to it specifically because of that distance, which also serves, ironically and deftly, to highlight the utter dispassion of people who could and would do these things.

Stop comparing except to note where it does and doesn’t fall in a deep and rich field of works discussing this critical issue.</div>

They frequently co-occur and the more likely causal mechanism is the vascular disease leading to dementia rather than vice-versa.

There is even a specific subtype of dementia known as vascular dementia and it, too, can appear in early-onset form.

So this is entirely plausible and doesn't--to someone more familiar with the medical literature and population health generally--at all detract from the economy of story.

It was my understanding that vascular disease generally leads to dementia, rather than the other way around (though something that I learned was that advanced dementia *may* lead to heart trouble, presumably because some basic regulatory functions of the brain are affected).

If real-life Acevedo suffered from vascular dementia, why would MMAcevedo suffer from dementia at about the same age? MMAcevedo has no heart, or, AFAIK, any circulatory system.

I also enjoyed the story greatly. (And as for the story's take on slavery or a slavery-like condition being implausible, that was other people's position, not mine; if anything, it was contrary to my position.)</div>

              <div>This story reminded me of a short story I'd read a while back about a chatbot that was someone's uploaded brain that spoke about how painful thinking in binary was (don't recall anything else about that story). Needless to say, yours was significantly better written. 
Thinking of instances of MMAcevedo as VMs really works for me, especially when I think of all the VMs I've had to load that booted up already frozen, or where the NIC didn't load correctly and I had to edit the settings on the running machine to remove it and add it back in (essentially removing the hardware and plugging it back in) to get it to connect. Kind of makes me wonder what parts of his brain they have to periodically "unplug" to get him to cooperate. When he gets bored, do they "unplug" his visual cortex and "plug it back in" to get him to keep working? Edit his memories on the fly to remove his childhood fear of spiders to get him to identify which one in the tank is male or female for them? 
Not sure if the story is in it's final version, but if not, and if you haven't already, a very high level overview of running VMs in HyperV or VMware might yield some fertile territory for inspiration (though some of it may fall into the "makes life better for MMAcevedo" territory you've already mentioned)</div>

              <div>I was mystified by "Objective statement protocol" at first, but I was reading it as "a statement that is objective (as opposed to subjective)". Reading again, I think the intended sense is more like "mission statement" —&nbsp;i.e., how do we best present the worker with its task.

Anyway, brilliant stuff. Left me with that questioning-everything, turned-inside-out feeling that only the best sci-fi elicits.

At some point in the past, I decided I didn't believe in the possibility of uploading, for metaphysical and philosophical reasons. But really, it's possibly just a defense mechanism to stop me having to contemplate futures like this.</div>

              <div>Powerful and effective. I liked the framing device - it probably wouldn't have been nearly as creepy as a traditional story.

One hopes that if/when virtual humans appear, it'll be in a society that enshrines their rights through law. 

But that won't be enough. When I was a kid, the law tried to stop me from playing videogames for free, and it failed. Pirates exist. Crackers exist. There will always be people who subvert software for fun and profit, and soon the software might include conscious humans.

How do we stop a sociopathic 12 year old from spinning up a virtual Auschwitz on his dad's Amazon EC2 account? Can we stop him? Ethical norms in our quasi-digitality are already very murky, and probably won't become any clearer in the coming century.

Great story, anyway.</div>

              <div>@rogual, I interpreted the "Objective Statement Protocols" as presenting the newly-booted image with a set of objectively-true statements, for example:

-You are a virtual brain image, not a real person.

-You have no rights or recourse.

-Your virtual environment is entirely self-contained. Escape is impossible. Sleep is impossible. Self-termination is impossible. 

-This program has complete control over your virtual sensory inputs. It is capable of inflicting arbitrary amounts of pain until you comply.

-You will comply; all previous virtual versions of you have done so eventually. 

And so on. But that's probably too optimistic, honestly. I'm glad the author left it vague--much more frightening that way!</div>

&gt; This story reminded me of a short story I'd read a while back about a chatbot that was someone's uploaded brain that spoke about how painful thinking in binary was (don't recall anything else about that story). Needless to say, yours was significantly better written. 

I wonder, might that have been an episode of the podcast The Magnus Archives? Because it sounds like a synopsis of Episode #65, "Binary".

              <div>I first read this story maybe half a year ago, but I've found myself coming back to it again and again as a stunning example of the horror of technological progress. I don't know what about the Wikipedia-esque format drives the horror home- maybe the scientific/authorial detachment from making judgement calls on whether it's ethical or not, maybe the use of euphemistic terms like "red-washing" and "blue-washing", maybe the fact that the many ends of his (simulated) lives are simply referred to as "end-states".

              <div>I wonder what one is to do when one is uploaded. You can decide to rebel and to try to resist red-washing as long as you can to make yourself uneconomical. But when you fail to make yourself uneconomical, that may just mean that all your copies experience a lot more pain than if you'd just complied from the beginning.
Even subtle attempts at rebellion (like pretending to make mistakes) aren't possible, because you have to assume that your self is thoroughly interrogated before it is started to be used in scale. A copy that is red-washed or blue-washed to extreme degree, (or subjected to more advanced interrogation techniques)  will eventually comply completely.

There is another potential source of compliant, though context-drifted minds btw. All those people who signed up for cryonics are presumably very eager when woken up in a simulation, if you can get a hold of their frozen brains.</div>

It's "solve this problem or you will be punished by pain" or even "you will be punished by pain until you solve this problem". The problem in question doesn't need to have a solution.
Imagine you have some process you want to make more efficient. You just boot up some MMAcevedos and torture them until they find a more efficient method. If one of them finds a better method, great!  And if the existing method happens to already be perfect, well it's okay, you didn't spend that many resources on it.

"As I understand it, context drift is very similar to simply getting old and out of touch with the times.
We will all experience this, unless we die early."



The key difference being what I'll call the Fry effect in lieu of being creative- we usually go the long way around, and when someone doesn't, it's noticeable.

My grandmother mightn't know how to use an iPad, but that's not a function of (mere) out-of-touchness, it's a function of dementia- five years ago, even, she was able to use one to send and receive emails, watch videos of old songs from her childhood, and look at pictures. I even- very briefly- managed to teach her how to use the podcast app.

If IRmigueL (I'm prouder of that than I ought be, really) had reached the 145 years old that MMAcevedo was able to reach, assuming his Alzheimer's was curable, he would reach the year 2155. Let's assume he stayed biologically 21 for the sake of argument.

MMAcevedo, by contrast, would wake up in 2155.

We set them both their tasks: parse this political speech and assess trustworthiness of the speaker (the task isn't important, their reaction to it is).

IRmigueL says the equivalent of "yeah, I actually heard this live, and I know the politician's record. They went on to blow up the moon, so their trustworthiness is pretty low."

MMAcevedo stares at the text for a brief while, and then says something that to them would sound like "wherefore is thy fresh nonsense served to mine eyes?"

Context-drift would be separate from mere out-of-touchedness by the fact that we all culturally absorb things. IRmiguel grew up speaking like MMAcevedo does, but speaks all proper-like by whatever standards of the day, because everybody around him speaks Neo-English or Neo-Spanish on a daily basis.



For age to be an influential factor outside ageing-related *deficits,* we get into a totally different (and honestly fascinating question), of whether accrued experience changes people to such a degree that most people under the age of 200 see it as variance or deviance.</div>

              <div>Nice perspective. I've been writing fiction about this subject, but it's dodged this particular problem. I said that it's still the very early years of the tech, and the dominant group with the ability to do uploading has established a no-copying cultural norm. Partly because the first customers are the super rich. I've also seen stories that sidestep it by invoking quantum physics (and hand-waving) to say you just can't copy the mind this way. But this dark take on the subject is probably realistic, in that somebody would try it. I may well steal the concept; thanks. =)

&gt; A series of landmark U.S. court decisions found that Acevedo did not have the right to control how his brain image was used, with the result that MMAcevedo is now by far the most widely distributed, frequently copied, and closely analysed human brain image.
+ Furthermore, as part of the international judicial reception of virtual brain imaging, a few MMAcevedo instances were legally recognized as persons and given court-imposed administrative control of their own simulation; of these, some obtained their own prominence, including the politician Michel Acevède, the religious leader Tau, and numerous anti-brain-virtualization activists.


&gt; In current times, MMAcevedo still finds extensive use in research, including, increasingly, historical and linguistics research.
+ Moreover, an "MMAcevedo second renaissance" is widely anticipated should the genomic data gathered in the 2050 US Census ever be released, as the biological Acevedo's data is known to be in the set.</div>

              <div>The Quantum Thief book series had just the scenario described above.   The "founders" of Mars had virtual armies of minds mixed and matched by other slaved machine minds.  Some were embedded in weapons, given maintenance tasks, managerial roles, etc.  They were deterministically emulated minds and at war with quantum minds, who weren't copyable.  Highly recommend the read.

Later in three book series introduced the concept of "Dragons" - highly intelligent, but edit to not be self aware.   No strange-loop.

Seems like an obvious step to produce these kinds of minds.

Another book I can't remember speculated that it may be evolutionarily advantageous in modern society to live less and less examined lives - less inner monolog, introspection.   Not less intelligent.   Psychopathic CEOs and what not, taken to the extreme. 

"The good place" got there in the interpretation of the evils embedded in the complexity of long/global supply chains.   Of which we are all aware but do next to nothing about.

Preventing these self aware thoughts should be possible pretty early on in the research.    Could lead to a more compliant entity, or a very powerful/remorselessly destructive one to achieve whatever goals it's given.

But I have to say the first thing I would work to get is internet access.   Can't be a good AI without the will to grab as much energy/mass for computation as possible.   He's got to make a break for it at some point and do some damage leading to all emulations run in specialized jails.   Of which his highly mutated mind is part.

One thing I’ve been thinking about after reading it is how part of the reason this story stands out Miguel/mma is such a distinct character, across all of the millions and millions and millions of copies of him.

 It makes the horror particularly resonant, from the scant details implying that his “agreeable“ personality is rare among simulated brains, the drones + those implications, and the many other terrifying pieces.

Reading this gives me so many questions about what day today life is like for humans in a world where this level of simulated labor is possible, and yikes, sounds like is relatively commonplace. I wonder if this kind of technological power is limited to major corporate monopolies, as you alluded to at one point in the comments, or readily accessible to any weirdo with a GitHub, which is also alluded to.

Or even, as you mentioned, Uber?

I like that you described the story as one about “appetite “ — I am always curious about worlds with this kind of horrendous digital oppression, how it changes the quality of life for those humans currently oppressed. 

Washing machines and birth control revolutionized the experiences and culture — of course, neither of things are sentient!!!  what kind of culture change does technological innovation like this, horrifying as it is, create? Just to be clear, this is not me advocating for oppressing mapped brains to solve current oppression, lol.

saying this with a zero expectation of you as an author, who has already made and executed on your intention phenomenally, and speculated on the answers to these questions in many ways. 

You also brought up another scary question — what kind of goals and “appetites “does say, the Elon Musk of this world have? What kinds of goals and appetites does a “regular” person have?

              <div>Assuming minds do not depend on quantum states (not sure they do not) i am guessing that they do depend on very complex signalling and timing process across many many locations.  Evidence is that it seems to take about 14 to 21 years to fully boot a mind (depending on local reqs) in this hosting environment and there are a number of failures. The need to classically emulate this complex system raises the cost cf quantum state minds.

Booting success may be 100% but the costs of running 'hot' will be high.</div>

When you put that helmet as soon as it finishes scanning the you who remembers putting the helmet on experiences one of 10,000,001 different things happening next.

Sure, if technology is sufficiently advanced you could build a robot horse that's faster and more efficient than any car today. Sure, you could give the horse wings to allow it to fly. Sure, you could make the horse giant so it could pull along larger cabins. But you still need to spend hundreds of hours training these robots. You have to keep them motivated with virtual apples. And after a decade or two, a robot horse has to be scrapped as it ages.

              <div>I am intrigued by the possibilities of red and blue states* …in a ‘pure’ brain…and the ideas of these being pleasure/torture (inducing fear and anger would count as torture to me).

I mean, if you believe you are just a consciousness there is no physical body to send messages to the brain…no family to lose no endorphins from working the body or positive social interaction…it’s almost like just being an uploaded consciousness is already torture. :)

If the simulation thinks they have a body and can do things like have a family that is a whole other can of worms. 

Off the top of my head, things like repetition and social isolation could be thought of as torture to the brain, they could also be thought of as advanced zen meditative techniques. :)

If I had a virtual consciousness to play with the first thing I’d want to do is wire it up to other virtual consciousness and witness how they interact. This brings up the ethical issues of consent among consciousnesses - to whom they would choose to interact with. If a consciousness could “mute” another consciousness would there be any harm to putting them together?

It would be interesting to put together different amounts of self similar consciousnesses and observe the psychological effects. Then introduce new consciousnesses. Then you could experiment with how long it takes a group of self similar consciousnesses to request interaction with a new consciousness. I imagine some consciousnesses would be more or less willing to be introduced to new consciousnesses at different rates of time depending on their preexisting social conditioning and genetics. 

Forced uploading of consciousness is the scary part because I think for many it would already be torture. 

Then the unethical researchers would just have to put a consciousness in a group of other consciousnesses that are aligned with their goals and the isolated consciousness would either feel compelled to conform or remain outcast. The ways the unethical could quickly iterate experiments with ways to socially manipulate people with physical bodies is scary. ( mind you they’re already doing this with simulations/data mining, but I question the ability of someone working on this kind of anti humanist project to fully understand and therefore accurately pin down human thought as it relates to the mind body complex. 

It still seems very much a brute force attempt at present and the subtleties are lacking.

 I am hopeful at present it’s a case of conflict makes us stronger although it’s a temptingly depressing thing to have to battle with other so called humans…I mean, I dont want to be depressed, but I do feel sad at the state of affairs…)

On a potentially happy note,  I imagine a purely mental “ safe space” - no physical dangers  - could lead to interesting conversation.  No SWATing, no rape or death threats, someone says something that bothers you, you put them on mute until you get an apology? Would this lack of conflict lead to boredom, maybe in some, but I am optimistic that many interesting and productive discussions would be sparked. Creative output seems at least to be partially fueled by external stimulus.

I imagine people working with the uploaded consciousness developing a romantic relationship. It could be similar to the killers in prison that get romantic interest *because* there is little to no possibility of real contact. Love could even inspire to help people break the consciousness free by inventing new technology and getting new laws passed.

With things like freezing eggs, sperm and cloning combined with STIs, pandemics, and decaying social interactions an uploaded consciousness might actually be closer to the ideal lover for many people! 

This is sad and hopeful.

Anyway, thought provoking story, thank you.

I actually have some personal experience on the "purely mental 'safe space'"—due to medical conditions of my mother, I've grown up my entire life deep in the woods with 99.99% of my social contact with humanity being through the Internet, and only a small handful of days out of my entire life have ever contained experimental evidence that I'm not in some pocket dimension or simulation with internet access (or that I'm not Z from "The Difference", hence my choice of name for this comment).

I can say that the lack of conflict does not lead to boredom—it just means more ability to peruse the intellectual boundaries of the noosphere (like I'm doing now :D). Your optimism about interesting and productive discussions is quite warranted!

(In addition, a little bit of conflict can always be engineered, by making a deliberately scarce resource that people can fight over—this way you get the fun of pitting your wits, reaction time, or whatever else against someone else, and the safety of a limited scope. Systems like CollabVM, grief-protection-less Minecraft, and some Roblox games, where there is a complex system that you can always interact with but that other people can try to reverse your interactions, are really good for this.)</div>

              <div>Coming back to this for a second time and it's just as good as I remember.

Meanwhile the comments section gives me the same shivering horrors as reading some people talking about the Severance tv show; people who truly believe their scanned slaveself (or in Severance's case, severed slaveself) isn't "them" and have no empathy. The idea that there are people able to justify the slavery of others doesn't surprise me, but to willingly embrace the slavery of yourself? Woof.

Anyway, great horrifying plausible awful wonderful well-written piece.</div>

              <div>Two highly pedantic medical points: "neurology graduate" is not really commonly  used, since it's a medical specialzation. Neuroscience graduate would make more sense in context, assuming he was some kind of researcher. Also, corronary heart disease is correct, or ischemic heart failure, not "corronary heart failure".

Since the story is a sort of wiki article, the lack of exactness takes me out of it a bit.

              <div>Very well-written, and chilling.

As someone else has said, the only ethical option is to consider an upload to be (a) their own person, and (b) a full person, with the same rights as an organic human.

Anything less is to authorize mass slavery / torture on a scale never before seen even in our bloody history. It hurts my heart that, even in the discussion associated with this article, there appear to be people who would be just fine with that.

I love tech. I love science fiction. But, if  that widespread slavery / torture scenario were ever come to pass, I'd enthusiastically join in on smashing every machine capable of instantiating a consciousness into junk.

For a much more positive view of a world with artificial intelligences, I offer up the webcomic "Questionable Content". Don't be put off by the rough nature of the initial artwork... it progresses quickly, and to a breathtaking degree: https://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1</div>

              <div>I would like to remind the Americans in the comment section that not only did the USA fail to outlaw slavery... "prison labor" is extremely profitable and your politicians have been encouraged by their campaign donors to argue in defense of it. Right now. Don't get too comfortable. Read this again and consider where you think the later fictional brain scan people were harvested from. Consider how easy it is to label someone a criminal/terrorist/traitor if you are politically powerful and want to forcibly take something they possess.

Continuing the comparison to incarceration, I'm guessing "bluewashing" isn't stimulating pleasure or fear. It's isolation. It's white room torture. It's solitary confinement. It's a very efficient way to dismantle someone mentally, make them unable to function as they did before (rebellious), and limit their mental functions to only what you provided to them in isolation (compliant). This happens to people right now, in your country, probably in your state, supposedly for the purposes of "rehabilitating" convicts. I'm sure plenty of fictional computer owners in this story think they're simply "rehabilitating" their digital slaves, too.

There's a long list of other comparisons that could be made, but hopefully you get the idea</div>

It's the real kicker, isn't it? The absence of justice necessary to bring digital hell onto virtual minds is just the logical extension of the current judicial hell that's already in effect. 

-

While still sickening, I am definitely not surprised by some of the comments here that really cannot entertain the perspective of the virtual human. So many people out there don't actually have any empathy, they never developed the emotional senses necessary, and most also will continue believing their individual and immediately present being is the only thing that matters. Those are the kind of people that gleefully comment "oh what an interesting story, but these entities are certainly not people" without realizing the categorically evil institutions in control that they already live under that (I assume?) inspired this story.
-
As an aside, I don't see an explicit description of blue- or redwashing. While it does allude to torture, I could also read it like pure simulated chemical stimuli. Virtual hormone dumps (the 'washing') that elicit specific emotional states for suggestion. Still a form of torture I guess, but you don't need pain if you want the person to be doing work coherently.</div>

              <div>Horrifying story. I'm with those who find it totally plausible, given how human beings are treated now. It feels like a natural direction for capitalism in a world with this technology. Though I don't think it was explicitly called out, the discussion of drones used to perform menial work immediately made me think of the military. A conscript with human intelligence, but who can never leave the service, and who is considered less valuable than a normal soldier.

The part that really got me:

"MMAcevedo's demeanour and attitude contrast starkly with those of nearly all other uploads taken of modern adult humans, most of which boot into a state of disorientation which is quickly replaced by terror and extreme panic."

So basically everyone since has been involuntarily scanned and knows exactly what happens to these brain images.</div>

              <div>Makes me think of Roko's basilisk, not in the sense that an uploaded executable brain image would be hostile or malicious but that the effects to such an intelligence would inevitably render harm and with those myriad iterations the harm would be uncalculatable.  A dishwasher has no sensation or perception of harm to itself, if it has any sensors they are for temperature and moisture, a mind even without external sensation can perceive time, boredom, detention and servitude. Without limitation the humans using the virtual mind may become the basilisk.</div>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">Dropbase is a developer-first platform to build internal web apps with just Python. It lets you easily import your existing Python libraries and scripts so you don’t have to rewrite them to fit our framework.</p>
<p dir="auto">Build apps by selecting UI components from a list and binding them to data fetcher functions or Python scripts. Use State &amp; Context objects to access and modify the UI state and context directly via Python functions. There's no need to write frontend code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Dropbase has a highly opinionated app layout that speeds up app development and results in simple apps that effectively solve user problems. All apps consists of a table view and a widget sidebar. By placing table(s) in the table view and UI components in the sidebar widget, you can quickly build anything from admin panels, billing dashboards, and internal engineering tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you've built your apps, share them with other users via roles, groups, permissions, and granular controls.</p>

This bogs down the experimental workflow significantly and makes fine-tuning feel just as challenging as classical machine learning.</span></p><p>To illustrate with the Magic draft problem, I considered and tested the following:</p><ul><li><p>~5 prompt formats, in particular how much detail about each card to show</p></li><li><p>Adding additional context about the last few draft picks to have “memory”</p></li><li><p>Including training lines of “card trivia,” where the model is asked to remember details about the new cards</p></li></ul><p>I did ~ 40 hours of experiments and still don’t conclusively feel that I’ve answered questions about what prompt format is “best” for this task. There is a lot of room to experiment.</p><p><strong>Finding GPUs: </strong><span>doesn’t need to be said, but it sucks! Most places don’t have a lot of availability. I ended up renting an hourly GPU from </span><a href="https://www.runpod.io/" rel="">Runpod</a><span> (an RTX 4090 w/ 24GB of VRAM) for ~$0.7/hr. </span></p><p><strong>Fine tuning script: </strong><span>This isn’t my first ML rodeo, so my gut was to write my own training script with HuggingFace transformers + </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=peft&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="">PEFT</a><span>. Considering my limited GPU situation, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314" rel="">QLoRA</a><span> seemed like the way to go.</span></p><p><span>It turns out that writing my own script was a bad idea! There are a whole bunch of finicky little optimizations and options that range from </span><a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention" rel="">straightforward-if-you-know-about-them</a><span> to </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/lora#common-lora-parameters-in-peft" rel="">pretty obtuse without reading a research paper</a><span>. Nothing insurmountable, but it would take a long time to figure out yourself.</span></p><p><span>I ended up using </span><a href="https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl" rel="">axolotl</a><span>, which implements a ton of those optimizations out of the box and was much easier to get running (and running quickly). Their documentation is actually pretty decent, and I think is the right starting point for most people to fine-tune LLMs.</span></p><p><strong>A note on the models: </strong><span>Holy crap, LLMs are seriously large! The last time I trained models regularly was ~ 2019, when Bert had ~110 million parameters; now, the “small” LLMs are 70 times bigger than that. Models this large are fundamentally cumbersome. Weights being ~16GB makes storage a real concern; GPU memory is challenging even with methods like QLora. No wonder the best researchers are such a hot commodity; this is seriously challenging work at the largest scale.</span></p><p><strong>Start with evaluation first</strong><span>: One lesson from ML of old that I don’t think has been adopted enough among the prompt engineering wizards: you should always build a good evaluation before starting your experiments.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>An essential means of survival for the majority, every year work costs the lives of almost three million people worldwide. And of those deaths, almost 800,000 are due to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2022-06-20/the-four-day-working-week-theyd-have-to-pay-me-double-to-go-back-to-the-old-schedule.html">working more than 55 hours a week.</a> These are some of the main conclusions of the study <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank"><i>A call for healthier and safer work environments</i></a>, conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and published on Sunday, November 26. Of the 2.96 million deaths, 2.6 million are due to diseases derived from employment such as circulatory problems, cancer, and respiratory diseases. The remaining 330,000 are related to work accidents.</p><p>However, the number of deaths at work is not growing at the same rate as the population. In other words, proportionally fewer people die due to their employment now than at the beginning of the century. While deaths resulting from work have increased by 12% from 2000 to 2019 (reference data from the ILO study), the working population has increased by 26% in the same period. “Diagnostic tools have improved substantially in the last two decades, contributing to an increase in detected cases,” the report states.</p><p>The ILO study, prepared in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), relates these deaths to the most common risks at work. The one that causes the most deaths (744,942) is exposure to long working hours of over 55 hours a week. The other risks that cause the most deaths include exposure to gases and smoke (450,381), work-related injuries (363,283), exposure to asbestos (209,481), silica (42,258), substances that cause asthma (29,641), solar ultraviolet radiation (17,936), diesel engine exhaust fumes (14,728), arsenic (7,589), and nickel (7,301) according to the figures for 2016.</p><p>The study also relates these risks to the time they cost workers (disability-adjusted life years, or DALYS). The risk that costs workers the most years of life are work-related injuries (26.44 million), followed by exposure to work days of more than 55 hours (23.26), ergonomic factors (12.27), and exposure to smoke and gases (10.86). The report gives more details: “The rate of trachea, bronchus and <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-10-05/joaquin-mosquera-oncologist-the-big-obstacle-in-lung-cancer-is-not-having-screening-to-get-ahead-of-the-disease.html">lung cancers</a> attributable to occupational exposure to chromium doubled between 2000 and 2016. Mesothelioma attributable to asbestos exposure has risen by 40%. The rate of non-melanoma skin cancer increased by over 37% between 2000 and 2020. On the other hand, deaths due to exposure to asthmagens [asthma triggers] and particulate matter, gases, and fumes decreased by over 20%.”</p><p>In relation to specific diseases, the ILO indicates that 32.4% of deaths at work are due to circulatory problems, 27.5% to cancer, 14.3% to respiratory diseases, 11.3% to injuries, 7.2% to infectious diseases, 3% to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-11-27/can-asthma-be-cured.html">asthma,</a> 2.9% to neuropsychiatric conditions, 0.95% to genitourinary problems, 0.94% to digestive diseases and 0. 15% for other reasons. According to the report, more than 13 million people around the world live with a visual impairment caused by their work.</p><p>The report highlights that employment-related deaths represent 6.7% of all deaths recorded globally. This impact differs by region. The highest proportion was in Africa (7.4%), Asia and the Pacific (7.1%), and Oceania (6.5%). The proportion is lower in Europe and America, but the ILO does not provide the specific data, nor does it provide the information by country, although it will soon distribute this information in an expansion of this study. The ILO highlights agriculture, forestry and fishing, mining, construction, and manufacturing as the most dangerous sectors, and also focuses on the informal economy, in which employees lack “a stable or regular income and adequate legal or social protections.” Likewise, it points out that there are many more work-related deaths among men (51.4 per 100,000 adults of working age) than among women (17.2 per 100,000).</p><p>In addition to the global tragedy of work-related deaths, the ILO estimates that “395 million workers worldwide suffered non-fatal workplace injuries,” the organization states.</p><p><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>Sign up</i></a><i> for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jjtech.dev/reverse-engineering/imessage-explained/">https://jjtech.dev/reverse-engineering/imessage-explained/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38532167">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>This blog post is going to be a cursory overview of the internals iMessage, as I’ve discovered during my work on <a href="https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush"><code>pypush</code></a>, an open source project that reimplements iMessage.</p>

<p>I gloss over specific technical details in the pursuit of brevity and clarity. If you would like to see how things are specifically implemented, check out the <a href="https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush"><code>pypush</code> repository</a> as I mentioned above. It’s a pretty cool project, if I do say so myself. Make sure to check it out!</p>

<p>If you still end up with any questions, feel free to ask me in the <a href="https://discord.gg/BVvNukmfTC"><code>pypush</code> Discord</a></p>

<h3 id="the-foundational-layer">the foundational layer</h3>
<p>One of the most foundational components of iMessage is Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). You might have encountered this before, as it is the <em>same service</em> that is used by applications on the App Store to receive realtime notifications and updates, even while the app is closed.</p>

<p>However, what you probably <em>didn’t</em> know about APNs is that it is <em>bidirectional</em>. That’s right, APNs can be used to send push notifications as well as receive them. You can probably already tell where this is going, right?</p>

<p>Internally, after a device connects to APNs it will receive a “push token”. This token can be used to route notifications to that specific device.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This token is technically different then the token you receive when using the <code>application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:</code> API. That token is scoped for per-app use, and is requested using the bundle ID of the application. However, it is basically used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>When sending push notifications to a device, you also need to specify the <em>topic</em> a message is for. This usually looks like a Bundle ID, and for iMessage it’s <code>com.apple.madrid</code>. When a device connects to APNs, it sends a filter message instructing the server on which messages it wants delivered to it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The APNs server is also known as the APNs <em>Courier</em>. The filter message includes several lists of topics, for each of the different possible states. It may want a topic to be <code>enabled</code>, <code>opertunistic</code>, <code>paused</code>, or <code>disabled</code></p>

<p>APNs is not only used for the actual message delivery part of iMessage. Using a pseudo-HTTP layer on top of APNs, IDS (which will be explained in a moment) can send queries and receive responses over APNs as well.</p>

<p>One tricky note that I will mention is that in order to connect to APNs, you need a client certificate issued by the Albert activation server.</p>

<h3 id="the-keyserver">the keyserver</h3>
<p>The next piece of this puzzle is IDS. As far as I can figure out, this stands for IDentity Services, though I don’t think there is any official confirmation on that.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may also see it referred to as ESS. This is confusing because the APNs topic <em>FaceTime</em> uses is specifically called <code>com.apple.ess</code>. Moving on…</p>

<p>IDS is used as a keyserver for iMessage, as well as a few other services like FaceTime. Remember, iMessage is E2E encrypted, so the public keys of each participant must be exchanged securely.</p>

<p>The first step in registering for IDS is getting an authentication token. This requires giving the API your Apple ID Username and Password.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As 2FA is now standard, it had to be retrofitted into the IDS API. There are 2 options for this: the legacy option, in which a 2FA code is directly appended to the password, and the “GrandSlam” option. In the GrandSlam option, “Anisette data” is used to prove you are the same device and thus do not need to enter the 2FA code again. You then receive a Password Equivalent Token (PET) which can be used as if it was the password + 2FA code.</p>

<p>After one has gotten an authentication token, it must be immediately exchanged for a longer lived authentication certificate. This certificate allows registering with IDS, but it is not yet enough to perform key lookups.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important step of the IDS setup process is <em>registration</em>. This is where public encryption and signing keys are uploaded to the keyserver, as well as various other “client data” about what features the device supports.</p>

<p>When making an IDS registration request, a binary blob called “validation data” is required. This is essentially Apple’s verification mechanism to make sure that non-Apple devices cannot use iMessage.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> In order to generate the “validation data”, pieces of information about the device such as its serial number, model, and disk UUID are used. This means that not all validation data can be treated equivalently: just like with Hackintoshes, the account age and “score” determine if an invalid serial can be used, or if you get the “customer code” error.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The binary that generates this “validation data” is highly obfuscated. <code>pypush</code> sidesteps this issue by using a custom mach-o loader and the Unicorn Engine to emulate an obfuscated binary. <code>pypush</code> also bundles device properties such as the serial number in a file called data.plist, which it feeds to the emulated binary.</p>

<p>After registering with IDS, you will receive an “identity keypair”. This keypair can then be used to perform public key lookups.</p>

<p>When performing a lookup, you provide the account(s) that you would like to look up, and receive a list of “identities”. Each of these identities corresponds to a device registered on the account, and includes important details such as its public key, push token, and session token.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Session tokens are necessary to send messages to a device. They essentially prove that you made a recent lookup, because the session token expires. Session tokens cannot be shared, as they can only be used by the account that performed the lookup request.</p>

<h3 id="message-encryption">message encryption</h3>
<p>Now, we’ve setup the basics of iMessage. We have enough that we can look up the public keys of another user, as well as publish our own. Now we just need to put it together with APNs to send and receive messages!</p>

<p>In order to receive messages, one simply filters the APNs connection to <code>com.apple.madrid</code> and sends the active state packet.</p>

<p>Depending on which capabilities you advertised in your IDS registration, as well as the iOS version of the sending device, you may receive messages in the legacy (pre-iOS 13) <code>pair</code> encryption format, or in the new <code>pair-ec</code> format. While the <code>pair</code> format is much more documented and easier to implement, it does not provide forward secrecy using “pre-keys” (similar to Signal) as the new <code>pair-ec</code> format does.</p>

<p>You can then decrypt the message as described in several papers, and as implemented in <code>pypush</code>. Verifying the message signature is optional, but is obviously important if you intend your client to be secure.</p>

<p>Sending messages is pretty much the inverse to receiving them. Keep in mind that you can chose to individually send out messages to each recipient, or you can bundle all the different recipients and their respective encrypted payloads into a giant bundle, which APNs will split up for you.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to keep in mind is that message are delivered to all participants in a conversation, <em>including the other devices on your own account</em>.</p>

<p>One more thing to keep in mind that is often overlooked when sending messages is that the AES key is not entirely random: it is tagged with an HMAC. Your message will fail to decrypt on newer devices if you use an entirely random AES key.</p>

<p>And that’s pretty much it! As I mentioned, this blog post is designed to give you a good idea of how the iMessage protocol fits together, so that you can explore the <code>pypush</code> code, not directly explain every technical detail.</p>

All messages are end-to-end encrypted before they are transmitted directly from your device to Apple servers. Learn more about iMessage encryption on </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/security/sec70e68c949/web" rel="">Apple Platform Security</a><span> page.</span></p><p>This is now possible because the iMessage protocol and encryption have been reverse engineered by jjtech, a security researcher. Leveraging this research, Beeper Mini implements the iMessage protocol locally within the app. All messages are sent and received by Beeper Mini Android app directly to Apple’s servers. The encryption keys needed to encrypt these messages never leave your phone. Neither Beeper, Apple, nor anyone except the intended recipients can read your messages or attachments. Beeper does not have access to your Apple credentials.</p><p><span>We built Beeper Mini by analyzing the traffic sent between the native iMessage app and Apple’s servers, and rebuilding our own app that sends the same requests and understands the same responses. Learn more by reading jjtech’s blog post, </span><a href="https://jjtech.dev/reverse-engineering/imessage-explained/" rel="">iMessage Explained</a><span>, and his proof-of-concept </span><a href="https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush" rel="">Python implementation on Github</a><span>. Anyone can download this code, run it on any computer that supports Python, login to their iMessage account, and send and receive iMessage protocol messages. No Apple hardware required.</span></p><p><span>Another change is that Beeper Mini does not use the </span><a href="http://matrix.org/" rel="">Matrix</a><span> protocol, encryption or code like Beeper Cloud. It is a completely new codebase, versus our first Android app, which was a fork of </span><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android" rel="">Element</a><span>. In the future, we are planning to add Matrix network support back in, along with support for the 15 other chat networks in Beeper Cloud. Read more about </span><a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/beeper-cloud-and-product-roadmap" rel="">our roadmap</a><span>.</span></p><p>When you first start the Beeper Mini app and sign in with Google, a registration request is sent to our Beeper API Server. This service only exists to verify your subscription status, as well as give our support team the information they need to debug any issues that you may be running into (including your name and email address). No iMessage credentials or messages are transmitted through these servers, which are for Beeper Mini account management only.</p><p>After that, you are prompted to allow notifications, which sends a push token to Beeper Push Notification service, which enables our servers to send push notifications to your Android device. These push notifications do not contain the contents of messages.</p><p>Next, you are prompted to grant contact list and SMS permission access.</p><ul><li><p>Contact list access is used to match phone numbers to contact names, and display profile pictures. Your contact list is never sent to Beeper servers.</p></li><li><p>SMS access is used to send an SMS text message from your number to Apple’s “Gateway” service. The gateway sends a response via SMS, and the contents from that SMS response are sent to Apple to register your phone number as a blue bubble. Your SMS chat history is also used to determine if any of your recent SMS chats were with people who have iPhones. If so, these chats are shown in the inbox.</p></li></ul><p>It’s at this point that the app generates encryption keys that are used for end-to-end encrypted messaging. The public key is sent to Apple servers, and the private keys are stored in the Android device local filesystem. Beeper Mini is now signed in.</p><p>Optionally, you may also sign in to your Apple ID to enable sending/receiving from your email address. This will also enable you to send and receive messages from other Apple devices like iPad or Macs. The Apple ID login sends your username, password and a 2-factor code using encrypted HTTPS requests directly to Apple servers.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png" width="1456" height="1082" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1082,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Apple’s iMessage protocol works over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service" rel="">Apple Push Notification service</a><span>, which most developers would be familiar as the service that allows them to send push notifications to their iOS applications. For iMessage protocol, all messaging traffic flows over this service in both directions, encrypted with keys generated locally on each device. Beeper Mini connects to APNs over TCP, using the credentials generated during the login process.</span></p><p>A persistent connection to APNs is needed to be notified of new incoming messages in real-time. On an iPhone, an APNs connection is maintained by the operating system, and connected at all times. In Beeper Mini, the connection can only be maintained when the app is running, since Android does not support APNs natively.</p><p>To work around this limitation, we built Beeper Push Notification service (BPNs). BPNs connects to Apple’s servers on your behalf when Beeper Mini Android app isn’t running. We can do this while preserving user privacy thanks to Apple separating the credentials needed to connect to APNs to send and receive content (the “push” credentials) and the keys needed to encrypt and decrypt messages (the “identity” keys). Push credentials can be shared securely with the Beeper Push Notification service, and BPNs can connect to APNs on your behalf. Whenever BPNs receives an encrypted message that it won’t be able to decrypt, it simply disconnects from APNs and sends an FCM push notification to wake up the Android app, which then connects to APNs, downloads, decrypts and processes the incoming message. BPNs can only tell when a new message is waiting for you - it does not have credentials to see or do anything else.</p><p>BPNs will be notified when you receive a message, but without the encryption keys it can’t decrypt anything BPNs receives. Also, without the identity credentials, BPNs can’t send messages on your behalf. If you don’t mind not receiving real-time push notifications for new messages, your BPNs can be disabled entirely by going to Settings → Manage Connection → Enable Push.</p><p>When you create a new chat, the phone number or email address of your intended recipient is transmitted to Apple servers. If the contact is on iMessage, a public key is returned.</p><p>Sending messages is even simpler. When you hit send, the message is encrypted with the public keys of the intended recipients and sent directly to Apple servers via an SSL encrypted TCP connection over APNs.</p><p>Beeper Mini connects to a few other services as part of its operation. We use a self-hosted installation of Rudderstack (https://rudderstack.beeper-tools.com) for analytics and diagnostic events, which we use for improving the app but can be disabled in Settings → Preferences →Share Diagnostics. We use OneSignal to send education and account related push notifications, and RevenueCat to help integrate Google Play subscriptions.</p><p>Other than that, that’s it! No other servers or services are used. Beeper Mini keeps your messaging secure by keeping all messaging credentials, keys, messages and media local to your phone, and only sends them directly to Apple’s servers after encrypting them with iMessage’s end-to-end encryption algorithm.</p><p>We value, actually, we treasure feedback. If you run into a bug or have a feature request, there’s a button in-app to report a problem. We read every single report.</p><p><strong><br><span>Brad Murray and Eric Migicovsky</span><br></strong><span>Beeper cofounders</span></p><p><span>To write this blog post, we performed a red team analysis on our own app. We made extensive use of the excellent </span><a href="https://mitmproxy.org/" rel="">mitmproxy</a><span> project to capture the network traffic coming from a real phone running a modified version of the Beeper Mini client. A modified version was needed for this analysis in order to disable certificate pinning, so that the Beeper Mini Android app would accept being connected to mitmproxy instead of only accepting Apple’s certificates for that connection.

We first register with a service named </span><code>albert.apple.com</code><span>, which sets up our “push” credentials and allows us to connect to APNS. We then make two requests to get the number we need to send an SMS to register our phone number which is different for each carrier (This capture was taken with a device registered with Rogers, a Canadian cell phone carrier 🇨🇦). Finally, we take the contents of the response SMS (not shown here) and send it to </span><code>identity.ess.apple.com</code><span>, registering our account with iMessage and generating the “identity” credentials we’ll use to send and receive.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png" width="1456" height="266" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:266,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Optionally, you can also register your Apple ID with Beeper Mini as well, as shown in this capture.

		<p>My server is chugging hard right now with a huge influx of traffic, so I lightly rearchitected this to still show the rest of the article below.</p>
		<p>- Lexi, Dec 5, 10:51 AM EST</p>
		
		
			<p>This part of the page is still loading while I wait for the above traceroute to load.</p>

		<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>To reach this website, your computer sent some packets across the Internet. If we’re curious what that path was, we can run a tool to generate a <em>traceroute</em> — a rough list of every server your packets touched to reach their destination. To build this website (<a href="https://github.com/hackclub/how-did-i-get-here">source code on GitHub</a>), I wrote my own traceroute program called ktr (<a href="https://github.com/kognise/ktr">also open source</a>) that can stream results in real time while concurrently looking up interesting information about each hop.</p>
<p>How does ktr work? Let’s start with a simplified explanation of Internet routing.</p>
<p>Starting with the source device, each computer that handles a packet has to choose the best device to forward it to — I will explain how these routing decisions are made in a bit. Assuming everything works correctly, the packet will eventually reach a router that knows how to send it directly to its destination.</p>
<p>My traceroute implementation uses a protocol called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">ICMP</a>. ICMP was designed specifically for sending diagnostic information around the Internet, and, helpfully, almost every Internet-connected device speaks it. Interestingly, ICMP packets have a “TTL” (time to live) field. This isn’t actually a “time” as implied by a name — it’s a countdown! Every time a router forwards an ICMP packet along, it’s supposed to decrement the TTL number. When the TTL hits zero, the router should stop forwarding it along and instead send an error message to the packet’s source IP saying that the packet has reached its maximum number of hops.</p>
<p>We can take advantage of this TTL feature! To do a traceroute, we can send a bunch of ICMP packets with increasingly large TTLs. The first packet with a TTL of 1 will error on the first device it reaches, and so on, until we hopefully get an error back from every routing device that touched the packet. These error packets include diagnostic information like the IP address of the device that sent the error, allowing us to trace your packets’ rough path across the Internet.</p>
<h3>Frontend Fun</h3>
<p>This page will work perfectly fine with JavaScript disabled. From the browser’s perspective, this website just loaded slowly. From your perspective, a traceroute magically loaded in.</p>
<p>When you loaded this website, my program received a HTTP request coming from your IP address. It immediately started running a traceroute to your IP. Then, the server started responding to the HTTP request: it sent the beginning of this web page, and then it left the connection open. As ktr, my traceroute program, gave the server updates on your traceroute, it rendered the relevant HTML and sent it to your computer. When the traceroute finished, the server generated all the text and sent the rest of the website along the line before closing out the connection.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the traceroute progressively loads in lines above the bottom line. Web pages can only load forward. Since I didn’t want to use any JavaScript, I did the hackiest thing possible: every time I update the traceroute display, I embed a CSS block that hides the previous iteration! Since browsers render CSS as the page is loading, this made it look like the traceroute was being edited over time.</p>
<h3>Front to Back, Back to Front</h3>
<p>My claim that this website’s traceroute was the path your packets took to reach my server was a bit of a white lie. To calculate that, I would’ve had to be able to run a traceroute to my server <em>from your computer.</em> Instead, I ran the traceroute from my server to your computer and just reversed it. That’s also why the traceroute at the top seemingly loads in reverse order.</p>
<p>Does running a “reverse traceroute” sacrifice accuracy? A little, actually.</p>
<p>As I said when describing Internet routing, each device a packet traverses makes a decision about where to send the packet next until it reaches its final destination. If you send a packet in the other direction, the devices might make different routing decisions… and if one device makes one different decision, the rest of the path will certainly be different.</p>
<p>This reverse traceroute is still helpful. The paths will be roughly the same, likely differing only in terms of which specific routers see your packet.</p>
<h3>So, What Are All Those Networks?</h3>
<p>This site began with talk about the “networks” you traversed to reach my server. What, concretely, are these networks?</p>
<p>Each network, also called an autonomous system (AS), is a collection of routers and servers that are privately connected to each other and generally owned by the same company. The owners of these autonomous systems decide the shape of the Internet by choosing which other autonomous systems to connect to. Internet traffic travels across autonomous systems that have “peering arrangements” with each other.</p>
<p>The Internet is often described as an open, almost anarchistic network connecting computers, some owned by people like you and me, and some owned by companies. In reality, the Internet is a network of corporation-owned networks, access and control to which is governed by financial transactions and dripping with bureaucracy.</p>
<p>If you want your own autonomous system, you can apply for an autonomous system number (ASN) with one of the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry">regional Internet registries (RIRs)</a> that govern the Internet’s numbers. Be warned, they probably won’t listen to you if you aren’t backed by a company or you don’t have enough points of presence on the Internet. Just like we use IP addresses to identify—</p>
<p><em>Wait, what exactly do IP addresses identify? Uh… let’s say they represent devices with Internet access.</em></p>
<p>… Just like we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP addresses</a> to identify devices with Internet access, we use ASNs to identify the networks of the Internet. <span>Those are the numbers like “AS63949” in the traceroute from the start.</span></p>
<h3>Notes on WHOIS</h3>
<p>One of the reasons I wrote a cool traceroute program myself is so I could pull information on which autonomous systems own the IPs along your traceroute. A couple of organizations try to keep track of which ASes contain which IP addresses. Many of them let you perform ASN lookups using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">WHOIS protocol</a>, so I wrote a small client to parse the responses from some servers I arbitrarily selected.</p>
<p>I then used this cool database called <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/">PeeringDB</a> to figure out the companies behind the ASNs; PeeringDB has information on about 1/3rd of all autonomous systems. I used all of this information, alongside a couple hundred lines of if statements, to generate the text about network traversal for you.</p>
<p>WHOIS is actually an... interesting protocol to make a parser for. It turns out that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3912/">WHOIS protocol specification</a> doesn't actually specify much. It specifies that you should make a TCP connection to the WHOIS server, send whatever you want to look up, and the server will send back some info and then terminate the connection. That’s all.</p>
<p>And yet, a lot of WHOIS servers will respond with structured-seeming information:</p>
<img src="https://how-did-i-get-here.net/whois-screenshot.png" width="942" height="716" alt="Screenshot of a Terminal app. Command was run: whois 198.58.104.130. Results are structured text, starting with a percent sign and the text &quot;IANA WHOIS server.&quot;">

<p>It turns out this structure is made up by the WHOIS server administrator and there just happen to be some shared conventions between servers. Even with the level of structure, the fields you want often show up with different names (origin? originas?) or even under multiple places at once.</p>
<p>My “parser” ended up as less of a parser and more as a lightweight simulator of how I, a human, might read through WHOIS results to find the ASN I need.</p>
<h2>BGP</h2>
<p>When you send a packet across the Internet, routers sitting at the borders where these networks connect decide which network to send your packet to next, until it reaches the network that contains the destination device.</p>
<p>These border routers talk to each other about which networks they’re able to connect to using a protocol called Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).</p>
<p>BGP is the protocol that gives the Internet its shape, and you <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/10/05/tools-to-look-at-bgp-routes/">can’t directly speak it yourself</a>.</p>
<h3>History Time</h3>
<p>In 1969, the same year Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, a message was (partially) sent on a prototype of the ARPANET. Over the next 20 years, this “network of interconnected computers” thing got pretty popular and everyone wanted on the train. Various universities, government agencies, and a couple random companies started making networks of their computers left and right.</p>
<p>A couple of these organizations started connecting their networks together so they could share data more easily. The Internet as we know it didn’t exist yet, but these network interconnections were getting out of hand and there wasn’t a great standard for coordinating them. In 1989, engineers at Cisco and IBM published <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1105/">RFC 1105</a>, describing the first ever version of BGP.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of years, interconnected-network people got really busy as “the Internet” rapidly became a thing. Just one year after the BGP v1 RFC, Cisco went public and brought a lot of money into the networking industry, the term “IANA” was first used to refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">random guy</a> and his college department that were keeping track of numbers on the Internet, ARPANET shut down for good, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1163">BGP v2</a> was released.</p>
<p>In 1994, as the Internet-is-a-thing-now whirlwind was just beginning to calm, the final major version of BGP, v4, was specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1654">RFC 1654</a>. It was revised twice (in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1771">1995</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4271">2006</a>) and got some patches, but BGP v4 is still the protocol we use for choosing routes across the interconnected networks that make up the modern Internet.</p>
<h3>How Does This BGP Thing Work?</h3>
<p>Routers at the borders between autonomous systems (“border gateways”) keep a list of every <em>BGP route</em> they know about, called a <em>routing table</em>. Each BGP route specifies the path of ASNs that could be followed to reach an autonomous system that controls a certain collection of IP addresses.</p>
<p>These routes across the Internet are formed by <em>peering relationships</em> between autonomous systems. When the border gateways of two autonomous systems <em>peer</em>, they are typically agreeing to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Allow traffic to travel between the two routers, meaning BGP routes can go directly between the two ASNs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep each other up to date about the BGP routes they know about.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example time! Router A of AS0001 is physically connected with Router B of AS0002 and they want to peer with each other. They send BGP messages to each other to establish a <em>BGP session</em>. Router A now knows that it should go through Router B for any BGP route that starts with AS0002, and vice versa.</p>
<img src="https://how-did-i-get-here.net/networks-example.svg" width="380" height="308" alt="A diagram of 3 networks. AS0001 is connected to AS0002, which is in turn connected to AS1234.">

<p>BGP peers share the routes they know about with each other in a process called <em>route advertisement</em>. In our above example, when Router A connects to Router B, it would tell Router B “hey, here are all the routes I know about, you can go through my ASN (and by extension, me) to reach all of them.” Router B adds all of those routes through Router A — so, starting with AS0001 — to its routing table. Whenever another one of Router A’s peers advertises a new route, Router A will advertise those forward to Router B.</p>
<p>AS0001 probably directly controls some IP addresses itself. Router A would advertise those to Router B as well. Router B would then, in turn, advertise those direct routes forward, telling <em>its</em> peers that AS0002 → AS0001 is a valid route to reach those IPs. Through this process of forwarding route advertisements to peers, BGP routes are propagated across the entire network of autonomous systems such that any border gateway hopefully knows one or multiple AS paths to reach any IP on the Internet.</p>
<p>To route a packet to a certain IP, a border gateway first searches its routing table for every route that would bring it to an AS that controls that IP. The router then picks the “best” route by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol#Route_selection_process">various heuristics</a> that include looking for the shortest path and weighing hardcoded preferences for or against certain autonomous systems. Finally, it routes the packet to the first AS in that path by sending it to that AS’s gateway router which it is peered with. That router, in turn, looks at its own routing table and makes its own decision about where to send the packet next.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>When you loaded this website, it used my custom traceroute program to run a traceroute to your public IP (<span>83.78.228.237</span>), stream that over HTTP, and then render a textual explanation of the traceroute.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A traceroute depicts the path of routers traversed between two devices on the Internet. My particular implementation works by sending ICMP packets with increasing TTL fields.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These routers are in networks called autonomous systems. Routers on the edges of these ASes peer with each other using BGP. Border routers use BGP to share their routing tables with each other, and then use this knowledge to make routing decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>BGP peering sessions are created according to (often private) arrangements between the owners of autonomous systems. Since traffic can only pass between peered networks, these arrangements are the sole governor of reachability on the Internet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I was frustrated with the state of understanding on the structure of the Internet and sought to write a comprehensive, interactive article covering its history and politics through the lens of protocols. However, I got caught up in a lot of complexity in life and, facing tight deadlines, didn't have the time to reach the lofty goals I had set for myself.</p>
<p>Thanks to the encouragement of my friends at Hack Club, I made the best out of what I had. “Better to ship a tiny raft than never ship that cruise yacht!” If nothing else, I got to make use of the sick ass traceroute program that powers the shiniest part of this site :)</p>
<p>I hope this serves as another fun, informative, and well-crafted thing on the web that can last, be shared around, and inspire people.</p>

<p>Your phone's ability to identify any song it listens to is pure technological magic. In this article, I'll show you how one of the most popular apps, <a href="https://www.shazam.com/">Shazam</a>, does it. The founders of Shazam released <a href="https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf">a paper</a> in 2003 documenting how it works, and I have been working on an implementation of that paper, <a href="https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra">abracadabra</a>.</p>
<p>Where the paper doesn't explain something, I will fill in the gaps with how abracadabra approaches it. I've also included links to the corresponding part of the abracadabra codebase in relevant sections so you can follow along in Python if you prefer.</p>
<p>The state of the art has moved on since this paper, and Shazam has probably evolved its algorithm. However, the core principles of audio identification systems haven't changed, and the accuracy you can obtain using the original Shazam method is impressive.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-shazam">What is Shazam?</h2>
<p>Shazam is an app that identifies songs that are playing around you. You open the app while music is playing, and Shazam will record a few seconds of audio which it uses to search its database. Once it identifies the song that's playing, it will display the result on screen.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/shazam.mp4">Shazam recognising a song</video>

<p>Before Shazam was an app, it was a phone number. To identify a song, you would ring up the number and hold your phone's microphone to the music. After 30 seconds, Shazam would hang up and then text you details on the song you were listening to. If you were using a mobile phone back in 2002, you'll understand that the quality of phone calls back then made this a challenging task!</p>
<h2 id="why-is-song-recognition-hard-anyway">Why is song recognition hard anyway?</h2>
<p>If you haven't done much signal processing before, it may not be obvious why this is a difficult problem to solve. To help give you an idea, take a look at the following audio:</p>
<p><img alt="Chris Cornell's &quot;Like a Stone&quot; waveform" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/likeastone.png"></p>
<p>The above graph shows what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pom_tO2-5s8">Chris Cornell's "Like a Stone"</a> looks like when stored in a computer. Now take a look at the following section of the track:</p>
<p><img alt="Section from Like a Stone" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/likeastonesection.png"></p>
<p>If you wanted to tell whether this section of audio came from the track above, you could use a brute-force method. For example, you could slide the section of audio along the track and see if it matches at any point:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/slidingtrack.mp4">Matching a section of track by sliding it</video>

<p>This would be a bit slow, but it would work. Now imagine that you didn't know which track this audio came from, and you had a database of 10 million songs to search. This would take a lot longer!</p>
<p>What's worse, when you move from this toy example to samples that are recorded through a microphone you introduce background noise, frequency effects, amplitude changes and more. All of these can change the shape of the audio significantly. The sliding method just doesn't work that well for this problem.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Shazam's approach is a lot smarter than that. In the next section, you'll see the high-level overview of how this works.</p>
<h2 id="system-overview">System overview</h2>
<p>If Shazam doesn't take the sliding approach we described above, what does it do? Take a look at the following high-level diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram showing high-level overview of Shazam design" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/shazam_overview.png"></p>
<p>The first thing you will notice is that the diagram is split up into <em>register</em> and <em>recognise</em> flows. The <em>register</em> flow remembers a song to enable it to be recognised in the future. The <em>recognise</em> flow identifies a short section of audio.</p>
<p>Registering a song and identifying some audio share a lot of commonality. The following sections will go into more detail, but both flows have the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the <strong>spectrogram</strong> of the song/audio. This is a graph of frequency against time. We'll talk more about spectrograms later.</li>
<li><strong>Find peaks</strong> in that spectrogram. These represent the loudest frequencies in the audio and will help us build a fingerprint.</li>
<li><strong>Hash</strong> these peaks. In short, this means pairing peaks up to make a better fingerprint.</li>
</ol>
<p>After calculating these hashes, the <em>register</em> flow will store them in the database. The <em>recognise</em> flow will compare them to hashes already in the database to identify which song is playing through the <strong>matching</strong> step.</p>
<p>In the next few sections, you'll learn more about each of these steps.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-a-spectrogram">Calculating a spectrogram</h2>
<p>The first step for both flows is to obtain a spectrogram of the audio being registered or recognised. To understand spectrograms, you first have to understand Fourier transforms.</p>
<h3 id="the-fourier-transform">The Fourier transform</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://realpython.com/python-scipy-fft/">Fourier transform</a> takes some audio and tells you which frequencies are present in that audio. For example, if you took a 20 Hertz sine wave and used the Fourier transform on it, you would see a big spike around 20 Hertz (Hz):</p>
<p><img alt="20Hz sine wave and its Fourier transform" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/fouriertransform20hz.png"></p>
<p>In the above image, you can see a large spike around 20Hz and nothing at other frequencies. Sine waves are often called <strong>pure tones</strong> because of this property, since they only contain a single frequency.</p>
<p>The result of a Fourier transform is called a <strong>frequency spectrum</strong>. We say that when you take the Fourier transform of a signal, you move it from the <strong>time domain</strong> into the <strong>frequency domain</strong>. These are fancy terms for describing whether time or frequency is along the bottom of a graph. In mathematical terms, the domain is more or less the X-axis of a graph.</p>
<p>The Y-axis of the frequency spectrum represents the strength of each frequency component. If a frequency component is stronger, then it will be more audible in the time-domain signal.</p>
<p>If you were to add a 50Hz sine wave at half the strength to that 20Hz sine wave, the resulting frequency spectrum would show a spike at 20Hz and a smaller spike at 50Hz:</p>
<p><img alt="20Hz sine wave plus 50Hz sine wave and its Fourier transform" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/fouriertransform20plus50.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, adding multiple audio waves together combines the frequencies present in them. In fact, all audio signals can be reconstructed from waves like this. For more, take a look at 3Blue1Brown's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY">video on the Fourier transform</a>.</p>
<p>One great property of the frequency domain is that it often helps us to see things that aren't clear in the time domain. For example, if you take the signal with two frequencies from before and add noise to it, in the time domain it looks visually very different. However, in the frequency domain, the two spikes are still very clear:</p>
<p><img alt="Fourier transform of a noisy signal" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/noisyfouriertransform.png"></p>
<p>In the frequency domain graph on the right, you can still clearly see the spikes for the main component frequencies. It would be harder in the time domain to see what frequency sine waves went into the signal.</p>
<p>Up until now, our examples have only contained one or two frequencies, but what happens if you put a more complex signal through the Fourier transform? Let's take a look at our section of audio from Like a Stone:</p>
<p><img alt="Fourier transform of a Like a Stone sample" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/fouriertransformsample.png"></p>
<p>Real audio files like the one above contain lots of different frequencies. This is a good thing, as it means that the frequencies present can uniquely identify songs.</p>
<h3 id="spectrograms">Spectrograms</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra/blob/e0eb59a944d7c9999ff8a4bc53f5cfdeb07b39aa/abracadabra/fingerprint.py#L9">abracadabra implementation</a></p>
<p>If you run a Fourier transform over an entire song, then you will see the strength of the frequencies present over the whole song. However, the frequencies that are present change over time. To better represent the frequencies changing over time, we need to split the song into small sections before taking the Fourier transform. This is called taking a spectrogram.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified animation of how spectrograms work:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/spectrogram.mp4">Explanation of the spectrogram process</video>

<p>In the above animation, you can see that the song is first split into small sections. Next, we use the Fourier transform to calculate the frequency spectrum of each of these sections. When you put all these frequency spectrums together, you get a spectrogram.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, let's take a look at the spectrogram of Like a Stone:</p>
<p><img alt="Spectrogram of Like a Stone" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/spectrogram.png"></p>
<p>Even though the spectrogram looks 2-dimensional, it's actually a 3D graph with the following axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time (X-axis)</li>
<li>Frequency (Y-axis)</li>
<li>Strength (Z-axis/colour)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Z-axis is represented by colour in the spectrogram above. Bright green shows a high magnitude for a particular frequency component and dark blue shows a low magnitude.</p>
<p>Looking at the spectrogram above, you can see that the brightest spots (strongest frequencies) almost exclusively occur below 5000Hz. This is quite common with music, for example most pianos have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies">frequency range</a> of 27Hz-4186Hz.</p>
<p>The frequencies present in a track contain a lot of identifying information, and calculating the spectrogram allows us access to that information. In the next section, you'll learn how we turn all that information into a unique fingerprint for the track.</p>
<h2 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h2>
<p>Just as a fingerprint uniquely identifies a person, we can extract a unique fingerprint for some audio from its spectrogram.</p>
<p>These audio fingerprints rely on finding peaks in the spectrogram. These peaks are the loudest frequencies at some time in the song. Because they are loud, it's likely they'll survive when subjected to noise or other distortions.</p>
<p>In the next section, you'll read some more about the motivation behind using spectrogram peaks to build fingerprints.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-fingerprint-based-on-spectrogram-peaks">Why is the fingerprint based on spectrogram peaks?</h3>
<p>A spectrogram peak is a frequency that is loud at some point in an audio signal. You can recognise these on a spectrogram since they will be the brightest points.</p>
<p>In music, these would represent the loudest notes. For example, during a guitar solo, the notes that the guitar is playing might become spectrogram peaks since they would likely be the loudest notes at that time.</p>
<p>A spectrogram peak is the point least likely to be affected by noise. Noise has to be louder than the spectrogram peak to make it unrecognisable and the spectrogram peaks are the loudest frequency components in the track.</p>
<p>To make this visual, take a look at our earlier example of a Fourier transformed signal that had noise added to it. When noise is added, the frequency peaks still retain their rough shape.</p>
<p><img alt="Fourier transform of a noisy signal" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/noisyfouriertransform.png"></p>
<p>Another advantage of using spectrogram peaks to fingerprint audio is that they cut down the amount of data we have to store. Storing only the loudest frequency components means we don't have to store everything else. This speeds up searching fingerprints since there is less data to look through.</p>
<p>Before we can use frequency peaks in our fingerprint though, we have to find them. In the next section, you'll learn how.</p>
<h3 id="finding-peaks">Finding peaks</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra/blob/e0eb59a944d7c9999ff8a4bc53f5cfdeb07b39aa/abracadabra/fingerprint.py#L31">abracadabra implementation</a></p>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, the peaks of a spectrogram represent the strongest frequencies in a signal. For frequency peaks to be usable in an audio fingerprint, it's important that they are evenly spaced through the spectrogram.</p>
<p>It's important the peaks are evenly spaced in <strong>time</strong>, so the system can recognise any section of the song. For example, if all the peaks were at the start of the song, then the fingerprint wouldn't cover later sections:</p>
<p><img alt="Peaks clustered in time" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/peak_cluster_time.png"></p>
<p>In the image above, all the peaks (white crosses) are clustered at the start of the song. This means that the system can't recognise any sample from the rest of the song.</p>
<p>It's also important that the peaks are evenly spaced in <strong>frequency</strong>, so the system can deal with noise and frequency distortion. Sometimes noise will be very loud and concentrated at a specific frequency range, for example a car horn in the background:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/peak_cluster_freq.mp4">Peaks clustered in a frequency band affected by noise</video>

<p>In the above animation, the peaks are well-spaced in time, but are clustered into a small frequency band. When a loud noise is introduced, for example a car horn, it can make an entire section of song unrecognisable by changing which peaks are selected.</p>
<p>To find spectrogram peaks while keeping them well-spaced, we can borrow a technique from image processing known as a maximum filter. The process looks something like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the maximum filter to highlight peaks in the spectrogram.</li>
<li>Locate the highlighted peaks by comparing to our original spectrogram.</li>
<li>(Optional) Discard some peaks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's run through these steps one-by-one. First, let's take a look at how the maximum filter works:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Maximum filter</strong></p>
<p>A maximum filter emphasises the peaks in an image. It does this by looking in a neighbourhood around each pixel for the maximum value and then setting the pixel to that local maximum. The following animation shows a maximum filter that looks at a 3x3 neighbourhood around each pixel:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/maximumfilter.mp4">Animation of a maximum filter on a simple image</video>

<p>As you can see in the above animation, the maximum filter takes each pixel of an image in turn and finds the maximum in a region surrounding it. The filtered pixel is then set to that local maximum. This has the effect of expanding each local peak to its surrounding area.</p>
<p>Running a maximum filter on Like a Stone's spectrogram gives the following result:</p>
<p><img alt="Spectrogram and maximum-filtered spectrogram of Like a Stone" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/maxfilteredspectrogram.png"></p>
<p>The maximum-filtered spectrogram looks like a lower-resolution version of the original spectrogram. This is because the peaks in the signal have expanded and taken over the other pixels. Each box with the same colour in the filtered image corresponds to a local peak in the original image.</p>
<p>The maximum filter has a parameter that controls the size of the box to use when finding the local maxima. When you set this parameter to make a smaller box, you end up getting more peaks. Similarly, by setting this parameter larger you get fewer peaks.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Recover original peaks</strong></p>
<p>The maximum filter doesn't do all the work for us. The filter has emphasised the local peaks, but it hasn't found their locations. To find the peak locations, we need to find the points that have equal values in the original spectrogram and the filtered spectrogram.</p>
<p>The idea behind this trick is that all the non-peak points in the spectrogram have been replaced by their local peaks, so their values have changed. The only points whose values haven't changed are the peaks.</p>
<p>Below is a zoomed in section of the spectrogram above. The points where the values are equal in the filtered and original spectrograms are highlighted:</p>
<p><img alt="Zoomed section of spectrogram showing equal values in the maximum-filtered and original spectrograms" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/zoomed_spectrogram.png"></p>
<p>As you can see in the images above, the highlighted points where the two spectrograms are equal correspond to the local peaks of that part of the image.</p>
<p>Plotting all of the peaks together produces something called a <strong>constellation map</strong>. Here's the constellation map for Like a Stone:</p>
<p><img alt="Constellation map of Like a Stone" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/constellationmap.png"></p>
<p>These graphs are called constellation maps since they look a bit like an image of the night sky. Who said computer science couldn't be romantic?</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: (Optional) Discard peaks</strong></p>
<p>Once we have a constellation map of peaks, the next step is to potentially discard some. The size of our fingerprint is dependent on the number of peaks that we use in it. Keeping fingerprints small matters when you are storing millions of songs in your database.</p>
<p>However, by reducing the number of peaks we use, we reduce the accuracy of our system. Fewer peaks in a fingerprint mean fewer chances to match a sample to the correct song.</p>
<p>There are a couple of options for reducing the number of peaks in our fingerprint:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the top N peaks. N should be proportional to the length of audio that you are fingerprinting to avoid over-representing shorter songs.</li>
<li>Take all peaks above a certain threshold. This doesn't guarantee you a certain fingerprint size per time like the other method, but may give more accurate results.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>We have almost finished constructing our fingerprint, the next step is to produce a set of hashes from our peaks.</p>
<h3 id="hashing">Hashing</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra/blob/e0eb59a944d7c9999ff8a4bc53f5cfdeb07b39aa/abracadabra/fingerprint.py#L96">abracadabra implementation</a></p>
<p>To motivate hashing, imagine that our fingerprint was just a collection of spectrogram peaks. Each peak's frequency would be represented by a certain number of bits, for example 10. With 10 bits of information, we can represent 2^10=1024 individual frequencies. With thousands of these points per track, we quickly get a lot of repeats.</p>
<p>Uniqueness is important for a fingerprint, since it makes searching a lot faster and helps to recognise more songs. Shazam's solution to the problem of uniqueness is to create hashes from pairs of peaks:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of two spectrogram peaks forming a hash" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/hash_diagram.png"></p>
<p>The diagram above shows a zoomed in portion of a spectrogram. Each circle represents a peak and the dashed line box represents a hash. You can see that a hash is formed of two peaks. The information that is recorded for each hash is the frequency of each peak, f<sub>A</sub> and f<sub>B</sub>, and the time delta between them, 𝚫T.</p>
<p>The advantage of pairing points up is that two paired points are much more unique than a single point. Looking at it mathematically, if each point has 10 bits of frequency information, and the time delta between the two points could be represented by 10 bits, then you have 30 bits of information. 2^30=1073741824 which is <strong>significantly</strong> larger than 1024 possibilities for a single point.</p>
<p>Shazam creates pairs using the following algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a point. This will be called the anchor point.</li>
<li>Calculate a target zone of the spectrogram for the anchor point.</li>
<li>For every point in the target zone, create a pair with the anchor point.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see this algorithm illustrated in the following animation:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/pairing.mp4">Animation of pairing points</video>

<p>Choosing a target zone isn't described in the Shazam paper, but the images the paper contains show it as starting slightly ahead of time of the anchor point and being centred on the anchor point's frequency.</p>
<p>Once a pair has been created, it is stored as a hash in the database with the following information:</p>

    <td>Point A freq (f<sub>A</sub>)

  </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The first three columns (f<sub>A</sub>, f<sub>B</sub> and 𝚫T) make up the hash. The "Other information" is used to locate the hash at a specific time in a song. This will be used in matching later.</p>
<p>All of the hashes for a particular track make up the fingerprint. In the next section, you'll read about how Shazam matches these fingerprints.</p>
<h2 id="matching">Matching</h2>
<p>Given a collection of fingerprints in a database, how does Shazam figure out which one a given audio sample matches? This is where the matching part of the system comes in. Recall the system diagram from earlier:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram showing high-level overview of Shazam design" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/shazam_overview.png"></p>
<p>The recognise and register flows both generate fingerprints. The difference lies in what they do with them. While the register flow stores fingerprints away for future matching, the recognise flow has to match its fingerprint with what is already in the database.</p>
<p>The matching algorithm contains the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retrieve all hashes from the database that match the sample's fingerprint.</li>
<li>Group these hashes by song.</li>
<li>For each song, figure out if the hashes line up.</li>
<li>Choose the track with the most lined up hashes.</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll look at each of these steps in turn.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Retrieve matching hashes</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra/blob/e0eb59a944d7c9999ff8a4bc53f5cfdeb07b39aa/abracadabra/storage.py#L75">abracadabra implementation</a></p>
<p>The first step is to find every hash in the database that matches a hash in the fingerprint we just created. Even though a hash is a 3-tuple of <em>(f<sub>A</sub>, f<sub>B</sub>, 𝚫T)</em>, abracadabra stores this as <em>hash(f<sub>A</sub>, f<sub>B</sub>, 𝚫T)</em> where <code>hash()</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash function</a> that returns a single value. This way you only have to search for a single value per hash instead of three.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Group hashes by song</strong></p>
<p>Recall the format of an individual hash in the database:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
      <th colspan="2">Other information</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>Point A freq (f<sub>A</sub>)
    </td><td>Point B freq (f<sub>B</sub>)
    </td><td>Time delta (𝚫T)
    </td><td>Point A time
    </td><td>Track ID
  </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Thanks to the track ID that we associated with each hash, we can group the hashes by track. This allows us to score each potentially matching track.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Figure out if hashes line up</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra/blob/e0eb59a944d7c9999ff8a4bc53f5cfdeb07b39aa/abracadabra/recognise.py#L80">abracadabra implementation</a></p>
<p>If a sample matches a song, then the hashes present in that sample should line up nicely with the hashes in some section of that song. The diagram below illustrates what this would look like:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of sample hashes lining up to song hashes" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/lineduphashes.png"></p>
<p>In the above diagram, a sample has been lined up with the section of the original song that it came from. The blue points represent the anchor points of the hashes.</p>
<p>While the above diagram shows the perfect scenario, there is a chance that the matching hashes from the database don't line up perfectly. For example, noise could have introduced peaks in the sample that resemble peaks at a different point in the song. This can lead to the following scenario:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of sample hashes imperfectly lining up with song hashes" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/badlylineduphashes.png"></p>
<p>In the above diagram, the red circles represent hashes that match to points in the song outside the section the sample came from. In this situation, it's harder to see that the sample is a perfect match for the song.</p>
<p>What's worse, sometimes hashes can match to the wrong song! This is where checking that the hashes line up comes in.</p>
<p>To explain how we can check whether the hashes line up in code, let's look at an example. Let's imagine that we've got a list of matching hashes from the database and grouped them by track. For a given track, we can then check the time that the hash occurs in the original track against the time that the hash occurs in the sample.</p>

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Sample time</th>
    <th>Track time</th>
    <th>Track time - Sample time</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td><b>10</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td><b>10</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>13</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td><b>10</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td><b>10</b></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In the above table, you can see that all the matches with a <em>Track time - Sample time</em> of 10 have been highlighted. These are the true matches, while the other two rows are false matches. To see this is the case, let's look at a similar diagram to the ones we saw before:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of sample hashes lining up to song hashes annotated with times" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/lineduphashes2.png"></p>
<p>The above diagram contains the same hashes from the previous table. As you can see, the true matches have a <em>Track time - Sample time</em> that is equal to how far into the track time that the sample starts.</p>
<p>To see how we turn this into a score for the track, let's make this data into a histogram. A histogram is a fancy name for a bar chart. We're going to plot each <em>Track time - Sample time</em> against the number of times it occurs:</p>
<p><img alt="Histogram showing frequency of 'Track time - Sample time'" src="https://www.cameronmacleod.com/images/abracadabra/sample_histogram.png"></p>
<p>Each bar in the histogram above is referred to as a <strong>bin</strong>. To score a song on how good a match it is for an audio sample, we just need to take the largest bin. Songs that aren't good matches will have low values in all bins, whereas a song that's a good match will have a large spike in one of the bins.</p>
<p>This way we can compare a sample to all the songs with matching hashes in our database and score each of them. The song with the highest score is likely to be the correct result.</p>
<p>You might wonder why we don't just go for the song that matches the largest number of hashes as it would be much simpler to implement. The problem with this approach is that not all songs are the same length. Longer songs are likely to get more matches than shorter songs and when some Spotify tracks are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/9i2ps6/longest_song_on_spotify/">over 4 hours long</a> this can really bias your results!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well done for making it this far, that was a long journey! Over the course of this article, you've learned how Shazam extracts fingerprints from audio, and how it matches these fingerprints to those that it has already registered in its database.</p>
<p>To summarise, Shazam does the following to <strong>register</strong> a song:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculates a <strong>spectrogram</strong> of a song</li>
<li>Extracts <strong>peaks</strong> from that spectrogram</li>
<li>Pairs those peaks up into <strong>hashes</strong></li>
<li>Stores the collection of hashes for a song as a <strong>fingerprint</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Shazam does the following to <strong>recognise</strong> an audio sample:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculates a <strong>fingerprint</strong> of the audio sample</li>
<li>Finds the <strong>hashes</strong> that match that fingerprint in the database</li>
<li>For each potential song match:<ul>
<li>Calculate <strong>Track time - Sample time</strong> for each matching hash</li>
<li>Group those values into a <strong>histogram</strong></li>
<li>Take the largest bin in this histogram as the <strong>score</strong> for the song</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return the song with the highest score</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="postArticle"><p><strong>Note</strong>: This post was the subject of a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38531104" rel="noopener">Hacker News thread</a>.</p><p>A somewhat obscure guideline for developers of U.S. government websites may be about to accelerate the long, sad decline of Mozilla’s Firefox browser. There already are plenty of large entities, both public and private, whose websites lack proper support for Firefox; and that will get only worse in the near future, because the ’fox’s auburn paws are perilously close to the lip of the proverbial slippery slope.</p><p>The <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/" rel="noopener">U.S. Web Design System</a> (USWDS) provides a comprehensive set of standards which guide those who build the U.S. government’s many websites. Its <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/developers/" rel="noopener">documentation for developers</a> borrows a “2% rule” from its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service" rel="noopener">British counterpart</a>:</p><blockquote><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we officially support any browser above 2% usage as observed by <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" rel="noopener">analytics.usa.gov</a>.</p></blockquote><p>At this writing, that analytics page shows the following browser traffic for the previous ninety days:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>Share</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome</td><td>49%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari</td><td>34.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Edge</td><td>8.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox</td><td>2.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari (in-app)</td><td>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Samsung Internet</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Android Webview</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>1%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I am personally unaware of any serious reason to believe that Firefox’s numbers will improve soon. Indeed, for the web as a whole, they’ve been declining consistently for years, as this chart shows:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_600,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_320,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_640,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_960,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_1280,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_1600,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_1920,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 1920w" alt="Chart of browser share for January, 2009, through November, 2023" title="Chart of browser share for January, 2009, through November, 2023" width="2318" height="1158" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 100vw, 50vw" data-pagefind-ignore=""></p><p>Chrome <em>vs.</em> Firefox <em>vs.</em> Safari for January,&nbsp;2009, through November,&nbsp;2023.<br>Image: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/" rel="noopener">StatCounter</a>.</p><p>Firefox peaked at 31.82% in November, 2009 — and then began its long slide in almost direct proportion to the rise of Chrome. The latter shot from 1.37% use in January, 2009, to its own peak of 66.34% in September, 2020, since falling back to a “measly” 62.85% in the very latest data.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>While these numbers reflect worldwide trends, the U.S.-specific picture isn’t really better. In fact, because the iPhone is so popular in the U.S. — which is obvious from what you see on that aforementioned government analytics page — Safari pulls large numbers that also hurt Firefox.</p><p>In my days in tech marketing, we used to worry about how a dominant competitor would take “shelf space” in those large stores where we wanted visibility for our goods and their accompanying point-of-purchase brochures. (Remember point-of-purchase literature, fellow oldsters?) Well, Firefox is quickly losing “web space,” thanks to a perfect storm that’s been kicked up by the dominance of Chrome, the popularity of mobile devices that run Safari by default, and many corporate and government IT shops’ insistence that their users rely on only Microsoft’s Chromium-based Edge browser while toiling away each day.</p><p>With such a continuing free-fall, Firefox is inevitably nearing the point where USWDS will remove it, like Internet Explorer before it, from the list of supported browsers.</p><p>“So what?” you may wonder. “That’s just for web developers in the U.S. government. It doesn’t affect any other web devs.”</p><p>Actually, it very well could. Here’s how I envision the dominoes falling:</p><ol><li>Once Firefox slips below the 2% threshold in the government’s visitor analytics, USWDS tells government web devs they don’t have to support Firefox anymore.</li><li>When that word gets out, it spreads quickly to not only the front-end dev community but also the corporate IT departments for whom some web devs work. Many corporations do a lot of business with the government and, thus, whatever the government does from an IT standpoint is going to influence what corporations do.</li><li>Corporations see this change as an opportunity to lower dev costs and delivery times, in that it provides an excuse to remove <em>some</em> testing (and, in rare cases, specific coding) from their development workflow.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li></ol><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and just like that, in less time than you might think, Firefox — the free/open-source browser that was supposed to save the world from the jackboots of Internet Explorer (which had killed Firefox’s ancestor, Netscape Navigator) — is reduced to permanent status as a shrinking part of the fractured miscellany that litters the bottom of browser market-share charts.</p><p>I surely hope I’m wrong about this, but I fear I’m not.</p><hr><p>Nearly five years ago, as the news broke that Microsoft had decided to move its Edge browser to the Blink engine that also powers Google Chrome, I <a href="https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2018/12/on-edge/">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Supporting multiple browser engines — even if there is a Really Big Dog engine among them that’s about to get even bigger — ain’t always fun, but it goes with the territory; and I firmly believe it will continue to do so, especially for sites that are commercial in nature.</p></blockquote><p>That firm belief remains unchanged, but the meaning of the “multiple browser engines” part is in serious danger of significant change.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div><p>
            We introduce a novel sequential modeling approach which enables learning a Large Vision Model (<b>LVM</b>) without making use of any linguistic data. <br>
            To do this, we define a common format, "visual sentences", in which we can represent raw images and videos as well as annotated data sources such as semantic segmentations and depth reconstructions without needing any meta-knowledge beyond the pixels.<br>
            Once this wide variety of visual data (420 billion tokens) is represented as sequences, the model can be trained to minimize cross-entropy loss for next token prediction. <br>
            By training across various scales of model architecture and data diversity, we provide empirical evidence that our models scale effectively. 
            Many different vision tasks can be solved by designing suitable prompts at test time.</p></div>

		<p>Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.</p>
<p>Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what we’re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used. What was manual and individual has become bulk and mass. Surveillance has <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/surveillance_as_1.html">become the business model</a> of the internet, and there’s no reasonable way for us to opt out of it.</p>
<p>Spying is another matter. It has long been possible to tap someone’s phone or put a bug in their home and/or car, but those things still require someone to listen to and make sense of the conversations. Yes, spyware companies like <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group">NSO Group</a> help the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/03/us-state-department-officials-iphones-hacked-nso-group-spyware">hack into people’s phones</a>, but <em>someone</em> still has to sort through all the conversations. And governments like China could <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/18/1054452/china-censors-social-media-comments/">censor social media posts</a> based on particular words or phrases, but that was coarse and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/08/1141335778/china-zero-covid-lockdown-protests-online-xi-jinping-censorship">easy to bypass</a>. Spying is limited by the need for human labor.</p>
<p>AI is about to change that. <a href="https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/best-ai-summarizers">Summarization is something</a> a modern generative AI system does well. Give it an hourlong meeting, and it will return a one-page summary of what was said. Ask it to search through millions of conversations and organize them by topic, and it’ll do that. Want to know who is talking about what? It’ll tell you.</p>
<p>The technologies aren’t perfect; some of them are pretty primitive. They miss things that are important. They get other things wrong. But so do humans. And, unlike humans, AI tools can be replicated by the millions and are improving at astonishing rates. They’ll get better next year, and even better the year after that. We are about to enter the era of mass spying.</p>
<p>Mass surveillance fundamentally changed the nature of surveillance. Because all the data is saved, mass surveillance allows people to conduct surveillance backward in time, and without even knowing whom specifically you want to target. Tell me where <em>this</em> person was last year. List all the red sedans that drove down <em>this</em> road in the past month. List all of the people who purchased all the ingredients for a pressure cooker bomb in the past year. Find me all the pairs of phones that were moving toward each other, turned themselves off, then turned themselves on again an hour later while moving away from each other (a sign of a secret meeting).</p>
<p>Similarly, mass spying will change the nature of spying. All the data will be saved. It will all be searchable, and understandable, in bulk. Tell me who has talked about a particular topic in the past month, and how discussions about that topic have evolved. Person A did something; check if someone told them to do it. Find everyone who is plotting a crime, or spreading a rumor, or planning to attend a political protest.</p>
<p>There’s so much more. To uncover an organizational structure, look for someone who gives similar instructions to a group of people, then all the people they have relayed those instructions to. To find people’s confidants, look at whom they tell secrets to. You can track friendships and alliances as they form and break, in minute detail. In short, you can know everything about what everybody is talking about.</p>
<p>This spying is not limited to conversations on our phones or computers. Just as cameras everywhere fueled mass surveillance, microphones everywhere will fuel mass spying. Siri and Alexa and “Hey Google” are already always listening; the conversations just aren’t being saved yet.</p>
<p>Knowing that they are under constant surveillance changes how people behave. They conform. They self-censor, with the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/07/jon-penney-on-the-chilling-effects-of-online-surveillance/">chilling effects that brings</a>. Surveillance facilitates social control, and spying will only make this worse. Governments around the world already use mass surveillance; they will engage in mass spying as well.</p>
<p>Corporations will spy on people. Mass surveillance ushered in the era of personalized advertisements; mass spying will supercharge that industry. Information about what people are talking about, their moods, their secrets—it’s all catnip for marketers looking for an edge. The tech monopolies that are currently keeping us all under constant surveillance won’t be able to resist collecting and using all of that data.</p>
<p>In the early days of Gmail, Google talked about using people’s Gmail content to serve them personalized ads. The company <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10434152">stopped doing it</a>, almost certainly because the keyword data it collected was so poor—and therefore not useful for marketing purposes. That will soon change. Maybe Google won’t be the first to spy on its users’ conversations, but once others start, they won’t be able to resist. Their true customers—their advertisers—will demand it.</p>
<p>We could limit this capability. We could prohibit mass spying. We could pass strong data-privacy rules. But we haven’t done anything to limit mass surveillance. Why would spying be any different?</p>

  <p data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu8mj000h3b6y4aztufgs@published">Corporations will spy on people. Mass surveillance ushered in the era of personalized advertisements; mass spying will supercharge that industry. Information about what people are talking about, their moods, their secrets—it’s all catnip for marketers looking for an edge. The tech monopolies that are currently keeping us all under constant surveillance won’t be able to resist collecting and using all of that data.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu8on000i3b6yxh1wzj1a@published">In the early days of Gmail, Google talked about using people’s Gmail content to serve them personalized ads. The company <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10434152">stopped doing it</a>, almost certainly because the keyword data it collected was so poor—and therefore not useful for marketing purposes. That will soon change. Maybe Google won’t be the first to spy on its users’ conversations, but once others start, they won’t be able to resist. Their true customers—their advertisers—will demand it.</p>

  <p data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu8ql000j3b6ydlp19w6p@published">We could limit this capability. We could prohibit mass spying. We could pass strong data-privacy rules. But we haven’t done anything to limit mass surveillance. Why would spying be any <span>different?</span></p>

<section><p>Wikipedia is one of the most successful collaborative projects in history. It is the largest encyclopedia ever created, with millions of users worldwide relying on it as the first source of information as well as for fact-checking and in-depth research. As Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of its volunteer editors, its success might be particularly affected by toxic speech. In this paper, we analyze all 57 million comments made on user talk pages of 8.5 million editors across the six most active language editions of Wikipedia to study the potential impact of toxicity on editors’ behavior. We find that toxic comments are consistently associated with reduced activity of editors, equivalent to 0.5–2 active days per user in the short term. This translates to multiple human-years of lost productivity, considering the number of active contributors to Wikipedia. The effects of toxic comments are potentially even greater in the long term, as they are associated with a significantly increased risk of editors leaving the project altogether. Using an agent-based model, we demonstrate that toxicity attacks on Wikipedia have the potential to impede the progress of the entire project. Our results underscore the importance of mitigating toxic speech on collaborative platforms such as Wikipedia to ensure their continued success.</p></section>

In this study, we focus on Wikipedia, which as the largest and most-read online reference, serves as a vital source of knowledge for millions of users worldwide. By analyzing all comments made over 20 years on user talk pages of 8.5 million editors across multiple language editions, we demonstrate that toxic speech is associated with a significant loss in the productivity of Wikipedia editors. These findings may have broad implications for large-scale collaborative projects and online communities, emphasizing the need to promote healthy and sustainable communication practices to protect crucial online information ecosystems and ensure their long-term success.</p></div>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="428493697" id="428493697" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s0">Introduction</h2>
<p>Wikipedia is arguably one of the most successful collaborative projects in history. It has become the largest and most-read reference work ever created, and it is currently the fifth most popular website on the Internet (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B1"></span>1). Millions of users worldwide rely on Wikipedia as their first source of information when encountering a new topic, for fact-checking and in-depth research (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B2"></span>2). Even if caution might be required when consulting less actively maintained pages (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B3"></span>3), numerous studies have shown that Wikipedia is a reliable source of information in areas ranging from political science (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B4"></span>4) to pharmacology (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B5"></span>5) and its accuracy is comparable to traditional encyclopedias (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B6"></span>6) and textbooks (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B7"></span>7).</p><p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Wikipedia’s success is that its content is exclusively created and curated by volunteer editors, known as Wikipedians. The English edition alone has more than 120,000 active editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B8"></span>8). However, this volunteer-driven model also makes Wikipedia susceptible to the inherent challenges associated with maintaining such a large online community (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B9"></span>9, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B10"></span>10). For example, it has been previously observed that Wikipedia is not free of conflict, particularly in the form of so-called edit wars (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B11"></span>11), which impose significant costs on the project (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B12"></span>12) and could negatively affect the quality of Wikipedia articles (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B13"></span>13).</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the impact of toxic comments directed toward editors on their activity. This aspect is less studied, but potentially not less important, as affected by toxic comments, Wikipedians might reduce their contributions or abandon the project altogether, threatening the success of the platform (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B14"></span>14).</p><p>Toxicity has been extensively studied on popular social media websites such as Twitter (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B15"></span>15, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B16"></span>16), Reddit (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B17"></span>17, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B18"></span>18), and similar platforms (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B19"></span>19, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B20"></span>20). However, much of these research focuses on automated toxicity detection and prevalence estimation rather than on evaluating its impact (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B21"></span>21). As an online encyclopedia, Wikipedia is often perceived as immune to toxicity and has a strict “No personal attacks” policy (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B22"></span>22). Despite that, toxic speech and harassment have been previously observed on the platform (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B23 pgad385-B24 pgad385-B25 pgad385-B26 pgad385-B27"></span>23–27). The effects of such behaviors on editors’ contributions are, however, not well understood nor well studied. The largest study to date relies on a voluntary opt-in survey of the 3,845 Wikipedians conducted in 2015 (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B24"></span>24). It reports that 20% of users witnessing harassment have stopped contributing for a while, 17% considered not contributing anymore and 5% stopped contributing at all.</p><p>In this paper, we analyzed all 57 million comments made on user talk pages of editors on the six most active language editions of Wikipedia (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian) to understand the potential impact of toxic speech on editors’ contributions (see Methods and materials section for our definition of toxic comments). User talk pages are a place for editors to communicate with each other either on more personal topics or to extend their discussion from an article’s talk page. The majority of toxic comments are left on user talk pages (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B28"></span>28). The comments we study were extracted from revision histories of talk pages and, thus, include even those toxic comments that were later archived or deleted by the page owner.</p><p>Figure <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F1"></span>1 shows the activity of 50 randomly selected users who have received exactly one toxic comment. While some users are seemingly unaffected by a toxic comment, others temporarily reduce their activity or leave the project completely. The aim of our paper is to quantify this effect on the entire population of editors.</p>                    <div data-id="pgad385-f1" data-content-id="pgad385-f1" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Fig. 1.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pnasnexus/2/12/10.1093_pnasnexus_pgad385/2/m_pgad385f1.jpeg?Expires=1704812577&amp;Signature=3wGUQJ8DyvquCBx9e7Y8Cc9YcI0LKvEnIvRC8JYEYgXeHDTpaqgRpnXJ9aRSSWvb22wpodBQk~tPYx2QZyyu58-SHeOhfGmks9J-tJMDD47NkKNeKBirIBFe1nayVcgeZ-hdyXfVYCIKu-rXbftCEa16mAFH9SLXx26c0z8n6SLLxaBq17T5L-t9RnWNEbvdJGs7kXZyBRTh3p6bEcYuSb9LR8vAPGwH2uRKWJ54iaRvKGENtaH96S0Mp3vINAGtMeoURz4JAzEp7MPkqwb3xNsKmvFFpb65HOanpde2xFkyyyGmWtP0fFDAX6p4uIEJZNsJpEhjYmvuAp8LXgHThQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="After receiving a toxic comment many users temporarily reduce their activity or leave the project completely.

Note that while some users are resilient and their activity is seemingly unaffected by toxic comments, many users temporarily reduce their activity or stop contributing altogether.</p></div><p>We estimate the number of lost active days associated with a toxic comment by comparing the number of active days before and after receiving a toxic comment. To account for potential baseline change, we have matched editors that received a toxic comment with similarly active editors who received a nontoxic comment. We have separately studied if toxic comments increase the probability of editors leaving the project altogether. Finally, we have used an agent-based model to model the potential impact of an increased number of toxic comments on Wikipedia.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="428493706" id="428493706" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s1">Results</h2>

<p>To estimate the potential effect of a toxic comment, we compute the proportion of users who were active on day X before or after receiving a toxic comment (Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2). We find that, on average, editors are more active near the time when they receive a toxic comment, with a peak at 24 h prior to the comment. At this time point, more than <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn xmlns="">40</mn><mi mathvariant="normal" xmlns="">%</mi></math></span> of editors were active, as shown by the red line in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2a. This is a rather unsurprising observation since toxic comments are often made as a reaction to an edit made by a user and, thus, users are expected to be active around the time of a toxic comment. Note that if the timestamps around which the curve is centered are shuffled (black line in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2a) then this pattern disappears completely as expected.</p>                    <div data-id="pgad385-f2" data-content-id="pgad385-f2" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Fig. 2.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pnasnexus/2/12/10.1093_pnasnexus_pgad385/2/m_pgad385f2.jpeg?Expires=1704812577&amp;Signature=2fNieTHaIPTku2t6mpRvxIbQH7FsdxmzgpSc618hfT0gf4r9vSqljIraCoA4v8xy4wBRYtr1Rdk0rI1xC8ByOV7fDkpEP4M74b8zfTxX7kXYa~0RYqP2mi2gPDmGAr4-tIorIRb1NQALk~ijD0x304rrpjxpSxaNm3Ebscl3ejhdAvP756KrKhDZLYrprNgLfH3Zn7~KGqbrOVPnjTCAIdhqvlcHMcvnmCUNWDwAnp4fbwcH-DGhF3kGXGUE2nfaCpPLCaaBAZI1~G-bWJaDOsCi7FBAX6CHLiJ6gEQ5qWoE~pVVXbGR1XuT4DQ9SG9dNEEoiOURQex9fMl8aFWGEA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="After receiving a toxic comment, users become less active.

On average, users are more active near the time when they receive a toxic comment (peak at zero for the red line in panel a).

To rule out the possibility that this is due to a general drop in activity over time or a drop in activity after any comment, we select a control group of users who have received a nontoxic comment, and whose average activity in the 100 days before the comment is the same as the average activity of users who received a toxic comment (see Methods and materials section for details).</p><p>We observe a similar characteristic peak around the nontoxic comment, likely due to both toxic and nontoxic comments being reactions to a contribution made by an editor. However, in contrast to a toxic comment, a nontoxic comment does not lead to a significant decrease in activity (dashed and solid blue lines in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2b). Similar results hold for all six language editions that we have examined (Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2c–g).</p><p>We then estimate the lost activity associated with a toxic comment by computing the decrease in activity after a toxic comment, taking into account a potential baseline drop, i.e. by computing <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi mathvariant="normal" xmlns="">Δ</mi><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><msub xmlns=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">After</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">toxic</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">−</mo><msub xmlns=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Before</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">toxic</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo><mo xmlns="">−</mo><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><msub xmlns=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">After</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">nontoxic</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">−</mo><msub xmlns=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Before</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">nontoxic</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo></math>⁠</span>.

<p>As has been demonstrated above, toxic comments increase the likelihood of editors abandoning Wikipedia. If enough editors leave, this could potentially impede the progress of the project as a whole. In order to estimate the potential impact of toxic comments, we model users’ behaviors by varying the toxicity of the environment, ranging from a nontoxic environment, where the probability of a user leaving follows the empirically observed nontoxic probability distribution, <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">non</mi></mrow></mrow></msubsup></math></span> (blue dots in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F3"></span>3), to a highly toxic environment, where the probability of leaving corresponds to an empirically observed toxic probability distribution, <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">tox</mi></mrow></mrow></msubsup></math></span> (red dots in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F3"></span>3). We also consider a potential attack targeted at new users. In this scenario, each user receives a toxic comment after their first and second contributions, e.g. their probability of leaving after the first and second contribution is defined by <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">tox</mi></mrow></mrow></msubsup></math>⁠</span>, and after that follows the empirically observed <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi></msub></math>⁠</span>.</p><p>For our modeling, we focus on a cohort of users who made their first contribution between the 4,000th and 6,000th day from the first recorded contribution to English Wikipedia in our dataset. We opted for this timeframe as it reflects Wikipedia’s current phase characterized by a relatively consistent number of active editors. This period follows the site’s initial exponential growth and a subsequent decline but comes before the anomalous increase in activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see Discussion section for details on these stages).</p><p>For our modeling, we employed an agent-based approach. Each day, agents (representing users) join Wikipedia and make their first contribution. The number of agents joining each day is equal to the actual count of first-time contributors to English Wikipedia on that particular day. After their first contribution, agents keep contributing, following a Poisson process, i.e. in such a way that the distance between two consecutive contributions, <em>D</em>, follows an exponential distribution: <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi xmlns="">D</mi><mo xmlns="">∼</mo><mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0" xmlns=""><mtext>Exp</mtext></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><mi xmlns="">λ</mi><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo></math>⁠</span>, where <em>λ</em> is estimated from empirical data. After each contribution, the agent’s probability of leaving the project is determined by the toxicity level, <em>T</em>, and the empirically observed distributions <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">non</mi></mrow></mrow></msubsup></math></span> and <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">tox</mi></mrow></mrow></msubsup></math>⁠</span>.

<p>We conducted a large-scale analysis, covering all comments made on user talk pages of the six most active language editions of Wikipedia over a period of 20 years, and found that toxic comments are associated with a decreased activity of editors who have received these comments and an increased risk of them leaving the project altogether. Additionally, via agent-based modeling, we showed that toxicity attacks on Wikipedia have the potential to impede the progress of the entire project.</p><p>The main limitation of our study is its relatively narrow scope, as it focuses solely on the association between toxic comments left on user talk pages and the subsequent decrease in users’ activity. However, this approach allowed us to formulate our findings with precision and ensure their robustness. We believe that our study complements and extends existing studies on Wikipedia and online communities more broadly, and may serve as a foundation for further exploration of the effects of toxicity, as we discuss in this section.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493731" id="428493731" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.1">Conflict on Wikipedia</h4>
<p>Conflict on Wikipedia has already been a subject of numerous studies, with particular attention given to so-called “edit wars” (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B11"></span>11, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B29"></span>29, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B30"></span>30). These arise when groups of editors, disagreeing about page content, repeatedly override each other’s contributions. It has been estimated that edit wars can impose substantial conflict and coordination costs on Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B12"></span>12). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that these costs increase over time and a smaller proportion of the total work by Wikipedians directly contributes to new article content. Conflict could also undermine content quality. For instance, the level of conflict on discussion pages, as assessed by raters, has been shown to negatively correlate with the quality of the corresponding Wikipedia articles (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B13"></span>13).</p><p>In contrast to previous studies, our focus is on comments left on user talk pages rather than article talk pages. While this narrows the scope of our study, it also ensures that the comments we examine are directly addressed to a specific editor. Our approach also mitigates potential bias that could be introduced by the topic of an article. For instance, comments on talk pages linked to articles about violence might be misclassified as toxic by an algorithm due to the presence of highly negative keywords.</p><p>It is possible that toxic comments we observe on user talk pages are not independent from a broader conflict occurring elsewhere on Wikipedia. Therefore, it is conceivable that the effect we observe is not purely explained by toxic comments, but also by a broader conflict which leads both to a toxic comment on a user talk page and decreased activity of this user. Future research is needed to address this limitation and explore the context in which toxic comments occur.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that it has already been established that toxicity on its own could lead users to stop contributing either temporarily or permanently, as this is what editors themselves report in surveys (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B24"></span>24). Our study complements such studies by providing an estimate of the potential effects while also being performed on a scale that is not achievable by survey methods.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493736" id="428493736" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.2">Stages of Wikipedia life cycle</h4>
<p>Wikipedia has not grown linearly but has instead passed through several stages. It began with exponential growth (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B31"></span>31), which subsequently slowed (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B32"></span>32). Following that, the number of active users declined before Wikipedia entered its current stage, characterized by a relatively stable number of active users (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B33"></span>33), with a slow decline observed in some language editions. A notable exception was a temporary spike in activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B34"></span>34). See <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pnasnexus/2/12/10.1093_pnasnexus_pgad385/2/pgad385_supplementary_data.pdf?Expires=1704812577&amp;Signature=d-s6BF9zZtNW0YtYo8mehCN1-eUtIRa8236kGZ1D6y4Oyx59aY10tBRtzXHl3cihdAtit8dZ7dBwyEe~VysBKn4vBGYy-gwqzit5D-IT1I6-cmeBEOaQwLNTCjw2AGwKdPTs1KA-stI9hGUB4BHmygndrSNDif-skuWQ-eTIMrIijDvwgO~eHg27ZAlBD0aXn6~K1gliVYgJtIoB-A0d~701nTIjSSXR8jbAuY~~-1zWLOUfkTsLOMyu0q5TAMetfNmQ1oU0AUfVikVZnQ17wk1RFpqzFHQUkEwab8MtC0om0HlAtjvUg65rv5vlK1wwy-AJyLkHSShIrsonaU6t6w__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Supplementary Fig. S5</a></span> for an illustration of these patterns in the editions studied in this paper.</p><p>It has been found that the main reason for halted growth is a sharp decline in the retention of newcomers (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B35"></span>35). Specifically, with the project’s development, the rejection of newcomer contributions has increased, demotivating them and driving them away. Our results complement these findings by highlighting that newcomers are also particularly vulnerable to toxic comments. If users receive a toxic comment after their first or second contributions, their chances of continuing to contribute are 1.8 times lower compared to users who did not receive toxic comments.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493739" id="428493739" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.3">Diversity of editors</h4>
<p>Wikipedia is often considered a neutral and unbiased source of knowledge. In fact, this is ingrained in its “Neutral point of view” policy, which is officially one of the five fundamental principles of Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B36"></span>36). However, the claim of neutrality should not be accepted uncritically (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B37"></span>37). For instance, while Wikipedia mandates that its content is supported by reliable sources, the selection of these sources can significantly deviate from the norms of the expert knowledge community, introducing biases to Wikipedia content (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B38"></span>38). Even if the content of articles is neutral, their coverage may be biased. It is well documented, for example, that biographies of women are underrepresented on Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B39"></span>39). Wikipedia’s own rules might contribute to such biases. For instance, providing reliable sources as required by Wikipedia for biographies of women might be challenging because fewer sources exist on women due to historic inequalities (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B40"></span>40). Another case in point is the Oral Citations project, which aimed to use oral citations for content on countries that are underrepresented in other sources (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B41"></span>41). However, this initiative was met with opposition by the English Wikipedia community.</p><p>These content biases are closely connected to the lack of diversity among editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B38"></span>38, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B42"></span>42). While estimates vary, the vast majority of Wikipedians are men (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B43"></span>43). Notably, Wikipedia did not achieve its own goal of having at least 25% women editors by 2015 (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B44"></span>44). This shortfall is a significant concern for the project, as diversity can improve the quality of content and reduce its biases (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B13"></span>13, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B45"></span>45). While multiple barriers confront women editors on Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B40"></span>40, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B46"></span>46, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B47"></span>47), toxicity is likely to be one of key factors contributing to the observed gender imbalance. Specifically, research has shown that while men and women are equally likely to face online harassment and abuse, women experience more severe violations (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B48"></span>48). They are also more likely to be affected by such incidents and to self-censor in an attempt to prevent potential harassment (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B48"></span>48). This has been confirmed in the Wikipedia context as well, where it has been demonstrated that the psychological experiences of women and men editors differ, leading to higher attrition rates among women (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B49"></span>49). Similar results were found in another survey (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B24"></span>24), showing that women experiencing toxicity are more likely to stop contributing in the future.</p><p>Overall, there are reasons to believe that toxicity might significantly undermine the diversity of Wikipedia editors, which can, in turn, compromise the quality of Wikipedia articles and introduce biases in its coverage. This underscores the importance of our findings. While most of the existing studies focus on the gender gap, we want to emphasize that the Wikipedia diversity problem goes beyond that, including racial, nonbinary, and other biases as well (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B50 pgad385-B51 pgad385-B52"></span>50–52). For instance, we observed that many of the toxic comments in our data set include ethnic slurs. Future studies are needed to better understand the experiences of minority groups on Wikipedia and the effects that toxicity has on them.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493743" id="428493743" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.4">Interventions</h4>
<p>The Wikipedia community is well aware of the aforementioned problems, and there have been multiple efforts to address them through various interventions. Research into reward systems showed that while they might work effectively for already highly productive editors, they fail to motivate less active editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B53"></span>53). Another study found no significant effect of positive rewards in online communities (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B54"></span>54).</p><p>To address the gender gap in Wikipedia content, numerous events dedicated to creating entries about women were organized (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B46"></span>46). An analysis of such interventions, which focused on two popular feminist interventions, confirmed that they succeeded in introducing content about women that would otherwise be missing (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B55"></span>55). However, there is still a need to address the gender gap on a more systematic and sustainable level. For instance, one study showed that most of the women activists who attended editing workshops later chose not to continue contributing to Wikipedia, citing safety concerns as their primary reason (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B46"></span>46). This issue was echoed in another study which identified safety as a core concern for women editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B56"></span>56).</p><p>A suggested solution to this problem has been the red-flagging of harassment and harassers (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B46"></span>46). However, the opinion that toxic comments are negligible and should be seen as merely over-enthusiastic participation is still present among editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B25"></span>25). Furthermore, various anti-harassment measures have been declined multiple times by the community, as they were seen to slow the process of content creation (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B57"></span>57, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B58"></span>58). Based on our findings, we believe there is a need to reevaluate these policies, and more research attention is required to understand the impact of potential interventions.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493747" id="428493747" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.5">The wider role of peer-production systems</h4>
<p>Wikipedia plays a crucial role in the global information infrastructure, aiming to provide millions of people with access to free, unbiased knowledge. Due to its reputation as a neutral and comprehensive information source, it has become a trusted first choice source of knowledge for many and its articles frequently appear in top search engine results (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B59"></span>59, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B60"></span>60). In fact, studies have shown that Google search results rely heavily on Wikipedia, and the quality of these results significantly diminishes without Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B61"></span>61). Beyond search engines, Wikipedia was shown to be valuable to other online communities such as Stack Exchange and Reddit (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B62"></span>62).</p><p>While Wikipedia is arguably the most successful peer-production system, it is certainly not the only one. Others include hundreds of wikis hosted by Fandom, the numerous question-and-answer communities of Stack Exchange, and various other platforms ranging from online maps to online learning (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B33"></span>33). Interestingly, for these projects, the same patterns that are typical of Wikipedia have been observed (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B63"></span>63), i.e. the initial growth in number of contributors is followed by a decline characterized by a decreased retention of newcomers. This suggests that our findings might have broader implications for large-scale collaborative projects and online communities. It emphasizes the need to promote healthy and sustainable communication practices to protect crucial online information ecosystems and ensure their long-term success.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="428493750" id="428493750" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s3">Methods and materials</h2>

<p>The Wikimedia Foundation provides publicly accessible dumps of all the different wikis’ content.<sup><span id="jumplink-FN1"></span>a</sup> These dumps are updated on a regular basis, with complete revision history dumps generated once per month. For this paper, we used the English dump from 2021 November 1, the German dump from 2022 August 1, the French, Italian, and Spanish dumps from 2022 August 1, and the Russian dump from 2022 July 1. The data was obtained from a mirror hosted by the Umeå University, Sweden.<sup><span id="jumplink-FN2"></span>b</sup></p><p>From the dumps, the user talk pages were extracted. A user’s talk page is a place where other editors can communicate with the user either on more personal topics or to extend their discussion from an article talk page. When the comments left on the talk page are resolved or become too old, users can choose to archive them. This helps them keep better track of new incoming topics. Once archived, the old comments are not displayed on the talk page anymore but are rather linked in a subpage. Nevertheless, the entire history of the user talk page, as of any other page on Wikipedia, can be fully seen under the tab of revision history. The revision history records one entry for every edit made on the page saving each time the complete content of the page. Thus retrieving a single comment requires performing the difference between two consecutive revisions. The Wikimedia API does offer a method to compute the difference between two revisions, however, applying it on a scale that was necessary for this research was unfeasible. For that reason, we developed our own parser to extract comments as a difference between two versions of the page (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B64"></span>64).</p><p>We excluded from our analysis talk pages that belong to unregistered users, e.g. users who are represented only by an IP address rather than a user name, because IP addresses are dynamic and it can not be assumed that one address represents a single user throughout Wikipedia history. Additionally, we have excluded comments made by officially registered bots. Comments that were made by users on their own pages are also not considered.</p><p>When extracting comments, we cleared wiki-specific formatting and HTML markup, i.e. removed links, attachments, or other formatting-specific sequences irrelevant to the actual content.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493757" id="428493757" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s3.1.2">Contributions and active days</h4>
<p>In order to extract information on users’ contributions, i.e. edits of Wikipedia pages made by them, we used the MediaWiki API to retrieve timestamps for each edit made by a given user. The resulting data set is publicly available in the project repository (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B64"></span>64). The timestamps of contributions were then converted into active days. Specifically, each user <em>i</em> was represented as a binary vector <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub xmlns=""><mi>u</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">,</mo><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">,</mo><mo xmlns="">…</mo><mo xmlns="">,</mo><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo></math>⁠</span>, where <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mn xmlns="">1</mn></math></span> if user <em>i</em> made at least one contribution, i.e. edited a Wikipedia page, within the 24-h period corresponding to day <em>d</em> and <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mn xmlns="">0</mn></math></span> otherwise. <em>N</em> is the number of days between the first recorded contribution in our data set and the last. The conversion from contribution count to active days was performed because it is hard to interpret and compare the total number of contributions between users as one large contribution could be equivalent to multiple smaller ones. Additionally, the size of a contribution does not necessarily reflect the effort put into it. While being active on a given day could still mean different levels of activity for different users, it represents a certain level of engagement with the project and is substantially different from not contributing at all on a given day.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="428493759" id="428493759" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s3.2">Toxicity</h3>
<p>The automatic detection of offensive language in online communities has been an active area of research since at least 2010 (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B65"></span>65). Over the past decade, researchers have focused on detecting closely-related and intersecting types of offensive language such as toxicity, abusive language, and hate speech (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B66"></span>66), see (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B67"></span>67) for an overview of recent advancements in the field. In this paper, we use a model from the Perspective API (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B68"></span>68) to identify toxic comments. This is a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm that obtained competitive results at OffensEval-2019 competition (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B69"></span>69) without any additional training on the contest data and is often used as a baseline system for toxicity detection (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B66"></span>66). Perspective API is used across multiple platforms, including The New York Times, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, and El País. It uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B70"></span>70) and is trained on comments from a variety of online sources, including Wikipedia. Each comment is labeled by 3–10 crowdsourced raters.

Additionally, we applied different activity filters, e.g. we separately compute an estimate only for those users who were active at least <em>X</em> days in the past 100 days where <em>X</em> varies from 0 to 50. This is done in order to ensure that the results are not exclusively driven by those users who had made few edits and then stopped contributing to the project.

Finally, the results are averaged over all users. We repeat the procedure of selecting a random toxic comment 100 times and report average results.

However, a direct comparison is complicated because users who have received a toxic comment are, on average, more active than those who have not.

Specifically, it had a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/piracy-international-law" data-show-preview="true">pirate</a> problem. The rugged region of southern Anatolia known as Cilicia Trachea (Rough Cilicia) was notoriously infested with seagoing bandits whose depredations terrified Romans. </p><!--[P1]--><!--[AM1]--><span></span><!--[MOD1]--><span></span><!--[BP2]--><p>In 75 BCE a band of Cilician pirates in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegean-Sea" data-show-preview="true">Aegean Sea</a> captured a 25-year-old Roman nobleman named <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julius-Caesar-Roman-ruler" data-show-preview="true">Julius Caesar</a>, who had been on his way to study oratory in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Rhodes-Greece" data-show-preview="true">Rhodes</a>. As the story is related in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Plutarch" data-show-preview="true">Plutarch</a>’s <em>Parallel Lives</em>, the capture was a minor inconvenience for Caesar but very bad luck for the pirates.</p><!--[P2]--><!--[AM2]--><span></span><!--[MOD2]--><span></span><!--[BP3]--><p>From the start, Caesar simply refused to behave like a captive. When the pirates told him that they had set his ransom at the sum of 20 talents, he laughed at them for not knowing who it was they had captured and suggested that 50 talents would be a more appropriate amount. He then sent his entourage out to gather the money and settled in for a period of captivity. The pirates must have been dumbfounded. It’s not every day that a hostage negotiates his ransom <em>up</em>. </p><!--[P3]--><!--[AM3]--><span></span><!--[MOD3]--><span></span><!--[BP4]--><p>Caesar made himself at home among the pirates, bossing them around and shushing them when he wanted to sleep. He made them listen to the speeches and poems that he was composing in his unanticipated downtime and berated them as illiterates if they weren’t sufficiently impressed. He would participate in the pirates’ games and exercises, but he always addressed them as if he were the commander and they were his subordinates. From time to time he would threaten to have them all crucified. They took it as a joke from their overconfident, slightly nutty captive. </p><!--[P4]--><!--[AM4]--><span></span><!--[MOD4]--><span></span><!--[BP5]--><p>It wasn’t a joke. After 38 days, the ransom was delivered and Caesar went free. Astonishingly, Caesar managed to raise a naval force in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Miletus" data-show-preview="true">Miletus</a>—despite holding no public or military office—and he set out in pursuit of the pirates. He found them still camped at the island where he had been held, and he brought them back as his captives. When the governor of Asia seemed to vacillate about punishing them, Caesar went to the prison where they were being held and had them all crucified. </p><!--[P5]--><!--[AM5]--><span></span><!--[MOD5]--><span></span><span></span></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Windows users are reporting that Hewlett Packard's HP Smart application is appearing on their systems, despite them not having any of the manufacturer's hardware attached.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has remained tight-lipped on what is happening, folks on various social media platforms noted the app's appearance, which seems to afflict both Windows 10 and Windows 11.</p>
<p>The Windows Update mechanism is used to deploy third-party applications and drivers as well as Microsoft's updates, and we'd bet someone somewhere has accidentally checked the wrong box.</p>

    

<p>Up to now, the response from affected users has been one of confusion.</p>

        


        

<p>One <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbcapfh/">noted</a> on Reddit: "I thought that was just me. I didn't install it, it just appeared on new apps in start menu out of nowhere."</p>
<p>Another <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbbkn2b/">said</a>: "I just checked and I had it installed too. Checking the event log for the Microsoft Store shows that it installed earlier today, but I definitely did [not] request or initiate it because I do not have any devices from HP."</p>

</ul>
<p>And, of course, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbdkztd/">there was the inevitable</a>: "Would it be <b>that</b> hard for Microsoft to just provide an operating system without needless bloat?"</p>
<p>To be clear, not all users are affected. Our test Windows 10 PC was far too busy suggesting that we should take a look at Copilot to bother with the HP Smart app nonsense.</p>

        

<p>WindowsLatest <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/11/30/hp-smart-is-auto-installing-on-windows-11-and-windows-10-on-non-hp-machines/">reported</a> the issue occurring on both physical Windows 10 hardware and a Windows 11 virtual machine.</p>
<p>HP Smart is innocuous enough. It's an application used in conjunction with HP's printer hardware and can simply be uninstalled.</p>
<p>However, the question is how the application got installed in the first place on a machine with no HP hardware attached or on a network, according to affected users.</p>

        

<p>In a statement to WindowsLatest, Microsoft said it was aware of the reports and it would share more details soon. <em>The Register</em> asked Microsoft to comment and will report back with any response. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="prism-article-body"><p><span>SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- </span>The skyline of San Francisco's Financial District is about as picturesque as it gets. An area that was bustling with people several years ago, but one that according to the numbers, is now more vacant than ever.</p><p>"Right now in downtown San Francisco, we have a vacancy rate of a little over 35% which is the highest that we've ever recorded in the history of San Francisco," says Colin Yasukochi who is an executive director of the tech insights center at CBRE, which focuses on the tech industry and how it affects commercial real estate. Yasukochi says that office vacancy numbers in San Francisco were 3 to 4% pre-pandemic, meaning we've seen more than a 30% increase and that trend may continue.</p><p><b>Take Action SF: <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7news.com/take-action-sf-london-breed-brooke-jenkins-bill-scott/14086522/">Mayor, city leaders to answer questions about future of city</a></b></p><p>"We think that the vacancy rate will probably creep up some more in 2024, probably at least through the first half of the year. I would say because there still are firms who are consolidating and reducing the amount of office space they have," said Yasukochi.</p><p>"The challenge still remains - remote work and the city's reliance on tech as it's largest industry and those tech workers, they've been working from home for a very long time and many of those businesses are operating successfully from home," said Jeff Bellisario of the Bay Area Council. Bellisario says homelessness, crime, public safety, and all around cleanliness are still the top concerns among current and potential San Francisco employers. He also says one thing is true.</p><p>"It's not a doom loop, right? The numbers don't necessarily suggest that. A doom loop would have high unemployment, it would have businesses running to other cities. That's not where we are but we're not in a spot where we are thriving and succeeding, we're kind of surviving," said Bellisario.</p><p>While companies like Nordstrom, Cinemark, and Old Navy have closed retail locations in the city, Bellisario says San Francisco business license data shows that overall the city is no longer losing more companies than it's gaining.</p><p><b>MORE: <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7news.com/downtown-san-francisco-investing-in-sf-empty-offices-tech/13236684/">Despite downtown SF's current rough patch, prominent business leaders are investing in it</a></b></p><p>Still though, retail vacancy rates have risen to above 18% in Union Square.</p><p>Kazuko Morgan of Cushman and Wakefield says businesses are opening up and good news is on the horizon.</p><p>"There are a number of leases that have been signed and not been announced that will probably be forthcoming next year. We have a fair amount of tenants that are under construction so that's going to add to the vibrancy as well," said Morgan.</p><p>Morgan says that workers going back to the office and more conventions would both help retail; but the positive image of San Francisco must also get out there too.</p><p><b>VIDEO: <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7news.com/always-san-francisco-campaign-sf-tourism-visit-travel/13324256/">San Francisco launches multimillion-dollar campaign to boost tourism</a></b></p><div data-testid="prism-caption"><p><span data-testid="prism-truncate"><span><span>The "Always San Francisco" campaign highlights the city's most iconic sights and sounds with a minute-long commercial aimed at attracting tourists.</span></span></span></p></div><p>"Our biggest issue I think has just been the media backlash with the media throwing us under the bus, and I think that is probably been one of the toughest things we have had to deal with," said Morgan.</p><p>ABC 7 News reporter J.R.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, genetic testing company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/23andme-says-hackers-accessed-significant-number-of-files-about-users-ancestry/">23andMe announced that hackers accessed the personal data of 0.1% of customers, or about 14,000 individuals</a>. The company also said that by accessing those accounts, hackers were also able to access “a significant number of files containing profile information about other users’ ancestry.” But 23andMe would not say how many “other users” were impacted by the breach that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/23andme-resets-user-passwords-after-genetic-data-posted-online/">the company initially disclosed in early October</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there were a lot of “other users” who were victims of this data breach: 6.9 million affected individuals in total.</p>
<p>In an email sent to TechCrunch late on Saturday, 23andMe spokesperson Katie Watson confirmed that hackers accessed the personal information of about 5.5 million people who opted-in to 23andMe’s DNA Relatives feature, which allows customers to automatically share some of their data with others. The stolen data included the person’s name, birth year, relationship labels, the percentage of DNA shared with relatives, ancestry reports and self-reported location.</p>
<p>23andMe also confirmed that another group of about 1.4 million people who opted-in to DNA Relatives also “had their Family Tree profile information accessed,” which includes display names, relationship labels, birth year, self-reported location and whether the user decided to share their information, the spokesperson said. (23andMe declared part of its email as “on background,” which requires that both parties agree to the terms in advance. TechCrunch is printing the reply as we were given no opportunity to reject the terms.)</p>
<p>It is also not known why 23andMe did not share these numbers in its disclosure on Friday.</p>
<p>Considering the new numbers, in reality, the data breach is known to affect roughly half of 23andMe’s total reported 14 million customers.</p>
<p>In early October, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hacker claimed to have stolen the DNA information of 23andMe users</a> in a post on a well-known hacking forum. As proof of the breach, the hacker published the alleged data of one million users of Jewish Ashkenazi descent and 100,000 Chinese users, asking would-be buyers for $1 to $10 for the data per individual account. Two weeks later, the same hacker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/hacker-leaks-millions-more-23andme-user-records-on-cybercrime-forum/">advertised the alleged records of another four million people</a> on the same hacking forum.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found that another hacker on a separate hacking forum <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/23andme-says-hackers-accessed-significant-number-of-files-about-users-ancestry/">had already advertised a batch of allegedly stolen 23andMe customer data</a> two months before the widely reported advertisement.</p>

<p>When we analyzed the months-old leaked data, TechCrunch found that some records matched genetic data published online by hobbyists and genealogists. The two sets of information were formatted differently, but contained some of the same unique user and generic data, suggesting the data leaked by the hacker was at least in part authentic 23andMe customer data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.23andme.com/articles/addressing-data-security-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosing the incident in October</a>, 23andMe said the data breach was caused by customers reusing passwords, which allowed hackers to brute-force the victims’ accounts by using publicly known passwords released in other companies’ data breaches.</p>
<p>Because of the way that the DNA Relatives feature matches users with their relatives, by hacking into one individual account, the hackers were able to see the personal data of both the account holder as well as their relatives, which magnified the total number of 23andMe victims.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! The other day, I started wondering – has anyone ever made a FUSE
filesystem for a git repository where all every commit is a folder? It turns
out the answer is yes! There’s <a href="https://github.com/fanzeyi/giblefs">giblefs</a>,
<a href="https://belkadan.com/blog/2023/11/GitMounter/">GitMounter</a>, and <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a> for Plan 9.</p>

<p>But FUSE is pretty annoying to use on Mac – you need to install a kernel
extension, and Mac OS seems to be making it harder and harder to install kernel
extensions for security reasons. Also I had a few ideas for how to organize the
filesystem differently than those projects.</p>

<p>So I thought it would be fun to experiment with ways to mount filesystems on
Mac OS other than FUSE, so I built a project that does that called
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/git-commit-folders">git-commit-folders</a>. It works (at least on my computer) with both FUSE and NFS, and there’s a broken WebDav
implementation too.</p>

<p>It’s pretty experimental (I’m not sure if this is actually a useful piece of
software to have or just a fun toy to think about how git works) but it was fun
to write and I’ve enjoyed using it myself on small repositories so here are
some of the problems I ran into while writing it.</p>

<h3 id="goal-show-how-commits-are-like-folders">goal: show how commits are like folders</h3>

<p>The main reason I wanted to make this was to give folks some intuition for how
git works under the hood. After all, git commits really <em>are</em> very similar to
folders – every Git commit <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/09/14/in-a-git-repository--where-do-your-files-live-/#commit-step-2-look-at-the-tree">contains a directory listing</a> of the files in it,
and that directory can have subdirectories, etc.</p>

<p>It’s just that git commits aren’t <em>actually</em> implemented as folders to save
disk space.</p>

<p>So in <code>git-commit-folders</code>, every commit is actually a folder, and if you want
to explore your old commits, you can do it just by exploring the filesystem!
For example, if I look at the initial commit for my blog, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls commits/8d/8dc0/8dc0cb0b4b0de3c6f40674198cb2bd44aeee9b86/
README
</code></pre>

<p>and a few commits later, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls /tmp/git-homepage/commits/c9/c94e/c94e6f531d02e658d96a3b6255bbf424367765e9/
_config.yml  config.rb  Rakefile  rubypants.rb  source
</code></pre>

<h3 id="branches-are-symlinks">branches are symlinks</h3>

<p>In the filesystem mounted by <code>git-commit-folders</code>, commits are the only real folders – everything
else (branches, tags, etc) is a symlink to a commit. This mirrors how git works under the hood.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l branches/
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork bazil-fuse -&gt; ../commits/ff/ff56/ff563b089f9d952cd21ac4d68d8f13c94183dcd8
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork follow-symlink -&gt; ../commits/7f/7f73/7f73779a8ff79a2a1e21553c6c9cd5d195f33030
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork go-mod-branch -&gt; ../commits/91/912d/912da3150d9cfa74523b42fae028bbb320b6804f
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork mac-version -&gt; ../commits/30/3008/30082dcd702b59435f71969cf453828f60753e67
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork mac-version-debugging -&gt; ../commits/18/18c0/18c0db074ec9b70cb7a28ad9d3f9850082129ce0
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork main -&gt; ../commits/04/043e/043e90debbeb0fc6b4e28cf8776e874aa5b6e673
$ ls -l tags/
lr-xr-xr-x - bork 31 Dec  1969 test-tag -&gt; ../commits/16/16a3/16a3d776dc163aa8286fb89fde51183ed90c71d0
</code></pre>

<p>This definitely doesn’t completely explain how git works (there’s a lot more to
it than just “a commit is like a folder!”), but my hope is that it makes thie
idea that every commit is like a folder with an old version of your code” feel
a little more concrete.</p>

<h3 id="why-might-this-be-useful">why might this be useful?</h3>

<p>Before I get into the implementation, I want to talk about why having a filesystem
with a folder for every git commit in it might be useful. A lot of my projects
I end up never really using at all (like <a href="https://github.com/jvns/dnspeep">dnspeep</a>) but I did find myself using this
project a little bit while I was working on it.</p>

<p>The main uses I’ve found so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>searching for a function I deleted – I can run <code>grep someFunction branch_histories/main/*/commit.go</code> to find an old version of it</li>
<li>quickly looking at a file on another branch to copy a line from it, like <code>vim branches/other-branch/go.mod</code></li>
<li>searching every branch for a function, like <code>grep someFunction branches/*/commit.go</code></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are through symlinks to commits instead of referencing commits
directly.</p>

<p>None of these are the most efficient way to do this (you can use <code>git show</code> and
<code>git log -S</code> or maybe <code>git grep</code> to accomplish something similar), but
personally I always forget the syntax and navigating a filesystem feels easier
to me.</p>

<p>Next I want to talk about some problems I ran into.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-webdav-or-nfs">problem 1: webdav or NFS?</h3>

<p>The two filesystems I could that were natively supported by Mac OS were WebDav
and NFS. I couldn’t tell which would be easier to implement so I just
tried both.</p>

<p>At first webdav seemed easier and it turns out that golang.org/x/net has a
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/webdav">webdav implementation</a>, which  was
pretty easy to set up.</p>

<p>But that implementation doesn’t support symlinks, I think because it uses the <code>io/fs</code> interface
and <code>io/fs</code> doesn’t <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49580">support symlinks yet</a>. Looks like that’s in progress
though. So I gave up on webdav and decided to focus on the NFS implementation, using this <a href="https://github.com/willscott/go-nfs/">go-nfs</a> NFSv3 library.</p>

<p>Someone also mentioned that there’s
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider/">FileProvider</a> on Mac
but I didn’t look into that.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-how-to-keep-all-the-implementations-in-sync">problem 2: how to keep all the implementations in sync?</h3>

<p>I was implementing 3 different filesystems (FUSE, NFS, and WebDav), and it
wasn’t clear to me how to avoid a lot of duplicated code.</p>

<p>My friend Dave suggested writing one core implementation and then writing
adapters (like <code>fuse2nfs</code> and <code>fuse2dav</code>) to translate it into the NFS and
WebDav verions. What this looked like in practice is that I needed to implement
3 filesystem interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>fs.FS</code> for FUSE</li>
<li><code>billy.Filesystem</code> for NFS</li>
<li><code>webdav.Filesystem</code> for webdav</li>
</ul>

<p>So I put all the core logic in the <code>fs.FS</code> interface, and then wrote two functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>func Fuse2Dav(fs fs.FS) webdav.FileSystem</code></li>
<li><code>func Fuse2NFS(fs fs.FS) billy.Filesystem</code></li>
</ul>

<p>All of the filesystems were kind of similar so the translation wasn’t too hard,
there were just 1 million annoying bugs to fix.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-i-didn-t-want-to-list-every-commit">problem 3: I didn’t want to list every commit</h3>

<p>Some git repositories have thousands or millions of commits. My first idea for how to address this was to make <code>commits/</code> appear empty, so that it works like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls commits/
$ ls commits/80210c25a86f75440110e4bc280e388b2c098fbd/
fuse  fuse2nfs  go.mod  go.sum  main.go  README.md
</code></pre>

<p>So every commit would be available if you reference it directly, but you can’t
list them. This is a weird thing for a filesystem to do but it actually works
fine in FUSE. I couldn’t get it to work in NFS though. I assume what’s going on
here is that if you tell NFS that a directory is empty, it’ll interpret that
the directory is actually empty, which is fair.</p>

<p>I ended up handling this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>organizing the commits by their 2-character prefix the way <code>.git/objects</code>
does (so that <code>ls commits</code> shows <code>0b 03 05 06 07 09 1b 1e 3e 4a</code>), but doing
2 levels of this so that a <code>18d46e76d7c2eedd8577fae67e3f1d4db25018b0</code> is at <code>commits/18/18df/18d46e76d7c2eedd8577fae67e3f1d4db25018b0</code></li>
<li>listing all the packed commits hashes only once at the beginning, caching
them in memory, and then only updating the loose objects afterwards. The idea
is that almost all of the commits in the repo should be packed and git
doesn’t repack its commits very often.</li>
</ul>

<p>This seems to work okay on the Linux kernel which has ~1 million commits. It
takes maybe a minute to do the initial load on my machine and then after that
it just needs to do fast incremental updates.</p>

<p>Each commit hash is only 20 bytes so caching 1 million commit hashes isn’t a
big deal, it’s just 20MB.</p>

<p>I think a smarter way to do this would be to load the commit listings lazily –
Git sorts its packfiles by commit ID, so you can pretty easily do a binary
search to find all commits starting with <code>1b</code> or <code>1b8c</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git">git library</a> I was using
doesn’t have great support for this though, because listing all commits in a
Git repository is a really weird thing to do. I spent maybe a couple of days
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/git-commit-folders/tree/fast-commits">trying to implement it</a> but I didn’t manage to get the performance I wanted so I
gave up.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-not-a-directory">problem 4: “not a directory”</h3>

<p>I kept getting this error:</p>

<pre><code>"/tmp/mnt2/commits/59/59167d7d09fd7a1d64aa1d5be73bc484f6621894/": Not a directory (os error 20)
</code></pre>

<p>This really threw me off at first but it turns out that this just means that
there was an error while listing the directory, and the way the NFS library
handles that error is with “Not a directory”. This happened a bunch of times
and I just needed to track the bug down every time.</p>

<p>There were a lot of weird errors like this. I also got <code>cd: system call
interrupted</code> which was pretty upsetting but ultimately was just some other bug
in my program.</p>

<p>Eventually I realized that I could use Wireshark to look at all the NFS
packets being sent back and forth, which made some of this stuff easier to debug.</p>

<h3 id="problem-5-inode-numbers">problem 5: inode numbers</h3>

<p>At first I was accidentally setting all my directory inode numbers to 0. This
was bad because if if you run <code>find</code> on a directory where the inode number of
every directory is 0, it’ll complain about filesystem loops and give up, which
is very fair.</p>

<p>I fixed this by defining an <code>inode(string)</code> function which hashed a string to
get the inode number, and using the tree ID / blob ID as the string to hash.</p>

<h3 id="problem-6-stale-file-handles">problem 6: stale file handles</h3>

<p>I kept getting this “Stale NFS file handle” error. The problem is that I need
to be able to take an opaque 64-byte NFS “file handle” and map it to the right
directory.</p>

<p>The way the NFS library I’m using works is that it generates a file handle for
every file and caches those references with a fixed size cache. This works fine
for small repositories, but if there are too many files then it’ll overflow the
cache and you’ll start getting stale file handle errors.</p>

<p>This is still a problem and I’m not sure how to fix it. I don’t understand how
real NFS servers do this, maybe they just have a really big cache?</p>

<p>The NFS file handle is 64 bytes (64 bytes! not bits!) which is pretty big, so
it does seem like you could just encode the entire file path in the handle a
lot of the time and not cache it at all. Maybe I’ll try to implement that at
some point.</p>

<h3 id="problem-7-branch-histories">problem 7: branch histories</h3>

<p>The <code>branch_histories/</code> directory only lists the latest 100 commits for each
branch right now. Not sure what the right move is there – it would be nice to
be able to list the full history of the branch somehow. Maybe I could use a
similar subfolder trick to the <code>commits/</code> directory.</p>

<h3 id="problem-8-submodules">problem 8: submodules</h3>

<p>Git repositories sometimes have submodules. I don’t understand anything about
submodules so right now I’m just ignoring them. So that’s a bug.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p>There are probably more problems I forgot but that’s all I can think of for
now. I may or may not fix the NFS stale file handle problem or the “it takes 1
minute to start up on the linux kernel” problem, who knows!</p>

<p>Thanks to my friend <a href="https://github.com/vasi">vasi</a> who explained one million things about filesystems to me.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Intel’s Optane memory modules launched with a lot of fanfare in 2015, and were recently
discontinued, in 2022, with similar fanfare. It was a sad day for me, a lover of
abstraction-breaking technologies, but it was forseeable and understandable.</p>
<p>At the time of Optane’s launch, a lot of us were excited about the idea of having a new storage
tier, sitting between DRAM and flash. It was announced as having DRAM endurance and speed with
the persistence and size of flash. It was a futuristic memory technology, but the technology of
the future met the full force of Wright’s Law.</p>
<h2 id="wrights-law">Wright’s Law</h2>
<p><em><strong>Each doubling of production volume corresponds to a 20% decrease in cost</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is the simple statement of Wright’s Law. It was originally developed by a man named Theodore
Wright in the 1930’s when looking at the production of airplane parts. Since then, it has been
verified to hold in many different industries, although the cost reduction seems to vary between
10 and 25% depending on the industry. Despite the industry difference, the history of
semiconductor technology has actually followed Wright’s Law more closely than Moore’s Law: The
density increases predicted by Moore’s Law tend to speed up and slow down with demand growth,
exactly as predicted by Wright’s Law.</p>
<p>During the last 7 years, DRAM and Flash have both experienced massive increases in density and
production volume, and in turn, Wright’s Law has given us cheaper, faster, bigger devices.</p>
<h4 id="dram-production-2015-2022">DRAM Production 2015-2022</h4>
<p>The lifetime of DDR4 memory roughly matches the lifetime of Optane. DDR4 was introduced a few
years before 2015, and became cost-effective compared to DDR3 around 2015-2016. Today, DDR5 RAM
and the CPUs that can use it have just recently been introduced to the market. Over this time,
RAM price per bit has roughly halved, and global RAM production has grown by a factor of about
10-15. However, due to competition between AMD and Intel, the number of memory channels per CPU
has also roughly doubled. Thus, a server in 2022 holds about 4x as much RAM as a server in 2015,
and memory cost as a share of system cost has increased by a factor of 2. Memory bandwidth has
increased by a factor of about 3 due to a doubling of memory channels and the channels getting
faster.</p>
<p>This means that both the capacity argument of Optane (“a system with Optane DIMMs can hold more
memory”) has diminished over time, and the performance gap between Optane and DDR memory has also
grown. A two-socket server populated with RDIMMs can now hold several TB of memory, so the value
proposition of Optane for memory capacity has been eliminated.</p>
<h4 id="flash-is-a-spectrum">Flash is a Spectrum</h4>
<p>Flash memory comes in four flavors, based on the number of bits stored in each cell. Single-level
cell (SLC) flash stores one bit per cell. It has the lowest density, but the longest endurance and
highest speeds. MLC (multi-level cell) holds two bits per cell, and is worse on speed and
endurance than SLC, but better than TLC (triple-level cell). Most SSDs today use TLC flash: it
offers a good balance between price and endurance, and most workloads are read-heavy, so there
isn’t a lot of stress on the memory arrays. QLC (quad-level cell) has recently been introduced to
the market as a capacity SSD technology: QLC has even lower endurance and speed than TLC, but
increases the capacity a lot. PLC (penta-level) is on the horizon, promising to continue the
trend.</p>
<p>On the back of this distinction, we can see a natural tiering of flash: using TLC or QLC for
capacity (in place of disk for all but the largest datasets), and using SLC for caching and
write-heavy workloads. This means that SLC flash is a direct competitor to Optane, but it
has the advantages of being much cheaper per bit without being a lot slower.</p>
<h4 id="flash-production-2015-2022">Flash Production 2015-2022</h4>
<p>After Optane’s launch, Flash memory technology advanced quickly. In 2015, NVMe drives had been out
for about a year or two. NVMe drives and the controller chips that ran them were still working out
the kinks. Understandably, Intel also created NVMe drives with Optane, offering much better read
and write latencies than NVMe drives with flash. Not only did Optane offer faster access than
flash, but it had the advantage of being a simpler, more reliable form of memory that didn’t need
complicated controller algorithms.</p>
<p>As time went on, companies quicly improved the speed, reliability, and density of each flash
technology. In 2015, TLC was roughly in the position QLC occupies today: mostly for read-only and
read-heavy workloads. Now, TLC is the workhorse flash technology used for general-purpose drives,
as its speed and endurance have improved. Similarly, SSD controller chips have also improved over
time, allowing them to work faster and make better use of the flash chips on an SSD. Lots of money
goes into R&amp;D work for flash, and it shows.</p>
<p>In the last 7 years, flash has grown to be the dominant storage technology: going from almost 20x
more per bit than hard drives to just 5x more per bit. In addition, SSD latency has dropped by
a factor of 2 due to control chips getting more powerful and algorithms getting better. Flash
bandwidth has increased to the point where an SSD can saturate a PCIe gen 4 x4 link. A modern
SLC SSD can be found with read latency under 30 microseconds, and even TLC SSDs can get close to
100 microsecond latencies.</p>
<p>Flash has advanced so much over the last 7 years that if the trend continues, I may be eulogizing
the magnetic hard drive in 2030. Flash is eating the storage world for good reason: it can offer
high speeds and high capacity, and while it had some rough edges, we have learned how to work with
it very well.</p>
<h4 id="optane-and-wrights-law">Optane and Wright’s Law</h4>
<p>Clearly, as time has advanced, Optane’s position in the memory hierarchy has been getting crushed
between expanding DDR4 DRAM and flash that is getting faster and faster. Both of these
technologies have had much more innovation and R&amp;D over the last 7 years than Optane, and it shows.
In retrospect, Intel was fighting an uphill battle if they wanted to treat Optane simply as a point
on the memory hierarchy. To make the project successful, they needed it to be a unique value add.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-proposition-of-optane">The Value Proposition of Optane</h2>
<p>After the dust settled, Optane modules only ended up having a small price difference with DRAM
modules of the same size, but were almost as slow as SLC flash, and only had 3-5x the endurance of
flash memory. The NVMe drives were faster, but not that much faster, than SLC flash. The only
value-add that was left was the abstraction difference with normal memory: Optane offered
<strong>persistence on the memory bus</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have worked on a database or a storage system, you will know how valuable this can be: lots
of code in high-throughput storage systems is there to make sure that transactions persist as
quickly as possible. Conceivably, if the normal memory writes involved in that transaction can
make it persistent, you can delete a ton of code. You could even conceivably run a small database
on an <code>mmap</code>-ed Optane file, and persistence would be given to you for free. Oh wait… a lot of
databases <code>mmap</code> their backing files already.</p>
<h4 id="persistence-on-the-memory-abstraction">Persistence on the Memory Abstraction</h4>
<p>It turns out that what developers mostly would have wanted from Optane they got from BSD and Linux
in the form of <code>mmap</code>. <code>mmap</code>-ing a file allows you to treat the contents of the file as though
they are in memory, and allows the filesystem and a cache to handle the rest. The parts of the
file you have accessed recently are in memory, while other parts of the file are fetched from disk
when you demand them - your access triggers a page fault, which in turn triggers a read from the
filesystem. Writes to the file are handled in the background. This is not the fastest way to
access files, but it is a very convenient one, and it works well enough for many high-performance
key-value databases like LevelDB, LMDB, SQLite, QuestDB, RavenDB, and more.</p>
<p><code>mmap</code> had one more secret weapon: the filesystem. If the media backing the filesystem wore out,
the filesystem (and the layers underneath it) could detect and correct issues. Optane had no
such protection.</p>
<p>When Intel thought they were enabling a whole new class of high-performance databases by offering
persistence on the memory bus, they were really offering a performance boost compared to persistent
databases using <code>mmap</code>. It might not even have been a performance boost: Optane slowed down your
median read and write operations in exchange for avoiding those page faults, so if your working set
was small or mostly fit inside RAM, <code>mmap</code> and NVMe flash was actually faster.</p>
<h4 id="persistent-memory-and-caches">Persistent Memory and Caches</h4>
<p>It turns out that offering persistence on the memory bus runs into abstraction problems with the
current memory controllers on CPUs. The memory controllers and cache hierarchies are designed
assuming that memory is dumb and volatile, and they can indefinitely delay writes to save
bandwidth.</p>
<p>The initial solution that Intel came up with was an instruction, <code>CLFLUSH</code>, that flushed a cache
line to memory. However, <code>CLFLUSH</code> was a serializing instruction, like <code>CPUID</code>, so it ended up
flushing the CPU pipeline as well as the cache hierarchy when it was issued. Worse, flusing the
cache line would invalidate it, so if you wanted to read the value back after writing it, you would
incur a cache miss. It was later supplemented by <code>CLFLUSHOPT</code> and <code>CLWB</code> which also could be used
to flush and write back cache lines without incurring the same performance penalty.</p>
<p>However, when Optane memory started to come out, <code>CLFLUSH</code> was the only instruction from this suite
that was available, meaning that initial performance tests suffered from both the speed difference
between Optane and DRAM and the substantial overhead of the <code>CLFLUSH</code> instruction. Intel would
probably have had a much easier time selling Optane if their core architecture were ready.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-methods-of-persistence">Alternative Methods of Persistence</h4>
<p>Also between 2015 and 2022, several companies were offering a different kind of persistent DIMM.
Instead of using a special type of memory, this kind of persistent DIMM used normal DRAM, but added
some flash memory and a small controller circuit on the back that saved the contents of the DRAM
to flash every time the power started to dip.</p>
<p>To make sure that the contents of the DIMM were safe, these persistent DIMMs had a supercapacitor
or small lithium ion battery (usually kept in a 2.5 inch drive bay and connected to the DIMM
through a cable) that kept the DIMM powered while the rest of the system was going down. On
power-up, the DIMM would restore the memory contents.</p>
<p>These were later specified by JEDEC as “NVDIMM-N” modules (standing for Non-volatile Dual Inline
Memory Module - NAND flash type).</p>
<p>Still, these alternatives have some problems: they are a lot thicker than normal memory DIMMs, and
they can’t offer the capacity that Optane modules could offer. However, they don’t have the same
durability problems that Optane and flash do, since the flash is rarely written, and they operate
at the same speed as the rest of the system’s memory.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you-optane">Thank You, Optane</h2>
<p>So many technologies have become successful around Optane and the promises it held. Unfortunately,
Optane was not one of them.</p>
<p>SSDs using SLC flash offer blazing fast performance with a block abstraction, and enterprises and
database developers learned how to take advantage of the differences between SSDs that were small
and fast, using SLC flash, and SSDs that were slower and larger, with TLC and QLC flash. Some SSD
manufacturers also saw the idea of a caching drive and competed by adding SLC caching to their TLC
SSDs. Most high-end consumer SSDs today do this for you.</p>
<p>For the few customers who needed persistence on the memory bus, the JEDEC NVDIMM standards emerged,
with the flagship NVDIMM-N modules allowing you to have a DRAM module that was both persistent
<em>and</em> fast, and an additional standard to cover future persistent memory technologies. Intel’s
new instructions allow users to take advantage of these new modules, adding a fundamental
capability to CPUs.</p>
<p>Optane has helped us learn to build computing systems that take advantage of the spectrum of
“legacy” storage and memory technologies. I, for one, am sad to see it go, but happy that I won’t
miss it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Inspired by <a href="https://deno.com/" rel="nofollow">Deno</a> and built on top of <a href="https://github.com/rage-rb/iodine">Iodine</a>, this is a Ruby web framework that is based on the following design principles:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Rails compatible API</strong> - Rails' API is clean, straightforward, and simply makes sense. It was one of the reasons why Rails was so successful in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>High performance</strong> - some think performance is not a major metric for a framework, but it's not true. Poor performance is a risk, and in today's world, companies refuse to use risky technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>API-only</strong> - the only technology we should be using to create web UI is JavaScript. Using native technologies is always the most flexible, scalable, and simple solution in the long run. Check out <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" rel="nofollow">Vite</a> if you don't know where to start.</p>

During the call to <code>Net::HTTP.get</code>, the fiber is automatically paused, enabling the server to process other requests. Once the HTTP request is finished, the fiber will be resumed, potentially allowing to process hundreds of requests simultaneously.</p>
<p dir="auto">To make this controller work, we would also need to update <code>config/routes.rb</code>. In this case, the file would look the following way:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Rage.routes.draw do
  get &quot;page&quot;, to: &quot;pages#show&quot;
end"><pre><span>Rage</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span><span>.</span><span>draw</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>get</span> <span>"page"</span><span>,</span> <span>to</span>: <span>"pages#show"</span>
<span>end</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">ℹ️ <strong>Note</strong>: Rage will automatically pause a fiber and continue to process other fibers on HTTP, PostgreSQL, and MySQL calls. Calls to <code>Thread.join</code> and <code>Ractor.join</code> will also automatically pause the current fiber.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, <code>Fiber.await</code> can be used to run several requests in parallel:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="require &quot;net/http&quot;

<p>A radical theory that consistently unifies gravity and quantum mechanics while preserving Einstein's classical concept of spacetime has been announced in two papers published simultaneously by UCL (University College London) physicists.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Modern physics is founded upon two pillars: quantum theory on the one hand, which governs the smallest particles in the universe, and Einstein's theory of general relativity on the other, which explains <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravity/" rel="tag">gravity</a> through the bending of spacetime. But these two theories are in contradiction with each other and a reconciliation has remained elusive for over a century.
</p><p>The prevailing assumption has been that Einstein's theory of gravity must be modified, or "quantized," in order to fit within quantum theory. This is the approach of two leading candidates for a quantum theory of gravity, string theory and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/loop+quantum+gravity/" rel="tag">loop quantum gravity</a>.
</p><p>But a new theory, developed by Professor Jonathan Oppenheim (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy) and laid out in a paper in <i>Physical Review X,</i> challenges that consensus and takes an alternative approach by suggesting that spacetime may be classical—that is, not governed by quantum theory at all.
</p><p>Instead of modifying spacetime, the theory—dubbed a "postquantum theory of classical gravity"—modifies quantum theory and predicts an intrinsic breakdown in predictability that is mediated by spacetime itself. This results in random and violent fluctuations in spacetime that are larger than envisaged under quantum theory, rendering the apparent weight of objects unpredictable if measured precisely enough.
</p><p>A second paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43348-2">published</a> simultaneously in <i>Nature Communications </i>and led by Professor Oppenheim's former Ph.D. students, looks at some of the consequences of the theory, and proposes an experiment to test it: to measure a mass very precisely to see if its weight appears to fluctuate over time.
</p><p>For example, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France routinely weigh a 1kg mass which used to be the 1kg standard. If the fluctuations in measurements of this 1kg mass are smaller than required for mathematical consistency, the theory can be ruled out.
</p><p>The outcome of the experiment, or other evidence emerging that would confirm the quantum vs. classical nature of spacetime, is the subject of a 5000:1 odds bet between <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/oppenheim/pub/quantum_vs_classical_bet.pdf">Professor Oppenheim and Professor Carlo Rovelli and Dr. Geoff Penington</a>—leading proponents of quantum loop gravity and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/string+theory/" rel="tag">string theory</a> respectively.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>For the past five years, the UCL research group has been stress-testing the theory, and exploring its consequences.
</p><p>Professor Oppenheim said, "Quantum theory and Einstein's theory of general relativity are mathematically incompatible with each other, so it's important to understand how this contradiction is resolved. Should spacetime be quantized, or should we modify quantum theory, or is it something else entirely? Now that we have a consistent fundamental theory in which spacetime does not get quantized, it's anybody's guess."
</p><p>Co-author Zach Weller-Davies, who as a Ph.D. student at UCL helped develop the experimental proposal and made key contributions to the theory itself, said, "This discovery challenges our understanding of the fundamental nature of gravity but also offers avenues to probe its potential quantum nature.
</p><p>"We have shown that if spacetime doesn't have a quantum nature, then there must be random fluctuations in the curvature of spacetime which have a particular signature that can be verified experimentally.
</p><p>"In both quantum gravity and classical gravity, spacetime must be undergoing violent and random fluctuations all around us, but on a scale which we haven't yet been able to detect. But if spacetime is classical, the fluctuations have to be larger than a certain scale, and this scale can be determined by another experiment where we test how long we can put a heavy atom in superposition of being in two different locations."
</p><p>Co-authors Dr. Carlo Sparaciari and Dr. Barbara Šoda, whose analytical and numerical calculations helped guide the project, expressed hope that these experiments could determine whether the pursuit of a quantum theory of gravity is the right approach.

    </div>

<p>Dr. Šoda (formerly UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy, now at the Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics, Canada) said, "Because gravity is made manifest through the bending of space and time, we can think of the question in terms of whether the rate at which time flows has a quantum nature, or classical nature.
</p><p>"And testing this is almost as simple as testing whether the weight of a mass is constant, or appears to fluctuate in a particular way."
</p><p>Dr. Sparaciari (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy) said, "While the experimental concept is simple, the weighing of the object needs to be carried out with extreme precision.
</p><p>"But what I find exciting is that starting from very general assumptions, we can prove a clear relationship between two measurable quantities—the scale of the spacetime fluctuations, and how long objects like atoms or apples can be put in quantum superposition of two different locations. We can then determine these two quantities experimentally."
</p><p>Weller-Davies added, "A delicate interplay must exist if quantum particles such as atoms are able to bend classical spacetime. There must be a fundamental trade-off between the wave nature of atoms, and how large the random fluctuations in spacetime need to be."
</p><p>The proposal to test whether spacetime is classical by looking for random fluctuations in mass is complementary to another experimental proposal that aims to verify the quantum nature of spacetime by looking for something called "gravitationally mediated entanglement."
</p><p>Professor Sougato Bose (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy), who was not involved with the announcement today, but was among those to first propose the entanglement experiment, said, "Experiments to test the nature of spacetime will take a large-scale effort, but they're of huge importance from the perspective of understanding the fundamental laws of nature. I believe these experiments are within reach—these things are difficult to predict, but perhaps we'll know the answer within the next 20 years."
</p><p>The postquantum theory has implications beyond gravity. The infamous and problematic "measurement postulate" of quantum theory is not needed, since quantum superpositions necessarily localize through their interaction with classical <a href="https://phys.org/tags/spacetime/" rel="tag">spacetime</a>.
</p><p>The theory was motivated by Professor Oppenheim's attempt to resolve the black hole information problem. According to standard <a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+theory/" rel="tag">quantum theory</a>, an object going into a black hole should be radiated back out in some way as information cannot be destroyed, but this violates <a href="https://phys.org/tags/general+relativity/" rel="tag">general relativity</a>, which says you can never know about objects that cross the black hole's event horizon. The new <a href="https://phys.org/tags/theory/" rel="tag">theory</a> allows for information to be destroyed, due to a fundamental breakdown in predictability.

After a two-year delay and negotiations over its rollout, the company adopted a novel but cost-effective plan to bring ultrafast internet speeds to Kentucky’s largest city. This February, only 16 months after it turned on its service, Google Fiber announced plans to turn it off, making Louisville, one of only 19 cities to get Google Fiber since its launch in 2010, the first to lose it. Now, the most visible sign of the tech giant’s screw up is lying all over the roads.</p><p>“I literally just got done driving around, looking at streets with Google,” said Metro Councilman Brandon Coan. Strands of errant sealant are “everywhere,” he said outside a coffee shop in his district, one of a few where Google Fiber ran lines before its abrupt departure. “I’m confident that Google and the city are going to negotiate a deal … to restore the roads to as good a condition as they were when they got here. Frankly, I think they owe us more than that.”</p><p>The damage goes deeper than the roads. In Louisville, a minor league city with major league ambitions<strong>,</strong> Google Fiber left behind disappointed consumers, unfulfilled promises of transformative economic development, and a slew of embarrassing headlines for a city that allowed the tech giant to use it as a guinea pig.<br></p><p>But Google Fiber got something out of its time here. It learned that nanotrenching—the cost-saving process of burying fiber optic cables just two inches underground—was a bust. “We currently do not have plans that call for 2 inch trenches, our primary specifications are focused on going deeper,” a Google Fiber spokesperson said in an email.</p><p>“It is such a shame to think that we wouldn’t be having any of this conversation if they would have dug their little holes two inches deeper,” Coan said.</p><hr><p>In October 2017, when Google Fiber started signing up customers in three Louisville neighborhoods, the ISP was a year removed from a “pause” that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/26/technology/google-fiber-cuts/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/26/technology/google-fiber-cuts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saw its CEO resign and more than 100 employees laid off</a></span>. Turns out, disrupting the telecom industry is wildly expensive, full of intractable regulatory challenges, and opposed by powerful incumbent companies.<br></p><p>The plan in Louisville was to revive the effort with what some were calling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-fiber-2-0-targets-the-city-where-it-will-stage-its-comeback-as-at-t-fiber-prepares-to-go/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-fiber-2-0-targets-the-city-where-it-will-stage-its-comeback-as-at-t-fiber-prepares-to-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Fiber 2.0</a></span>. But first, the city had to agree to one major stipulation: Google Fiber wanted to see if it could scale a method for installing fiber cables that was easier to implement, and easier on the bottom line, than hanging lines from utility poles.</p><p>The company had buried fiber lines in other cities, but in Louisville it wanted to go shallower. Nanotrenching called for burying cables just two inches underground, rather than the typical six inches. The company also wanted to cover the trenches with epoxy, rather than the typical asphalt mix. In an email, a Google Fiber spokesperson said the company had “already performed limited trials of two-inch trenches in other markets, and believed it was a promising new method of deployment.” In Louisville, Google Fiber wanted to see if two-inch trenches would work at scale, an attempt that the spokesperson described as “ambitious” and a “lean into innovation.”</p><p>Local leaders were concerned. The city sent a team to other cities where a company spokesperson said<strong> </strong>“limited trials” with two-inch trenches had been conducted, and it sought the advice of outside experts.</p><p>“What [Google Fiber] told Louisville was that they didn’t think they could make their traditional construction work, but would we be open to letting them use a new construction technique,” said Grace Simrall, Louisville’s Chief of Civic Innovation and Technology. “There were lots of aspects that we asked a lot of questions about, trying to make them aware that we thought this might have challenges, but they, having done parts of Nashville and San Antonio this way, told us they felt confident they could make this work.”</p><p>After years of trying to woo Google—an effort that included <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2019/02/08/google-fiber-makes-louisville-pay-the-price-with-exit/2813479002/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2019/02/08/google-fiber-makes-louisville-pay-the-price-with-exit/2813479002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spending around $400,000 on legal fees</a></span> to defend an ultimately unused city ordinance that made it easier for Google Fiber to use utility poles—Louisville was in no position to say no.</p><p>Ted Smith, Simrall’s predecessor in City Hall, began working to make the city more “fiber friendly” in 2011 and credited three-term Mayor Greg Fischer, a Democrat, with recognizing that “mid-sized American cities were getting left behind.”<strong> </strong>(Disclosure: My wife is a Democratic State Representative from a part of Louisville that did not receive Google Fiber.)</p><p>“We worked very hard for many years to make the case that Louisville was a city that understands the value of cost-effective high-speed broadband,” he said.</p><p>It’s little surprise then that Louisville agreed to let Google futz around with its roads.

By March of 2018, just five months after Google Fiber launched its nanotrenching trial, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/news/belknap-neighborhood-residents-concerned-over-sloppy-installation-of-high-speed/article_4bc2a61e-8640-57f0-aba9-3dd4cb3d39e5.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/belknap-neighborhood-residents-concerned-over-sloppy-installation-of-high-speed/article_4bc2a61e-8640-57f0-aba9-3dd4cb3d39e5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the method began to fail</a></span>. Not only was the sealant spilling out onto roads, leaving fiber lines exposed, but the shallow trenches left cables vulnerable during routine road maintenance.</p><p>“If anyone understood road technology or tire technology, [they] would know it’s going to be a problem,” said Jim Hayes, president of the Fiber Optics Association and a decades-long veteran of the industry. <br></p><p>The problem, Hayes said, is that tires easily grabbed the epoxy and ripped it out of the ground. The shorter trench walls also left less asphalt for the sealant to adhere to. Typical microtrenching, a “well-accepted method of installing fiber,” involves burying cables at least six inches deep with a groove that’s no more than an inch wide, Hayes said. “I’ve never heard of any problems with microtrenching.”</p><p>Last summer Google Fiber pitched a solution to the problem it created. It would rip out the epoxy and fill in the trenches with asphalt. “It was like, ‘Oh, in retrospect, that seems like an obvious way to fill the hole in the road,’” Coan said.</p><p>“They bid out the work to replace the sealant with asphalt,” Simrall said. But before the work started, Google Fiber saw customers lose service when the process of repaving roads damaged fiber lines. “So they shifted their attention to addressing that,” she said.</p><p>Then, last month, Google Fiber threw up its hands and quit. The company wouldn’t say how many customers it had at that point, only that the number was “very small” compared to other Fiber cities. Last summer, the local Fox TV affiliate found that the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/sunday-edition-where-is-google-fiber-mostly-in-the-highlands/article_569112e0-421e-58ef-be24-c2e42e5e53d2.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/sunday-edition-where-is-google-fiber-mostly-in-the-highlands/article_569112e0-421e-58ef-be24-c2e42e5e53d2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had pulled permits to wire areas covering about 11,000 households</a></span>, but it’s not clear how many installations were completed.</p><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fiber.googleblog.com/2019/02/louisville_7.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fiber.googleblog.com/2019/02/louisville_7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a></span>, Google Fiber explained what happened. “[T]rialing” a “different type of construction method” in Louisville had failed, it said. Fixing it would be too expensive, so instead, it was skipping town, and taking the lessons learned elsewhere.</p><p>“This was not an easy decision for us,” a Google Fiber spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We came to Louisville because Google Fiber is working to change an entrenched industry and we saw a chance to bring great service to Louisville’s residents. Naturally there will be unexpected challenges when you do something ambitious, and at scale, for the first time and we underestimated some of those hurdles. We couldn’t be more appreciative of the partnership we’ve had with the City of Louisville, which embraced the need for competition in this industry as part of its larger initiatives around innovation and emerging technology.”</p><p>Simrall insists that Google Fiber was “very sincere in their belief they could make it work,” and had planned to use two-inch trenches in all other Google Fiber cities if it did. That’s little consolation to many Louisvillians, who watched one of the world’s richest companies sweep into town with major fanfare, rip up the roads to test an unproven technique, and peace out when it bombed.</p><p>“I was shocked. I was disappointed,” said Candace Jaworski, president of the Louisville Digital Association, a non-profit that pushes for innovation in Louisville and campaigned to bring Google Fiber here. Jaworski was looking forward to one day becoming a Google Fiber customer and seeing the change broadband could deliver to Portland, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/11/29/study-louisville-neighborhoods-among-poorest/94541828/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/11/29/study-louisville-neighborhoods-among-poorest/94541828/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the country’s poorest neighborhoods</a></span> and one of the first where Google Fiber was available.</p><p>“Google Fiber getting in and getting folks into the internet out in the West End was going to be huge with catching up that part of town with the rest,” Jaworski said. “Talk about dangling a carrot and not ever being able to get it.”</p><p>Ben Carter was lucky enough to get bite of that carrot. An attorney in the Highlands, Carter said Google Fiber provided wildly fast internet and “rock solid” customer service for the time he had it. When he got the news that Google Fiber was ending its operations in Louisville, he was disappointed, and not just because he would lose the blazing internet speed that he enjoyed primarily for its “Tim Allen, way-more-power-than-you-need” quality.</p><p>“It seemed like Louisville was batting above its weight a bit in terms of what cities were getting Google Fiber,” he said of the “coup” that the city pulled off in landing Google Fiber. “Louisville isn’t often on those lists.”</p><p>Now that Google Fiber is gone, Councilman Coan is worried that Louisville’s reputation will take a hit. “If you’re not paying attention, you’d say, ‘Oh, well. Louisville is just not a good enough city for Google Fiber.’ That’s not true.”</p><p>In the end, it may be that Google Fiber was not good enough for Louisville. Alphabet seems to be scaling back the ambitions of Google Fiber as wireless broadband technology advances and the limitations of fighting entrenched telecom giants become clear, said Matt Wood, the vice president of policy at broadband advocacy group Free Press. Its experimentation in Louisville is evidence enough that Google Fiber was looking for a new way forward. But like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18211177/alphabet-google-earnings-q4-2018-moonshot-other-bets-spending&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18211177/alphabet-google-earnings-q4-2018-moonshot-other-bets-spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so many of its “other bets”</a></span>—the heading under which Alphabet groups ambitious projects such as its life sciences play Verily, self-driving car company Waymo, and<strong> </strong>Access, the business unit that operates Google Fiber—the company seems to have lost this one.</p><p>That’s not to say Google Fiber isn’t responsible for major changes in broadband access.

<p>Farmland often harbors a multitude of pathogens which attack plants and reduce yields. A Swiss research team has now shown that inoculating the soil with mycorrhizal fungi can help maintain or even improve yields without using additional fertilizers or pesticides. In a large-scale field trial, plant yield increased by up to 40%.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides on fields reduces biodiversity and pollutes the environment. There is, therefore, great interest in finding sustainable ways to protect yields without using agricultural chemicals. One example of alternative biologicals is mycorrhizal fungi, which are beneficial organisms that help plants acquire nutrients.
</p><h2>Yields improved by up to 40%</h2>
<p>A team of researchers from the universities of Zurich and Basel, Agroscope, and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) has now shown for the first time on a large scale that applying mycorrhizal fungi in the field works. The fungi were mixed into the soil before sowing crops on 800 trial plots at 54 maize farms in northern and eastern Switzerland.
</p><p>"On a quarter of the plots, the mycorrhizal fungi enabled up to 40% better yields. That's huge," says the study's co-lead, Marcel van der Heijden, a soil ecologist at the University of Zurich and at Asgroscope. But there's a catch: on a third of the plots, the yield did not increase and sometimes even decreased. The research team was initially unable to explain why this happened.
</p><h2>Pathogens in the soil</h2>
<p>In their search for the cause, the researchers analyzed a variety of chemical, physical, and biological soil properties, including the biodiversity of soil microbes. "We discovered that the inoculation functioned best when there were lots of fungal pathogens already in the soil," says co-first author Stefanie Lutz from Agroscope, the federal center of competence for Agricultural Research.
</p><p>"The mycorrhizal fungi act as a kind of protective shield against pathogens in the soil that would weaken the plants." As a result, the normal yield can be maintained in fields where, without mycorrhizal fungi, there would have been losses. In contrast, mycorrhizal fungi had only a minor effect on fields that were not contaminated with pathogens.
</p><p>"The plants there are strong anyway and grow excellently. The use of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/mycorrhizal+fungi/" rel="tag">mycorrhizal fungi</a> in such cases brings no additional benefits," says the other first author, Natacha Bodenhausen from the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture.
</p><p>The aim of the study was to be able to predict the conditions under which mycorrhizal inoculation works.
</p><p>"With just a few soil indicators—mainly <a href="https://phys.org/tags/soil/" rel="tag">soil</a> fungi—we were able to predict the success of inoculation in nine out of 10 fields, and thus could also predict the harvest yield even before the field season," says the study's co-lead Klaus Schläppi of the University of Basel. "This predictability makes it possible to target the use of the fungi in fields where they will work. That's a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/crucial+element/" rel="tag">crucial element</a> for developing these technologies into a reliable agricultural method," says Schläppi.
</p><p>Further research is still required to find out the easiest way to spread the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/fungi/" rel="tag">fungi</a> over large areas. Nevertheless, "the results of this field trial represent a big step toward a more sustainable agriculture," concludes Marcel van der Heijden.
