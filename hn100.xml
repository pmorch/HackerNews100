<p dir="auto">This list was started on September 29, 2017 and was most recently updated in May 2023 to add information on sites that require you to click links sent via email or to receive an automated call and enter a four-digit number on your phone in order to complete an opt-out request.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please send corrections or updates to <a href="mailto:yael@yaelwrites.com">yael@yaelwrites.com</a>, or file a pull request. Screenshots in emails are incredibly helpful. I will add opt-outs where users can verify that the data broker has their information before providing it, and where removal is not limited to GDPR/CCPA/etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Disclaimers: Some of these opt-outs take a long time to go through. Sometimes, information is pulled from other sources and you’ll need to opt out multiple times for the same site. Data brokers come and go (and are bought out by others), and they also often change their opt-out pages. I try to update this ~every six months, but it’s not always current. Finally, even opting out of these sites doesn’t mean that your address is secure. In many states, real estate data and voter registration information is public (or easy to obtain). And, of course, location data can be found by physical means (e.g., following you home) and through other people who know it (i.e., social engineering). That said, removing your home address from data broker sites can significantly lower your attack surface and make it harder for people to find it. 💕</em></p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">☠ 📞 MyLife</h3>
<p dir="auto">Find your information here: <a href="https://www.mylife.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.mylife.com</a>.
Opt out using the following URL: <a href="https://www.mylife.com/ccpa/index.pubview" rel="nofollow">https://www.mylife.com/ccpa/index.pubview</a>. Although this is CCPA-focused, non-California folks have successfully removed their profiles. However, another option is to email your removal request to <a href="mailto:privacy@mylife.com">privacy@mylife.com</a> with your name and a link to your profile. MyLife will try to get you to create an account with a copy of your driver’s license to submit a profile removal request, and we’ve received reports that emailing the <a href="mailto:info@mylife.com">info@mylife.com</a> or <a href="mailto:removalrequests@mylife.com">removalrequests@mylife.com</a> email addresses will require a phone call to&nbsp;(888) 704-1900. Previously, calling that number and pressing 2 allowed you to be removed from MyLife (and Wink.com) after providing your name, age, date of birth, email address, current mailing address, and a previous mailing address, but this no longer appears to be the case. (It also appears that you can sign up for a free membership to remove your reputation profile, though not your personal information such as your home address.)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">NeighborReport</h3>
<p dir="auto">Search for your name, address or phone number at <a href="https://neighbor.report/" rel="nofollow">https://neighbor.report/</a>.

Enter the URL of the profile page you found and your email address here: <a href="https://nuwber.com/removal/link" rel="nofollow">https://nuwber.com/removal/link</a>. You will need to confirm your opt-out request by clicking on a link sent to you via email. Your profile will look like this "<a href="https://nuwber.com/person/563a151aa219445d5225ff38" rel="nofollow">https://nuwber.com/person/563a151aa219445d5225ff38</a>."

You can also mail your request to Persopo.com,

    <address>Alexander Petros</address>
    <p><time>August 19, 2023</time></p><p>A recurring question from some htmx contributors is why htmx isn’t written in TypeScript, or, for that matter, why htmx lacks any build step at all. The full htmx source is a single 3,500-line JavaScript file; if you want to contribute to htmx, you do so by modifying the <code>htmx.js</code> file, the same file that gets sent to browsers in production, give or take minification and compression.</p>
<p>I do not speak for the htmx project, but I have made a few nontrivial contributions to it, and have been a vocal advocate for retaining this no-build setup every time the issue has arisen. From my perspective, here’s why htmx does not have a build step.</p>
<h2 id="write-once-run-forever"><a href="#write-once-run-forever" aria-label="Anchor link for: write-once-run-forever">🔗</a>Write Once, Run Forever</h2>
<p>The best reason to write a library in plain JavaScript is that it lasts forever. This is arguably JavaScript’s single most underrated feature. While I’m sure there are some corner cases, JavaScript from 1999 that ran in Netscape Navigator will run unaltered, alongside modern code, in Google Chrome downloaded yesterday. That is true for very few programming environments. It’s certainly not true for Python, or Java, or C, which all have versioning mechanisms where opting for new language features will force you off of deprecated APIs.</p>
<p>Of course, most people’s experience with JavaScript is that it ages like milk. Reopen a node repository after 3 months and you’ll find that your project is mired in a flurry of security warnings, backwards-incompatible library “upgrades,” and a frontend framework whose cultural peak was the exact moment you started the project and is now widely considered tech debt. Who’s to blame for this situation is for someone else to decide, but, in any case, you can eliminate this entire problem class by not having any dependencies beyond the JavaScript runtime.</p>
<p>A popular way to write JavaScript today is compile it from TypeScript (which I will use frequently as an example, because TypeScript is probably the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning">best reason</a> to use a build system). TypeScript does not run natively in web browsers, so TypeScript code is not protected by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ECMA">ECMA’s</a> fanatical devotion to backwards compatibility. Like any dependency, new major TypeScript versions are not guaranteed to be backwards compatible with the previous ones. They might be! But if they aren’t, then you need to do maintenance if you want to use the modern development toolchain.</p>
<p>Maintenance is a cost paid for with labor, and open-source codebases are the projects that can least afford to pay it. Opting not to use a build step drastically minimizes the labor required to keep htmx up-to-date. This experience has been borne out by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a>, the predecessor to htmx which is maintained indefinitely with (as I understand) very little effort. When htmx 1.0 was released, TypeScript was at version 4.1; when intercooler.js was released, TypeScript was pre-1.0. Would code written in those TypeScript versions compile unmodified in today’s TypeScript compiler (version 5.1 at the time of writing)? Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>But htmx is written in JavaScript, with no dependencies, so it will run unmodified for as long as web browsers remain relevant. Let the browser vendors do the hard work for you.</p>
<h2 id="developer-experience"><a href="#developer-experience" aria-label="Anchor link for: developer-experience">🔗</a>Developer Experience</h2>
<p>It is true that the TypeScript developer experience (DX) is better than the JavaScript developer experience in many respects. It is not true that the TypeScript DX is better in <em>every</em> respect, and the tendency of software engineers to view progress as a teleology of capability rather than choices with tradeoffs sometimes blinds them to the cost paid for the DX aspects they like. For instance, a small tradeoff you make for using TypeScript is that compiling it takes time, and you have to wait for it to recompile to test a change. Usually this cost is negligible, and well worth paying, but it is nonetheless a cost.</p>
<p>A more significant cost for using TypeScript is that the code running in the browser is not the code you wrote, which makes the browser’s developer tools harder to use. When your TypeScript code throws an exception, you have to figure out how the stack trace (with its JavaScript line numbers, JavaScript function signatures, and so forth) maps to the TypeScript code that you wrote; when your JavaScript code throws an exception, you can click straight through to the source code, read the thing you wrote, and set a breakpoint in the debugger. This is <em>tremendous</em> DX. For many younger web developers who have never worked this way, it can be a revelatory experience.</p>
<p>Build step advocates point out that TypeScript can generate <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/debugger/how_to/use_a_source_map/index.html">source maps</a>, which tell your browser what TypeScript corresponds to what JavaScript, and that’s true! But now you have <em>another</em> thing to keep track of—the TypeScript you wrote, the JavaScript it generated, and the source map that connects these two. The hot-reloading development server you’re now dependent on will keep these up to date for you on localhost—but what about on your staging server? What about in production? Bugs that appear in these environments will be harder to track down, because you’ve lost a lot of information about where they come from. These are solvable problems, but they’re problems you created; they are a cost.</p>
<p>The htmx DX is very simple—your browser loads a single file, which in every environment is the exact same file you wrote. The tradeoffs required to maintain that experience are real, but they’re tradeoffs that make sense for this project.</p>
<h2 id="enforced-clarity"><a href="#enforced-clarity" aria-label="Anchor link for: enforced-clarity">🔗</a>Enforced Clarity</h2>
<p>Modularization is one of the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">honking great ideas</a> of software. Modules make it possible to solve incredibly complex problems by breaking down code into well-contained substructures that solve smaller problems. Modules are really useful.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you want to solve simple problems, or at least relatively simple problems. In those cases, it can be helpful <em>not</em> to use the building blocks of more complex software, lest you emulate their complexity without creating commensurate value. At its core, htmx solves a relatively simple problem: it adds a handful of attributes to HTML that make it easier to replace DOM elements using the declarative character of hypertext. Requiring that htmx remain in a single file (again, around 3,500 LOC) enforces a degree of intention on the library; there is a real pressure when working on the htmx source to justify the addition of new code, a pressure which maintains an equilibrium of relative simplicity.</p>
<p>While the DX costs are obvious, there are also surprising DX benefits. If you search a function name in the source file, you’ll instantly find every invocation of that function (this also mitigates the need for more-advanced code introspection). The lack of places for functionality to hide makes working on htmx a lot more approachable. Far, far more complex projects use aspects of this approach as well: SQLite3 compiles from a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">single-file source amalgamation</a> (though they use separate files for development, they’re not <em>crazy</em>) which makes hacking on it <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/10/28/sqlite-is-really-easy-to-compile/">significantly easier</a>. You could never build the linux kernel this way—but htmx is not the linux kernel.</p>
<h2 id="costs"><a href="#costs" aria-label="Anchor link for: costs">🔗</a>Costs</h2>
<p>Like any technology decision, choosing to forgo a build step has advantages and disadvantages. It’s important to acknowledge those tradeoffs so that you can make an informed decision, and revisit that decision if some of the benefits or costs no longer apply. With the advantages of writing plain JavaScript in mind, let’s consider some of the pain points it introduces.</p>
<h2 id="no-static-types"><a href="#no-static-types" aria-label="Anchor link for: no-static-types">🔗</a>No static types</h2>
<p>TypeScript is a strict superset of JavaScript, and some of the features it adds are very useful. TypeScript has… types, which make your <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-type-systems">IDE better at suggesting code</a> and pointing out where you might have used methods incorrectly. The tools for automatically renaming and refactoring code are much more reliable for TypeScript than they are for JavaScript. The htmx code does have to be written in JavaScript, though, because browsers run JavaScript. And <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations">as long as JavaScript is dynamically typed</a>, the tradeoffs required to get true static typing in the htmx source are not worth it (htmx <em>users</em> can still take advantage of typed APIs, declared with <code>.d.ts</code> files).</p>
<p>Future versions of htmx might use JSDoc to get some of the same guarantees without the build step. Other libraries, like <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8569">Svelte</a>, have been trending in this direction as well, in part due to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35892250">debugging friction</a> that TypeScript files introduce.</p>
<h2 id="no-es6"><a href="#no-es6" aria-label="Anchor link for: no-es6">🔗</a>No ES6</h2>
<p>Because htmx maintains support for Internet Explorer 11, and because it does not have a build step, every line of htmx has to be written in IE11-compatible JavaScript, which means no <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/">ES6</a>. When people like me say that JavaScript is pretty good now, they are usually referring to language features that were introduced with ES6, like <code>async/await</code>, anonymous functions, and functional array methods (i.e. <code>.map</code>, <code>.forEach</code>)—none of which can be used in the htmx source.</p>
<p>While this is incredibly annoying, in practice it is not a huge impediment. The lack of some nice language features doesn’t prevent you from writing code with functional paradigms. Would it be nice not to write a custom <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/b4a61c543b283eb2315a47708006783efb78f563/src/htmx.js#L375-L381">forEach method</a>? Of course. But until all the browsers targeted by htmx support ES6, it’s not hard to supplement ES5 with a few helper functions. If you are used to ES6, you will automatically write better ES5.</p>
<p>IE11 support is going to be dropped in htmx 2.0, at which point ES6 will be allowed in the source code.</p>
<h2 id="no-modules-in-core"><a href="#no-modules-in-core" aria-label="Anchor link for: no-modules-in-core">🔗</a>No modules in core</h2>
<p>This point is obvious, but it’s worth re-stating: the htmx source would be a lot tidier if it could be split it into modules. There are other factors that affect code quality <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.steveonstuff.com/2022/01/27/no-such-thing-as-clean-code">besides tidiness</a>, but to the extent that the htmx source is high-quality, it is not because it is tidy.</p>
<p>This makes doing certain things with htmx very difficult. The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph">idiomorph algorithm</a> might be included in the htmx 2.0 core, but it’s also maintained as a separate package so that people can use the DOM-morphing algorithm without using htmx. If the core could include multiple files, one could easily accomplish this with any number of mirroring schemes, such as git submodules. But the core is a single file, so the idiomorph code will have to live there as well.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts" aria-label="Anchor link for: final-thoughts">🔗</a>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This essay might be better titled “Why htmx Doesn’t Have a Build Step <em>Right Now</em>.” As previously mentioned, circumstances change and these tradeoffs can be revisited at any time! One issue we’re exploring at the moment has to do with releases. When htmx cuts releases, it uses a few different shell commands to populate the <code>dist</code> directory with minified and compressed versions of <code>htmx.js</code> (pedants are welcome to point out that this is obviously, in some sense, a build step). In the future, we might expand that script to auto-generate the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/umdjs/umd">Universal Module Definition</a>. Or we might have new distribution needs that require an even more involved setup. Who knows!</p>
<p>One of the core values of htmx is that it gives you <em>choice</em> in a web development ecosystem that has for the last decade been dominated by an increasingly complex JavaScript stack. Once you no longer have an enormous codebase of frontend JavaScript, there is far less pressure to adopt JavaScript on the backend. You can write backends in Python, Go, even NodeJS, and it doesn’t matter to htmx—every mainstream language has mature solutions for formatting HTML. This is the principle of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-on-whatever-youd-like/">Hypermedia On Whatever you’d Like (HOWL)</a>.</p>
<p>Writing JavaScript with no build process is one of the options available to you once you no longer require NextJS or SvelteKit to manage the spiraling complexity of SPA frameworks. That choice makes sense for htmx development today, and it may or may not make sense for your app too.</p>

<p>by guest blogger <a href="https://mccarthylg.com/attorneys/">Kieran McCarthy</a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rules-for-thee-29eb361473.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rules-for-thee-29eb361473-300x164.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="164" srcset="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rules-for-thee-29eb361473-300x164.jpg 300w, https://blog.ericgoldman.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rules-for-thee-29eb361473.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>There are few, if any, legal domains where hypocrisy is as baked into the ecosystem as it is with web scraping.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest companies on earth—including Meta and Microsoft—take aggressive, litigious approaches to prohibiting web scraping on their own properties, while taking liberal approaches to scraping data on other companies’ properties.</p>
<p>When we talk about web scraping, what we’re really talking about is data access. All the world’s knowledge is available for the taking on the Internet, and web scraping is how companies acquire it at scale. But the question of who can access and use that data, and for what purposes, is a tricky legal question, which gets trickier the deeper you dig.</p>
<p>Some forms of data are protected by copyright, trademark, or another cognizable forms of intellectual property. But most of the data on the Internet isn’t easily protectible as intellectual property by those who might have an incentive to protect it.</p>
<p>For example, the most aggressive companies in pursuing web-scraping litigation are the social media companies. LinkedIn and Facebook, most notably, have done as much as anyone to shape the law of web scraping. But the content that they’re trying to protect isn’t theirs—it belongs to their users. It’s user-generated content. And while their terms of use provide the social media companies a license to use that user-generated content, it is their users who typically have a copyright interest in their content. The social media companies have no cognizable property right to assert in this content/data.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, these companies view this data, generated by their users on their platforms, as <em>their</em> property. This is true even though the law does not recognize that they have a property interest in it, and even though they expressly disclaim any property rights in that data in their terms of use.</p>
<p>Since the law does not give them a cognizable property interest in this data, they must resort to other legal theories to prevent others from taking it and using it.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Internet, the primary legal theory that companies used to stop scrapers was something called trespass to chattels. This is why Eric—who has been covering this issue for a good while now—tags all scraping posts as “Trespass to Chattels.”</p>
<p>The idea behind this legal theory is that web scraping—often high-volume, unwanted data requests—are a form of trespass on private tangible property—computer servers. But the thing about trespass to chattels is that it requires both a trespass to private tangible property and an element of damages. In the early days of the Internet, when Internet connections sounded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0">like this</a>, it didn’t take a lot of extra traffic to damage someone’s server or the ability to provide a functioning website. Many web scrapers were clumsy and didn’t realize the impact of their additional requests on servers. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, web scraping often did burden or shut down websites.</p>
<p>But as technology improved, this legal theory stopped making as much sense. Server capacity improved by many orders of magnitude, and most scrapers became savvy enough to limit their requests in a way that became imperceptible or at least inconsequential to the host servers. Now, one of elements of the trespass to chattels legal claim—damage to the servers or other tangible property of the host, very rarely happens.</p>
<p>Next, from the early 2000s until 2017, the primary legal theory that was used to deter web scraping was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or the CFAA. The CFAA prohibits accessing a “protected computer” without authorization. In the context of web scraping, the question is whether, once a web scraper gets its authorization revoked (usually via cease-and-desist letter, but often in the form of various anti-bot protections), any further scraping and use of a website’s data is “without authorization” within the meaning of the CFAA.</p>
<p>From 2001 to 2017, the simplistic answer was yes, any form of revocation of authorization was typically sufficient to trigger CFAA liability, if the scraper continued to access the site without permission. And then, in 2017, the famous <em>hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp</em>. case came out, which affirmed a plaintiff web scraper’s right to access public LinkedIn data under the CFAA.&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding:</p>
<blockquote><p>We agree with the district court that giving companies like LinkedIn free rein to decide, on any basis, who can collect and use data—data that the companies do not own, that they otherwise make publicly available to viewers, and that the companies themselves collect and use—risks the possible creation of information monopolies that would disserve the public interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many interpreted this as allowing an affirmative right to scrape public data, <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2022/12/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-web-scraping-laws-guest-blog-post-part-2-of-2.htm">even if that was not the correct reading of the law and the reality was always more nuanced</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, it was a pyrrhic victory. <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2022/12/as-everyone-expected-years-ago-hiqs-cfaa-wins-dont-mean-it-can-freely-scrape-hiq-v-linkedin-guest-blog-post-part-1-of-2.htm">hiQ Labs lost that case, and at summary judgment the district court held that</a> “LinkedIn’s User Agreement unambiguously prohibits scraping and the unauthorized use of scraped data.” LinkedIn obtained a permanent injunction and damages against hiQ Labs on that basis.</p>
<p>Now, the primary vehicle to stop web scraping is with breach of contract claims.</p>
<p>For example, in just the last few weeks, Twitter/X Corp. has filed multiple lawsuits against web scrapers, <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/XCorpvBrightDataLtdDocketNo323cv03698NDCalJul262023CourtDocket?doc_id=X2RNFIJA37E8BIOJFN5G1P36COT">including against Bright Data</a>, which is perhaps the biggest web-scraping company in the world.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in web-scraping cases, you’d typically see plaintiffs in scraping cases file 10-15 legal claims, with law firms exploring any legal theory that might stick. Now, in its case against Bright Data, Twitter’s lawyers filed three claims: breach of contract, tortious interference with a contract, and unjust enrichment. Lawyers are increasingly confident that courts will enforce the breach of contract claim against scrapers and obtain the relief thy want. They don’t need or seek alternative legal theories.</p>
<p>And it is this legal reality—web scraping legal enforcement through breach of contract—that allows companies to assert property rights regarding how people use and access data—through the domain of contract law.</p>
<p>Mark Lemley observed this happening nearly 20 years ago, in his prescient, seminal article, “Terms of Use.”</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is that the shift from property law to contract law takes the job of defining the Web site owner’s rights out of the hands of the law and into the hands of the site owner. Property law may or may not prohibit a particular “intrusion” on a Web site, but it is the law that determines the answer to that question. The reason my “no-trespassing” sign is effective in the real world is not because there is any sort of agreement to abide by it, but because the law already protects my land against intrusion by another. If the sign read “no walking on the road outside my property,” no one would think of it as an enforceable agreement. If we make the conceptual leap to assuming that refusing to act in the way the site owner wants is also a breach of contract, it becomes the site owner rather than the law that determines what actions are forbidden. The law then enforces that private decision. [citations omitted]</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark Lemley, 2006 Minnesota Law Review, <a href="https://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Lemley_Final.pdf">Terms of Use</a> at 471.</p>
<p>With the breach-of-contract-as-property legal regime, host websites are free to define their rights in online data however they want, in the form of online terms of use agreements.</p>
<p>Rather than creating a new intellectual property regime with general rules for data use—or even simpler—deciding cases using existing intellectual property rules, courts have allowed host websites to create their own intellectual property rights in website data, through the mere act of declaring such data to be property through an online contract. Companies have almost complete liberty to declare data that is not entitled to intellectual property protection to be “proprietary,” and courts allow them to enforce this ad hoc intellectual property regime through breach of contract claims (as long as they aren’t so foolish as to do it in a way that is co-terminus with copyright protections).</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>And this is where the hypocrisy comes in: the breach-of-contract-as-property legal regime has no legal requirement for intellectual honesty or consistency. It has no requirement to respect others’ IP akin to trademarks or patents in the same way that you do your own. Companies are free to press their advantage on what is deemed “proprietary” on their sites while simultaneously asserting what is free for the taking on others. It is easy to criticize this, but this is what smart lawyers and legal teams do.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Let’s look at what Microsoft is doing right now, as an example.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, Microsoft updated its general terms of use to <a href="https://fagenwasanni.com/news/microsoft-adds-rules-and-restrictions-for-ai-offerings-in-terms-of-service/184341/">prohibit scraping, harvesting, or similar extraction methods of its AI services</a>.</p>
<p>Also in the couple of weeks, Microsoft affiliate OpenAI released a product called GPTbot, <a href="https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/08/10/openai-introduces-gptbot-a-web-crawler-designed-to-scrape-data-from-the-entire-internet-automatically/">which is designed to scrape the entire internet</a>.</p>
<p>And while they don’t admit this publicly, OpenAI has almost certainly already scraped the entire non-authwalled-Internet and used it is training data for GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, without any obvious hints of irony, OpenAI’s own <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use">terms of use prohibits scraping</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, Microsoft subsidiary <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahgwight_user-agreement-linkedin-activity-6994402330884386816-UAkW/">LinkedIn loudly and proudly declared victory in the most high-profile web-scraping litigation in US history</a>, imposing a permanent injunction on a former business rival to prevent it from scraping and accessing its private and public data forever. VP of Legal Sarah Wright declared, “The Court’s ruling helps us better protect everyone in our professional community from unauthorized use of profile data, and it establishes important precedent to stop this kind of abuse in the future.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I’m picking on Microsoft, as it is the most flagrant offender here. But I could pick on hundreds of others who are also hypocritical on this issue. Notably, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/02/meta_web_scraping/">Meta is also famously suing a company right now for scraping and selling its public content, even though Meta once paid the same scraper to scrape public data for them.</a></p>
<p>As I said at the start of this post, hypocrisy is endemic to this legal regime.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I, for one, don’t blame Microsoft or Meta or any of the other companies that take hypocritical stances on scraping. That’s what smart legal teams do when courts allow them to do it.</p>
<p>I blame the courts.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register.com_v._Verio">I blame the court in <em>Register.com v. Verio, Inc</em>. that paved the way for contracts of adhesion in the absence of assent</a>. I blame <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/01/19/southwests-bullshit-lawsuit-over-site-that-made-45-helping-people-book-cheaper-flights/">the Northern District of Texas for enabling Southwest Airlines</a> to sue anyone that publishes public information about their flights. I blame the court in the <em>hiQ Labs</em> case that <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2022/12/as-everyone-expected-years-ago-hiqs-cfaa-wins-dont-mean-it-can-freely-scrape-hiq-v-linkedin-guest-blog-post-part-1-of-2.htm">made no attempt to explain the disconnect or inconsistency on why hiQ Labs</a> was entitled to a preliminary injunction on its CFAA claim, but LinkedIn was entitled to a permanent injunction on its breach of contract claim on the exact same facts a few years later.</p>
<p>Courts need to realize that if you allow private companies to invent intellectual property rights through online contracts of adhesion, courts will be at the mercy of private decision-makers on questions that should be questions of public interest.</p>
<p>But given the fact that contracts, even online contracts, are a state-law issue, it’s hard to imagine a simple resolution to this problem. One possible solution might be a more all-encompassing interpretation of the copyright preemption doctrine, but the current law of copyright preemption is a muddled mess of a circuit split and <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/07/contractual-control-over-information-goods-after-ml-genius-v-google-guest-blog-post.htm">the Supreme Court just declined an opportunity to resolve it.</a></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>But regardless of what you and I think about this legal regime, that is the current state of the law.</p>
<p>The next testing ground for it will be <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/06/how-can-ai-models-legally-obtain-training-data-doe-1-v-github-guest-blog-post.htm">with these generative AI cases</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve long said we have not yet reached a stable equilibrium on these issues, because this kind of inconsistency in the law cannot be sustained. That means we are likely to see plenty of fireworks on these issues in the next few years.</p>

                						<h2>UBC device uses wood dust to trap up to 99.9 per cent of microplastics in water</h2>
<p>Could plants be the answer to the looming threat of microplastic pollution? Scientists at UBC’s <a href="https://bpi.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioProducts Institute</a> found that if you add tannins—natural plant compounds that make your mouth pucker if you bite into an unripe fruit—to a layer of wood dust, you can create a filter that traps virtually all microplastic particles present in water.</p>
<p>While the experiment remains a lab set-up at this stage, the team is convinced that the solution can be scaled up easily and inexpensively once they find the right industry partner.</p>
<p>Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic debris resulting from the breakdown of consumer products and industrial waste. Keeping them out of water supplies is a huge challenge, says Dr. Orlando Rojas, the institute’s scientific director and the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Forest Bioproducts.</p>
<div id="attachment_268794"><p><a href="http://news.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Orlando-Rojas-e1555452538923.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-268794" decoding="async" src="https://news.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Orlando-Rojas-e1555452538923-150x150.jpeg" alt="Dr. Orlando Rojas" width="150" height="150"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-268794">Dr. Orlando Rojas</p></div>
<p>He noted one study which <a href="https://orbmedia.org/the-invisibles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that virtually all tap water is contaminated by microplastics, and other research which <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(22)00372-3/fulltext#bib0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states</a> that more than 10 billion tons of mismanaged plastic waste will be dispersed in the environment by 2025.</p>
<p>“Most solutions proposed so far are costly or difficult to scale up. We’re proposing a solution that could potentially be scaled down for home use or scaled up for municipal treatment systems. Our filter, unlike plastic filters, does not contribute to further pollution as it uses renewable and biodegradable materials: tannic acids from plants, bark, wood and leaves, and wood sawdust—a forestry byproduct that is both widely available and renewable.”</p>
<h2><strong>Captures a wide variety of plastics</strong></h2>
<p>For their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202301531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, the team analyzed microparticles released from popular tea bags made of polypropylene. They found that their method (they’re calling it “bioCap”) trapped from 95.2 per cent to as much as 99.9 per cent of plastic particles in a column of water, depending on plastic type. When tested in mouse models, the process was proved to prevent the accumulation of microplastics in the organs.</p>
<p>Dr. Rojas, a professor in the departments of wood science, chemical and biological engineering, and chemistry at UBC, adds that it’s difficult to capture all the different kinds of microplastics in a solution, as they come in different sizes, shapes and electrical charges.</p>
<p>“There are microfibres from clothing, microbeads from cleansers and soaps, and foams and pellets from utensils, containers and packaging. By taking advantage of the different molecular interactions around tannic acids, our bioCap solution was able to remove virtually all of these different microplastic types.”</p>
<h2><strong>Collaborating on sustainable solutions</strong></h2>
<p>The UBC method was developed in collaboration with Dr. Junling Guo, a professor at the Center of Biomass Materials and Nanointerfaces at Sichuan University in China. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-mehling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marina Mehling</a> <em>(she/her),</em> a PhD student at UBC’s department of chemical and biological engineering, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianyu-guo-50a0371b3/?originalSubdomain=ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Tianyu Guo</a> <em>(she/her)</em>, a postdoctoral researcher at the BioProducts Institute, also contributed to the work.</p>
<p>“Microplastics pose a growing threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health, demanding innovative solutions. We’re thrilled that the BioProducts Institute’s multidisciplinary collaboration has brought us closer to a sustainable approach to combat the challenges posed by these plastic particles,” said Dr. Rojas.</p>

<p>We’ve noted repeatedly how the hyperventilation about TikTok privacy is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/forget-a-tiktok-ban-we-need-to-regulate-data-brokers-and-pass-a-real-privacy-law/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/forget-a-tiktok-ban-we-need-to-regulate-data-brokers-and-pass-a-real-privacy-law/">largely just a distraction</a> from the U.S.’ ongoing failure to pass even a basic privacy law or meaningfully regulate data brokers. </p>
<p>We haven’t done those things for two reasons. One, the dysfunctional status quo (where companies mindlessly over-collect data and fail to secure it, resulting in endless privacy scandals) is hugely profitable to everybody in the chain. Two, the government long ago realized it can abuse the barely regulated info-hoovering user tracking system we’ve built <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/16/fbi-latest-to-admit-to-bypassing-warrant-requirements-by-purchasing-location-info-from-data-brokers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/16/fbi-latest-to-admit-to-bypassing-warrant-requirements-by-purchasing-location-info-from-data-brokers/">to avoid having to get warrants</a>. </p>
<p>There’s simply no meaningful incentive for reform. </p>
<p>None of this is helped by the fact that an ad-based, wealth-obsessed tech press is financially incentivized to prioritize engagement clickbait (billionaire cage matches! Poorly-made blockchain-based ape art will change the world!), over nuance and deeper analysis. A media ecosystem owned by billionaires that seems to have an <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/08/cnet-insiders-say-tech-outlet-softened-coverage-to-please-advertisers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/08/cnet-insiders-say-tech-outlet-softened-coverage-to-please-advertisers/">ever-dwindling interest</a> in <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/06/gq-clowns-itself-weakens-story-critical-of-incompetent-discovery-ceo-david-zaslav/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/06/gq-clowns-itself-weakens-story-critical-of-incompetent-discovery-ceo-david-zaslav/">meaningfully challenging</a> money, power, or the status quo. </p>
<p>The result of our collective superficiality isn’t hard to find when looking at the tech knowledge of the broader public. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/08/17/what-americans-know-about-ai-cybersecurity-and-big-tech/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/08/17/what-americans-know-about-ai-cybersecurity-and-big-tech/">recent Pew survey of 5,101 U.S. adults</a> found that 80 percent of Americans know that Elon Musk now owns Tesla and Twitter, but <em>just 23 percent were aware that the United States lacks a meaningful privacy law</em> addressing how companies can use the data they collect:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="890" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C890&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C890&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C261&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C667&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-1.jpg?resize=600%2C521&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-1.jpg?w=1326&amp;ssl=1 1326w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>52 percent of the public wasn’t sure if we had a privacy law. At the same time, while 77 percent of the public knows that Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021, less than half (48 percent) of those surveyed know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two-factor authentication</a> is. And while 87 percent know that more complicated passwords are better, just 32 percent have a basic understanding of how “AI” (LLMs) function. </p>
<p>When the press covers consumer privacy, the fact that the U.S. government has proven too corrupt to pass even a <strong>basic</strong> internet-era privacy law rarely gets mentioned. The idea that the government has been lobbied into apathy on this subject for 30 years by a broad coalition of industries (opposed to anything but the most toothless oversight) rarely even warrants a mention in mainstream tech coverage. </p>
<p>While I’m sure a superficial, clickbait obsessed tech press isn’t the only culprit here (our <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/the-u-s-is-losing-its-competitive-advantage-3306225" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/the-u-s-is-losing-its-competitive-advantage-3306225">shaky education standards</a> surely play a role), I can’t imagine it helps much. As a tech reporter I’ve watched a long, long line of quality independent tech news outlets get dismantled in favor of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/08/cnet-insiders-say-tech-outlet-softened-coverage-to-please-advertisers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/08/cnet-insiders-say-tech-outlet-softened-coverage-to-please-advertisers/">superficial clickbait machines</a>, terrified of offending anyone in power, whose output is now being <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/07/ai-journalism-continues-to-be-a-lazy-error-prone-mess/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/07/ai-journalism-continues-to-be-a-lazy-error-prone-mess/">clumsily supercharged by “AI”</a>. </p>
<p>Tech journalism’s failure to accurately portray the sorry state of U.S. privacy was perfectly exemplified by coverage over the TikTok privacy scandals. Endless outlets parroted worries that a single app might share U.S. consumer data with the Chinese government; few if any could be bothered to note that same Chinese government can buy endless reams of consumer data from barely regulated data brokers. </p>
<p>As a broadband and telecom beat reporter in particular, I’ve similarly seen how when press outlets cover substandard broadband, the real underlying problem (consolidated monopoly power has lobbied a corrupt government into apathy) again rarely warrants a mention. It’s systemic, and until we dedicate some serious time toward creatively funding independent journalism, it’s simply not getting better. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Every few decades, major shifts happen that change how an industry fundamentally operates, and who the new winners and losers are. We are in the midst of one such shift in the digital advertising industry. This has been driven by three critical changes in the ecosystem, all privacy-related:</p><ul><li><p><span>Apple announced the </span><a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/privacy/ios-14-5-is-live-att-enforcement-begins-and-heres-how-we-got-here/" rel="">App Tracking Transparency framework</a><span> in 2021</span></p></li><li><p><span>Google is </span><a href="https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/#the-privacy-sandbox-timeline" rel="">deprecating third party cookies</a><span> in 2024</span></p></li><li><p><span>A slew of privacy legislation is either already in place (like the </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" rel="">California Privacy Rights Act</a><span>, </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" rel="">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a><span>) or is about to be in place (like the </span><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package" rel="">EU Digital Services Act</a><span>)</span></p></li></ul><p><span>While the effects of these changes have been felt by the advertising industry globally, the </span><strong>EU in particular has been at war with behavioral advertising</strong><span> for a few years now. </span><strong>And winning</strong><span>. In the past three weeks, there have been significant announcements from </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/meta-says-yes-to-consent/" rel="">Meta</a><span>, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/snapchat-dsa-compliance/" rel="">Snap</a><span> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/tiktok-algorithm-dsa/" rel="">TikTok</a><span> about upcoming changes to their products in the EU. It’s probably fair to say these changes mark the end of an era for behavioral advertising in the EU, and the platforms have made peace with that.</span></p><p>In this piece, we’ll dive into:</p><ul><li><p>How the advertising ecosystem runs (or used to run)</p></li><li><p>Privacy interventions and impact on behavioral advertising</p></li><li><p>EU’s war on behavioral advertising and why platforms are conceding</p></li><li><p>Possible future paths</p></li></ul><p>Let’s start with some simple concepts. An ad shown to you can be contextual or behavioral (sometimes both).</p><p><span>A </span><strong>contextual ad</strong><span> is something that is shown alongside organic results (non-ads) in the context of whatever you are doing. For example, if you are on a food delivery app like DoorDash and you see an ad for a restaurant alongside organic results, that is a contextual ad. In that case, your identity doesn’t really matter. DoorDash knows your location and what you’re looking for, and therefore shows you a relevant ad. Knowing your identity and interests does help improve relevance of these ads but it’s secondary to the context itself.</span></p><p><span>A </span><strong>behavioral ad</strong><span> is something that’s shown to you because of your past behavior. For example, you might have visited an office chair brand’s page on Instagram and therefore you get served ads for another office chair brand; that’s exactly what happened to me with the ad on the right. This can either be based on direct behavior (like the office chair example), or inferred behavior - people like you that looked for chairs also looked for monitors. One step further, people that looked at chairs are also likely to work from home more and therefore open to a lunch service. All of those are potential ads that can be shown to you.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png" width="452" height="391.8141197497766" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:970,&quot;width&quot;:1119,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:452,&quot;bytes&quot;:1169040,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Contextual ad on DoorDash (left) vs Behavioral ad on Instagram Stories (right)&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Contextual ad on DoorDash (left) vs Behavioral ad on Instagram Stories (right)" title="Contextual ad on DoorDash (left) vs Behavioral ad on Instagram Stories (right)" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6f5b81-3bce-456f-8bae-5894b75c6ca1_1119x970.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Contextual ad on DoorDash (left) vs Behavioral ad on Instagram Stories (right)</figcaption></figure></div><p>A subset of products, most often search products, are perfect for contextual ads - Google Maps, Google Search, DoorDash, Yelp, Thumbtack, TripAdvisor, Zocdoc to name a few. The user has high intent to do something specific. However, most high intent products are low-medium frequency. You are not looking for plumbers every day on Thumbtack and you are not looking to order food delivery every hour of the day on DoorDash, and therefore the amount of contextual ad inventory is lower - highly effectively but lower in volume.</p><p>On the other hand, social media platforms where users spend hours doomscrolling have a large volume of non-contextual inventory. Random ads are annoying and ineffective, and therefore the most effective way to monetize this inventory is through behavioral ads.</p><p><span>Unsurprisingly, </span><strong>behavioral ads require a lot of data, and specifically data about you</strong><span>. Before ~2018 (when EU’s GDPR kicked in), there was essentially </span><strong>free flow of data</strong><span> about you, collected through a long list of highly effective AdTech mechanisms. Some notable examples:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Every iOS or Android phone had a unique “</span><a href="https://kb.narrative.io/mobile-advertising-ids" rel="">mobile advertising ID</a><span>” assigned to it (and by association, to you). This ID was accessible to all apps on your device, i.e. your Uber app and your Google Maps app both knew you are mobile advertising ID 123, and could easily cross-identify you across apps.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Most browsers (except Safari and Firefox) supported “</span><a href="https://cookie-script.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-third-party-cookies.html" rel="">third party cookies</a><span>”, which is essentially a piece of data that one site could place on your browser and another site could access. There would be a “cookie ID” associated with you and you could be easily cross-identified across websites.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Note that </span><strong>these identifiers, for all practical purposes, were permanent</strong><span>. You could go deep inside your settings and reset these IDs but most people never do that. This resulted in a couple of second order effects:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Companies that are “</span><strong>data brokers</strong><span>” started purchasing data from several different data providers and </span><strong>building “profiles” about you</strong><span>; for example, app 1 could tell the broker that you bought an expensive piece of furniture, website 2 could tell them you have an account with a high end bank, and the data broker could put that together and categorize you as “high propensity of spend” person; note that when I say “you”, that refers to your identifiers (mobile advertising ID or third party cookie ID)</span></p><ul><li><p>As more and more data became available, the profiles had more fidelity to them and identification became more sophisticated; for example, if app 1 had your mobile advertising ID and website 2 had your Chrome third party cookie ID, a data broker or an ad platform could compare your your IP addresses and know it is the same person.</p></li><li><p>Take this one step further. A data broker could also use a third data source and find an email associated with your IDs. One more step further, they could buy your address from a utility or telecom company and find your address.</p></li><li><p><span>This might sound far-fetched but it’s not - </span><a href="https://www.onaudience.com/resources/how-to-choose-a-device-graph-vendor/#:~:text=A%20device%20graph%20(a.k.a.%20identity,also%20an%20iPhone%20and%20iPad." rel="">device graphs</a><span> are a very commonly used data product in the AdTech stack today, and telecom companies are </span><a href="https://cybernews.com/privacy/us-telecom-companies-selling-users-data/#:~:text=Telecom%20companies%20actually%20have%20the,without%20any%20court%20order%20instantly." rel="">notorious for selling your data</a><span>. If you need a more entertaining take, check out </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqn3gR1WTcA" rel="">John Oliver’s episode on data brokers</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Attribution / measurement of advertising campaigns became more and more precise</strong><span>; through a combination of technical mechanisms, an advertiser could say you first saw an ad on Facebook, then an ad on Google Search, then a display ad on NYTimes, and eventually bought an item from their website, so each of those three advertising platforms get shared credit</span></p></li></ul><p>While this sounds privacy invasive (and it is), this resulted in a highly efficient advertising ecosystem. Advertisers knew exactly which users they were targeting and since they had all these extra behavioral signals to know how likely a user was to engage, they were willing to pay higher cost per impressions (CPM) for ad inventory, thereby generating more revenue for a media publisher. Precise attribution / measurement turbo charged this further.</p><p><span>However, you can see how this was </span><strong>becoming the wild west - highly effective advertising no doubt but also an uncontrolled orgy of data acquired with non-existent or questionable user consent</strong><span>. This rightfully raised concerns about data consolidation in the hands of both data brokers and large technology companies, and an intervention was inevitable. It was less a matter of if and more a matter of when.</span></p><p>Let’s dive into each of the three privacy interventions that arose in an attempt to tame the wild west.</p><p><span>First, Apple introduced the </span><a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/privacy/ios-14-5-is-live-att-enforcement-begins-and-heres-how-we-got-here/" rel="">App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework</a><span>. It sounds jargon-y but the change is relatively simple. Prior to ATT, every app by default had access to your advertising ID, i.e. it was opt-in by default. This meant you could easily be tracked across apps, and therefore shown effective behavioral ads. For example, you installed the Strava app to track your runs, you are now on Facebook, and you are shown an ad for Strava Premium. After ATT, the access to this </span><strong>identifier became opt-out by default</strong><span>, i.e. an app had to show you a pretty aggressive prompt to get access to your identifier and you explicitly needed to say yes. The average opt-in rate ended up close to </span><a href="https://www.adjust.com/blog/app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-rates/" rel="">~34%</a><span> (with a lot of caveats).</span></p><p><span>We won’t go into much detail here but this prompt was launched by Apple in the guise of embracing privacy - a smart chess move. The consensus opinion today is that this was an opportunistic move from Apple, which no doubt improves privacy but also heavily hurts Apple’s competitors as they </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddoty/2023/02/08/apple-the-story-behind-its-new-ad-offerings-to-retailers-restaurants-hotels-other-location-based-businesses/?sh=69dd5a994701" rel="">prop up their own ads business</a><span>. The impact  was that user identity was available much less often.</span></p><p><span>Note here that for behavioral advertising to happen in the Strava-Facebook example, there is not one but two apps that needs to have received opt-in from you, i.e. the addressable market does not drop to 34%, it drops to 34% * 34% = ~12%. Therefore, </span><strong>cross-app behavioral advertising on iOS is no longer effective at scale</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Second, Google announced that they will </span><a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/" rel="">deprecate third-party cookies in 2024</a><span>. The consensus opinion is that the change helps Google achieve a dual purpose: appease regulators who are breathing down their neck for </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies" rel="">potential anti-trust behavior in AdTech</a><span>, while taking control back from what’s now a </span><a href="https://www.sovrn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ProgramaticBuyingEcosystem_transparent-1024x791.png" rel="">fairly bloated advertising tech stack</a><span>. Google’s </span><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/fledge/" rel="">new mechanisms</a><span> post third-party cookies will still allow cross-site retargeting but in a more private way where all information is stored on-device within the browser, i.e. there are no more cross-site “cookie IDs” assigned to you. While the new mechanism preserves some of the status quo, </span><strong>cross-site behavioral advertising is</strong><span> </span><strong>going to have much less fidelity and therefore effectiveness</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Which brings us to the third intervention - </span><strong>privacy regulations</strong><span>. The most aggressive of these is EU’s GDPR, which went into effect in 2018. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) went into effect in 2020. While the progression has been gradual, the reason these laws matter for advertising companies today more that ever is because the laws take aim at the </span><strong>only remaining and mission critical advertising mechanism</strong><span> -</span><strong> behavioral advertising within companies’ own apps</strong><span> (i.e. you do a bunch of different things inside the Facebook app and Facebook gets to use that data to show you behavioral ads within the app).</span></p><p><span>A primary feature that makes the California laws (arguably the strictest privacy law in the US) less aggressive than EU’s GDPR is that it </span><strong>does not require explicit opt-ins and only requires platforms to provide opt-outs</strong><span>. For example, the 2020 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires companies that are considered “data sellers” under the law to provide explicit opt-outs on web pages, but the </span><strong>default is still opt-in</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>EU’s GDPR takes this up another notch and requires </span><strong>explicit opt-in / consent </strong><span>for behavioral advertising. This consent needs to be </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-consent-requirements/#:~:text=Article%204(11)%20defines%20consent,relating%20to%20him%20or%20her." rel="">freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous</a><span>. For example, Meta cannot gate content behind a behavioral advertising consent prompt.</span></p><p>So, the simplistic inference from this is that Meta needs to get explicit consent for all behavioral understanding, including the last remaining mechanism - showing ads within their own platform. If Meta is forced to do this, the opt in will likely be small (the Apple opt in rates were ~34%) and this majorly shrinks Meta’s addressable advertising market in the EU.</p><p>To not meet that fate, Meta made a creative legal argument:</p><ul><li><p><span>GDPR requires any company to have one of </span><strong><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/" rel="">six legal bases</a><span> </span></strong><span>if the company needs to process personal data. Paraphrasing, these are - consent, necessity to fulfill a contract, necessity for legal compliance, necessity to protect vital interests of the user, necessity to perform a public interest task, and necessity for legitimate interests pursued by the company</span></p></li><li><p><span>Of these six, Meta held the stance that they were processing personal data using “</span><strong>legitimate interests” (the last of the six) as the legal basis, and therefore  does not need to show an explicit opt-in prompt</strong></p></li></ul><p><span>Last month, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/norway-meta-ads-ban/" rel="">provided their enforcement decision</a><span> that </span><strong>Meta’s use of “legitimate interests” as the legal basis is not valid</strong><span>. Paraphrasing the </span><a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/contentassets/36ad4a92100943439df9a8a3a7015c19/urgent-and-provisional-measures--meta_redacted.pdf" rel="">enforcement decision</a><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Based on several past court rulings, Meta must prove that legitimate interest “cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects”</p></li><li><p>Based on another past court ruling, despite the face that Meta provides a free service, the user of that network cannot reasonably expect that the operator of the social network will process that user’s personal data, without his or her consent, for the purposes of personalized advertising</p></li></ul><p><span>Four days after the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s ruling, Meta </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/how-meta-uses-legal-bases-for-processing-ads-in-the-eu/" rel="">announced</a><span> that they will be changing their legal basis from “legitimate interests” to “consent”. In practice, what this means is that </span><strong>Meta is conceding that behavioral advertising within their own app in the EU can no longer be opt-in by default</strong><span>. While Apple’s changes significantly cut down the ability to advertise cross-app, Meta was holding on to hope that it would be able to preserve all in-app behavioral advertising (including in the EU), and the writing is now on the wall. </span><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/snapchat-dsa-compliance/" rel="">Snap</a><span>, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/tiktok-algorithm-dsa/" rel="">TikTok</a><span> followed suit</span></strong><span> shortly after with their own announcements that non-personalized versions of their products will soon be available to users. A total of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/europe-names-19-platforms-that-must-report-algorithmic-risks-under-dsa/" rel="">19 platforms that are in scope</a><span> are likely to follow suit.</span></p><p>It is still to be seen what percent of users opt into behavioral advertising. If the Apple opt-in rates are any indication, it may get to the ~34% rate seen there but it may also go higher if platforms are allowed to be creative about opt-in language and user interfaces.</p><p>It is hard to say what exactly the long-term effects of ending the opt-in-by-default regime for behavioral advertising in the EU will be, but here are some educated guesses:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Explicit preferences instead of inferred interests</strong><span> - Meta has made </span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-provides-insight-evolving-feed-algorithms-ai/654367/" rel="">some progress</a><span> towards letting users provide inputs to the feed algorithm. I would expect the creation of more explicit preferences / interests that users explicitly select. While it has worked to a smaller extent for some products like </span><a href="https://searchengineland.com/reddit-interest-targeting-categories-ads-431085" rel="">Reddit</a><span>, it is likely that the quality of content provided by just preferences will be nowhere close to the relevance of a system that is constantly ingesting data and inferring interests.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Non-personalized feeds</strong><span>: TikTok has announced that they will create a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/tiktok-algorithm-dsa/" rel="">non-personalized feed</a><span> that is based on what’s popular in your region. Most social feed-based platforms will also (re)introduce simplistic ranking options like chronological. I am not bullish any of these will create an engaging user experience.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Degraded user experience, leading to more opt-in</strong><span>: My (potentially contentious) take is that opted out users will see a significantly degraded experience and eventually decide to provide platforms consent to personalize. The platforms will likely use this mechanism to receive content for all personalization (including behavioral advertising) - it’s unclear if there are any regulatory constraints that force them to not bundle consent for user experience personalization and behavioral advertising. I don’t expect the consent rate to go anywhere close to status quo but I think it will be a meaningful bump to what’s seen with Apple’s opt in rates.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Experiments with subscriptions</strong><span>: Twitter launched Twitter Verified a few months back, and Meta is </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/testing-meta-verified-to-help-creators/" rel="">experimenting</a><span> with a similar concept. I am not bullish that a majority (or even a minority) of users will be willing to pay for social media products after years of being conditioned to getting these products for free.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>De-prioritization of EU markets: </strong><span>If platforms are not able to effectively monetize the EU market, it is likely that they will start de-prioritizing investments for the EU market, which is a real risk of an aggressive regulatory regime. I don’t expect them to stop supporting EU markets but every new feature built is an investment, and companies will start heavily questioning if they are willing to do any extra work for this market. For example, if there’s additional work to make a feature comply with GDPR, that might not be worth it anymore. We have seen other equivalent situations of this - several apps have a much better experience on iOS than Android because iOS apps monetize better.</span></p></li></ul><p>The advertising market exploded over the last several decades due to availability of essentially infinite user data, which brought both large efficiencies in advertising and major privacy risks. Regulation was necessary. Great regulation is about finding the balance between promoting innovation / letting new businesses emerge that move society forward, and having guardrails so people are protected. Did the EU go too far? I personally think they did, and if that is true, the effects will start showing in a 5-10 year horizon and course correction will follow. </p><p>Until then, this is the new reality of behavioral advertising in the EU. The regulators and legislators came all guns blazing, and they won.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2>OpenTF Announces Fork of Terraform</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Posted on: <time datetime="2023-08-25">August 25, 2023</time></p>
          <p> 
            Two weeks ago, HashiCorp announced they are changing the license to all their core products, including Terraform, to the Business Source License (BSL). In an attempt to keep Terraform open source, we published the <a href="https://opentf.org/">OpenTF manifesto</a>, and the community response was huge! Over 100 companies, 10 projects, and 400 individuals pledged their time and resources to keep Terraform open-source. The <a href="https://github.com/opentffoundation/manifesto">GitHub repository</a> for the manifesto already has over 2.5k stars, and the number is growing quickly!
          </p>
          <p>
            The manifesto outlined the intent of the OpenTF initiative in two steps — the first was to appeal to HashiCorp to return Terraform to the community and revert the license change they were making for this project. The second, in case the license was not reverted, was to fork the Terraform project as OpenTF.
          </p>
          <h4>The time is now!</h4>
          <p>
            Since no reversal has been done, and no intent to do one has been communicated, we’re proud to announce that <b>we have created a fork of Terraform called OpenTF</b>. Many engineers across a number of companies, sometimes even competing companies, have been working together over the last week to make this possible. It’s been an incredible experience, really!
          </p>
          <p>
            As outlined in our manifesto, we are keeping OpenTF:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Truly open source</b> - under a well-known and widely-accepted license that companies can trust, that won't suddenly change in the future
            </li>
            <li><b>Community-driven</b> - so that the community governs the project for the community, where pull requests are regularly reviewed and accepted on their merit and changes are proposed through a public RFC process
            </li>
            <li><b>Impartial</b> - so that valuable features and fixes are accepted based on their value to the community, regardless of their impact on any particular vendor
            </li>
            <li><b>Layered and modular</b> -  with a programmer-friendly project structure to encourage building on top, enabling a new vibrant ecosystem of tools and integrations</li>
            <li><b>Backwards-compatible</b> - so that the existing code can drive value for years to come</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Becoming part of a foundation</h4>
          <p>
            <b>We completed all documents required for OpenTF to become part of the Linux Foundation</b> with the end goal of having <b>OpenTF as part of Cloud Native Computing Foundation</b>. By making a foundation responsible for the project, we will ensure the tool stays truly open-source and vendor-neutral.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Terraform wasn’t open-source from the beginning, many of the tools that you are using right now for your Terraform workflows simply wouldn’t exist, thus, we believe the future for Terraform is OpenTF, developed fully in the open.
          </p>
          <h4>Roadmap</h4>
          
          <p>
            As previously outlined, we’ve been working on this fork for a number of days already, with over 10 engineers across multiple companies working on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>In short, here’s the current status</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Almost done with the repository-wide rename to OpenTF</li>
            <li>Selected initial steering committee members</li>
            <li>Performed initial adjustments and cleanup of community documents.</li>
            <li>Got CI/CD pipelines and multiple testing harnesses of end-to-end and snapshot tests to work and be green, to make sure that we stay backwards-compatible.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Expect the repository to be published very soon</b>, once we’re officially part of a foundation and have some basic community guardrails and processes in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>You might wonder why we already started work on this project so early?</b> It’s quite simple, really. If HashiCorp were to reverse their decision, worst case we’d just lose a week of work. But if, and that is what indeed happened, HashiCorp wasn’t to reverse their decision, we didn’t want to lose any time, so that <b>we could have a working OpenTF 1.6.0 release ready for you as soon as possible</b>. And that’s why we started work on this over a week ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the spirit of being as open as possible, <b>we’ve created a</b> <a href="https://github.com/opentffoundation/roadmap/milestones">public repository tracking our progress towards important milestones.</a> You can subscribe to the issues there to be notified as soon as the fork is public. If you have any questions, feel free to create additional issues on that repository - we’ll try to respond as quickly as possible.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>
          <b>When will I be able to see the fork?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re planning to publish the fork in the next 1-2 weeks. That doesn’t mean there will be a release by then, but the repository will be open. Releases (alpha and stable) should follow shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Will I be able to use OpenTF as a drop-in replacement for legacy Terraform?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Will OpenTF work with all the providers and modules Terraform works with?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What will be the first release of OpenTF?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first release will be 1.6.0-alpha, forked from the most recent commit that was still MPL-licensed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Who is maintaining OpenTF? Is there enough firepower behind the project?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, four companies pledged the equivalent of 14 full-time engineers (FTEs) to the OpenTF initiative. We expect this number to at least double in the following few weeks. To give you some perspective, Terraform was effectively maintained by about 5 FTEs from HashiCorp in the last 2 years. If you don’t believe us, look at their repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How can I contribute to OpenTF?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’d like to pledge resources as a company, please get in touch via email or PR on the manifesto repository. Otherwise, the best way to contribute right now is to spread the word! Once the repository is public and we have a contribution process in place, you’ll be able to do code contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Does OpenTF have a public roadmap? Can I affect it?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find current public roadmap on this <a href="https://github.com/opentffoundation/roadmap/milestones">GitHub repository</a>. We will put an RFC process in place for you to be able to contribute to the roadmap as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Will OpenTF be compatible with future Terraform releases?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenTF will be 100% interoperable with future Terraform releases until the community wishes otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Can OpenTF change its licensing model in the future?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once OpenTF becomes part of the foundation, it’s governed by the foundation and the project community. Its licensing model cannot change.

              <p>Instagram limited the reach of a <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-ads-illegal-content-drugs-guns-hackers/">404 Media investigation</a> into ads for drugs, guns, counterfeit money, hacked credit cards, and other illegal content on the platform within hours of us posting it. Instagram said it did this because the content, which was about Instagram’s content it failed to moderate on its own platform, didn’t follow its “<a href="https://help.instagram.com/313829416281232?ref=404media.co">Recommendation Guidelines</a>.” Later that evening, while that post was being throttled, I got an ad for “MDMA,” and Meta’s ad library is still full of illegal content that can be found within seconds.</p><p>This means Meta continues to take money from people blatantly advertising drugs on the platform while limiting the reach of reporting about that content moderation failure. Instagram's Recommendation Guidelines limit the reach of posts that "promotes the use of certain regulated products such as tobacco or vaping products, adult products and services, or pharmaceutical drugs."</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/Screenshot_20230823-170129--1--1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="2340" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/Screenshot_20230823-170129--1--1.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/Screenshot_20230823-170129--1--1.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/Screenshot_20230823-170129--1--1.png 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Meta reversed its decision <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwS47_OOeIg/?img_index=1&amp;ref=404media.co">on 404 Media’s post</a> after we appealed it and deleted the words “guns, meth, pills, and weapons” from our caption, which was describing the types of content that Instagram is taking money for and injecting into users’ feeds. </p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1232" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png 1600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w2400/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A screengrab of the post.

Moderation of that seems a little less developed. In theory, these integrity teams should be feeding into the same systems. Ads should theoretically be going through a review process … a lot of these things are something that just should be getting caught [at the review process.]”</p><p>Meta did not respond to a request for comment. At the time of this writing, there are thousands of ads on Instagram and Facebook that link to Telegram channels and groups. Many of the most recent ones are for groups selling acid, MDMA, and hacked credit cards.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>There have been a lot of <i>Wipeout</i> games released since the 1995 original, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/09/when-graphics-matter-the-case-for-wipeout-hd/"><i>Wipeout HD</i></a> and the <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/playstation-experience-2016-in-photos-and-games-psx-marks-the-spot/2/">Omega Collection</a></i>, but only the original has the distinction of having <a href="https://twitter.com/forestillusion/status/1508048268176990209">its Windows port source code leaked</a> by (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/forest-of-illusion-game-preservation-shut-down-six-years/">since defunct</a>) archive Forest of Illusion.</p>
<p>Dominic Szablewski grabbed that code before it disappeared and set about creating a version that’s not just a port. He rewrote the game’s rendering, physics, sound, and generally “everything everywhere.” He <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2023/08/rewriting-wipeout">documented the project</a>, put <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/wipeout-rewrite">his code on GitHub</a>, and has some version of a justification. “So let's just pretend that the leak was intentional, a <b>rewrite</b> of the source falls under fair use and the whole thing is abandonware anyway,” Szablewski writes.</p>
<p>Most of the code seemed to come from <i>Wipeout ATI 3D Rage Edition</i>,&nbsp;a “lackluster port for Windows” that was bundled with ATI GPUs, Szablewski wrote. It is a mess. There are fragments of code versions from DOS, PlayStation, Windows 95, and Windows 98, with lots of things shakily patched in, including some kludgey 25-to-30 frames-per-second physics calculations in moving from European PAL to North American NTSC. The result was bad geometry, sluggish performance, and even goofed text rendering.</p>
<p>Not that he doesn’t have sympathy. “The code may not be pretty, but the result justifies it all,” he wrote. The PSX launch title braved unseen hardware and 3D models and physics and holds up today. But this pack-in version “is some caffeine-induced nightmare code written under immense time pressure. The 5000 lines of <code>if else</code> that handles the menu state is a striking witness to this insanity.”</p>

<p>As he digs into the specifics of his work, Szablewski takes the reader on a tour of PSX dev kits and how they handled Z-levels, how to translate yesterday’s triangles to today’s OpenGL, breaking the 30 FPS cap on a game that explicitly forbade that, and more. He takes the code from 40,699 lines to 7,731 and notably loved an excuse to work in C. “I had an absolute blast cleaning up this mess!”</p>
<p>Szablewski’s <i>Wipeout</i> rewrite can be compiled for Windows, Linux, Mac, and WASM (Web Assembly). You can even play it <a href="http://phoboslab.org/wipegame/">in your browser on his server</a> (please be gentle). I spent some time in it this morning, and let me tell you: I am not ready for anti-gravity racing in the year 2052. It was a struggle to even get to fourth place, but those struggles were due entirely to skill, not system. The web version feels buttery smooth, even when you’re continually clunking into walls. I had misremembered this game as having a lot more to it, but it’s all feel: the trance/prog music, the physics, the controls, and the sense that you’re always just slightly out of control.</p>
<p>What about Sony and their legions of lawyers? Szablewski writes that Sony has “demonstrated a lack of interest in the original” <i>Wipeout</i>, so he doesn’t expect to hear much. “If anyone at Sony is reading this, please consider that you have (in my opinion) two equally good options: either let it be, or shut this thing down and get a real remaster going. I’d love to help!”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><small>Aug. 25, 2023</small></p><div>
      <p>There’s a popular open-source library called <a href="https://python.langchain.com/">LangChain</a> that can create chatbots that—among other things—do Q&amp;A over any website/document in 3 lines of code. Here’s <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/">an example of that from the langchain docs</a>.</p>
<div>
<pre><code id="target-element-current">from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
loader = WebBaseLoader("http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html")
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])
index.query("What should I work on?")</code></pre>
</div>
<div><p>Which outputs an answer specific to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html">Paul Graham’s essay</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The work you choose should ideally have three qualities: it should be something you have a natural aptitude for, something you have a deep interest in, and something that offers scope to do great work. If you're unsure, you could start by working on your own projects that seem excitingly ambitious to you. It's also beneficial to be curious, try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, and ask lots of questions. When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. It's okay to guess and be wrong sometimes, as this can lead to discovering what you're truly good at or interested in.</p>

<p><em>Note: if you’re interested you can try <a href="https://scriv.ai/a/scriv/bots/b/pg-bot/chat/">the chatbot built from Paul Graham’s essay here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The first time you run this it feels like pure magic. How the heck does this work?</p>
<p>The answer is a process called <strong>retrieval augmented generation</strong>, or RAG for short. It is a remarkably simple concept, though also has incredible depth in the details of its implementation.</p>
<p>This post will provide a high-level overview of RAG. We’ll start from the big picture workflow of what’s happening, and then zoom in on all the individual pieces. By the end of it, you should have a solid understanding of how those three magic lines of code work, and all the principles involved in creating these Q&amp;A bots.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer trying to build bots like this, you’ll learn which knobs you can tweak and how to tweak them. If you’re a non-developer hoping to use AI tools on your dataset, you'll gain knowledge that will help you get the most out of them. And, if you’re just a curious mind, you’ll hopefully learn a thing or two about some of the technology that's upending our lives.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?</h2>
<p><strong>Retrieval augmented generation is the process of supplementing a user’s input to a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT with additional information that you have <em>retrieved</em> from somewhere else. The LLM can then use that information to <em>augment</em> the response that it <em>generates</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The following diagram shows how it works in practice:</p></div>
<p><img alt="Retrieval Augmented Generation: An Overview" height="436" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/rag-overview.original.png" width="993"></p>
<div><p>It starts with a user’s question. For example “How do I do &lt;something&gt;?”</p>
<p>The first thing that happens is the <em>retrieval</em> step. This is the process that takes the user’s question and searches for the most relevant content from a knowledge base that might answer it. The retrieval step is by far the most important, and most complex part of the RAG chain. But for now, just imagine a black box that knows how to pull out the best chunks of relevant information related to the user’s query.</p></div>
<div>
      
        <p>Can't we just give the LLM the whole knowledge base?</p>
      
      <div>
        <p data-block-key="945eb">You might be wondering why we bother with retrieval instead of just sending the whole knowledge base to the LLM. One reason is that models have built-in limits on how much text they can consume at a time (though these are quickly increasing). A second reason is cost—sending huge amounts of text gets quite expensive. Finally, there is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172">evidence</a> suggesting that sending small amounts of relevant information results in better answers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
<div><p>Once we’ve gotten the relevant information out of our knowledge base, we send it, along with the user’s question, to the <em>large language model</em> (LLM). The LLM—most commonly ChatGPT—then “reads” the provided information and answers the question. This is the <em>augmented generation</em> step.</p>
<p>Pretty simple, right?</p>
<h2>Working backwards: Giving an LLM extra knowledge to answer a question</h2>
<p>We’ll start at the last step: <em>answer generation</em>. That is, let’s assume we already have the relevant information pulled from our knowledge base that we think answers the question. How do we use that to generate an answer?</p></div>
<p><img alt="Augmented Answer Generation" height="434" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/generation.original.png" width="658"></p>
<div><p>This process may feel like black magic, but behind the scenes it is <em>just a language model</em>. So in broad strokes, the answer is “just ask the LLM”. How do we get an LLM to do something like this?</p>
<p>We'll use ChatGPT as an example. And just like regular ChatGPT, it all comes down to prompts and messages.</p>
<h3>Giving the LLM custom instructions with the system prompt</h3>
<p>The first component is the <em>system prompt</em>. The system prompt gives the language model its overall guidance. For ChatGPT, the system prompt is something like “You are a helpful assistant.”</p>
<p>In this case we want it to do something more specific. And, since it’s a language model, we can just <em>tell it what we want it to do</em>. Here’s an example short system prompt that gives the LLM more detailed instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a Knowledge Bot. You will be given the extracted parts of a knowledge base (labeled with DOCUMENT) and a question. Answer the question using information from the knowledge base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re basically saying, <em>“Hey AI, we’re gonna give you some stuff to read. Read it and then answer our question, k? Thx.”</em> And, because AIs are great at following our instructions, it kind of just...  <em>works</em>.</p>
<h3>Giving the LLM our specific knowledge sources</h3>
<p>Next we need to give the AI its reading material. And again—the latest AIs are really good at just <em>figuring stuff out</em>. But, we can help it a bit with a bit of structure and formatting.</p>
<p>Here’s an example format you can use to pass documents to the LLM:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>------------ DOCUMENT 1 -------------

This document describes the blah blah blah...

------------ DOCUMENT 2 -------------

This document is another example of using x, y and z...

------------ DOCUMENT 3 -------------

[more documents here...]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Do you need all this formatting? Probably not, but it’s nice to make things as explicit as possible. You can also use a machine-readable format like JSON or YAML. Or, if you're feeling frisky, you can just dump everything in a giant blob of text. But, having some consistent formatting becomes important in more advanced use-cases, for example, if you want the LLM to cite its sources.</p>
<p>Once we’ve formatted the documents we just send it as a normal chat message to the LLM. Remember, in the system prompt we told it we were gonna give it some documents, and that’s all we’re doing here.</p>
<h3>Putting everything together and asking the question</h3>
<p>Once we’ve got our system prompt and our “documents” message, we just send the user’s question to the LLM alongside them. Here’s how that looks in Python code, using the OpenAI <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api">ChatCompletion API</a>:</p></div>
<div>
<pre><code id="target-element-current">openai_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": get_system_prompt(),  # the system prompt as per above
        },
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": get_sources_prompt(),  # the formatted documents as per above
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": user_question,  # the question we want to answer
        },
    ],
)</code></pre>
</div>

<div><p>That’s it! A custom system prompt, two messages, and you have context-specific answers!</p>
<p>This is a simple use case, and it can be expanded and improved on. One thing we haven't done is told the AI what to do if it can't find an answer in the sources. We can add these instructions to the system prompt—typically either telling it to refuse to answer, or to use its general knowledge, depending on your bot's desired behavior. You can also get the LLM it to cite the specific sources it used to answer the question. We’ll talk about those tactics in future posts but for now, that’s the basics of answer generation.</p>
<p>With the easy part out of the way, it’s time to come back to that black box we skipped over...</p>
<h2>The retrieval step: getting the right information out of your knowledge base</h2>
<p>Above we assumed we had the right knowledge snippets to send to the LLM. But how do we actually get these from the user’s question? This is the <em>retrieval step</em>, and it is the core piece of infrastructure in any “chat with your data” system.</p></div>
<p><img alt="Retrieval" height="201" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/retrieval.original.png" width="697"></p>
<div><p>At its core, retrieval is a search operation—we want to look up the most relevant information based on a user’s input. And just like search, there are two main pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Indexing:</strong> Turning your knowledge base into something that can be searched/queried.</li>
<li><strong>Querying:</strong> Pulling out the most relevant bits of knowledge from a search term.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s worth noting that <em>any search process could be used for retrieval</em>. Anything that takes a user input and returns some results would work. So, for example, you could just try to find text that matches the user's question and send that to the LLM, or you could Google the question and send the top results across—which, incidentally, is approximately how Bing's chatbot works.</p>
<p>That said, <em>most</em> RAG systems today rely on something called <em>semantic search</em>, which uses another core piece of AI technology: <em>embeddings</em>. Here we’ll focus on that use case.</p>
<p>So...what <em>are</em> embeddings?</p>
<h2>What are embeddings? And what do they have to do with knowledge retrieval?</h2>
<p>LLMs are weird. One of the weirdest things about them is that nobody really knows <em>how</em> they understand language. Embeddings are a big piece of that story.</p>
<p>If you ask a person how they turn words into <em>meaning</em>, they will likely fumble around and say something vague and self-referential like "because I know what they mean". Somewhere deep in our brains there is a complex structure that knows "child" and "kid" are basically the same, "red" and "green" are both colors, and "pleased," "happy," and "elated" represent the same emotion with varying magnitudes. We can't <em>explain</em> how this works, we just <em>know</em> it.</p>
<p>Language models have a similarly complex understanding of language, except, since they are <em>computers</em>  it's not in their brains, but made up of <em>numbers</em>. In an LLM's world, any piece of human language can be represented as a vector (list) of numbers. This vector of numbers is an <em>embedding</em>.</p>
<p>A critical piece of LLM technology is a <em>translator</em>  that goes from human <em>word-language</em> to AI <em>number-language</em>. We'll call this translator an "embedding machine", though under the hood it's just an API call. Human language goes in, AI numbers come out.</p></div>
<p><img alt="Embeddings Multiple" height="540" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-25_09-52-18.original.png" width="866"></p>
<div><p>What do these numbers mean? No human knows! They are only “meaningful” to the AI. But, what we do know is that <em>similar words end up with similar sets of numbers</em>. Because behind the scenes, the AI uses these numbers to “read” and “speak”. So the numbers have some kind of magic comprehension baked into them in AI-language—even if we don't understand it. The embedding machine is our translator.</p>
<p>Now, since we have these magic AI numbers, we can plot them. A simplified plot of the above examples might look something like this—where the axes are just some abstract representation of human/AI language:</p></div>
<p><img alt="Embedding Plot" height="525" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Embedding_Plot1.original.png" width="641"></p>
<div><p>Once we’ve plotted them, we can see that the closer two points are to each other in this hypothetical language space, the more similar they are. “Hello, how are you?” and “Hey, how’s it going?” are practically on top of each other. “Good morning,” another greeting, is not too far from those. And “I like cupcakes” is on a totally separate island from the rest.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can’t represent the entirety of human language on a two-dimensional plot, but the theory is the same. In practice, embeddings have many more coordinates (1,536 for the current model used by OpenAI). <strong>But you can still do basic math to determine how close two embeddings—and therefore two pieces of text—are to each other</strong>.</p>
<p>These embeddings, and determining “closeness” are the core principle behind <em>semantic search</em>, which powers the retrieval step.</p></div>

<div><h2>Finding the best pieces of knowledge using embeddings</h2>
<p>Once we understand how search with embeddings works, we can construct a high-level picture of the retrieval step.</p>
<p>On the indexing side, first we have to break up our knowledge base into chunks of text. This process is an entire optimization problem in and of itself, and we’ll cover it next, but for now just assume we know how to do it.</p></div>
<p><img alt="Knowledge Splitting" height="255" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-24_11-14-15.original.png" width="749"></p>
<p>Once we’ve done that, we pass each knowledge snippet through the embedding machine (which is actually an OpenAI API or similar) and get back our embedding representation of that text. Then we save the snippet, along with the embedding in a <em>vector database</em>—a database that is optimized for working with vectors of numbers.</p>
<p><img alt="Embedding Knowledge Snippets" height="323" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-24_11-19-35.original.png" width="582"></p>
<p>Now we have a database with the embeddings of all our content in it. Conceptually, you can think of it as a plot of our entire knowledge base on our “language” graph:</p>
<p><img alt="Knowledge Snippet Plot" height="533" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-24_15-35-04.original.png" width="659"></p>
<p>Once we have this graph, on the query side, we do a similar process. First we get the embedding for the user’s input:</p>
<p><img alt="Embedding the user query" height="180" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-22_14-09-41.original.png" width="856"></p>
<p>Then we plot it in the same vector-space and find the closest snippets (in this case 1 and 2):</p>
<p><img alt="Knowledge Snippet Plot with Query" height="523" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-24_15-35-42.original.png" width="667"></p>
<div><p>The magic embedding machine thinks these are the most related answers to the question that was asked, so these are the snippets that we pull out to send to the LLM!</p>
<p>In practice, this “what are the closest points” question is done via a query into our vector database. So the actual process looks more like this:</p></div>
<p><img alt="Retrieval with Embeddings Final" height="377" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-22_14-13-59.original.png" width="937"></p>
<p>The query itself involves some semi-complicated math—usually using something called a cosine distance, though there are other ways of computing it. The math is a whole space you can get into, but is out of scope for the purposes of this post, and from a practical perspective can largely be offloaded to a library or database.</p>
<div>
      
        <p>Back to LangChain</p>
      
      <div><p data-block-key="3saec">In our LangChain example from the beginning, we have now covered everything done by this single line of code. That little function call is hiding a whole lot of complexity!</p><p data-block-key="2ehku"><code>index.query("What should I work on?")</code></p></div>
    </div>
<div><h2>Indexing your knowledge base</h2>
<p>Alright, we’re almost there. We now understand how we can use embeddings to find the most relevant bits of our knowledge base, pass everything to the LLM, and get our augmented answer back. The final step we’ll cover is creating that initial index from your knowledge base. In other words, the “knowledge splitting machine” from this picture:</p></div>
<p><img alt="Knowledge Splitting High-Level" height="283" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-22_14-17-37.original.png" width="767"></p>
<div><p>Perhaps surprisingly, indexing your knowledge base is usually the hardest and most important part of the whole thing. And unfortunately, it’s more art than science and involves lots of trial and error. </p>
<p>Big picture, the indexing process comes down to two high-level steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Loading</strong>: Getting the contents of your knowledge base out of wherever it is normally stored.</li>
<li><strong>Splitting</strong>: Splitting up the knowledge into snippet-sized chunks that work well with embedding searches.</li>
</ol></div>
<div>
      
        <p>Technical clarification</p>
      
      <div><p data-block-key="oiv49">Technically, the distinction between "loaders" and "splitters" is somewhat arbitrary. You could imagine a single component that does all the work at the same time, or break the loading stage into multiple sub-components.</p><p data-block-key="8tt3h">That said, "loaders" and "splitters" are how it is done in LangChain, and they provide a useful abstraction on top of the underlying concepts.</p></div>
    </div>
<p>Let’s use my own use-case as an example. I wanted to build a chatbot to answer questions about my <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">saas boilerplate product, SaaS Pegasus</a>. The first thing I wanted to add to my knowledge base was <a href="https://docs.saaspegasus.com/">the documentation site</a>. The <em>loader</em> is the piece of infrastructure that goes to my docs, figures out what pages are available, and then pulls down each page. When the loader is finished it will output individual <em>documents</em>—one for each page on the site.</p>
<p><img alt="Loader" height="279" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-22_14-20-12.original.png" width="901"></p>
<p>Inside the loader a lot is happening! We need to crawl all the pages, scrape each one’s content, and then format the HTML into usable text. And loaders for other things—e.g. PDFs or Google Drive—have different pieces. There’s also parallelization, error handling, and so on to figure out. Again—this is a topic of nearly infinite complexity, but one that we’ll mostly offload to a library for the purposes of this write up. So for now, once more, we’ll just assume we have this magic box where a “knowledge base” goes in, and individual “documents” come out.</p>
<div>
      
        <p>LangChain Loaders</p>
      
      <div><p data-block-key="dbdqd">Built in loaders are one of the most useful pieces of LangChain. They provide <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/">a long list of built-in loaders</a> that can be used to extract content from anything from a Microsoft Word doc to an entire Notion site.</p><p data-block-key="8c7gm">The interface to LangChain loaders is exactly the same as depicted above. A "knowledge base" goes in, and a list of "documents" comes out.</p></div>
    </div>
<div><p>Coming out of the loader, we’ll have a collection of documents corresponding to each page in the documentation site. Also, ideally at this point the extra markup has been removed and just the underlying structure and text remains.</p>
<p>Now, we <em>could</em> just pass these whole webpages to our embedding machine and use those as our knowledge snippets. But, each page might cover a lot of ground! And, the more content in the page, the more “unspecific” the embedding of that page becomes. This means that our “closeness” search algorithm may not work so well.</p>
<p>What’s more likely is that the topic of a user’s question matches some piece of text <em>inside</em> the page. This is where splitting enters the picture. With splitting, we take any single document, and split it up into bite-size, embeddable chunks, better-suited for searches.</p></div>
<p><img alt="Splitter" height="224" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Screenshot_from_2023-08-22_14-21-05.original.png" width="715"></p>
<p>Once more, there’s an entire art to splitting up your documents, including how big to make the snippets on average (too big and they don’t match queries well, too small and they don’t have enough useful context to generate answers), how to split things up (usually by headings, if you have them), and so on. But—a few sensible defaults are good enough to start playing with and refining your data.</p>
<div>
      
        <p>Splitters in LangChain</p>
      
      <div>
        <p data-block-key="5bysr">In LangChain, splitters fall under a larger category of things called "<a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/">document transformers</a>". In addition to providing various strategies for splitting up documents, they also have tools for removing redundant content, translation, adding metadata, and so on. We only focus on splitters here as they represent the overwhelming majority of document transformations.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
<div><p>Once we have the document snippets, we save them into our vector database, as described above, and we’re finally done!</p>
<p>Here’s the complete picture of indexing a knowledge base.</p></div>
<p><img alt="Knowledge Indexing Complete" height="556" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Knowledge_Indexing_Complete.original.png" width="1055"></p>
<div>
      
        <p>Back to LangChain</p>
      
      <div><p data-block-key="9n2db">In LangChain, the entire indexing process is encapsulated in these two lines of code. First we initialize our website loader and tell it what content we want to use:</p><p data-block-key="38vfa"><code>loader = WebBaseLoader("http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html")</code></p><p data-block-key="5bvlf">Then we build the entire index from the loader and save it to our vector database:</p><p data-block-key="1rusd"><code>index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])</code></p><p data-block-key="2nksm">The loading, splitting, embedding, and saving is all happening behind the scenes.</p></div>
    </div>
<div><h2>Recapping the whole process</h2>
<p>At last we can fully flesh out the entire RAG pipeline. Here’s how it looks:</p></div>
<p><img alt="RAG: Complete" height="934" src="https://communitykeeper-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/Complete.original.png" width="1075"></p>
<div><p>First we <em>index</em> our knowledge base. We get the knowledge and turn into individual documents using a <em>loader</em>, and then use a <em>splitter</em> to turn it into bite-size chunks or <em>snippets</em>. Once we have those, we pass them to our <em>embedding machine</em>, which turns them into vectors that can be used for semantic searching. We save these embeddings, alongside their text snippets in our <em>vector database</em>.</p>
<p>Next comes <em>retrieval</em>. It starts with the question, which is then sent through the same embedding machine and passed into our vector database to determine the closest matched snippets, which we’ll use to answer the question.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>augmented answer generation</em>. We take the snippets of knowledge, format them alongside a custom system prompt and our question, and, finally, get our <em>context-specific</em> answer.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>Hopefully you now have a basic understanding of how retrieval augmented generation works. If you’d like to try it out on a knowledge base of your own, without all the work of setting it up, check out <a href="https://scriv.ai/">Scriv.ai</a>, which lets you build domain-specific chatbots in just a few minutes with no coding skills required.</p>
<p>In future posts we’ll expand on many of these concepts, including all the ways you can improve on the “default” set up outlined here. As I mentioned, there is nearly infinite depth to each of these pieces, and in the future we’ll dig into those one at a time.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
              <p>I read about this one family...</p>
<p>They were tired of society. They thought civilization was unraveling. They wanted to live off the grid. Authorities found their mummified remains a few months later.</p>
<p>The family died from exposure and malnutrition.</p>
<p>They didn't make it.</p>
<p>A while back, a prepper tried to ride out an arctic blast with canned food and survival gear. He didn't realize his electric can opener wasn't going to work until <em>after </em>the power had gone out.</p>
<p>He was helpless.</p>
<p>Prepping and homesteading have entered the mainstream over the last few years, helped by doomsday shows along with a growing sense of dread about the future. A lot of people have no idea what it's about.</p>
<p>They think they're living off the grid.</p>
<p>They're not.</p>
<p>None of us are truly living off the grid. We take it for granted. We watch homesteaders and bushcraft masters post videos about living in the woods in huts, but we don't see all the production that goes into making it look fun and simple. We don't think about where we'd go to the bathroom. We don't think about how we'd filter our water. We don't think about what we'd do without all these survival tools made in a factory somewhere.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with watching bushcraft videos and fantasizing about life in a mudhole. It only becomes a problem when millions of people become convinced they can all do it, and they forget that their mudhole isn't going to have bluetooth. If we had any idea what living off the grid was like, I think a lot of people would be trying a lot harder to protect it.</p>
<p>Prepping can get you through an emergency. It can get you through a disaster. It can get you through shortages and supply chain problems. It's not designed for life on an uninhabitable planet.</p>
<p>We need to talk about this, because a lot of newbie preppers and bunker babies seem to think it's possible.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>If you know what you're doing, you're probably not going to die making some rookie mistake. You could build a little cabin out in the woods with a solar power system, a root cellar, a rain harvesting system, a well, a composting toilet, and a small farm. You'd be okay for a while. It would still cost a lot. You would still need the luxury of time to get it all set up.</p>
<p>You still wouldn't make it.</p>
<p>There's people out there who know how to make their own batteries. They know how to take a car apart. They know how to build a solar power system without any help. They know how to dig an earth shelter.</p>
<p>They won't make it either.</p>
<p>In Texas in the 1950s, it didn't rain for seven years. People barely had enough water to rinse their dishes. Dust storms and heat waves brought life to a standstill. Those kinds of droughts lie in our future.</p>
<p>I've often daydreamed about having a cabin in the woods where my family can go as the unwinding of global industrial civilization accelerates. It's ironic that homesteading now evokes a sense of privilege. Rural hipsters want to homestead like their great grandparents, but they also want the comfort of the grid, along with its hospitals and drivable roads.</p>
<p>They like indoor plumbing.</p>
<p>And wifi.</p>
<p>The original homesteaders of the 1860s got their land for dirt cheap, even free. They filed claims under the Homestead Act. All they had to do was promise to live on the land and "improve it." There was a small registration fee. That was it. Now, nobody just <em>gives </em>you land anymore.</p>
<p>Talk about privilege...</p>
<p>Of course, the original homesteaders didn't have an internet where they could look things up. They didn't have indoor plumbing. They didn't have central heating. They didn't have hospitals where they could go if they fell and broke their arm. They didn't have antibiotics. They knew a simple harsh truth. If you truly lived off the grid, then you also died off the grid.</p>
<p>Most of us aren't ready for that.</p>
<p>Some of us have delved into prepping out of necessity, as a hedge against a world on fire. The more I've learned, the more I've come to an uncomfortable conclusion. It's no match for climate change.</p>
<p>It's not going to save you.</p>
<p>A rain harvesting system can't help if it doesn't rain for seven years. You're not going to hide from wildfires in a bunker.</p>
<p>You're not going to wait out social collapse in a cabin in the woods. You're not going to grow food if it's raining microplastics. You're not going to live off those emergency food kits, either.</p>
<p>Look at the sodium.</p>
<p>Your solar panels and batteries will eventually need replacing.</p>
<p>You can't smelt your own silicone.</p>
<p>You're not going to shoot your way through the apocalypse. There's always someone with a bigger gun and a better aim. There won't be an end to the number of hungry families who want your stuff and don't share your warm fuzzy view of humanity. Even if you killed them all, you'd have to bury them somewhere, and probably not next to your victory garden.</p>
<p>I've done the survival calculus.</p>
<p>You can't store 20 years of food in your home. You can't protect it from the elements. You can't build a bunker on an uninhabitable planet. Even if you did, someone would take it from you.</p>
<p>At any rate, you probably aren't going to die from famine or thirst if you're living in the first world. You're probably going to die from heat stroke. You're probably going to die from a disease. You're probably going to die from a hospital acquired infection. You're probably going to die from a heart attack or cancer from all the toxins you don't even know you're ingesting.</p>
<p>Eight billion people can't live off the grid.</p>
<p>We tried that with a far smaller global population. It didn't work. That many people can only live in societies where we carefully manage our resources, including food, water, and medicine.</p>
<p>Once you've constructed a network of people to provide all of each other's needs, you've basically built... a grid.</p>
<p>Look at history. People formed cities and societies because they got tired of living and dying off the grid. The grid is a wonderful thing when it's not run by kleptocrats.</p>
<p>It's good to be ready for emergencies.</p>
<p>It's good to have food and water for yourself and your neighbors. It's good to have a backup power source. It's good to know how to change a tire. It's good to know how to get through a heat wave without air conditioning. It's good to know how to prepare for a storm or a flood. It's good to have alternate transportation. It's good to have outdoor camping skills.</p>
<p>It's good to have matches and a compass.</p>
<p>It's good to know first aid.</p>
<p>It's good to know how to garden. It's good to be okay eating rice and beans every meal without complaining. It's good to know just how much you can depend on yourself, and the limits to your own resilience.</p>
<p>That's prepping.</p>
<p>The more I've learned about it, and the more I've read into the scope of our oncoming climate dystopia, one simple truth has been waiting down at the bottom. The best kind of prepping is emotional.</p>
<p>You aren't going to escape.</p>
<p>This disastrous summer has made one thing painfully clear. Nowhere on earth is safe from the consequences of climate change. If it's not wildfires, it's the smoke from the wildfires. If it's not drought, it's floods. You can build a community, but you also have to remember that it's hard to get along with people. They can be irritating, even when they're not batshit crazy. All we can do is be ready, and then be ready for when it's not enough.</p>
<p>One day, it won't.</p>
<p>You will die.</p>
<p>None of us are guaranteed a quick and painless exit from life. None of us are entitled to go peacefully in our sleep.</p>
<p>As for all the fantasy survivalists out there who play commando on the weekends and then stop at Chick-fil-A on the way home...</p>
<p>If you think you're going to defect from the social contract but still get to enjoy all the benefits of society, I have bad news.</p>
<p>You're not going to make it.</p>

<p>IBM has announced its latest <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTwZPWzPKAAxVhxgIHHerOCfwQFnoECB8QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fdownloads%2Fcas%2FWQX5N4RJ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0IJVJ4YHU88QUH0hX6To-R&amp;opi=89978449">TS1170</a> tape drive with 50TB cartridges, more than 2.5 times larger than LTO-9 cartridges.</p>



<p>IBM, which manufactures the LTO tape drives sold by itself, HPE, and Quantum, has its own proprietary tape formats used in its TS1100 series drives and Jx format media. The latest TS1170 drive supports 50TB JF media cartridges with 150TB compressed capacity through 3:1 compression. The prior <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2019/08/23/big-blue-developing-tape-drive-to-repel-quantum-computer-attacks/">TS1160</a>, announced in 2018, supported JE media with capacities of 20TB raw and 60TB compressed.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive.jpg" alt="IBM TS1170 tape drive" width="700" srcset="https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive.jpg 950w, https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive-300x150.jpg 300w, https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive-768x383.jpg 768w, https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive-696x347.jpg 696w, https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive-842x420.jpg 842w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px"><figcaption>IBM TS1170 tape drive</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The TS1170 drive operates at 400MBps raw throughput and supports both 12gig SAS and 16gig FC connectivity. It is also recognized as LTFS-ready. However, JF media is not backwards-compatible with the earlier JE specification.</p>



<p>The new tape cartridge media, also called 3592 70F, uses <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/06/29/fujifilm-400tb-magnetic-tape-cartridge-future/">Strontium Ferrite</a> particle technology. Fujifilm has demonstrated a <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/16/ibm-and-fujifilm-580tb-tape-capacity-record/">580TB</a> raw capacity tape using Strontium Ferrite particles so there is a lot of runway for future capacity increases.</p>



<p>LTO-9 tapes hold 18TB raw and 45TB compressed, less than IBM’s JE format tapes. The <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/09/10/lto-changes-tape-roadmap-strategy-cuts-capacity-to-build-air-gapped-ransomware-defence-storage/">LTO tape roadmap</a> has a coming LTO-10 specification with 36TB raw/90TB compressed capacity. Where IBM uses a 3:1 compression ratio, the LTO group uses 2.5:1. An IBM TS4500 tape library, using the JF cartridges, will be able to hold the same amount of data as an LTO-9-based library but with more than three times fewer tapes thanks to IBM’s large capacity tape and greater compression. Even when LTO-10 tape technology arrives, the TS4500 will still have a better density in terms of TB per cartridge.</p>



<p>The LTO (Linear Tape-Open) organization was founded to provide an open industry standard format to replace various proprietary tape formats such as Quantum’s S-DLT and DLT. But since only IBM makes LTO tape drives and these drives use media from Sony and Fujifilm, IBM has a lock on the LTO tape format.</p>



<p>LTO group members HPE and Quantum are dependent upon IBM and can do nothing to get LTO tape cartridge capacity up to the IBM TS1170/JF level unless they develop their own drives. If they do this, they may have to lose some backwards-compatibility. With IBM’s dominant presence in the LTO space, competitors would need significant investment to establish a foothold.</p>

<h3>What is Factorio: Space Age?<author>kovarex</author></h3>

<p>
  <strong>Factorio: Space Age</strong> continues the player's journey after launching rockets into space. Discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms.
</p>

<p>
  Vanilla Factorio ends by launching the rocket into space, so I always expected it to be quite obvious what we are going to do next.
  Honestly the space platform related gameplay was actually planned a very long time ago, and we had shown a little bit in <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-74">FFF-74</a>.
  We had a similar kind of story with the Spidertron. Its concept was teased for the first time in <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-120">FFF-120</a>, just to be quietly abandoned and then revived 4 years later.
</p>

<p>
  But as you might or might not know, the name 'WUBE' is an abbreviation of Wszystko będzie, which means something like "Everything will be done eventually". We didn't abandon the plan, we just realized it would be way too ambitious to try to fit it into the 1.0 Factorio release, so it was eventually just postponed to the expansion. In retrospect, it was clearly a good idea.
</p>

<h4>The main structure</h4>
<p>
  Instead of sending one rocket to space, you have to send many, because you need to use them to transport materials to build big space platforms in orbit.
  The rocket is cheaper in Space Age to not make it drag forever, but you still are expected to build bigger in preparation of what is to come.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The space platforms are used on their own to generate space science, but mainly, they are eventually used to travel to different planets, and for automated interplanetary logistics.</li>
    <li>We decided to go with the approach of having a small number of predefined planets, which represent your progression through the game.</li>
    <li>The expansion contains 4 additional planets. Each of which has its own unique theme, resource, challenges and gameplay mechanics. Most of them also have different military targets.</li>
    <li>Every planet leads to production of specific science packs and its technologies.</li>
    <li>The order in which you exploit the planets is an impactful strategic choice.</li>
  </ul>


<p>
  <img width="258px" src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-373-technology-graph-smaller.png">
</p>

<h4>The rewards</h4>
<p>
  Since we have a lot of new challenges, we also had to balance the set of rewards you get for each stage of the game.
  We have a set of cool new things in the expansion, but the player is quite omnipotent at the end of the vanila playthrough so we had to make some tough decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Since the goal was to make the overall expansion experience as good as possible, we have rebalanced the tech tree. This means, that with Space Age enabled, some items that are available in vanilla are unlocked later on some planet. This specifically applies to artillery, cliff explosives (this is the masochist part of me speaking), Spidertron, best tier of modules, and some personal equipment upgrades.
</p>

<p>
  Based on testing, these changes made the choice of where and when to go even more meaningful.
  On the other hand, space will be available sooner and there will be some nice additions available directly on Nauvis (the vanilla planet).
</p>

<p>
  This implies that technically, you could just take your vanilla base, activate the expansion, and continue playing. But the best way to experience it will be to play with Space Age from start to finish.
</p>

<h4>Version 2.0 is not just about the expansion</h4>
<p>
  In the previous news about the expansion <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-367">FFF-367</a>, we declared that the content will be technically a mod taking advantage of the updated engine. What this means is that a lot of the improvements will be for all players, regardless of them having the expansion or not.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of things that will be in the 2.0 update are: the ability to control train systems better, better blueprint building, better flying robot behaviour and many more. It will all be covered in more details in future FFFs.
</p>

<h3>The good news and the bad news<author>kovarex</author></h3>

<p>
  Lets start with the (probably) bad news. Since we know where we are and what is the goal, we can start to approximate
  the date of releasing the expansion, which is planned to be about one year from now.
  It is still a long time, but at least it is getting more specific.
</p>

<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>
  In the previous post <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-367">FFF-367</a>, we declared a 7 step plan, where we were at step 4.
  Now we are at the end of step 5, and have started some things from step 6 already.
</p>

<p>
  It has been playable from start to finish for more than a year. This means that we have already made several improvement iterations based on the playthroughs behind us.
</p>

<p>
  We are doing 3 types of testing which were all very useful:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Just playing the game on our own and contemplating how it feels.</li>
    <li>Office LAN party, which is also a great way to test multiplayer.</li>
    <li>Individual testers. We had a few outside testers who played it from start to finish and gave us detailed feedback.</li>
  </ul>


<p>
  The feedback led us to make different kinds of changes, for example:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Two planets were way too repetitive and similar to Nauvis, and we had to do a complete overhaul to make them more different.</li>
    <li>The game was a little bit too slow and grindy, so we were speeding things up, which doesn't mean dumbing it down.
        The goal was to be able to finish it in non-speedrun mode in less than 80 hours for an experienced player.
        We were trying to keep the mechanics and just cut down on the recipe counts and costs.
    </li>
    <li>We improved many UIs related to the new (and sometimes old) parts of the game many times.</li>
  </ul><p>
  It was kind of annoying to redo so much, but based on the result and reactions, it was definitely worth it.
</p>

<p>
  This means, that we have something we are happy with, is pretty stable, and we don't expect any further brutal changes to come.
  We have a relatively stable list of tasks to be finished both for programmers and artists, which makes us confident that we can release a polished product in about a year.
</p>

<h4>The good news</h4>

<p>
  But then there is the (hopefully) good news! From now on, we are stopping the embargo on the expansion content, and <strong>we
  will be publishing Friday Facts every week</strong> about all the different aspects of the expansion until release!
</p>

<p>
  We will mostly show what we have done, or what we are working on. We are also looking forward to the feedback from the
  community which has proved useful so many times already. With the quantity of things we have, I'm confident that we
  won't run out of topics until the release.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
  There's a mod for that<author>Earendel</author>
</h3>

<p>
  A lot of people are going to make comparisons between the Space Age expansion and the <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration" target="_blank">Space Exploration</a> mod.
  I've worked on the game design for both: On Space Age I made the first space + planets prototype builds and plus I've been involved in most of the gameplay discussions since.
  On Space Exploration, well it's my mod, I made it.
</p>

<p>
  I think that makes me the most qualified to talk about how these two things are very different from the ground up.
  Sure there's some overlap in the broader topics: you go to space, you visit planets; but these similarities end up being fairly superficial when all of the decisions along the way are made with different design goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    Space Exploration is targeted at a small set of challenge-seekers, it's not for everyone by design. Space Age is targeted at all Factorio players with better approachability in mind.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Game Length:</strong>
    Space Exploration is a long-form adventure designed for players to gradually uncover many interconnected challenges over 150-500 hours (or more).
    Space Age challenges are more streamlined and self-contained for a faster pace of 60-100 hours (rough estimate).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Complexity:</strong>
    Space Exploration challenges ramp up to a very high difficulty towards the end.
    Some of the last challenges cannot be automated without a set of arithmetic combinators, so it is not expected that all players will be able to complete it.
    Space Age has a lot of different challenges but they never get too extreme and the usage of combinators is quite lightweight, so we expect that most players will be able to complete it.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Engine Support:</strong>
    There are so many things that Space Exploration just can't do because it's a mod.
    Space Age has very different capabilities because the game engine can be made to support it.
    Large parts of the expansion are focused on game mechanics that just aren't possible otherwise, so the gameplay will be unique and refreshing even if you're a Space Exploration veteran.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are many more differences that will become apparent when we look at individual features of the expansion in upcoming FFFs.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  As always, let us know what you think at the usual places. We look forward to seeing you all in the weeks to come :) .

The organization writes and administers the SAT test and Advance Placement (AP) exams, which students take to earn college credit and bolster applications. The College Board also runs standardized tests taken by children as young as kindergartners, and essentially writes the curriculum in some school districts. </p><p>The College Board, as powerful as <!-- -->a governmental institution in some regards, is a non-profit.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction:</h2>
<p dir="auto">Mental health issues are often misunderstood or not fully grasped by the general public. This lack of understanding can lead to fear, discomfort, and negative perceptions about mental health conditions. Media portrayals of mental health often perpetuate negative stereotypes, leading to misconceptions and fear. Overcoming mental health stigma requires a multi-faceted approach that involves education, raising awareness, promoting empathy and understanding, challenging stereotypes, and ensuring accessible and quality mental health care.
Mental health directly impacts an individual's overall well-being, quality of life, and ability to function effectively in daily life. Good mental health is essential for experiencing happiness, fulfilment, and a sense of purpose. Mental health and physical health are closely intertwined. Untreated mental health issues can lead to or worsen physical health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, weakened immune systems, and chronic conditions.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Core Rationale:</h2>
<div dir="auto"><p>Chatbots offer a readily available and accessible platform for individuals seeking support. They can be accessed anytime and anywhere, providing immediate assistance to those in need. Chatbots can offer empathetic and non-judgmental responses, providing emotional support to users. While they cannot replace human interaction entirely, they can be a helpful supplement, especially in moments of distress.</p><p>
NOTE: <em>It is important to note that while mental health chatbots can be helpful, they are not a replacement for professional mental health care. They can complement existing mental health services by providing additional support and resources.</em></p></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dataset:</h2>
<div dir="auto"><p>The dataset was curated from online FAQs related to mental health, popular healthcare blogs like WebMD, Mayo Clinic and Healthline, and other wiki articles related to mental health. The dataset was pre-processed in a conversational format such that both questions asked by the patient and responses given by the doctor are in the same text. The dataset for this mental health conversational AI can be found here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/heliosbrahma/mental_health_chatbot_dataset" rel="nofollow">heliosbrahma/mental_health_chatbot_dataset</a>.</p><p>
NOTE: <em>All questions and answers have been anonymized to remove any PII data and preprocessed to remove any unwanted characters.</em></p></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Model Finetuning:</h2>
<div dir="auto"><p>This is the major step in the entire project. I have used sharded Falcon-7B pre-trained model and finetuned it to using the QLoRA technique on my custom mental health dataset. The entire finetuning process took less than an hour and it was finetuned entirely on Nvidia A100 from Google Colab Pro. But, it could also be trained on free-tier GPU using Nvidia T4 provided by Colab. In that case, we have to ensure to use max_steps less than 150.
The rationale behind using sharded pre-trained model is mentioned in my blog post: <a href="https://medium.com/@iamarunbrahma/fine-tuning-of-falcon-7b-large-language-model-using-qlora-on-mental-health-dataset-aa290eb6ec85" rel="nofollow">Fine-tuning of Falcon-7B Large Language Model using QLoRA on Mental Health Dataset</a><br>
Adding here the training loss metrics tracking report from WandB monitoring logs for 180 steps training run: <a href="https://api.wandb.ai/links/heliosbrahma/iv8s4frw" rel="nofollow">train/loss logs for Falcon-7B PEFT</a></p><p>
NOTE: <em>Try changing hyperparameters in TrainingArguments and LoraConfig based on your requirements. With the settings mentioned in notebook, I achieved 0.031 training loss after 320 steps.</em></p></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Model Inference:</h2>
<p dir="auto">PEFT fine-tuned model has been updated here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/heliosbrahma/falcon-7b-sharded-bf16-finetuned-mental-health-conversational" rel="nofollow">heliosbrahma/falcon-7b-sharded-bf16-finetuned-mental-health-conversational</a>. <br>
Run <code>gradio_chatbot_app.ipynb</code> notebook to get a chatbot like interface using Gradio as frontend for demo. Play around with different hyperparameter config settings for answer generation and run multiple queries to check for the quality of generated response.</p>
<p dir="auto">It takes less than 3 minutes to generate the model response. Compare the PEFT model response with the original model response in <code>funetuned_qlora_falcon7b.ipynb</code> notebook.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2023-08-25</small>
        <p>Elixir is the thing I do most of my public writing and speaking about. It is my default programming language for the last 5-6 years. It suits my brain. Performs well for the kind of work I typically do. And using it I have experienced very few drawbacks. Rather than writing yet another post trying to widely summarize what I think is beneficial about the language I want to try and go a bit deeper on one particular aspect I like. Not incredibly technically deep, but unpack the concepts more thoroughly. I hope this will be a series of stand-alone posts. We will see. This time we unpack Elixir concurrency (and parallelism).</p>
<p>My origin story is steeped in PHP. In PHP the concurrency model is pretty much whatever your web server (mod_php) or app server (php-fpm?) decides it should be. PHP generally assumes a shared-nothing model and each request is clear of whatever work is done in the others. In this regard work can run concurrently but they can also not share anything without reaching for external files, databases, queues or similar.</p>
<p>Then I went to Python. Over in Python .. it depends. It is really bad at concurrency. Ordinary threading is available but enormously constrained by the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). The best solution seems to be just running more interpreters or using Python multiprocess which I believe forks new processes. I liked Python. I didn’t enjoy trying to do performant concurrency in Python though.</p>
<p>Elixir builds on Erlang. Fundamentally everything I’m writing about here is thanks to the Erlang virtual machine, aka. the BEAM, which has this stuff at its core. I will write in the context of Elixir. The things that are great here are also great about Erlang. Except possibly the Task module, which is kind of neat. That could also be done with Erlang but I don’t know if anyone has.</p>
<p>The BEAM is made to run a ton of lightweight processes. A type of green thread if you will. They take very little time to spawn, they take very little memory. A system can have millions of them. And if you need many millions of them you can bump the default limit. They are fundamentally a different thing from OS processes and threads. The BEAM itself is scheduled by the OS but on startup the BEAM creates threads for its schedulers. One per available CPU core by default. These in turn take care of scheduling processes. This is the source of concurrency and parallelism.</p>
<p>We won’t go into detail on the Actor model and how that works here but that is built on top of the fundamental primitive of a process. A process runs a function, the function only has access to its own local variables and private copies of whatever arguments were passed in. This is Functional Programming so everything is immutable. A process cannot change the values in another function. This function running in a process has two cool special bits of API it can use. It can receive messages and it can send messages. If the function runs to completion the Process goes bye-bye. If the process runs in an eternal loop checking for messages and only acts if a message comes in? Then we end up talking about the Actor model again which I said we won’t do. So lets move on.</p>
<p>A process runs on one of the schedulers. If many processes taking a long time creates a queue on one scheduler the other schedulers can start stealing work to balance it out. If a particular process goes through a lot of function calls (internally called reductions), say 4000 for example, without completing then the scheduler will pre-empt it. That means freeze it, mid-run, and send it back to the end of the work queue. This is called pre-emptive multitasking and it is what Linux does to the OS processes. In the BEAM nothing gets to hold up the line for very long. This is how it ensures low latency which is another topic I hope to unpack at a different time.</p>
<p>The immutable FP nature of Elixir and Erlang are pragmatic choices that were made to achieve a bunch of goals. It predates multi-core machines by a fair bit and they were targeting a different kind of concurrency, distributed systems made up of multiple machines, a cluster. The end result was accidentally convenient for achieving incredibly concurrency and parallelism on multi-core machines. Processes do not share state, they can only communicate asynchronously through message passing. This ensures it is safe to run them at the same time. Same time as in concurrent, executing the tasks during the same period of time. Also parallel, executing the tasks at the same time. All APIs that touch files or other constrained resources, stdin/stdout and such, have mechanisms for ensuring that contention is under control. The Erlang folks have spent a lot of time getting this right.</p>
<p>When I write my code I generally don’t need to care about this very much. Most web requests take place inside a single process. They might communicate on through to a database connection pool which involves more processes but overall I don’t need to care about the underlying primitives. I also don’t need to think about the Node.js way of racing to IO. Node.js can be highly concurrent. CPU-bound work is fine on the BEAM. It won’t disrupt the ability of other processes to get work done, both because multiple cores can do the work but also because if I spend many CPU cycles I will be pre-empted and other work can slip by. This is all handled by the web server I use, more than by me.</p>
<p>If I do want to do concurrent work there is the usual async/await mechanisms, implemented in the Task module. Not as weird as in JS. They just return a Task reference which is a helpful abstraction on top of the Process ID or PID. Then you can await on it to get a result or await on multiple to get multiple results. There is also a wicked function called Task.async_stream which will take an enumerable (list, map, stream or similar) and run a Task for each entry as a lazy stream. By default it has a concurrency matching the number of available cores (just like the schedulers). This is essentially a fancy shortcut for using all your machine has to offer in the service of getting the work done for tasks that are embarrassingly concurrent. It is very fun to use when bodging together scripts that you want to go fast.</p>
<p>Compared to PHP I have many more tools for interacting across the work that happens in my system. Process registries and groups, PubSub mechanisms for message passing, memory-based shared state accessed through safe mechanisms (ETS for example).</p>
<p>Compared to Python I can do multiple things at once in simple and useful ways. In a language that is as expressive and as dynamic (in the places I care about).</p>
<p>Compared to Javascript I can do multiple things at once easily without worrying about CPU-bound work holding up other requests and such. I get actual immutability instead of working really hard to pretend I do.</p>
<p>These comparisons are of course based on my understandings and experiences with the languages. I’ve stuck with languages I have some experience with but I don’t hang out with them on a regular basis currently. If I have misrepresented any of them, do let me know.</p>
<p>In summary; great options for concurrency and parallelism are not an afterthought in Elixir and Erlang. They are built into the very foundation of the runtime and the languages surface it to us. This matters for performance and practicality. Doing concurrency on the BEAM is not punishing, it is not risky. It is just what you end up doing by using it.</p>

<p>But this time I feel different. A tour at Onkalo, which lies 450m (1,480ft) below the ground, to see tunnels hewn in the living rock to store highly radioactive waste for 100,000 years, suddenly makes me nervous.</p>
</div></div><div><h3>Finland's plan to bury spent nuclear fuel for millennia</h3><div><p><em>Finland is on the verge of becoming the first nation to bury spent nuclear fuel rods deep underground for the long term. <br></em><em><br></em><em>Read about the science – and the controversies – behind the scheme in Erika Benke's accompanying <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230613-onkalo-has-finland-found-the-answer-to-spent-nuclear-fuel-waste-by-burying-it">in-depth article for BBC Future Planet.</a></em></p></div></div><div><p>I'm about to visit the world's first permanent storage site for spent nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>As I drive on a near-empty road in southwest Finland, I slow down trying to imagine what this picture-postcard Nordic countryside with huge pine trees would look like in 1,000 years. Or 10,000.</p>
<p>Will there be any people in the pretty houses dotted around Olkiluoto island? If so, will they speak Finnish? Will they use a language at all? And, most crucially, will they know about the potential danger lurking in the ground under their feet at Onkalo? <em>(Read more about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200731-how-to-build-a-nuclear-warning-for-10000-years-time">how to communicate a nuclear warning 10,000 years into the future</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Spent fuel rods from nuclear power stations are currently <a href="https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/PUB1963_web.pdf">kept in temporary storage facilities around the world. </a></p>
<p>Finland is the first country implementing what it hopes is a permanent solution.

But I feel apprehensive now. It helps that our hosts from Posiva, the company running the site, show us a safety video first. I watch it with fellow visitors, two German TV crews. </p>
<p>The video hits a tone of sensible down-to-earth pragmatism. Don't get separated from the group. In an emergency, follow your guide's instructions. It's an active construction site so watch out for vehicles and machines. If there's a fire, follow your guide to the nearest shelter. The video shows a group of people calmly walking into a fire-proof pod with its own oxygen supply. Once inside, their guide hands everybody a bottle of water. It all looks very organised. </p>
<p>"Have you ever been in an emergency down there?”, I ask one of our guides, Johanna Hansen, research and development coordinator at Posiva.</p>
<p>"Only one, but it was a false alarm," she replies with a smile.</p></div><div><p>Next we're asked to don our safety gear: a bright yellow high-visibility jacket, waterproof boots, a helmet with a visor and a belt with a torch. We're each handed a small pack containing an escape hood that will protect us from fire-related gases for 15 minutes. I'm relieved to hear that the helmets have a tracking device so people in the control room above the ground will always know where I am in the tunnels.</p>
<p>With that reassuring thought I walk through the turnstile at a security gate under the blazing midday sun and get into a car. Our guide drives into the service tunnel without hesitation. In a moment, everything turns very dark.</p>
<p>It takes 15 minutes to drive down to Onkalo's service station which lies 437m (1,430ft) below the ground. As the 4.5km-long (2.8 mile) tunnel begins to snake down, we see a standard traffic sign for a 20km/h (12mph) speed limit. There are also green signs on the tunnel wall at regular intervals indicating how far we are from the surface.</p></div><div id="future/article/20230824-the-descent-to-the-worlds-first-waste-nuclear-fuel-storage-site-p0g8jxsx"><picture><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0g8jxsx.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0g8jxsx.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0g8jxsx.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0g8jxsx.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0g8jxsx.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0g8jxsx.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="No nuclear waste is yet stored at Onkalo – but it is an active building site so required Erika to don safety equipment (Credit: Erika Benke)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0g8jxsx.jpg" alt="No nuclear waste is yet stored at Onkalo – but it is an active building site so required Erika to don safety equipment (Credit: Erika Benke)" id=""></picture><div><p>No nuclear waste is yet stored at Onkalo – but it is an active building site so required Erika to don safety equipment (Credit: Erika Benke)</p></div></div><div><p>It's a lot less scary than I thought it would be. I think what makes me relax is to see that we're not alone. The tunnel is narrow – it's for one vehicle – but when we pass a bay, we catch glimpses of trucks and cars. It's like driving in a busy construction site, just set in a cave.</p>
<p>We arrive at the service station surprisingly quickly: a spacious, well-lit chamber with crushed stone underfoot. There's a lot of heavy machinery and a row of large containers filled with construction materials. Two men standing on a cherry picker attached to harnesses are working on ventilation shafts in the ceiling. Two other workers are in conversation over containers surrounded by massive cables.</p>
<p>It feels oddly normal: people are going about their jobs as if they were in a factory above the ground. It's a pleasant 14C (57F) and the air is clean: a ventilation system has been installed and there's no smell of dust or moisture.</p>

							<p>The naked mole rat is arguably the strangest looking mammal on the planet. However, beneath its wrinkly exterior may lie secrets that could extend human lifespan.&nbsp;In a new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06463-0">published in the journal <em>Nature</em></a>, researchers reported that they successfully transferred a naked mole rat gene into mice, leading to improved health and longevity.</p>

Adam Fenster&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D810&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;A naked mole rat (NMR) is pictured at the University of Rochester January 31, 2018.  Naked mole rats are intriguing for researchers for a variety of reasons: they have the longest life span of rodents (average lifespan is 30 years), they are resistant to a variety of age-related diseases such as cancer, and they tend to remain fit and active until very advanced ages. In fact, they typically only die because they are combatant and kill each other or because they eat toxic food. The Gorbunova Lab studies these rodents in the hopes of unraveling their unique anti-cancer properties. In this paper, the researchers compared the cellular senescence of short-lived mice (who have average life spans of 2-3 years) with the long-lived NMRs. They found that NMR cells still undergo cellular senescence just like mice, however, the cellular senescence in NMRs displays unique features that may contribute to cancer resistance and longevity. Future research will determine what these features are and how this might translate to humans.  \/\/ photo by J.

[University of Rochester]</figcaption></figure>
<p>Native to East Africa, naked mole rats live in underground colonies like ants or termites. They have almost no hair and very little subcutaneous fat but are incredibly long-lived for their size, surviving <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/naked-mole-rat">up to 30 years</a>. This is around 10 times longer than similar-sized mice. Naked mole rats also resist age-related diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>For over a decade, scientists Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov at the University of Rochester have been probing the naked mole rat for clues to its super longevity. Previous studies show high molecular weight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronic_acid">hyaluronic acid</a> (HMW-HA) is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12234">elevated in naked mole rats</a> compared to other mammals. The researchers believe this unique molecule holds the key.</p>
<p>To test whether HMW-HA could extend lifespan in other mammals, the researchers engineered mice to produce the naked mole rat version of the hyaluronan synthase 2 gene. This gene codes for a protein that generates HMW-HA.</p>
<p>The genetically modified mice showed increased HMW-HA levels and lived 4.4% longer on average versus regular mice. They also had lower cancer rates, reduced age-related inflammation, and healthier guts.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Gorbunova, HMW-HA conferred these benefits by directly regulating the immune system, protecting cells from oxidative damage, and improving gut barrier function. This demonstrates that the naked mole rat’s longevity adaptations can be successfully transferred to another species.</p>
<p>The big question is whether HMW-HA could be used to increase longevity in humans as well. The Rochester team is focused on finding ways to boost HMW-HA levels or slow its degradation in people.</p>
<p>“We hope that our findings will provide the first, but not the last, example of how longevity adaptations from a long-lived species can be adapted to benefit human longevity and health,” <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/gene-transfer-hmw-ha-naked-mole-rats-extends-mice-lifespan-565032/">says</a> Dr. Seluanov.</p>
<p>The naked mole rat has much to teach us about healthy aging. With further research, this humble rodent’s longevity secrets may unlock new ways to extend human lifespans.</p>

<h5><strong>85 web pages and 52 videos entirely devoted<br>to helping you drill your own well</strong></h5>







<p>You can drill your own shallow water well using PVC and household water hoses.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a cheap and effective way to dig your own shallow water well.&nbsp; Water well drilling isn’t just for the pros with huge commercial drilling rigs.&nbsp; Digging a water well yourself is both interesting and fun.</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_under_page_title - under_page_title --><!-- Ezoic - gen_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div><figure><img src="http://drillyourownwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ready-to-Start-low-res.jpg" alt="How to Drill Your Own Water Well" width="583" height="778" srcset="https://drillyourownwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ready-to-Start-low-res.jpg 500w, https://drillyourownwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ready-to-Start-low-res-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px"></figure></div>







<p>The water well drilling methods described here work well in digging/drilling through dirt, and clay, including really hard clay.&nbsp; They will not work if you need to drill through rock but, if the area you live in is flat or relatively flat, it is definitely worth a try.&nbsp; Many folks think they have to dig or drill their well into an aquifer.&nbsp; For irrigation and lawn watering, reaching an aquifer isn’t necessary.&nbsp; You only have to drill under the standing water level. It is very likely that you can drill your own well.&nbsp; Many successful wells have been drilled using this well drilling method.&nbsp; It is cheap.  You can expect the “drilling” portion of the project to cost about $200. <span data-ez-name="drillyourownwell_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><!-- Ezoic - gen_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->

<p>In these pages the “do it yourself water well drilling” technique is referred to as well drilling, but many call this technique “washing” or “jetting” a well.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is somewhat similar to the rotary bit method which most real water well drillers use for water bore drilling.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>The DIY technique involves water pumped down the center of a PVC schedule 40 pipe used as both a drill stem and a drill bit.&nbsp; At the bottom end of the PVC pipe a “drill bit” is fashioned by cutting teeth into the end of the PVC pipe.&nbsp; The pipe is rotated back and forth as the PVC pipe is slowly worked into the ground while the cuttings are brought to the surface by the upward flow of water in the annular space around the pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to dig your own well, try this technique.&nbsp;</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><!-- Ezoic - gen_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->



<p>Installing a well and a pump can save a lot of money, especially if you are now paying the local utility for irrigation water.&nbsp; You have probably noticed that just watering the lawn can get expensive.&nbsp; You can spend less money watering the lawn.&nbsp; Actually, you can spend almost no money watering the lawn.&nbsp; It is great for gardeners, too.<span data-ez-name="drillyourownwell_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>



<p>If you are a first time visitor to the site you will probably want to start out with either the “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/background/"><span>Background</span></a>” or the “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/basic-well-drilling-steps/"><span>Basic Well Drilling Steps</span></a>” pages.&nbsp; The bulk of the site is dedicated to drilling water wells using just two hoses for drilling fluid.&nbsp; Inexpensive PVC is used for the drill pipe, the drill bit, and the well screen.&nbsp; This DIY water well drilling technique is very cheap and many successful shallow wells have been installed using this technique.&nbsp;</p><p>When drilling a well by hand, it can be very helpful to at least be familiar with the techniques used by real well drillers – the kind with big powerful trucks and huge water tanks.&nbsp; What we do is extremely similar, almost identical.&nbsp; We can’t dig holes as wide or as deep but it is the same process.&nbsp; A local well drilling company was kind enough to let me video their process.&nbsp; Check it out at “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/real-well-drilling/">Real Well Drilling</a>.”</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_mid_content - mid_content --><!-- Ezoic - gen_mid_content - mid_content --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-640x360-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-640x360-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-426x240-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-426x240-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-384x216-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-384x216-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock -->



<p>There are several enhancements you can make to the basic DIY well drilling technique.&nbsp; To make the technique even more effective you can use the techniques described on the pages, “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/drilling-deeper-with-bentonite/">Drilling Deeper with BENTONITE</a>” and “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/drill-10-feet-deeper/">Drill 10 Feet Deeper</a>.”&nbsp; Additionally, converting to a metal drill bit will make your drilling more productive.&nbsp; These are all techniques that were sent in by users of the site and discovered as they drilled their wells.<span data-ez-name="drillyourownwell_com-box-4"></span></p>



<p>A gravel pack can increase a well’s production so there is a section on them.&nbsp; I don’t recommend you include a gravel pack on your first well but after you get the hang of the technique this is something you will probably want to check out the pages on <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/about-well-screens-and-gravel-packs/">gravel packs</a>.</p>



<p>Don’t go shopping for a pump without reading this page:  <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/which-pump/">Which Pump?</a>  You want a shallow well pump, also known as a suction pump.  Pool pumps and other types of transfer pumps will not work.</p>



<p>In the “Videos” section, you will find videos that show techniques used world wide.&nbsp; Some of these techniques, like the <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/the-baptist-method/">Baptist Method</a>, require very little drilling fluid and have been used for centuries.</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_long_content - long_content --><!-- Ezoic - gen_long_content - long_content --><p>We’ve been fortunate enough to receive some input from Bob Tabor, a real well driller who has been drilling wells all of his life.&nbsp; Please be sure and check out the page –&nbsp;<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/advice-from-a-real-well-driller/">“Advice from a REAL Well Driller.”</a></p>



<p>Bill Granade in Tampa, Florida has developed a very similar DIY water well drilling technique.&nbsp; He has been wildly successful.&nbsp; Bill has helped his neighbors drill a bunch of wells his protocols may be useful to you.&nbsp; Look under “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/another-home-driller/">Another Home Driller</a>.”</p>

<p>Somewhere, ol' Beelzebub is putting on his thickest coat because Apple has endorsed a right-to-repair bill, suggesting hell has frozen over. In a letter dated August 22, Apple showed its support for California's right-to-repair bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244">SB 244</a>, after spending years combatting DIY repair efforts.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/">TechCrunch</a>, the letter, written to California state Senator Susan Eggman, declared that Apple supports SB 244 and urged the legislature to pass it.</p>
<p>The bill requires vendors of consumer electronics and appliances to make sufficient documentation, parts, and tools for repairs available to customers and independent repair shops. The big exceptions are video game consoles and alarm systems.</p>
<p>The bill has been praised by right-to-repair activists like iFixit, who says the bill goes further than right-to-repair laws passed in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/minnesota-enacts-right-to-repair-law-that-covers-more-devices-than-any-other-state/">Minnesota</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/ny-passes-right-to-repair-will-require-tech-oems-to-share-tools-diagnostic-info/">New York</a>. Minnesota's law was considered the most all-encompassing right-to-repair legislation yet. Some activists, though, lamented that companies aren't required to sell parts and tools for devices not actively sold. California's bill, however, keeps vendors on the hook for three years after the last date of manufacture if the product is $50 to $99.99 and seven years if it's over $99.99.</p>
<p>The bill also allows a city, county, or state to bring a related case to superior court rather than only a state attorney general, as noted by iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california">blog post </a>Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Apple’s stipulations</h2>
<p>According to what appears to be a PDF of Apple's letter shared by sites including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843506/apple-california-right-to-repair-sb-244">The Verge</a>, Apple decided to support the SB 244 bill since it has requirements around "individual users’ safety and security, as well as product manufacturers’ intellectual property." It's signed by D. Michael Foulkes<strong>,</strong> director of state and local government affairs at Apple.</p>
<p>The letter notes that Apple was able to "engage" with the senators and staff on the bill.</p>
<p>It goes on to list the tech giant's conditions for continued support of the bill. Those conditions include that the bill not feature a requirement for manufacturers to enable repair providers to disable device security features.</p>
<p>Apple's letter also asked that the bill "focus on requiring manufacturers obligations to provide the documentation tools, and parts to enable the repairs performed by authorized repair channels, as opposed to a broader undefined scope of repairs." Apple also wants repair providers to mention when they're using "non-genuine or used" components.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The bill, as written, also requires non-authorized repairers to provide written notice of their lack of official vendor approval.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability at iFixit, told Ars Technica that while disclosing the use of third-party parts is reasonable, she's concerned that it "supports unnecessary fear-mongering around used and third-party parts."</p>
<p>"I also worry that lumping used and third-party parts together will contribute to further confusion. Apple's 'unable to verify' warnings already blur the line between those categories," she added.</p>
<p>California's final bill "should balance device integrity, usability, and physical safety" with the right to repair, Apple's letter reportedly says.</p>
<h2>Apple flip-flops</h2>
<p>Apple's letter is a reverse-course on the battle against right-to-repair efforts that it's been fighting for a decade, as noted via Repair.org Executive Director Gay Gordon-Byrne through a US PIRG press release Wednesday. That includes in California, where in 2019, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjvdb4/apple-is-telling-lawmakers-people-will-hurt-themselves-if-they-try-to-fix-iphones">Motherboard</a> reported that an Apple representative met with legislators, encouraging them to kill a right-to-repair bill over alleged consumer safety concerns. That bill was pulled soon after.</p>
<p>In 2017, then-Nebraska state Senator Lydia Brasch was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pgxgpg/apple-tells-lawmaker-that-right-to-repair-iphones-will-turn-nebraska-into-a-mecca-for-hackers">quoted</a> as saying an Apple representative told her that if Nebraska passed its right-to-repair bill, it would be the only state to do such a thing and become a "mecca" for hackers. In 2016, there were concerns of anti-repair behavior via "<a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/411395/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ios-crippling-error-53/">Error 53</a>," which could befall iOS devices that underwent an unauthorized repair.</p>
<p>Despite its past, Apple is sharing support for a California right-to-repair bill that it, apparently, deems fit. Ironically, Apple's letter attempts to frame itself as a bit of a right-to-repair leader, pointing to its Authorized Repair Provider Program launched in 2016, the Independent Repair Provider Program it debuted in 2019, and its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/apple-will-soon-send-parts-and-tools-to-users-who-want-to-repair-their-phones/">Self-Service Repair Program</a> introduced in 2022. The latter, however, is far from covering all of the consumer electronics Apple makes and has its own <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/macbook-self-repair-program-highlights-apples-flawed-repairability-progress/">criticisms</a>.</p>
<p>As noted by TechCrunch, this week it's rare to see a vendor speak out on the right to repair rather than speaking through an industry group. No other big name in tech has shared public support for SB 244.</p>
<p>So why now?</p>
<p>Nathan Proctor, senior director of US Public Interest Research Group's (PIRG's) Right to Repair Campaign, wagered a guess to Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>My best guess is that it's because we were able to pass a bill in Minnesota, and it has become clear that we have the ability to pass these bills. At that point, you can either try to have some input, maybe get some good PR while you are at it ... because you can't stop us. We are glad that the company has decided to do the right thing, whatever the reason.</p></blockquote>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  This book gives a thorough introduction to topological data analysis (TDA),
the application of algebraic topology to data science. Algebraic topology is
traditionally a very specialized field of math, and most mathematicians have
never been exposed to it, let alone data scientists, computer scientists, and
analysts. I have three goals in writing this book. The first is to bring people
up to speed who are missing a lot of the necessary background. I will describe
the topics in point-set topology, abstract algebra, and homology theory needed
for a good understanding of TDA. The second is to explain TDA and some current
applications and techniques. Finally, I would like to answer some questions
about more advanced topics such as cohomology, homotopy, obstruction theory,
and Steenrod squares, and what they can tell us about data. It is hoped that
readers will acquire the tools to start to think about these topics and where
they might fit in.

Now to find the workers" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p>The next step is less certain. America is building factories, but can it find the workers to operate them? With the jobless rate near a five-decade low, firms are already struggling to find staff. As scores of new factories are built, the gaps will grow.</p><p>Semiconductors are the most important test case for America’s manufacturing revival. Over the past couple of decades makers of computer chips have largely left America. The country still has world-class semiconductor researchers and designers, but has been denuded of a workforce that turns silicon wafers into electronic circuits at scale. Hoping to reverse that tide, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/07/how-real-is-americas-chipmaking-renaissance" data-tegid="brff2rkrgi069ogkulbpmfvc7ji6891v"><small>CHIPS</small> Act</a> passed last year will see the government dole out $50bn over the next half-decade.</p><p>A baseline estimate from the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade body, is that by 2030 America’s chip sector will face a shortage of 67,000 technicians, computer scientists and engineers, and about 1.4m such workers throughout the wider economy. Set this against the total of roughly 70,000 students who complete undergraduate degrees in engineering in America each year, and the scale of the deficit becomes apparent. Whatever the precise gap, it marks the difference between foundries running at full capacity with labour bills under control, or ending up mired in high costs and low productivity.</p><p>One of the sites at the centre of America’s ambitions offers an early glimpse of the problem. The Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (<small>TSMC</small>), the world’s largest maker of chips, plans to invest $40bn in two factories in Phoenix, Arizona, greatly boosting America’s ability to craft large volumes of ultra-small semiconductors. If it is successful, it will suggest that America can reclaim a position at the cutting-edge of chip production.</p><p>The first of <small>TSMC‘s </small>factories was due to start production next year. But in July it announced that the launch would be put back to 2025 because it could not find enough workers with the expertise to install equipment at such a high-tech facility. Mark Liu, <small>TSMC</small>’s chairman, said the firm would send technicians from its home base in Taiwan to train its American staff.</p><p>“My nightmare is investing in all of this infrastructure and then not being able to build the workforce,” says Shari Liss of <small>SEMI </small>Foundation, a microelectronics lobbying group. The fact that many share her worry is at least a useful spur. A report in January from the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, said America needed a “surge of national, state and local actions” to provide enough workers for the chips sector. The outlines of that are taking shape.</p><p>The most immediate hole, as illustrated by <small>TSMC</small>’s troubles, is in the construction industry. The Commerce Department reckons that about 100,000 builders may be needed for the first phase of investments in semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs. The government cannot conjure such a labour force out of thin air. But it has made its subsidies contingent on companies explaining the steps they will take to recruit and train construction workers.</p><p>An official in the Commerce Department says the government wants companies to collaborate on building up a construction workforce. “Workers that are trained for one project will then be beneficial for other fabs that get built,” the official says. In this respect <small>TSMC</small>’s plan to import Taiwanese trainers is less a bug than a feature, helping to transmit knowledge.</p><p>Once the fabs are built, they will need technicians to operate them. Such workers, responsible for tasks like inspecting tools and products, have historically required two years of training at a community college or a vocational school. But companies and educators have started experimenting with much shorter courses.</p><p>Most eye-catching are quick-start programmes that promise to churn out technicians in just ten days, offered by Maricopa Corporate College in Arizona and Portland Community College in Oregon. The Portland college, supported by Intel, an American chipmaker, offers students stipends of $500 a week, and the one in Arizona guarantees its students interviews with <small>TSMC</small>. Still, no company is about to put candidates with just ten days of training anywhere near the multi-million-dollar machinery inside their fabs.</p><p>The more realistic goal is to whet people’s appetites for a career in semiconductors. “Our intent is to reach out to people who may think they lack the skills for this type of job,” says Gabriela Cruz Thompson of Intel. She notes that the firm has been more successful at recruiting women and minorities to the quick-start programmes than to traditional two-year courses. </p><p>There may soon be more in-between options. This autumn Columbus State Community College in Ohio, where Intel is building two fabs, will offer a first-of-its-kind one-year programme. The aim is for students to “finish job-ready” for Intel.</p><p>The next rung up the work ladder in fabs are the engineers who run them. Universities near some of the plants under construction, including Arizona State and Ohio State, have expanded their offerings of semiconductor courses as part of degrees in engineering and physical sciences. Leading the charge is Purdue University in Indiana: last year it launched a semiconductor degree programme for both undergraduates and graduates.</p><p>The aim of Purdue’s “lab-to-fab” model is to collaborate more closely with companies. As part of a $49m upgrade of its “cleanroom” facility, it gives students access to the sorts of conditions and materials they would encounter in commercial enterprises, along with testing their mettle in the head-to-toe bunny suits they must wear to keep chips free of contamination.</p><p>This summer Purdue introduced an eight-week course that included a $10,000 stipend for students, funded by companies that hope to attract would-be workers before they are seduced by Silicon Valley. And in an industrial park at the south-west edge of campus, SkyWater, an American chip foundry, will build a $2bn fab. “Students will be able to wake up in their dorm, turn right and go to their classes, and then turn left and do an internship,” says Mung Chiang, president of Purdue. </p><h2>Fab opportunities</h2><p>Ms Cruz Thompson says that Intel expected 100 or so people to register for quick-start courses. But about 900 did. At Purdue enrolment has also been very strong. In May Handshake, a job platform for recent graduates, reported that applications for full-time jobs at semiconductor companies were up by 79% compared with last year, versus 19% in other sectors. “Students…realise that chips are the new oil,” says Vijay Raghunathan, Purdue’s director of semiconductor education.</p><p>Unfortunately, America is limiting its access to one obvious source of talent. Immigrants account for about 40% of highly skilled workers in America’s semiconductor industry. They are funnelled through a couple of visa programmes, with strict caps. Those caps are fixed, meaning that as the industry expands they will become more restrictive. Politicians on the right, including Donald Trump, have floated eliminating the visa openings altogether.</p><p>America’s chip firms are already configured for a small but skilled workforce. As they outsourced manufacturing abroad they grew more specialised at home, putting America at the commanding heights of the global industry. Qualcomm, Nvidia and others became world leaders in developing and designing advanced chips. It was a highly profitable division of labour.</p><p>Now America is trying to retake a foothold in the industry’s lower tiers, relearning basic skills such as cutting wafers into chips and packaging them in hard plastic casing.

Améliorer l'article sur sympy jacobian pour parler du fait que scipy fait l'estimation de la dérivée alors qu'on peut des fois la calculer sans problème avec sympy.

Au delà des réseaux de neurones, beaucoup d'algorithmes d'optimisation demande le calcul du gradient, c'est à dire du vecteur qui va contenir toutes les dérivées partielles. La fonction `scipy.optimize.optimize` de la bibliothèque Numpy/Scipy va estimer le gradient en un point $x$ avec la formule suivante :   
$$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} $$  
On peut obtenir un résultat numérique de la dérivée de $f$ au point $x$, mais ce sera une approximation, et il faudra appeler deux fois la fonction $f$, ce qui peut être coûteux. -->

<p>---&gt; <a href="https://vmartin.fr/comprendre-la-differenciation-automatique-en-30-lignes-de-python-fr.html">French version of this article</a></p>
<p>I'm a Machine Learning engineer and I use libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch in my work to train my neural networks. And it's been a while since I wanted to write the simplest piece of code to perform what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation</a> which is at the heart of neural network training.<br>
In this article, I will try to iteratively build the simplest code to calculate derivatives automatically on scalars.</p>
<p>In the following Python code, the sum between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will be performed and the result (<code>8</code>) will be assigned to the variable <code>z</code>. After the assignment, the <code>z</code> variable keeps no track of the variables used, so there is no way to automatically update the value of <code>z</code> if the value of <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> changes. Even less possible to understand the link between each variable to calculate a derivative automatically.</p>



<h2>The <code>Tensor</code> class</h2>
<p>The idea is to create a new type, a <code>Tensor</code>, which will allow us to do <strong>symbolic calculation</strong> on our variables.<br>
Let's start by creating a <code>Tensor</code> class where the addition operation is redefined.</p>

<p>In this example, we create a <code>Tensor</code> class that can store a value, and we redefine addition to create a new <code>Tensor</code> when we perform an addition between two <code>Tensors</code>. There is no symbolic computation mechanism yet that will allow <code>z</code> to have a trace that it is the result of the addition between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.<br>
We will add this behavior by using <strong>a binary tree</strong>. Each tensor will be able to contain the other two tensors and the operation that produced it. To do this, we introduce the Children tuple which will contain these three pieces of information.</p>

<p>Now a tensor, in addition to containing a numerical value, will contain the tuple <code>children</code> allowing it to keep track of the calculation. In this example, in addition to introducing the <code>Children</code> type, we have added the multiplication method to tensors. The <code>forward</code> method to the <code>Tensor</code> class has also been added to be able to <strong>execute the computation graph</strong> and compute the actual value of the tensors. The tensor <code>z2</code> can be modeled by the following computation graph.</p>
<!-- ![Pelican](imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyzz1.png =100x20) -->

<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyz1z2.png" alt="Computation graph of the tensor z2" width="300"></p>
<p>We can check that it works as expected by first creating the graph without specifying any values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>z1</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span>
<span>z2</span> <span>=</span> <span>z1</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z2</span><span>)</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:None T:None</span>
<span># T:None</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Then the values of the leaves of the tree (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) can be changed and the value of <code>z2</code> calculated. The call to <code>z2.forward()</code> will cause the <code>forward</code> method of <code>z</code> and <code>y</code> to be called, and these calls will browse the graph to recursively calculate the value of <code>z2</code>.  </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>y</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z2</span><span>.</span><span>forward</span><span>())</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:40</span>
</code></pre></div>



<h2>Adding Automatic Differenciation</h2>
<p>To add automatic differentiation to an arbitrary computation graph, we simply add the derivative for the basic operations supported by our <code>Tensor</code> class. Recursive calls to the <code>grad</code> function will traverse the computation graph and decompose a complex function to be derived into a combination of simple functions.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>deriv_to</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Derivative of a tensor with itself is 1</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

    <span># Derivative of a scalar with another tensor is 0</span>

        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"This op is not implemented. </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>children</span><span>.</span><span>op</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>t</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>We can now derive <code>z2</code> as a function of the variable of our choice:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>z2</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:3 T:5</span>
<span># T:13</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Here, <code>g</code> is not just a value, <strong>it is a new computational graph</strong> that represents the partial derivative of <code>z2</code> as a function of <code>y</code>. Since the value of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> was defined when <code>grad</code> was called, the value of <code>g</code> could be calculated. The calculation graph of <code>g</code> can be represented by this diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyz1z2_grad.png" alt="Computation graph of the partial derivative of z2 in function of y" width="300"></p>
<p>Literally $g = \frac{\partial z_2}{\partial y} = x + 2*y$, and when <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are 3 and 5 respectively, then <code>g</code> is 13.</p>
<h3>Enabling the <code>Tensor</code> class to handle more complex formulas</h3>
<p>To be able to use more complex formulas, we will add more operations to the <code>Tensor</code> class. We add subtraction, division, exponential and negation (<code>-x</code>).<br>
Here is the <code>Tensor</code> class in its final form:</p>

<p>For each operation added to the <code>Tensor</code> class, the corresponding derivative has been included in the <code>grad</code> method. Also, we have modified <code>forward</code> to handle more cases, especially to handle operations that require only one term like exponential or negation.    </p>
<p>Now let's create a more complex formula and derive it!<br>
Let's try to derive $z$ :</p>
<p>$$z = \frac{12 - (x * e^{y})}{45 + x * y * e^{-x}}$$
<!-- $$z = (12 - (x * exp(y))) / (45 + x * y * exp(-x) )$$ --></p>
<p>We just have to write this equation using our <code>Tensor</code> class:  </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>12</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>()))</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span><span>x</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This will generate for the tensor <code>z</code>, the following computation graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe.png" alt="Computation graph of z" width="300"></p>
<p>We can now easily calculate the partial derivative of <code>z</code> as a function of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with the following code: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span> <span># T:-3.34729777301069</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>))</span> <span># T:-9.70176956641438</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This will generate the following two graphs:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe_grad_x.png" alt="Computation graph of derivative of z in function of x"><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe_grad_y.png" alt="Computation graph of derivative of z in function of y"></p>
<p>Finally, to check that our automatic derivation system works, we can compare the numerical calculation of our derivatives with the calculation done by the Sympy library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>sympy</span> <span>as</span> <span>sym</span>

<span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>'xs'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>'ys'</span><span>)</span>
<span>zs</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>12</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>xs</span> <span>*</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)))</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>45</span> <span>+</span> <span>((</span><span>xs</span> <span>*</span> <span>ys</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>xs</span><span>))</span> <span>)</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>evalf</span><span>(</span><span>subs</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>}))</span> <span># -3.34729777301069</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>evalf</span><span>(</span><span>subs</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>}))</span> <span># -9.70176956641438</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>The result obtained with the Sympy library is strictly the same as with our <code>Tensor</code> class !</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements &amp; Optimizations</h2>
<p>We have just created the simplest automatic differentiation system that exists, and probably also the slowest. We can add more complex operations if we want, as long as we know how to derive them. As it is, this class can only handle scalars; for such a library to be most useful, one would have to add <strong>operations on arrays</strong> of arbitrary sizes. <br>
<!-- Un grand atout des bibliothèques de différenciation automatique telles que <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a> ou <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch">PyTorch</a>  -->
Also, looking at the graphs, we can see that some optimizations are possible:
</p><ul>
<li>If we are in a multiplication node and one of the two <code>children</code> is 0, we <strong>should not explore further</strong>. Because we know that whatever is multiplied by 0, will always be 0.   </li>
<li>When traversing the tree to perform a derivative with respect to a tensor <code>x</code>, if we are in a node that does not depend on <code>x</code> and whose children do not depend on <code>x</code>, we could stop the traversal at this step and <strong>consider the current node as a constant</strong>. This type of optimization could greatly improve the computational speed for graphs with many nodes and different variables.  </li>
<li>By looking at the graph we can see that some operations are repeated. We can imagine <strong>to set up a cache</strong> to avoid repeating the computations several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this article has helped you understand how automatic differentiation is performed for neural network optimization and learning.<br>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It has been five months since my <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/03/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-march-2023.html">last
general
update</a>
on the Rust compiler’s performance. Let’s see what has happened in that time.</p>

<h2 id="big-wins">Big wins</h2>

<p>Let’s start with some big improvements. The information about metrics at the
top of <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2022/10/27/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-october-2022.html">this
post</a>
still applies.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107925">#107925</a>: Incremental
compilation uses a hashing algorithm to detect when code fragments have changed
and need recompilation. In this PR, <a href="https://github.com/thomcc">@thomcc</a>
changed the algorithm from SipHash-2-4 to SipHash-1-3, which is faster and
lower quality, but still good enough for the purposes of incremental
compilation. (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash">Wikipedia page</a> says
“The recommended parameters are SipHash-2-4 for best performance, and
SipHash-4-8 for conservative security. A few languages use Siphash-1-3 for
performance at the risk of yet-unknown DoS attacks.” Incremental compilation
seems like an unlikely target for such attacks.) This gave a mean wall-time
reduction of 1.63% across all benchmark results, with the improvements mostly
coming in incremental builds.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109474">#109474</a>: In this PR,
<a href="https://github.com/nikic">@nikic</a> upgraded the LLVM version used by the
compiler to LLVM 16. This gave a mean wall-time reduction of 1.19% across all
benchmark results. It’s unclear how much of the improvement is because LLVM
itself is faster (which would make rustc’s back-end faster) and how much is
because LLVM is producing higher quality code (which would make all of rustc
faster). Either way, it’s great work by the LLVM developers!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113734">#113734</a>: In this PR,
<a href="https://github.com/cjgillot">@cjgillot</a> tweaked how some lints are run. This
gave a mean wall-time reduction of 1.05% across all benchmark results, with
the improvements mostly coming in incremental builds.</p>

<p>Any change that results in a 1% across-the-board win is a big improvement, so
it’s great to see three of them. (I pay close attention but it’s possible that
I have overlooked other big improvements.)</p>

<h2 id="codegen-units">Codegen units</h2>

<p>I spent a lot of time trying to improve the parallelization done by the Rust
compiler’s back-end, without much success. A lot of the work related to how the
compiler breaks code into chunks for parallel processing, and how it must
predict how long these chunks will take to compile. I did get two wins of note.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112448/">#112448</a>: In this PR I
introduced a minimum CGU size in non-incremental builds. This reduced peak
memory usage across several benchmarks by up to 19%, with most of the
improvements in the 2-9% range. It also reduced binary sizes by 48% in one
extreme example, and up to 8% across numerous other benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113777">#113777</a>: In this PR I adjusted
the CGU merging algorithm to minimize the duplication of inlined functions,
giving icount, peak memory, and binary size wins of a few percent on several
benchmarks.</p>

<p>I wrote in more detail about my efforts in a <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/07/11/back-end-parallelism-in-the-rust-compiler.html">blog
post</a>
in July. In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/14wcezs/backend_parallelism_in_the_rust_compiler/">Reddit
discussion</a>
several people suggested data analysis to improve the estimates. So I collected
data, put it in <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/07/25/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-data-analysis-assistance-requested.html">another blog
post</a>,
and requested assistance because I am no data scientist. I got some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/158tcel/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/">excellent
responses</a>,
many of which suggested that larger data sets would be helpful. I then
published a <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/08/01/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-data-analysis-update.html">follow-up blog
post</a>
with larger data sets, and received some more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/15f3cob/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/">good
responses</a>.
For people interested in compilers and data science there will be plenty of
interesting reading there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to improve the compiler further, despite trying a
number of different estimation functions from the analyses. Normally when you
implement a parallel algorithm, the exact way you divide the problem into
pieces doesn’t affect the answer. But that isn’t true for codegen unit
formation! The functionality of the generated code doesn’t change, but the
quality of that code (and its size) can very much change. This makes it really
challenging to improve, because there are multiple metrics in conflict. Almost
any change that improves one metric regresses another. It’s quite possible that
there are potential improvements remaining, but I don’t know how to attain
them, and I’m not planning on working on this area any further.</p>

<h2 id="other-presentations">Other presentations</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Kobzol">Jakub Beránek</a> has been extremely productive
recently, and published multiple interesting blog posts describing his work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One about his <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/07/30/optimizing-rust-ci-2023.html">improvements to the CI used for
rustc</a>,
some of which sped up the compiler.</li>
  <li>One about <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/08/18/rustc-benchmark-suite.html">the rustc-perf benchmark
suite</a>
that we use to measure the compiler’s performance.</li>
  <li>One about
<a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/cargo/2023/08/12/rust-llvm-optimization-remarks.html">cargo-remark</a>,
an experimental tool to help you understand how your Rust code is being
optimized by LLVM.</li>
  <li>One about
<a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/cargo/2023/07/28/rust-cargo-pgo.html">cargo-pgo</a>,
which makes it easier to use PGO and BOLT to speed up your Rust programs.</li>
</ul>

<p>He also got a new <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector/runtime-benchmarks">runtime benchmarking
suite</a>
up and running within rustc-perf, to complement the existing compile-time
benchmarking suite. This is a long-desired feature that is now running on
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=03a119b0b0e310d22d94399b24ed030056050f13&amp;end=443c3161dd04f4c1b656a626f9079921bee9c326&amp;stat=instructions%3Au&amp;tab=runtime">every merge</a>.
It’s still experimental and the benchmarks could be improved, but it’s a huge
step towards reliable detection of changes to codegen quality. I believe Jakub
will write a new blog post about this soon.</p>

<p>Finally, I gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2vJ8Faundw">a short talk</a> at
<a href="https://2023.rustnl.org/">RustNL 2023</a> about parallelism in the compiler. It’s
a nice overview, but please note that my estimate of “next month” for the
parallel front-end was too optimistic. I have learned my lesson, and I won’t
give a new prediction for when that feature will ship.</p>

<h2 id="my-improvements">My improvements</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110527">#110527</a>: In this PR I avoided
constructing a data structure when it wasn’t necessary, for a few sub-1% icount
wins.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111088">#111088</a>: The compiler has a
<code>FileEncoder</code> type used for writing various things to file. It has an internal
buffer that had a variable size, but in practice the buffer size was always 8
KiB. In this PR I fixed the size to 8 KiB, which meant some checks could be
hardwired in the generated code, giving sub-1% icount wins on a few benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111963">#111963</a>: The compiler can
derive impls for various built-in traits: <code>Clone</code>, <code>Default</code>, <code>Debug</code>,
<code>PartialEq</code>/<code>Eq</code>, <code>PartialOrd</code>/<code>Ord</code>, and <code>Hash</code>. The derived functions were
marked <code>#[inline]</code>, except for <code>Debug::fmt</code> (which makes sense given that it is
typically not used on hot code paths) and <code>Hash::hash</code>. This PR added an inline
marking to <code>Hash::hash</code>, giving sub-1% icount wins on a number of benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113116">#113116</a>: In this PR I made a
series of micro-optimizations in and around codegen unit formation, giving
sub-3% icount wins on a few benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113609">#113609</a>: In this PR I added a
cache that avoids the need for some repetitive HIR traversals during linting.
It gave icount wins of up to 6% across a number of benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/114611">#114611</a>: This is a fun one.
<a href="https://github.com/Dragon-Hatcher">@Dragon-Hatcher</a> created a very unusual
Rust program: a chess engine that computes things at compile time only using
Rust’s Turing-complete trait system. (They also have a TypeScript version of
the same program.) This causes vast numbers of trait obligations to be
generated for the compiler’s trait solver. In this PR I made some small changes
to a de-duplication step that runs on collections of these obligations, which
reduced both the compile time and peak memory usage of this crate by almost 7x!
It also gave icount wins of up to 4% across a number of secondary benchmarks.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that some recent improvements I made to Cachegrind,
were very helpful with all of the above PRs. I wrote about these changes in a
<a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/05/03/valgrind-3.21-is-out.html">previous
post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="general-progress">General Progress</h2>

<p>For the period 2023-03-22 to 2023-08-24 we had some excellent overall
performance results.</p>

<p>First,
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=wall-time&amp;nonRelevant=true">wall-time</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There were 513 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>454 of these were improvements, and 59 were regressions. The mean change was
a reduction of 7.13%, and many of the reductions were in the double digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=max-rss&amp;nonRelevant=true">peak memory usage</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Again, there were 513 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>492 of these were improvements, and 21 were regressions. The mean change was
a 10.53% reduction, and many of the reductions were again in the double
digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=size%3Alinked_artifact&amp;nonRelevant=true">binary
size</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There were 316 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>178 of these were improvements, and 138 were regressions. The mean change was
a 0.02% reduction, i.e. the wins and losses balanced out. Most of the changes
were in the single digits.</li>
  <li>If we restrict things to <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=size%3Alinked_artifact&amp;nonRelevant=true&amp;incrFull=false&amp;incrUnchanged=false&amp;incrPatched=false&amp;debug=false&amp;doc=false">non-incremental release
builds</a>,
which is probably the most interesting case for binary size, there were 24
improvements, 18 regressions, and the mean change was a reduction of 2.65%.</li>
</ul>

<p>For all three metrics, all but a handful of results met the significance
threshold. I haven’t bothered separating those results because they made little
difference to the headline numbers. As always, these measurements are done on
Linux.</p>

<p>Overall these are excellent results which will translate into meaningful speed
and memory usage improvements for many Rust users, and continue a long line of
steady improvements over a number of years. Thank you to everyone who
contributed!</p>

<h2 id="bigger-improvements">Bigger improvements?</h2>

<p>In a Reddit discussion one person
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/158tcel/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/jtcrlwi/">questioned</a>
the value of incremental improvements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to ask: are optimizations like these the right path forward?</p>

  <p>I don’t mean to diminish your work, i’ve been reading your posts for a long
time and i know a lot of effort goes into improving rustc and how many
experiments don’t pan out but i always get the impression that even when they
do, it’s a couple percent at most and often only on specific benchmarks.</p>

  <p>This doesn’t seem to be the path towards the 10x improvements which many
people wish for. Is something like that even possible and what architectural
changes would be necessary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I admit this question tested my patience. (Have I thought of making big
improvements instead of small improvements? Yes. Yes, I have.) But I will
assume it was asked in good faith, and provide some thoughts in response.</p>

<p>Anyone waiting for 10x improvements is likely to be disappointed. I don’t see
that happening, except for the occasional unusual program (such as the chess
engine case mentioned above).</p>

<p>The compiler is a large, mature project. It’s well over 10 years old, and
hundreds of thousands of lines. Projects like that tend to not get quantum
leaps in performance. Many small improvements is more typical.</p>

<p>Rust is a difficult language to compile quickly. Brian Anderson has a whole
series of blog posts about this:
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/rust-compilation-model-calamity/">1</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/generics-and-compile-time-in-rust/">2</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/rust-huge-compilation-units/">3</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/reasons-rust-compiles-slowly/">4</a>. Some of the
points made are now out of date, and I find the overall a tone a little
sensationalistic, but there is some truth to it. In short, there were numerous
design trade-offs made during Rust’s design, and compile times got the short
end of the stick almost every time.</p>

<p>There have been a number of large improvements in the past, and there may be
some more coming. There have also been some failed attempts at large
improvements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incremental compilation can make a huge difference, perhaps not 10x, but
certainly 3-5x in many cases. The implementation has its issues (it has
been temporarily disabled a couple of times due to bugs) but many people
are benefiting from it every day.</li>
  <li>The parallel back-end makes a huge difference. Try compiling with
<code>codegen-units=1</code> and you’ll get slightly higher code quality but it might
take 2x or more longer. There are many trade-offs with this kind of thing,
though, as I touched on earlier.</li>
  <li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/evaluating-pipelined-rustc-compilation/10199">Pipelined
compilation</a>
greatly increased inter-procedural parallelism, giving speedups of up to
1.8x.</li>
  <li>The parallel front-end is under active development, and will hopefully be
shipped soon. We have seen 2x speedups in some cases. Getting it working
has been a multi-year effort; it’s a difficult project.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">Cranelift backend</a>
has been in development for a number of years. A primary goal is to improve
compile times. It is a large piece of work, and is still experimental.</li>
  <li><a href="https://davidtw.co/media/masters_dissertation.pdf">Polymorphization</a> is an
optimization that aims to reduce the cost of monomorphization of generic
code. There is a partial implementation that provide modest speed
improvements and is not stable enough to be on by default. I think this is
basically because compilers are complex and sometimes reasonable ideas are
just really hard to get working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compilers involve giant tree structures, with lots of allocations, pointer
chasing, and data-dependent multi-way branches. All the things that modern
microarchitectures handle poorly. There is research into different designs that
avoid these problems, but they involve data structures that can be highly
non-ergonomic. And it’s hard to radically change the data structures used in a
mature compiler.</p>

<p>All of this ignores what might be called performance “dark matter”: the many
bug fixes and functional improvements that have gone into the compiler without
regressing performance. (Or that did slightly regress performance, but which
have been balanced out by other improvements.) A great example of this is the
NLL borrow checker that shippped in 2018, which I think is the single biggest
improvement to Rust since 1.0. It was performance neutral, but only because a
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/11/06/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018-nll-edition/">great deal of
work</a>
went into its performance before shipping, which resulted in some cases
reducing compile times and peak memory use by <strong>50x</strong>. Another good example is
the excellent error messages that the compiler is famous for; a lot of care
goes into keeping those as cheap as possible.</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer that small improvements add up, in just about any part of
life, and compiler performance is no difference. I have a knack for finding
these improvements and the persistence to keep at it. I’ve been writing these
posts for a long time, and I typically report 3-10% improvements every 3-6
months, due to my work and that of many others. Visit the <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/dashboard.html">performance
dashboard</a> and you’ll see things
like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://nnethercote.github.io/images/2023/08/25/dashboard-debug.png" alt="Graph showing improving debug compile times since Rust 1.28"></p>

<p>The improvements over time have been consistent enough that there has been
<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/log.20scale.20for.20the.20dashboard">discussion</a>
about whether the y-axis scale on these graphs should be linear or logarithmic.
I’d love to have 10x wins, but in their absence, a steady grind of small
improvements is absolutely worthwhile.</p>

Chromosome X and Y components of the assembly string graph built from HiFi reads, detected based on node sequence alignments to T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38 references. Each node is colored according to the excess of paternal-specific (blue) and maternal-specific (red) k-mers, obtained from parental Illumina reads, indicating if they exclusively belong to chromosome Y or X, respectively. Most complicated tangles are localized within the heterochromatic satellite region on the Y q-arm. The X and Y subgraphs are connected in PAR1 and PAR2. Graph discontinuities are due to a lack of HiFi sequence coverage in these regions caused by contextual sequencing bias, with 9 out of 11 observed breaks falling within PAR1 on either chromosome (5 out of 5 for chromosome Y). Note that for visualization purposes the length of shorter nodes is artificially increased making the extent of the tangles appear larger than reality. <b>b</b>. The effects of manual pruning and semi-automated ONT read integration is illustrated from top to bottom.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>On a recent cross-country trip—I (Paul) drove from California to Illinois and back again. On the drive, I saw a sign I had never seen before: In a McDonald’s window it said </span><strong>$1,000 SIGNING BONUS</strong><span>. That was not a thing when I was a teenager doing minimum-wage jobs. No one paid you $1,000 signing bonuses to work for fast-food restaurants.&nbsp;</span></p><p>These bonuses have been around for a few years now, having started during Covid when the U.S. workforce fell into a wormhole and disappeared. But instead of going away, they persist, and bonuses have seemingly gotten even larger.&nbsp;</p><p>This got us thinking, unsurprisingly. It ties into a theme we have been rolling around, one we’re passionate about. Explaining what is going on, why it is important, and its relevance for investing will require some groundwork, so bear with us for a few paragraphs.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a persistent structural imbalance in the U.S. workforce: too few people for all the jobs, for the most part. It resists all efforts to reduce it, driven by a host of factors, including demand growth, an aging society, retirements, lower immigration, and skill mismatches, all of which conspire to create an unprecedented shortage of workers.</p><p>You can see some of this in the participation rate among U.S. workers.

While the U.S. civilian labor force is larger than it was pre-Covid, so is the U.S. economy. If the labor force had continued to grow more or less in line with history and GDP, we’d have almost 5 million more workers out there. But we don’t. The gap is shrinking—it was closer to 7 million a year ago—but it is still a very large number, and, given retirements, skill mismatches, and aging, it seems unlikely we will close that gap quickly, if ever.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png" width="865" height="555" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:555,&quot;width&quot;:865,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It is important to be nuanced about this. The missing jobs are not in all areas. Arguably, we still have too many people in technology company middle management. For example, all eight of the Google-based authors of the seminal “transformers” paper that helped spark the current wave of large language models have now left Google to start various AI companies. As a friend and long-ago former Google employee reminded us, that is more people than there were senior vice presidents at Google in 2004. Technology is not, with a few exceptions, where jobs are going wanting.&nbsp;</p><p>But almost everywhere else needs people. Badly. Across retail, restaurants, manufacturing, trades, and on and on, companies are struggling to hire. And this brings us back to the cross-country trip observation and that “signing bonus” sign in a McDonald’s window.</p><p><span>The absence of human workers has become a limiting factor on economic growth in the U.S. Absent a wave of immigration, which creates its own problems, politically and otherwise, and doesn’t necessarily fill the observed skill gaps, something needs to change. Historically, when this has happened—labor became more expensive than capital—economies have responded with automation, so we </span><em>should</em><span> expect that again today.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, as promised, let’s circle back from demography and economics to technology, investments, and automation. As we’ve </span><a href="https://skventures.substack.com/p/societys-technical-debt-and-softwares" rel="">written previously</a><span>, what’s important about this wave of automation is how it is more skewed toward jobs that can be described as requiring “tacit knowledge,” where we know what to do but can’t always create programmatic ways of doing things. These jobs are not assembly lines, so simply throwing capital (orthodox automation) at the problem doesn’t work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>That is why, in a sense, the current wave of AI has come along at the </span><em>perfect</em><span> time. It is the first automation technology to be applicable to tacit knowledge, to tasks where we can’t describe in a linear ABC way how inputs turn into outputs. To that way of thinking, we should </span><em>embrace</em><span> and not fear the current wave of technological change, in that it can help with the observed shortages in U.S. workers, and do so in a replicable and continuous way, not unlike traditional automation.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The trouble is—not to put too fine a point on it—current-generation AI is mostly crap. Sure, it is terrific at using its statistical models to come up with textual passages that read better than the average human’s writing, but that’s not a particularly high hurdle. Most humans are terrible writers and have no interest in getting better. Similarly, current LLM-based AI is very good at comparing input text to rules-based models, impairing the livelihood of cascading stylesheet pedants who mostly shouted at people (fine, at Paul) on StackExchange and Reddit. Now you can just ask LLMs to write that code for you or check crap code you’ve created yourself.</p><p>But that’s not enough. We are quickly reaching the limits of current AI, whether because of its tendency to hallucinations, inadequate training data in narrow fields, sunsetted training corpora from years ago, or myriad other reasons. We are pushing against the limits of what current AI can do, and that has unintended consequences, which we will return to in a moment. Most observers haven’t realized this yet, but they will.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Our view is that we are at the tail end of the first wave of large language model-based AI. That wave started in 2017, with the release of the transformers paper (“</span><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46201/" rel="">Attention is All You Need</a><span>”) by those Google researchers, and ends somewhere in the next year or two with the kinds of limits people are running up against. It ends partly because of constraints inherent in the current approach, but also because of technological and cost limits related to training models, whether wide or narrow. This wave has been terrific for a few companies, especially Nvidia, but it will be thought of in the future as mostly about piping the AI house, at most. The key component of this current wave is that it is characterized by scarcity—training data, models, chips, and AI engineers—and the accompanying high costs that scarcity brings.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Before explaining which waves come next, and what that will mean, we will now digress into why it’s so important we rethink how we think about automation. Because there is a huge risk that we don’t, and this opportunity goes wanting. And that is to take nothing away from legitimate concerns, like existential risk, but we have a near-term problem: The workforce wormhole is eating the economy.&nbsp;</p><p><span>In an important 2019 paper (“</span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.2.3" rel="">Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor</a><span>”) by Acemoglu and Restrepo, the authors develop and test important ideas about the nature of automation. While the models are highly quantitative, they can be summarized in simpler terms. In essence, the authors show that for automation to have widespread benefits it must deliver high productivity gains to more than compensate for the high displacement of workers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here are the authors from the paper itself: ”...automation always reduces the labor share in value-added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity”. Of course, there are opposing forces, as they say: “The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage”. In other words, and this is a trope often delivered nuance-free by technology boosters, </span><em>technology’s displacement effects can be outweighed if new tasks are created where labor has an advantage over automation</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This is a huge “if.” Not all waves of automation create jobs as speedily as they displace them. And, even more importantly for our purposes, not all waves of automation deliver bursts of productivity that compensate for the displacement. Acemoglu and Restrepo coined the phrase “so-so automation” for a particularly insidious and increasingly common form of tech-enabled automation, where there is high worker displacement without commensurate productivity gains impact—where minimal human flourishing is created.&nbsp;</p><p>Has this happened? All the time, Acemogul and Restrepo show. And, worryingly, it is happening increasingly frequently in recent decades, blinding us to the effects of so-so automation on productivity gains:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.</p></blockquote><p><span>You can see their idea in schematic terms in the following 2x2 grid. So-so automation is in the top right; the kind of automation we want, which we think of as flourishing, is in the bottom right quadrant. We should never confuse these two forms of automation, given that high worker displacement must be more than compensated for by high productivity gains if we are to avoid massive economic disruption, especially in an economy where workers are scarce and inflexible, as we have already discussed. The box in the lower right should be our goal, call it, by way of contrast with so-so, </span><em>“Zoso” automation</em><span> (Yes, that is a Led Zeppelin pun; yes, Led Zeppelin’s best song is still “Kashmir”), where we get worker displacement, but we also get even more explosive productivity growth.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png" width="1456" height="821" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>How do we know if something is so-so vs Zoso automation? One way is to ask a few test questions:</p><p>1. Does it just shift costs to consumers?</p><p>2. Are the productivity gains small compared to worker displacement?</p><p>3. Does it cause weird and unintended side effects?</p><p>Here are some examples of the preceding, in no particular order. AI-related automation of contract law is making it cheaper to produce contracts, sometimes with designed-in gotchas, thus causing even more litigation. Automation of software is mostly producing more crap and unmaintainable software, not rethinking and democratizing software production itself.&nbsp; Automation of call centers is coming fast, but it is like self-checkout in grocery stores, where people are implicitly being forced to support themselves by finding the right question to ask.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is a problem. These are all examples of so-so automation. They are happening all over, and they are typical of much of what many investors are investing in and many entrepreneurs are creating. These products and services will, inevitably, displace a huge number of people, but they </span><em>will not</em><span> drive human flourishing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So, what does this mean? It means we need much better AI. Or we need much worse AI. The second point first: Much worse AI would have minimal worker displacement effects, making it less economically fraught in its effects, and given that the U.S. economy can work within those limits. We are in a middle zone, however, with AI able to displace huge numbers of workers quickly, but not provide compensatory and broader productivity benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings us back to our wave theory of what is happening in AI. As we wrote above, we think, contrary to hyperbole, we are already at the tail end of the current wave of AI. We are bumping against many of its limits, which is, in turn, constraining the state space of what can be done with AI that drives explosive productivity growth versus so-so automation.&nbsp;</p><p>What comes next? In our view, the next wave will last until perhaps 2030, with a diversity of new models (like tree of thoughts models), ubiquitous/cheap GPUs, and an inevitable commoditization of LLMs with an accompanying explosion of open source. At the same time, the current era of massive, intermittently-updated models will seem quaint, like mainframe computers. The next generation will be lighter weight and much more specific, a good example of which is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where the old LLM mainframe becomes mostly a syntax and grammar generator. All the action is local and informed by proprietary data, whether real-time or historical, or both.</p><p>To get from here to there a bunch of things have to change. For starters, we need far better tools. For example, our current generation of developer tools are perfectly adapted for a world that no longer exists, and they are mostly being kludged with new features that make them more narrowly useful, rather than redesigned altogether. Without a change in the tooling, we cannot see past recency bias into the kinds of service that might drive explosive productivity growth. We will be trapped in that box of so-so automation.</p><p><span>We also need to stop thinking in such siloed terms about technology. It is possible that, with the right tools, the most explosive growth in flourishing-promoting automation will be in areas other than those where the last few waves played out, that is, outside white-collar office work. For example, there are early signs that, with minor advances, huge gains are possible in life sciences. We are already seeing new drugs and targets, new ways of </span><a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news/a-new-ai-tool-predicts-gene-expression-in-a-single-cell-71295?utm_campaign=TS_DAILY_NEWSLETTER_2023&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=271255795&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XITrAwTC_XX04YVnkpOAQpHWO2bKW2dZHyUrguBKPQQScHKlSSg76z1Iooq9ZaKvWWH9TnzGFVCcrJZ69RvwqqLmCHA&amp;utm_content=271255795&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">analyzing cell types and gene expression</a><span>, and so on. Our blinkers must not prevent us from being open to the idea that true Zoso automation will come mostly in unexpected areas, like biology.&nbsp;</span></p><p>At an even higher level, however, we need to break free from decades of recent thinking about what automation is for. As Acemoglu and Restrepo show in their 2019 paper, the productivity benefits of recent technology-related automation have been declining, with more and more of it being directed at low productivity displacement.&nbsp;</p><p>Decades ago, business theorist Michael Hammer made bank promoting the idea of using technology to reengineer society. It didn’t happen, partly because there was no way to do it with then-current technology, but mostly because reengineering became a consultant code word for cost-cutting and layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>This time can be different. By realizing where we are in AI waves, and by recognizing the limits of current technology, we can see why the limits of current LLMs already dictate what, how, and when we automate. Whether we do so will dictate whether this next wave leads to explosive improvements or just incremental so-so automation.&nbsp; We need to look past the limits of current AI technology if we are to break free from the past few decades of so-so automation and compensate for the gravitational forces dragging the U.S. workforce into that wormhole.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some paper and bamboo straws contain so-called "forever chemicals" that could make them a less-than-ideal alternative to plastic, researchers have found. </p><p>Scientists in Belgium recently tested dozens of straws from supermarkets, retail stores and fast-food restaurants in the country, and found that the majority contained PFAS — a family of synthetic chemicals used in the manufacture of consumer products because they can resist stains, grease and water.</p><p>The researchers sampled 39 brands of straws made of paper, bamboo, glass, stainless steel and plastic.&nbsp;Of those, 27 were found to contain PFAS, though the concentrations were low.  </p><p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19440049.2023.2240908" target="_blank">results</a> were published Thursday in the journal Food Additives and Contaminants.</p><p>PFAS, an acronym for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they linger almost permanently in air, water and soil. They are frequently detected in food wrappers, cosmetics, carpet, furniture and textiles such as raincoats or workout clothes. </p><p>Of the straws tested in the study, those made of paper were the most likely to contain PFAS: The chemicals were detected in 18 out of 20 brands. Four out of five bamboo straws sampled contained PFAS, compared to three out of four plastic straws and two out of five glass straws. All five stainless steel straws analyzed were PFAS-free.</p><p>Previous <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653521007074?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">research</a> in the U.S. has also detected PFAS in paper and other plant-based straws, among many other types of cookware and packaging.</p><p>Exposure to PFAS can be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html" target="_blank">associated</a>&nbsp;with low birth weight, high cholesterol,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.c-8medicalmonitoringprogram.com/" target="_blank">thyroid disease</a> and an&nbsp;increased risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33780327/" target="_blank">kidney</a> and <a href="https://www.jhep-reports.eu/article/S2589-5559(22)00122-7/fulltext" target="_blank">liver</a> cancers, but researchers are still learning about these health risks and aren't sure which levels of exposure are problematic.</p><p>Thimo Groffen, an author of the new study and environmental scientist at the University of Antwerp, said it’s not clear whether the manufacturers of the straws he analyzed are intentionally adding PFAS as a waterproof coating. Other possibilities, he said, are that PFAS accidentally winds up in straws during the production process, or that bamboo straws have trace amounts of PFAS due to plants being grown in contaminated soil.</p><p>Graham Peaslee, who studies PFAS at the University of Notre Dame and was not involved in the new research, said it's possible manufacturers aren't testing for the chemicals in their own products.</p><p>“All the straw manufacturers should take warning and say, ‘Hey, do we use this stuff?’ Because at the moment, they’re not even asking that question,” Peaslee said.</p><p>Groffen said straw users probably don't need to panic about their individual risk.</p><p>“This is just one very small source of additional exposure which could be easily avoided, but I don’t expect straws themselves to be very harmful," he said.</p><p>But he added that because PFAS accumulate in the body, people should ideally reduce exposures where they can: “It all adds up together with other exposure routes and the combination could cause health effects,” he said.</p><h2>Does PFAS leach into food and water?</h2><p>There is no federal limit for PFAS in food packaging in the U.S., though some states have their own restrictions. The Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/process-contaminants-food/authorized-uses-pfas-food-contact-applications" target="_blank">allows PFAS to be used</a> in certain food processing equipment and as a grease-proofing agent in paper food packaging.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, has proposed<strong> </strong>limits for PFAS in drinking water but not yet issued a final rule. </p><p>Keith Vorst, director of the Polymer and Food Protection Consortium at Iowa State University, said some of the straws in the study exceeded the proposed EPA concentrations for water. However, he pointed out that the researchers didn’t test whether PFAS leaches from the straws into beverages, or whether using a straw necessarily causes someone to ingest the chemicals.</p><p>Plus, Vorst said, he has detected far higher concentrations of PFAS in drink carriers, take-home containers and microwave popcorn bags. </p><p>“I have a little fear about, ‘OK, now let’s focus on straws’ when we have much, much bigger issues that are contaminating the environment,” he said.</p><p>Peaslee said the amount of PFAS that transfers from packaging to food and drink is generally minimal, especially if the items aren't in contact for very long.</p><p>“If you let a straw sit for a day, you’ll get some in the water, but how many of us leave our straw in the water for a day and then still drink out of it?” he said.</p><h2>Weighing the harms of paper versus plastic straws</h2><p>Various states, including California, Colorado, New York and Oregon, have banned plastic straws from food establishments in the last five years, and chains like Starbucks have phased them out. </p><p>The main reason is that the straws generally can't be recycled, so they wind up in landfills, get burned in incinerators or become litter that contaminates oceans, rivers, lakes and streams. Since plastic doesn't decompose easily, it can persist in the environment for up to 200 years, threatening the lives of marine mammals.</p><p>Paper and bamboo straws have risen in popularity as alternatives, but researchers said the cure is sometimes not much better than the disease.</p><p>“If they come with PFAS on them, they’re not so eco-friendly anymore," Peaslee said. </p><p>PFAS can leach out of landfills into water and soil, and have toxic effects on animals, including liver damage or reproductive issues. Groffen's study detected one particular compound that's highly soluble in water, trifluoroacetic acid, in five paper straws and one bamboo straw. </p><p>But Groffen said plant-based straws are still better for the environment than plastic.</p><p>"I still would expect plastic straws to be more harmful to the environment because of course you also have the degradation of the plastics into microplastics that can be consumed by animals," he said.</p><p>The researchers interviewed<strong> </strong>agreed that stainless steel straws are preferable over paper, bamboo or plastic, but they questioned whether people will adopt them widely.</p><p>“If we could all switch to stainless steel, that’d be great," Vorst said. "I don’t think it’s practical.”</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/aria-bendix-ncpn1294089"><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2022_46/3581042/aria-bendix-byline-jm.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581042/aria-bendix-byline-jm.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581042/aria-bendix-byline-jm.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/aria-bendix-ncpn1294089">Aria Bendix</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/ariabendix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:aria.bendix@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Accordingly, it is likely that the three colonies where rapid loss of fast ice occurred prior to this date will have experienced total or near total breeding failure, as emperor penguin chicks do not develop waterproof feathers until fledging. Some chicks may have survived on grounded icebergs (as may have occurred on Smyley Island; see below), but the percentage of the chicks that&nbsp;may have survived on these refugia is impossible to say from satellite images, which are of insufficient resolution to discriminate chicks from adults. However, as staining from three of the colonies disappeared entirely before December it is likely adult emperors abandoned these sites shortly after unsuccessful breeding.</p><p>Between the initial collection of Sentinel2 data in Antarctica in 2018 until 2022 the archive of imagery shows only one of the five colonies had witnessed sea ice break up earlier than December (Bryant Peninsula; 2010). One instance of break up in the five colonies in the 4 years of imagery is a likely hood on 0.04. In 2022 the loss of four out of the five sites led to an early break-up a likelihood of 0.80.</p><p>Below are reports for each of the five individual emperor penguin colonies in the central and eastern Bellingshausen Sea.

In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the sea ice in the bay did not break up until the New Year. A population estimate from WorldView3 imagery on 20th November 2021 (image ID 21NOV20142220) gave an estimate of ~3000 pairs. In September 2022 the colony was once again visible in Sentinel2 imagery, but very small—consisting of just 4 brown pixels. Between the 31st of October and the 4th of November the land-fast sea ice in the bay broke up. This ice had entirely dissipated by early December and no sign of any staining from guano could be found in the local area.</p><h3 id="Sec4">Smyley Island colony</h3><p>Smyley Island colony was discovered in 2009 by Landsat satellite imagery. Very High-Resolution satellite imagery has been taken of it during most years since then to reveal that numbers vary between 1000 and 6500 breeding pairs with a 10 years average of 3500 pairs (British Antarctic Survey data unpublished, in prep). These satellite records shows that the land-fast sea ice at the colony location remained intact until at least early December except in 2022, when the fast ice broke up some time in mid-November. In this year, the colony had split into two groups approximately four kilometres apart. In Sentinel2 imagery from early December, the sea ice had clearly broken up leaving only loose pack ice and a few large bergs. It appears that at least some of the penguins had moved onto the foot of a large berg which was grounded near the coast. Whether any of the chicks survived on the berg is unknown.</p><h3 id="Sec5">Bryant Coast colony</h3><p>The Bryant Coast colony was discovered in Landsat imagery in 2014. It has had a number of population estimates by VHR satellite imagery with numbers ranging from ~2000 in 2014 to 0 in 2010, which was the only year that birds were absent from the site. From 2010 to 2021, inclusive, multi-year fast ice persisted at the site, providing a stable platform for emperor penguins throughout the year. In 2022 the colony was visible in mid-November in Sentinel2 imagery but appeared smaller than normal. By the 25th of November, the sea-ice edge was approaching the colony location and by the 29th the fast ice had broken into pack. There was still evidence of brown staining on some of the broken pack ice. However, a few days later on the 2nd of December this brown staining had disappeared from the pack ice, suggesting the abandonment of the colony. No other evidence of the colony could be found in the local area.</p><h3 id="Sec6">Pfrogner Point colony</h3><p>Pfrogner Point colony was discovered in 2019 and only one VHR satellite population estimate has been conducted, estimating the population at 1200 pairs. It is one of the few emperor colonies that is situated on an ice shelf<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Fretwell, P. T., Trathan, P. N., Wienecke, B. &amp; Kooyman, G. L. Emperor penguins breeding on iceshelves. PLoS ONE 9, e85285 (2014)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00927-x#ref-CR16" id="ref-link-section-d95482762e605">16</a></sup>, as in all years of the Sentinel2 record (2018–2022), the colony has been located for at least some of the year in a creek on the ice tongue or on the shelf itself. In 2022, the brown stain of the colony was visible by Sentinel2 in the ice creek on at least three dates in October (9th, 22nd, 29th), although in all instances the staining was small and only encompassed between 7–10 pixels.</p><p>However, by 8th November the stain had disappeared and did not return in Sentinel2 later images. The abandonment of the colony was confirmed by VHR imagery captured later in the month (26th November). By the 12th December 2022, all the sea ice had dissipated. This confirmed that no penguins were visible, either on the shelf or the surrounding sea ice by this time. The reason for abandonment of the colony site if difficult to say with certainty.</p><p>The VHR imagery also revealed that the ice cliff leading onto the shelf was ~4.5 metres high (estimated from sun angle and shadow length) and that a snow ramp between the sea ice and the ice shelf existed at the foot of the ice creek. Earlier Sentinel2 images, in early October, show that the sea ice beneath the ramp appeared to have broken up to the ice cliff or just short of it. This would have removed the snow ramp and with it access colony. After this, the emperors would have to abandon the colony as they would not have been able to get back to their chicks. This did not happen in previous years as, due to the geometry of the ice shelf, the edge of the ice cliff was father back inside the creek which protected it from sea ice loss.</p><h3 id="Sec7">Rothschild Island colony</h3><p>Rothschild Island colony is the furthest north of the five sites, located in a bay between Alexander Island and Rothschild Island. It is a small colony, averaging ~700 breeding pairs. As of 5th of December fast ice beneath the colony remained intact, although several open water patches opened up close to the colony. Counts from aerial imagery taken from helicopters from the cruise ship Commandant Charcot on 20th November, showed that there were 820 chicks and 228 adults at the site. Subsequent Sentinel2 imagery confirmed that fast ice persisted at the site until 17th December and only began to break up on the 30th December. This confirms that some fledging was successful at this location in 2022 despite being in the in the centre of the negative sea ice anomaly. The location of the colony is in an embayment between Rothschild and Alexander islands and the presence of many icebergs suggest shallow water. The geometry of the bay and the presence of icebergs may have helped to stabilise the sea ice at this location and afforded protection from breakout until after the chicks had fledged.</p></div></div><div id="Sec8-section" data-title="Discussion"><h2 id="Sec8">Discussion</h2><div id="Sec8-content"><p>Since the use of satellite imagery to monitor emperor penguins first started in 2009, there have been isolated cases of catastrophic breeding failure due to fast ice loss across Antarctica. For a few marginal colonies, such as the colony at Leda Bay in Marie Byrd Land, this happens regularly<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="LaRue, M.

However, as yet, there has been no record of a widespread failure of breeding emperor penguins due to a regional sea ice loss affecting multiple sites before fledging in early December. Moreover, only one of the sites in our study region had experienced catastrophic breeding failure prior to 2022 (Bryant in 2010). Our finding of probable breeding failure across multiple, non-blinking, sites in a single season is without precedent.</p><p>Emperor penguins are known to adapt to breeding failures caused by localised sea ice loss by moving to alternative, more stable, sites in the following year. For example, at Halley Bay in Weddell Sea, the loss of local sea ice from 2016 onward resulted in the emperor penguins relocating their colony to Dawson Lambton Glacier, 85 km to the south, where the sea ice had remained stable<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Fretwell, P.

However, such a strategy will not be possible if breeding habitat becomes unsuitable at a regional scale, unless local refugia such as the one identified at Rothschild Island persist.</p><p>How sea ice, and in particular land-fast sea ice, will react to future anthropogenic induced climate warming is unclear and difficult to predict. Although it is difficult to link specific extreme seasons to climate change, a longer-term decline in sea ice extent is expected from the current generation of climate models<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Roach, L.

Since 2016, Antarctica has experienced the four lowest sea ice extents observed in the 45 year satellite record, with the two lowest years in 2021/22 and 2022/23. Whether these continent-wide conditions are symptomatic of an ongoing trend or a more episodic phenomenon is as yet unknown, and this question is currently a priority for climate and sea ice scientists. The regional anomaly in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas is likely to have been influenced by the Triple-Dip La Niña that is affecting many areas of the southern Pacific<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="WMO.

It is expected that as the La Niña weakens and SAM turns positive, sea ice extent in the region may grow. Nonetheless, our findings show a clear link between negative sea ice anomalies and emperor penguin breeding failures that may represent a snapshot of a future, warming Antarctica where such events become more frequent and widespread, with grave consequences for emperor penguin population viability.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9-section" data-title="Methods"><h2 id="Sec9">Methods</h2><p>The locations and presence of emperor penguins was assessed using two satellite imagery platforms. The primary source was ESAs Sentinel2 platform, part of the Copernicus programme. These data were accessed through the Copernicus Sentinel Hub, viewed in Sentinel Playground [apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground/] and downloaded using the Sentinel Hub EO browser [<a href="https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/">https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/</a>]. Sentinel2 imagery has been taken continuously in Antarctica since 2018 and collection can vary between several times per week to several times per month. All imagery taken between August and the end of December 2022 was assessed manually for the presence of emperor penguins at each of their five colony locations in the Bellingshausen Sea. Sentinel2 imagery has a spatial resolution of 10 m in the visible bands and groups of emperor penguins can easily be distinguished on the sea ice as they leave distinctive brown guano stains on the ice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Fretwell, P.

Here we assume that the presence of brown pixels is indicative of penguin guano staining and hence the location of their colony. This staining may exist for several days after abandonment until the next snowfall, so it possible that there is some lag in the dates reported here. To ensure the best contrast when using the Sentinel Playground browser, the custom parameters [B08*0.8,B04*0.8,B03*0.8] were used. These data were supplemented using Very High-Resolution WorldView3 data from MAXAR, with a spatial resolution of 0.31 m at two sites; Pfrogner Point and Rothschild Island. At Pfrogner Point (image ID 10300100DE30A800 26th November 2022) this image was used to confirm that no penguins were present. At Rothschild Island, the WorldView3 image could confirm the presence of emperors and enable a rough count of individuals. This count was later confirmed and re-counted by oblique hand-held aerial survey from the helicopters of the ship Commandant Charcot.

<p>Minneapolis, MN – High-tech surveillance video and audio communication from a Minnesota State Patrol helicopter, obtained and first published by Unicorn Riot, reveals some of the planning and tactics behind the largest mass arrest in recent Minnesota history. On Nov. 4, 2020, a multi-agency law enforcement operation kettled and <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2022/reportbacks-from-the-646-detained-during-minnesotas-largest-mass-arrest/">arrested at least 646 people</a> during a post-election-day <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2020/protesters-demand-elections-remain-untampered-across-united-states/">protest</a> calling for then-President Donald Trump to not ‘steal the vote.’</p>
<p>In an exclusive release, viewers are taken inside Minnesota State Patrol’s Bell 407 helicopter, <a href="https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=119SP">N119SP</a>, to see and hear the operations of authorities as around 700 peaceful protesters marched onto Interstate 94 in Minneapolis. Watch a condensed video highlighting the chopper’s camera capabilities alongside the audio communications <a href="https://vimeo.com/855175964">below</a>, and the <a href="https://vimeo.com/855179182">full hour-long video</a> further down in the article. </p>

<h2>High-Tech Surveillance Cameras &amp; Audio Comms</h2>
<p>The hour-long video obtained by Unicorn Riot records from when the protest marched onto the interstate until the authorities had the large crowd effectively boxed in, and stops at the hour mark. This is our third exclusive release of videos from <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/exclusive-state-patrol-spy-plane-over-protest-video/">State Patrol</a> and <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/shame-games/">Minneapolis Police</a> during and after the mass arrest on Nov. 4, 2020.</p>
<p>The State Patrol has two helicopters that are <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/aerial-surveillance-in-twin-cities-frustrates-alarms-residents/">frequently providing aerial surveillance</a> above the Twin Cities metro for a wide variety of reasons. Whether to assist police in tracking suspects, follow traffic patterns and accidents, or providing surveillance of protests, the abilities of the state’s aircraft is powerful. Publishing this video will help the public understand what the helicopters are doing, and more specifically, what N119SP is doing, while above protests. </p>

Because the protest was at night and it was dark out, the video mostly stays in infrared mode (IR) (showing heat emanating from people, vehicles, and buildings). At time to get more clarity, the video switches between other high-tech surveillance modes including high definition zoom video and a ‘blend’ mode which combines both image types for an increasingly revealing composite.</p>
<p>The chopper used their overhead spotlight to shine down on the protesters and surrounding area. Someone identified as trooper nine ran the comms from N119SP and provided several warnings to officers on the ground about random events that occurred. </p>

<p>Radio scanner audio traffic is heard alongside the video and features law enforcement communications to and from troopers on the scene, revealing details into their planning in relation to the large protest. </p>
<p>Troopers are heard giving and relaying orders of where to block off roads and exits to detour traffic from the protest and ordering Mobile Response Teams [<a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/msp/dashboard/Pages/specialty-units.aspx">MRT</a>] and Special Response Teams [<a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/msp/dashboard/Pages/specialty-units.aspx">SRT</a>] to the area. MRTs are units of troopers that respond to civil unrest. SRTs are units of troopers providing tactical SWAT operations. </p>
<p>Eight minutes into the recording, troopers radioed that they were set to let the protesters off the freeway, <strong>“at some point we will have to give those dispersal orders and give them a exit.”</strong> </p>
<p>Just three minutes later at 7:51 p.m., they reversed that decision, saying, <strong>“car 25 to all MRT units, there will be no dispersal orders. Ah, we’re just gonna take ‘em on the freeway breach.”</strong></p>
<p>About twenty minutes into the video, a trooper can be heard calling for <strong>“all available trooper resources,”</strong> and saying <strong>“they should be geared up when they get down here. In their personal protective gear.”</strong> </p>

<p>Not long after being kettled, some protesters started to escape the police by running up the interstate embankment and scaling a fence. Trooper nine saw this, zoomed in with the camera and relayed over the radio, <strong>“people at the back of the group are starting to jump the fence and exit the freeway onto 9th Street.”</strong> </p>
<p>The fence jumping continued and other troopers chimed in to ask if they had <strong>“any leeway to push”</strong> the protesters toward a different location to prevent escapes. Minneapolis Police officers were lined near the fences along with a unit of Mounted Police not long after.</p>

<p>Press began to gather on the roof of a nearby apartment building to document the massive police operation. </p>
<p>Upon seeing this, trooper nine illuminated the roof with the chopper spotlight and radioed, <strong>“you’ve now got people on the top of the building south of 9th Street, overlooking the crowds.”</strong> They continued to track the building even after the subjects left the roof.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the video, a green laser was pointed at the helicopter, to which trooper nine responded by asking over the radio <strong>“did you log, yet another, green laser strike from the group?”</strong> </p>
<p>Other troopers are then heard telling arresting officers to check all the belongings of the arrestees. Trooper nine chimed in again moments later, <strong>“if you come across the guy with the green laser, let’s take him with the gross misdemeanor.”</strong> </p>

<p>Authorities ended up <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/demands-to-drop-the-charges-on-amina-and-the-646-mass-arrested/">arresting and charging</a> then-19-year-old college student, Amina McCaskill. Prosecutors charged her with felony, second-degree riot armed with a dangerous weapon, the weapon being the laser. </p>
<p>Many months later, McCaskill’s charges were dropped. McCaskill’s case was comparable to <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2017/action-drop-charges-louis-hunter/">Louis Hunter’s charge</a> in 2016 after <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/tag/philando-castile/page/4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philando Castile</a> was fatally shot by police and thousands of protesters shut down I-94 in St. Paul. A riot on I-94 left dozens injured and over <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2016/protesters-blockade-interstate-20-arrests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 arrested</a>. Like McCaskill, Hunter was the single protester charged with a felony. Both Hunter and McCaskill are Black.</p>

<p>This is the third exclusive release of government videos from the two day span of Nov. 4 and Nov. 5, 2020. The first exclusive release was of <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/exclusive-state-patrol-spy-plane-over-protest-video/">video from the State Patrol’s spy plane Cirrus SR22, N115SP,</a> hovering over a protest the day after the mass arrest, on Nov. 5, 2020.</p>

<p>The second release was of body camera footage from a unit of Minneapolis Police <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/shame-games/">denigrating their own central command community engagement officer</a> as they were on an overpass of I-94 on Nov. 4. Another release featuring over 32 hours of body camera footage from officers on the ground during the mass arrest is to be released soon.</p>

<h2>Background on the 646+ and Related Coverage</h2>
<p>Nearly 1,000 people converged on the West Bank of Minneapolis for the Nov. 4, 2020, protest entitled The People’s Mandate. From families with children, to the less abled and elders, a litany of community members showed up to the organized march the night after a tumultuous presidential election. The family-friendly protest started with a rally with speakers and then a short march which planned to get on the interstate at Cedar Ave. and get off at the next exit, 25th Ave. and Riverside Ave. </p>
<p>However, law enforcement agencies who amassed with hundreds of officers wouldn’t allow the group to exit. Coming off the summer of the <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/georgefloyd/">George Floyd Uprising</a>, police tactics became more aggressive and sometimes violent. </p>
<p>Once the crowd was on on I-94, authorities used the opportunity to practice inter-agency communication and tactics for the then-upcoming Operation Safety Net, a convergence of local, state, and military forces working together to occupy sections of the Twin Cities metropolitan area during the <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/derek-chauvin-trial/">murder trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin</a> which started in March 2021.</p>
<p>Moreover, the night before the mass arrest, Minneapolis Police violently arrested over a dozen people who were participating in an <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2020/election-night-mobile-dance-party-blockades-uptown-police-arrest-14/">election night mobile dance party</a> in Uptown Minneapolis. Playing music, about 50 people danced through the streets, putting up barricades and spray painting political messaging on boarded-up businesses. <a href="https://vimeo.com/476770817">Watch Unicorn Riot video from the dance party and arrests here</a>.</p>
<center><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476770817?h=dce977a7a4&amp;color=FFEE00&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="640" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>
<p>After the large crowd entered I-94 on Nov. 4, many were shocked to see that the authorities had surrounded and effectively ‘kettled’ them. Once boxed in, the detainment and processing operation took over five hours for the authorities to complete. Authorities shut down large sections of both I-94W and I-94E for the most of the operation. </p>
<p>Unicorn Riot was live from the frontline of the protest and police lines for six and a half hours during the night of the protest-turned-mass arrest. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivTAS3L8j_8">Watch the YouTube stream</a> below.</p>

<p>The day after the mass arrest, organizers held a press conference outside of the Minnesota Governor’s Residence to decry the police actions and demand all charges be dropped. It was this presser in which we first published the capabilities of the State Patrol’s spy planes as we <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/exclusive-state-patrol-spy-plane-over-protest-video/">published exclusive video</a> from their Cirrus CR22 aircraft. Unicorn Riot live streamed the presser and interviewed several organizers afterwards. Watch in full in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jDxqV6ogI">YouTube video below</a>. </p>
