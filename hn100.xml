<p dir="auto">It's great when people get excited about things, but sometimes they get a little <em>too</em> excited. This an awesome (rigorous and respectful) and curated (I read every suggestion and make judgement calls) list of cold showers on overhyped topics.

<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> "Formal Verification is a great way to write software. We should prove all of our code correct."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Extensive literature review showing that formal methods are hard to learn, extremely expensive to apply, and often miss critical bugs.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> "Static Typing reduces bugs."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> A review of all the available literature (up to 2014), showing that the solid research is inconclusive, while the conclusive research had methodological issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Does not cover other possible benefits of static typing, like documentation. Does not address research on gradual type systems, like mypy or Typescript.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> McSherry is really good at optimizing his algorithms and has skills the average data scientist does not. Big data systems might be better if you have ad-hoc queries and don't want to take the time to optimize them.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> While Meyer calls out some problems, overall he's very positive about Agile and recommends it as a good (but imperfect) methodology.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> "If I formally verify my code, I don't need to test it!"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Researchers looked at three formally verified systems, and found critical correctness bugs in all three. The bugs were from "a wide range of mismatched assumptions" and caused servers to crash or produce wrong data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Most bugs were at the system boundaries; none were found in the implemented protocols. Formally verified systems, while not perfect, were considerably less buggy than unverified systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong>  Systems were verified with Coq and Z3. Further discussion at <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/05/29/an-empirical-study-on-the-correctness-of-formally-verified-distributed-systems/" rel="nofollow">The Morning Paper</a>.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> "Identifiers should be self-documenting! Use full names, not abbreviations."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Researchers had programmers fix bugs in a codebase, either with all of the identifiers were abbreviated, or where all of the identifiers were full-words. They found no difference in time taken or quality of debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Only applies to fixing bugs. Otherwise watertight. This is honestly one of the most rigorous and comprehensive papers I've ever read.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> camelCase is easier to read than under_score. So it is a best practice to
use camelCase in variable names, function names, and other identifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Several research papers have been done. But when eye-tracking software was
used to test the claim, two conclusions emerged: (1) developers are equally accurate
regardless of style, but (2) the under_score style can be processed faster and easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> The study's sample size was small (15 people), and "Subjects were
historically trained mostly in the underscore identifier style and were all programmers."
In the study, subjects were presented terms in isolation (not in blocks of code). Thus,
as the study notes, there could be variance due to context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong> "The interaction of Experience with Style indicates that novices benefit
twice as much with respect to time, with the underscore style.
"This paper purports to remedy difficulties in an earlier paper entitled
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=BD104CB69764CBBB36249528028E19B7?doi=10.1.1.158.9499&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" rel="nofollow">To CamelCase or Under_score</a>,
which concluded that with training, camelCase is more accurately processed. Finally, neither
paper seems to have analyzed whether native language comes into play (e.g. whether it is
easier for non-native English speakers to understand camelCase versus under_score).</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> "Microservices! Microservices!"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Presents five fallacies of "why microservices solve problems monoliths have" and shows how either monoliths don't actually have those problems or that microservices make the problem even worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Abstract arguments and experience, no case studies or examples.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00602" rel="nofollow">VM Warmup Blows Hot and Cold</a></h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype</strong>: Your favourite programming language has been updated. The new
version makes impressive performance improvement claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower</strong>: Benchmarking modern programming languages under near-ideal
circumstances, just for longer than before, suggests that we have not been
benchmarking language implementations as accurately as we might wish. Many
benchmarks slow down over time. Some never stabilise. Many benchmarking
experiments will not be repeatable due to non-determinism. Warmup time is
important, but is usually either ignored, or reported inaccurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats</strong>: Only evaluates the x86_64 architecture, and for only two
operating systems (Linux and OpenBSD). Experiment conducted in 2017 (prior to
meltdown patching). Evaluates mainly JITted language implementations
(although C benchmarks were included).</p>
</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> "Scaling out is better than scaling up. Cloud is more scalable than bare metal."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Expensify found that running a single bare-metal server was both faster and cheaper than using a x1e.32xlarge EC2 instance. By using one server, they could avoid sharding their data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Does not cover if scaling out bare metal has the same advantages over scaling out EC2 (assuming you can afford sharding). Can't really compare how much cheaper the bare metal is because they don't list the cost. I'm guessing their servers are 100k each? No basis for that guess though.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://songlh.github.io/paper/go-study.pdf" rel="nofollow">Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in Go (PDF)</a></h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> Compared to other languages, Go's concurrency system of goroutines and channels is easier to understand, easier to use, and is less prone to bugs and memory leaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> According to an empirical study by Tu, <em>et al</em>, there are plenty of concurrency-related bugs related to the difficulty in understanding and following the concurrency features and patterns provided by Go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> This study is specific to Go. Though other languages provide similar facilities, they are not covered in this article. Also, the types of bugs seen with channels and shared memory are different. Channels lead to more blocking bugs (deadlocks, dangling channels) while shared-memory lead to more nonblocking bugs (race conditions, dirty reads).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong> "We studied six popular Go software including Docker, Kubernetes, and gRPC. We analyzed 171 concurrency bugs in total, with more than half of them caused by non-traditional, Go-specific problems"</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ever since I visited my first web site (via a slow modem to a library BBS running a text-based web browser), I have been ceaselessly pondering the nature of the web. I knew from my first experience visiting a site as a young child, that the web (and the internet in general) was going to profoundly re-architect our culture. A re-architecting that would be so radical, so complicated, and so fast paced, that we would likely evolve alongside those changes in a way that none of us would really predict or understand. And I knew that we would make some big mistakes along the way.. because we had no idea what the hell we were doing.</p>

<p>One of those big mistakes we made was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">Dot-Com Bubble</a>, where novel ideas for web startups were turned into trumped-up card bets. There were some great ideas and companies that came out of that period. But there were also companies that got too greedy, overvalued their companies to raise easy bubble money, and expanded beyond their ability to sustain themselves (a playbook that, hauntingly to me, seems quite at home with the current startup climate). Massive web corporations flush with stock market cash acquired startups for billions of dollars, like rich brats that wanted a cool new toy, but then quickly got tired of it and threw it away. And in the end, we lost a lot of great ideas, companies, <strong>and user content</strong> that would have otherwise prospered.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/yahoo-writes-geocities-obituary-109042500035_1.html">This is essentially what happened to GeoCities.</a></strong></p>

<p>A lot of people have mistakenly told me that GeoCities was shut down because it was a bad idea, or because it was “too old”, or because people didn’t want to make and visit web sites anymore. The problem is that it ignores the internal problems that would be the real cause of its demise. Yahoo! acquired GeoCities in 1999 for $3.57 billion in bubble stock, and at the time (and perhaps still today) had <a href="http://waxy.org/2013/04/the_death_of_upcomingorg">a toxic approach to acquisitions</a> that would effectively ruin the startups they acquired. Everyone is holding their breath on the Tumblr acquisition to see if they learned their lessons from the previous failures. Hopefully they did.</p>

<p>When Yahoo shut down GeoCities, they did much more than delete a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_baby">obnoxious dancing baby GIFs</a> and <a href="http://www.midiworld.com/files/1067">Limp Bizkit MIDI files</a>. <strong>They deleted the ability for people (both old and new to the web) to easily create web sites, and be in complete control of the content and presentation they provide to their audience.</strong></p>

<p>Sure, some of the old sites weren’t “great”. But they were fun, and quirky, and interesting. We used to call it “surfing” the web, and that was actually a good way to describe it. There was a certain adventure to the activity - a fun and excitement in exploring the unknown.</p>

<p>Go to a Facebook profile, and ponder what we have now. Instead of having adventures into the great unknowns of the web, we instead now spend most of our time on social networks: boring, suburban gated communities, where everybody’s “profile” looks exactly the same, and presents exactly the same content, in the same arrangement. Rarely do we create things on these networks; Instead, we consume, and report on our consumption. The uniformity and blandness rival something out of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel%C3%A1k">Soviet bloc residential apartments corridor</a>. And now adding to that analogy, we’ve found out that our government is actually spying on us while we’re doing it, <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/26/195045/memories-of-stasi-color-germans.html">in ways the Stasi could only dream of</a>. <strong>The web we have today is a sad, pathetic, consumption-oriented digital iron curtain, and we need to change that.</strong></p>

<p>This is why my goal with <a href="http://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a> is not to turn it into a GeoCities parody site, though I don’t really care if people use it that way. The purpose of this project is not to inspire nostalgia. <strong>It’s to rebuild the platform for us to be able to be creative again.</strong> To have sites that we can do whatever we want with. This is not nostalgia speaking. We really did lose our platforms for creativity and rich self expression online, and I want to help bring them back.</p>

<p>None of the technology we have developed has obsoleted what made the old web magical. It did not take away the joy of creation. It’s still fun to make web pages, you can still share it with every internet user in the world 24/7. <strong>And when you don’t have to attach your real identity to everything you do, it still doesn’t matter how old you are, what you look like, or what your social class is</strong>. If you have a library card and a few hours, you can make a web site on NeoCities.</p>

<p>In fact, the technology has made it better. We now have incredible tools for making web pages that don’t look like crap, and don’t randomly break on different web browsers. Now we have HTML5, which enables very powerful web sites. Like <a href="http://mlpfim.neocities.org/">this amazing site</a>, an interactive episode guide to the show My Little Pony, which looks fantastic and uses your browser database for storage (I <em>dare</em> you to make it half as good with your over-engineered, poorly scalable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP stack</a>). And we have great CSS frameworks like <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> and a new, even simpler one that <a href="https://twitter.com/scottohara">Scott O’Hara</a> is working on called <a href="http://groundfloor.neocities.org/">Ground Floor</a>, that makes web sites look pretty good <strong>even if the designer doesn’t use or understand CSS at all</strong>.</p>

<p>After just one week of NeoCities, there are already over 1,600 sites, and even with that short time frame, <a href="http://dragonquest.neocities.org/">a</a> <a href="http://ninjabit.neocities.org/">lot</a> <a href="http://scientology.neocities.org/">of</a> <a href="http://eksith.neocities.org/">them</a> <a href="http://dyingtime.neocities.org/">are</a> <a href="http://mlpfim.neocities.org/">really</a> <a href="http://simonsroom.neocities.org/">good</a>. And there are <a href="http://neocities.org/browse">more sites being generated every day</a>. And there are people using the site to <a href="http://eleanor.neocities.org/">learn HTML</a> (something <a href="https://twitter.com/violasong">Victoria Wang</a> is working to improve, while also working on <a href="https://github.com/kyledrake/neocities-web/commit/4eaa8f7ace84f9062302666fd7997a2154b77a7e">building a really great design</a> for the site with Scott). If that much creativity can happen with one week (and with the site editing code in early stages), how much more creativity will come out of the next year?</p>

<p>Nothing scales like static HTML. It’s easy and affordable for NeoCities to host millions of web sites without having to worry about making a profit. Even the current 10 Megabyte limit on accounts is just a conservative start. <strong>We will be raising the limit to 20 Megabytes soon</strong>, and probably will be raising it much higher later as we learn what our scaling needs are. Part of the reason we will be able to do this is that I’m building some better servers that can handle <strong>2+ million NeoCities accounts</strong>. I’m paying for the servers out of pocket, which is tough for me because I currently don’t have a large income, but NeoCities needs and deserves it. <strong>The web needs and deserves it.</strong> If we are to break free from the consumption-oriented web we have today, we need more creative spaces like this.</p>

<p>My goal is to pay for the site through <a href="http://neocities.org/about">donations from contributors</a> and through supporter accounts. I will not be taking any money with dangerous strings attached to it, and I will not be turning it into a VC-backed startup. We need to maintain this as a sustainable resource, the same way that sites like the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> are. The <a href="https://github.com/kyledrake/neocities-web">source code to NeoCities</a> is available, for anyone that wants to help. If you like this idea, <a href="http://neocities.org/about">any and all help is welcome</a>!</p>

<p>With your help (and your creativity), I know NeoCities can be an amazing site. Thank you for making the web fun again, and for rekindling my love for it.</p>

<p>What are you waiting for? <strong><a href="http://neocities.org/new">Go make your web site!</a></strong></p>

<div data-testid="description-content">
<p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:286" dir="auto">This MR moves the most of the remaining backend lowering into NIR. Specifically, ftrunc, fcsel (when suitable) and flrp. The backend lowering paths are removed. This is a prerequisite for more backend cleanups, for example I have a MR ready to get rid of backend DCE for vertex shaders.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:1047" dir="auto">To be honest I tried to get this right like five times already, initially even before nir_to_rc and I always failed to make it work reasonably. The reason why this is more tricky than the usual lowering is the required pass order. In fact all the opcodes that we are lowering comes either from integer lowering (ftrunc) or bool lowering. We can't do bool lowering in the main loop in finalize nir (most notably because peephole select expects bools for ifs) and while early integer lowering is OK in tests and seems to work, Emma voiced some opposition to it previously. Therefore all of this now happens when translating to the backend IR. For the same reason there are some custom algebraic passes doing the same lowering that we would normally used the common nir_opt_algebraic. In an ideal world we would do the lowering before late algebraic, so if we lower the fcsels all all the way to add+muls we can optimally generate ffmas, but I couln'd get this right so we just emit ffmas directly when lowering the flrps that come from the fcsels...</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:530" dir="auto">Doing the fcsel lowering in NIR on R500 (we have a native CMP but the vertex engine has the limitation that it can't read from three different TMP registers) is also unfortunately much more complex than doing it in the backend, one needs to look through the fneg and fabs and also check whether constant and inputs will be copy propagated or not. In the end this is a lot of code, so in total this series is mostly even (NIR fcsel lwoering vs the TRUNC, LRP and CMP backend removal), but opens a way for more cleanups in a future.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:276" dir="auto">Shader-db-wise this is a bit of a win for R500 (by doing the fcsel lowering in nir, we still have info if this is fcsel_lt/ge or fcsel and we can save the comparison for the later case if we have to lower it), and mostly even on R300 see individual commits for detailed stats.</p>

Here are some examples you can play and clone (to start your own project).</p><p>* Anime Jester Companion: <a href="https://play.rosebud.ai/games/ba438cc4-246e-432e-b170-4e16948cd571">https://play.rosebud.ai/games/ba438cc4-246e-432e-b170-4e1694...</a>

ChatGPT, because we give users a chat interface for this code editor so they can describe the game they want to make and generate game code; Midjourney, because we let users generate assets inside Rosebud, 2D and 3D, to be used in their games; And Replit, because Rosebud includes a browser based code editor that lets you deploy your game instantly.</p><p>Sometimes, users generate a code base from scratch via prompts. Often a simpler place to start is to modify (“clone”) an existing project on Rosebud. In both cases, we need to eventually convert user descriptions and modifications of the game into edits and changes to the codebase. To solve this problem, we had to experiment heavily with using LLM agents in production. Our agent framework tries to follow the instructions of user prompts by deciding when and whether to call upon a number of generative models (some for code generation, some for asset generation, some for character dialogue, and some for game ideas). It also must decide where to insert code snippets when it generates them. Often, a user is asking for ideas or something too vague, and our agent has to decide when to ask for feedback and clarifications.</p><p>Not surprisingly, if we impose more constraints, on both the programming framework and game genres supported, our agent will perform better. However, the constraints on the types of games users can make and frameworks we want to support also constrains how flexible our platform is. Balancing these two factors, we decided to only support browser-based, JavaScript frameworks and focus on supporting AI NPCs that use LLMs themselves for dialogue and actions. This allows us to create abstractions that enable the agent to alter the codebase more successfully and guide the creator towards a more successful experience. Furthermore, we found that our beta testers are very creative with making AI character based games, and the resulting game is usually fun for players.</p><p>How does Rosebud differ from Roblox, Unreal, or Unity simply adding a co-pilot? Incumbent game engines optimized their user-flow and tech stack before the advent of generative AI, and many of their user-flows are well established. We have the advantage of designing this game creation flow from the ground up. It's not just about adding code completion to an existing code editing app and including asset plugins. Such an approach wouldn't fully harness the power of LLMs. We have a chat-first interface, and having identified the limitations of agents, we can create more safeguards for users where failure is likely. Our approach will make it possible for non technical creators to also contribute to making games.
Check it out for yourself!</p><p>To try Rosebud: (1) head over to <a href="https://www.rosebud.ai/hn">https://www.rosebud.ai/hn</a> for access to our Discord beta tester channel and a special role. (2) then go to <a href="https://play.rosebud.ai/">https://play.rosebud.ai</a> and use the code HelloHN to get immediate access. We have an array of trending projects that users can clone and mod to get started, including various character chat based games.</p><p>Here’s a video onboarding of Rosebud in action:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h99H3FefxU0&amp;ab_channel=RosebudAI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h99H3FefxU0&amp;ab_channel=Roseb...</a></p><p>Re business model, we plan on following in Roblox’s footsteps, i.e. keep it free for developers and take a cut of what they can charge users. Since AI tools cost more from usage than just hosting, we may have to evolve that model and see what the unit economics are (and separate a premium versus free tier for devs).</p><p>(Oh and in case you’re wondering why a YC S19 startup is launching now: we basically pivoted. We were always in consumer generative AI, but focused on images until this spring, but always wanted to focus on games–Rosebud is in fact a reference to the cheat code in The Sims. When code gen got good enough this year to work for UGC in gaming, we decided the time had finally come and switched.)</p><p>Some encouraging user feedback from our beta: “I have done some modding before, and I must say, this is much easier. Even when I occasionally need to code, the AI can answer all my questions and tell me how to achieve what I want. Normally, I would have to conduct numerous Google searches. What you guys have created is truly amazing.” “I’ve used Chat GPT to help me code simple games in Unity. This seems more connected and easier to work through.” “This is fascinating. This is ** amazing. Yeah, I know it's obviously early on, but already works for rad generative art. I'll say that much.” “Can finally call myself a game developer lol. Damn that sounds so good.”</p><p>We’re a small team working on this for the last few months, so a lot of things are far from perfect. Constructive feedback is very welcome!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><h2 id="origins">Origins</h2><p>Over half a year ago (in April, to be exact), I eventually decided to learn Rust for good. My previous attempt during the <a href="https://github.com/spetz/advent-of-code-2022">2022 AoC</a> had failed rather quickly, after a few days of completing the exercises - I finally realized that <strong>I needed a real project to work on</strong>. For the last few years, I've been dealing with the different kinds of distributed systems (mostly using C#), including the typical microservices architecture or Web3. Regardless of their nature, some sort of the messaging between the independent components was always required. I had a chance to use the tools such as <a href="https://rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href="https://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>, <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> or <a href="https://aeron.io/">Aeron</a> (just to name a few), as well as implementing the low-level peer-to-peer communication <a href="https://libp2p.io/">protocols</a>.</p><p>After a few months of trying to figure out (or just staying in the limbo I guess), what would be the best project to work on, I decided to build the <strong>message streaming platform</strong> (keep in mind that streaming is <a href="https://blog.iron.io/message-queue-vs-streaming/">not the same</a> as regular message broker). The other reason (besides getting to know Rust) was to <strong>truly understand the internals of the messaging systems</strong> and the trade-offs that were made by their developers - some of them being the sole implication of the theory of distributed systems (ordering, consistency, partitioning etc.), while others the result of the implementation details (programming language, OS, hardware and so on).</p><p>And this is how the <a href="https://iggy.rs/">Iggy.rs</a> was born. The name is an abbreviation of the Italian Greyhound (yes, I own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fabio.and.cookie/">two of them</a>), small yet extremely fast dogs, the best in their class.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggys.jpeg"></p><p>Therefore, what I want, or actually <strong>what we want</strong> (since there's a few of us working on it already) for Iggy.rs to be - the best message streaming platform in its class. <strong>Lightweight</strong> in terms of the resource consumption, <strong>fast</strong> (and predictable) when it comes to the throughput and latency, and <strong>easy to use</strong> when speaking of its API, SDK and configuration of the project.</p><h2 id="project">Project</h2><p>At the very beginning, Iggy had rather limited functionality, and everything was handled using the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/quic/">QUIC</a> protocol based on <a href="https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn">Quinn</a> library. You could connect multiple applications into the server, and start exchanging the messages between them, simply by appending the data to the stream (from the producer perspective), and fetching the records on the consumer side, by providing an offset (numeric value specifying from which element in the stream, you'd like to query the data) - that's pretty much the very basics of how the message streaming platform works in terms of the underlying infrastructure.</p><p>After spending a few weeks on building the initial version, and then another few weeks on rewriting its core part (yes, prototyping + validation repeated in a continuous loop worked quite well), I managed to implement the persistent streaming server being capable of parallel writes/reads to/from independent streams supporting many distinct apps connected into it. Simply put, one could easily have many applications, and even <strong>thousands of the streams</strong> (depending on how do you decide to split your data between them e.g. one stream for user related events, another one for the payments events etc.) and start producing &amp; consuming the messages without interfering to each other.</p><p>On top of this, the support for <strong>TCP</strong> and <strong>HTTP</strong> protocols have been added. Under the hood, the typical architecture of streams, consisting of the topics being split into the partitions, which eventually operate on a raw file data using so-called segments has been implemented as well.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_sample.jpeg"></p><p><strong>It was one of the "aha" moments</strong>, when reimplementing the parallel access to the data with the usage of underlying synchronization mechanism (<em>RwLock</em> etc.), optimized data structures e.g. for dealing with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bytes">bytes</a>, along with the <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a> <strong>work stealing</strong> approach, yielded the great improvements for the overall throughput.</p><p>I do believe, that somewhere at this point I had realized, that <strong>Iggy might actually become something useful</strong> - not just a toy project, to be abandoned after reaching its initial goal (which was sort of already achieved).</p><pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span><span> polled_messages </span><span>=</span><span> client</span><span>.</span><span>poll_messages</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>PollMessages {
</span><span>  stream_id</span><span>: </span><span>Identifier</span><span>::</span><span>numeric(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>,
</span><span>  topic_id</span><span>: </span><span>Identifier</span><span>::</span><span>named(</span><span>"orders"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>,
</span><span>  consumer</span><span>: </span><span>Consumer</span><span>::</span><span>group(Identifier</span><span>::</span><span>named(</span><span>"payments"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>)</span><span>,

</span><span>  strategy</span><span>: </span><span>PollingStrategy</span><span>::</span><span>offset(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>,
</span><span>  count</span><span>: </span><span>10</span><span>,
</span><span>  auto_commit</span><span>: </span><span>true</span><span>,
</span><span>})</span><span>.</span><span>await</span><span>?</span><span>;
</span></code></pre><p>After running some benchmarks (yes, we have a dedicated app for the <strong><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy/tree/master/bench">benchmarking purposes</a></strong>) and seeing the promising numbers (<strong>range of 2-6 GB/s for both, writes &amp; reads when processing millions of messages</strong>), I eventually decided to give it a long-term shot. Being fully aware that there's still lots to be done (speaking of many months, or even years), I couldn't be more happy to find out that there's also someone else out there, who would like to contribute to the project and become a part of the team.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_bench.jpeg"></p><h2 id="team">Team</h2><p>At the time of writing this post, <strong>Iggy consists of around 10 members</strong> contributing to its different parts. Some of us do work on the core streaming server, while the other ones are focused on SDKs for the different programming languages or tooling such as Web UI or CLI - all these projects are equally important, as they add up to the overall ecosystem. But how do you actually gather a team of open source contributors, who are willing to spend their free time working on it?</p><p>Well, I wish I had an answer to that question - honestly, in case of Iggy I wasn't actually looking for anyone, as I didn't think this could be an interesting project to work on (except for myself). Then how did that happen anyway? There were only 2 things in common - all the people that joined the project were part of the same Discord communities, yet more importantly <strong>they all shared the passion for programming</strong>, and I'm not talking about Rust language specifically. From junior to senior, from embedded to front-end developers - regardless of the years of experience and current occupation, everyone has found a way to implement something meaningful.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_server.jpeg"></p><p>For example, when I asked one guy what was the reason behind building an SDK in Go, the reply was the need of playing with and learning a new language. Why C# SDK? Well, the other guy wanted to dive more into the low-level concepts and decided to squeeze out great performance from the managed runtime. Why build Web UI in Svelte? At work, I mostly use React, and I wanted to learn a new framework - another member said.</p><p>My point is - as long as you believe in what you're building, and you're consistent about it (it was one of the main reasons why I've been contributing to Iggy every day since its inception, and still doing so), there's a chance that someone out there will notice it and happily join you in your efforts. <strong>Lead by example, or whatever you call it.</strong></p><p>At the same time, we've started receiving the first, <strong>external contributions from all around the world</strong> - whether talking about simpler tasks, or the more sophisticated ones, requiring significant amount of time being spent on both, the implementation and the discussions to eventually deliver the code.</p><p>It gave us even more confidence, that there are other people (outside our internal bubble), who find this project to be interesting and worth spending their time. And without all these amazing contributors, it'd be much harder (or even impossible) to deliver so many features.</p><h2 id="features">Features</h2><p>At first, let me just point out some of the properties and features that are part of the core streaming server:</p><ul><li><strong>Highly performant</strong>, persistent append-only log for the message streaming</li><li><strong>Very high throughput</strong> for both writes and reads</li><li><strong>Low latency and predictable resource usage</strong> thanks to the Rust compiled language (no GC)</li><li><strong>Users authentication and authorization</strong> with granular permissions and PAT (Personal Access Tokens)</li><li>Support for multiple streams, topics and partitions</li><li>Support for <strong>multiple transport protocols</strong> (QUIC, TCP, HTTP)</li><li>Fully operational RESTful API which can be optionally enabled</li><li>Available client SDK in multiple languages</li><li><strong>Works directly with the binary data</strong> (lack of enforced schema and serialization/deserialization)</li><li>Configurable server features (e.g. caching, segment size, data flush interval, transport protocols etc.)</li><li>Possibility of storing the <strong>consumer offsets</strong> on the server</li><li>Multiple ways of polling the messages: <ul><li>By offset (using the indexes)</li><li>By timestamp (using the time indexes)</li><li>First/Last N messages</li><li>Next N messages for the specific consumer</li></ul></li><li>Possibility of <strong>auto committing the offset</strong> (e.g. to achieve <em>at-most-once</em> delivery)</li><li><strong>Consumer groups</strong> providing the message ordering and horizontal scaling across the connected clients</li><li><strong>Message expiry</strong> with auto deletion based on the configurable <strong>retention policy</strong></li><li>Additional features such as <strong>server side message deduplication</strong></li><li><strong>TLS</strong> support for all transport protocols (TCP, QUIC, HTTPS)</li><li>Optional server-side as well as client-side <strong>data encryption</strong> using AES-256-GCM</li><li>Optional metadata support in the form of <strong>message headers</strong></li><li>Built-in <strong>CLI</strong> to manage the streaming server</li><li>Built-in <strong>benchmarking app</strong> to test the performance</li><li><strong>Single binary deployment</strong> (no external dependencies)</li><li>Running as a single node (no cluster support yet)</li></ul><p>And as already mentioned, we've been working on SDKs for the multiple programming languages:</p><ul><li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/iggy">Rust</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-dotnet-client">C#</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-go-client">Go</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-node-client">Node</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-python-client">Python</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-java-client">Java</a></li></ul><p>Please keep in mind, though, that some of them e.g. for Rust or C# are more up to date with the recent server changes, while the other ones might still need to do some catching up with the latest features. However, given the amount of available methods on the server's API and the underlying TCP/UDP stack with custom serialization to be implemented from the scratch (except for HTTP transport, that's the easier one), I'd say we're doing quite ok, and I can't stress enough <strong>how grateful I am to all the contributors for their huge amount of work</strong>!</p><p>But wait, there's even more - what would be a message streaming platform without some additional tooling for managing it? We've also been developing the <strong><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy/tree/master/cmd">CLI</a></strong>.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_cli.jpeg"></p><p>As well as modern <strong><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-web-ui">Web UI</a></strong> to make it happen :)</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_web_ui.jpeg"></p><p>Last but not least, we've got a fully-featured <a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy/actions">CI/CD pipeline</a> responsible for running all the checks and tests on multiple platforms, and finally producing the release artifacts and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/iggyrs">Docker images</a>.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_ci_cd.jpeg"></p><p>At first glance, it might look like there's plenty of features already in place, but for anyone who has ever worked with the message streaming infrastructure before, that might be just a tip of an iceberg, thus let's discuss the roadmap.</p><h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2><p>After gaining some traction a few months ago (mostly due to landing on the GitHub trending page in July), we've talked to some users potentially interested in making Iggy part of their infrastructure (there's even one <a href="https://neferdata.com/">company</a> using it already), and discussed what features would be a good addition to the current stack.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/gh_trending.jpeg"></p><p>Considering what's already there, being worked on or planned for the future releases, such as interactive CLI, modern Web UI, optional data compression and archivization, plugin support or multiple SDKs, there are at least three additonal challenges to overcome:</p><p><strong>Clustering</strong> - the possibility of having a <strong>highly available and fault tolerant</strong> distributed message streaming platform in a production environment, is typically one of the most important aspects when considering the particular tool. While it wouldn't be too difficult to implement the extension (think of a simple proxy/load balancer), allowing to monitor and deliver the data either to the primary or secondary replica (treated as a fallback server) and switch between them when one of the nodes goes down, such a solution would still result in SPOF and wouldn't really scale. Instead, we've started experimenting with <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> consensus mechanism (de facto the industry standard) in a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-cluster-sandbox">repository</a>, which should allow us in delivering the truly fault tolerant, distributed infrastructure with an additional data replication at the partition level (so-called unit of parallelization).</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/leader_elections.jpeg"></p><p><strong>Low-level I/O</strong> - although the current results (based on the benchmarking tool measuring the throughput etc.) are satisfying, we strongly believe that there's still (potentially a huge) room for improvement. We're planning to use <strong><a href="https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html">io_uring</a></strong> for all I/O operations (disk or network related). The brand new, completion based API (available in the recent Linux kernels) shows a significant boost when compared to the existing solutions such as <strong>epoll</strong> or <strong>kqueue</strong> - at the end of the day, the streaming server at its core is all about writing &amp; reading data to/from disk and sending it via the network buffer. We've decided to give a try <strong><a href="https://github.com/bytedance/monoio">monoio</a></strong> runtime, as it seems to be the most performant one. Going further, we'd like to incorporate techniques such as <strong>zero-copy</strong>, <strong>kernel bypass</strong> and all the other goodies e.g. from <strong><a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a></strong> or other relevant frameworks.</p><p><strong>Thread-per-core</strong> - in order to avoid the rather costly context switches due to the usage of synchronization mechanism when accessing the data from the different threads (e.g. via Tokio's work stealing mechanism), we're planning to explore (or actually, already doing it, in the previously mentioned repository for clustering sandbox) thread-per-core architecture, once again, delivered as part of <strong><a href="https://github.com/bytedance/monoio">monoio</a></strong> runtime. The overall idea can be described in two words - <strong>share nothing</strong> (or as little as possible). For example, the streams could be tied to the particular CPU cores, resulting in <strong>no additional overhead</strong> (via <em>Mutexes</em>, <em>RwLocks</em> etc.) when writing or reading the data. As good as it might sound, there are always some tradeoffs - what if some specific streams are more frequently accessed than the others? Would the remaining cores remain idle instead of doing something useful? On the other hand, tools such as <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/product/technology/shard-per-core-architecture/">ScyllaDB</a> or <a href="https://redpanda.com/blog/tpc-buffers">Redpanda</a> seem to be leveraging this model quite effectively (both are using the same <a href="https://seastar.io/">Seastar</a> framework). We will be looking for the answers, before deciding which approach (thread-per-core or work stealing) suits Iggy better in the future.</p><h2 id="future">Future</h2><p><strong>Why building another message streaming then?</strong> A few months ago, I would probably answer - strictly for fun. Yet, after exploring more in-depth the status quo, what we would like to achieve is sort of twofold - on one hand, it'd be great to deliver the general-purpose tool, such as Kafka. On the other hand, why not to try and really push hard the OS and hardware to its limits when speaking of the performance, reliability, throughput and latency, something what e.g. Aeron does? And what if we could <strong>put this all together</strong> into the easy-to-use, unified platform, supporting the most popular programming languages, with the addition of modern CLI and Web UI for managing it?</p><p>Only the time will tell, but <strong>we're already excited enough to challenge ourselves</strong>. We'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas and <strong>feedback</strong> - anything that will help us in building the best message streaming platform in Rust that you will enjoy using! Feel free to join our <a href="https://iggy.rs/discord">Discord</a> community and let us know what do you think :)</p><p>P.S.</p><p>This blog uses <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Rust</a>.</p></section></div>]]></description>

									The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706">Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen</a> is the best beginner fountain pen, period. Its durable metal build and smooth stainless steel nib ensure that your first fountain pen is one you can be proud of. The Metropolitan comes in three nib sizes (<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=4cb4dbdf7f3f31d2">fine</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=58abf2a2f635c8ec32ea692af29489e9">medium</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=6914ab5eaeccecd6039d36e7d078ad40b376adb49213ebba">medium italic</a>) and several body colors. It can be filled with Pilot’s proprietary <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Namiki-Fountain-Pen-Refill-Cartridges/ct/130">cartridges</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pen-Black-Plain-Fine-Nib/pd/12075/refills?&amp;f=64f61958cc42490f31a490a25ae468364ebf64e44e23854d">converters</a>—one is included!—which allows you to use any <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Fountain-Pen-Inks/ct/3250">bottled fountain pen ink</a>.
									</p><p>For those who like how the Metropolitan writes but would prefer a different body, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Kakuno-Fountain-Pens/ct/1984">Kakuno</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Penmanship-Fountain-Pens/ct/759">Penmanship</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Prera-Fountain-Pens/ct/410">Prera</a> all use the same swappable nibs. The Kakuno is especially charming thanks to the smiley face stamped on the nib, which reminds you which side should face up.</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>Most fountain pens are filled with cartridges or converters, but some have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Fountain-Pen-Filling-Systems-Explained/pt/912#Built-In%20Filling%20System">built-in mechanisms</a> that allow you to fill the pen barrel with ink. They’re not as convenient as cartridges, but they can be filled with far more ink. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-GO-Fountain-Pens/ct/5275">TWSBI GO</a> is a great place to start if you want to try out this type of filling system. Its spring-loaded piston mechanism is easy to use. Submerge the nib in ink, then press down and release the plunger to fill the pen.</p>
							
							<p>Are you still a little hesitant to try out fountain pens? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fountain-Pens/ct/5111">Platinum Preppy</a> is another beginner option. It has a budget-friendly price that won’t break the bank if you decide fountain pens aren’t for you. Plus, you can repurpose the pen by swapping out the nib for a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fluorescent-Highlighter-Pen-Tip-Refill-Pack-of-2/pd/2820">chisel tip</a> and the fountain pen ink cartridge for a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Highlighter-Ink-Cartridges/ct/3171">highlighter ink cartridge</a>. Now you have a refillable highlighter pen!</p>

									While most piston-filling fountain pens cost more than $100, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3">TWSBI ECO</a> is the best fountain pen under $50. It offers amazing value with its high quality piston-filler, and its sleek, clear body lets you see how much ink is left inside. It’s available in four nib sizes, including a fun <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=6914ab5eaeccecd6039d36e7d078ad40b376adb49213ebba_8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3">1.1 mm stub</a>.
									</p><p>You might be wondering, “Why should I pick the TWSBI ECO over the GO mentioned in the previous section?” It comes down to price, ink capacity, and style. The GO has a budget-friendly price, smaller ink capacity, and quirky design that might look a little childish to some. The ECO is a little more expensive, though its traditional piston mechanism can hold more ink. Additionally, it has a body design with more general appeal, including limited edition colors (<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">some of which</a> are over $50).</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>If the idea of a piston-filling pen makes you a bit nervous—or if you would prefer the convenience of cartridges—we wholeheartedly recommend the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Safari-Fountain-Pens/ct/1185">LAMY Safari</a>. This distinctively modern fountain pen has a triangular grip section that guides your hand into an ergonomic <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pen-for-Your-Hand-Grip/pt/454">tripod grip</a>. The Safari is made of durable ABS plastic. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-AL-Star-Fountain-Pens/ct/1184">AL-Star</a> is a little more expensive, but it’s made from lightweight aluminum.</p>

									The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-AL-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/1040">Kaweco AL Sport</a> is the best fountain pen under $100. It’s a stylish option for anyone ready to venture into more interesting fountain pen styles and materials. It’s both vintage and modern thanks to an iconic octagonal body design that was first introduced in 1935. The Kaweco Sport’s slogan—”Small in the pocket, great in the hand”—describes its appeal perfectly. Although the pen is small enough to fit in a pocket for <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Everyday-Carry-Stationery-Items/pt/46">everyday carry</a>, the cap can be posted on the back of the barrel to extend it to a comfortable size.
									</p><p>The Kaweco Sport is available as an inexpensive <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/3402?&amp;f=bfc2ef6f965adaf41e7007fbf57bff50_8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3_b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">plastic pen</a>, but we like the AL Sport’s premium feel. The aluminum build gives the pen a good weight and durability without adding too much weight.</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Brass-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/2462">Brass Sport</a> is a good alternative for anyone who wants a heavier pen, though we should note that its raw <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Brass-Pens/pt/337">brass</a> construction can have a noticeable scent.</p>
							
							<p>We also want to mention the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=873a409ab1e24078cf6022af66aea815">LAMY Studio</a>. It features the same steel nib found on the Safari fitted to a sturdy metal body. The Studio’s subtle, curving design gives the pen a remarkably sophisticated look. If you like the Studio and are willing to spend more than $100, you can pick up the stealthy all-black <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=f0cf9d16b892f5cd0a0d2415a7dca11f">Lx</a> with a matching steel nib or a fountain pen with a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=1914fdb7b0902f3495804bc50c319a60">14k gold nib</a>.</p>

									Although there are many sophisticated pens that any professional would be proud to carry, we have to say that the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876">Pilot Vanishing Point</a> is the best luxury fountain pen for writing. This fountain pen’s elegance speaks for itself, but its retraction mechanism takes it to another level. Just press the button on the back of the barrel to extend the nib. When the nib is retracted, a “gate” inside the grip section seals the nib and prevents it from drying out.
									
									</p><p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens-Standard/ct/1225">Standard Vanishing Point</a> is best for those with larger hands and comes in a range of finishes, from the stealthy <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876?&amp;f=3e29cb29569d6320_9f666c7890582192">Black Matte</a> to the stunning <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876?&amp;f=372172b339817c6c6272cd02ad9e29fb">Raden</a> series inlaid with real abalone shell. The thinner and lighter <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Decimo-Fountain-Pens/ct/544">Decimo</a> is ideal for those with smaller hands, or anyone who intends to write for long periods of time.</p>
								</div>

							<p>Some writers may find that the Vanishing Point’s clip gets in the way of their fingers. For an alternative that’s no less exceptional, you can’t go wrong with the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-2000-Fountain-Pens/ct/1542">LAMY 2000</a>. This fountain pen balances a striking design with understated style. Because it’s a piston filler, it has a high ink capacity that allows you to write for pages and pages.</p>
							
							<p>Is the LAMY 2000’s design a little too modern for your taste? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-3776-Century-Fountain-Pens/ct/3830">Platinum 3776 Century</a> has a vintage appeal thanks to its classic, cigar-shaped design with rounded ends. Or are you searching for an option with plenty of colors to choose from? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sailor-Pro-Gear-Slim-Fountain-Pens/ct/4019">Pro Gear Slim</a> would be right up your alley. Sailor regularly releases new colors based on seasonal themes, Japanese festivals, and more. </p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/354">Uni Jetstream</a> is definitely the best ballpoint pen for writing. It’ll undoubtedly change your mind if you think ballpoint pens are just low quality writing instruments swiped from restaurants and hotels. Like other ballpoint pens, the Jetstream can write on receipts and other surfaces that gel pens struggle with. And to make it even better, the Jetstream uses a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a> that provides a smooth, vivid, and consistent writing experience. 
							</p><p>The Jetstream comes in several body styles, tip sizes, and ink colors. This includes the comfortable <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Alpha-Gel-Grip-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/655">Alpha Gel Grip</a>, as well as a shockingly fine <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/354?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.28 mm</a> tip size that no other ballpoint pen can match. You can even get the Jetstream in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Multi-Pens/ct/858">multi pen form</a>, which includes several ink colors. Some even have mechanical pencil components!</p>

							If you want your writing instrument to have the finest tip possible, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381">Pilot Hi-Tec-C</a> is the best gel pen for you. Its <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381?&amp;f=f1d84bb55a3b087ba04e42ce0a1eb746">0.25 mm</a> tip can write neatly in the tiniest spaces, from book margins to planner squares. The Hi-Tec-C is remarkably smooth considering the fineness of the tip, and it comes in a handful of bright colors.
							</p><p>However, we must warn that such fine tip sizes will feel more “scratchy” than those found on 0.38 mm or 0.5 mm pens. A smaller tip size has a smaller surface area that comes in contact with the paper, and it puts down less ink that would otherwise lubricate the tip. Additionally, the 0.25 mm Hi-Tec-C may need to be primed with a scribble on a piece of scratch paper to get the ink flowing.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<p>We find these minor flaws a reasonable exchange for such fine lines, but the slightly broader <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381?&amp;f=df8f74e215697aa1cd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.3 mm</a> tip tends to perform more reliably.</p>
					
					<p>Those who prefer ballpoint inks should reach for the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5947?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">Uni Jetstream Edge</a>. As with the Hi-Tec-C, its ultra fine tip doesn’t perform as consistently as the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5947?&amp;f=6c955f272b074045a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.38 mm Jetstream</a>, but we’re still impressed by how well the pen writes. A 0.28 mm tip size is almost unheard of in ballpoint pens, and Uni managed to make a precise pen that still offers a smooth writing experience. You can even get it as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-3-Color-Ballpoint-Multi-Pens/ct/6234">multi pen</a>!</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Dry-Gel-Pens/ct/3703">Zebra Sarasa Dry</a> is the fastest-drying gel pen. Even the largest and wettest <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Dry-Gel-Pens/ct/3703?&amp;f=98b97b6ae48ce49ecd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.7 mm</a> tip size dried in less than five seconds on Rhodia paper, a paper that inks tend to dry slowly on. The Sarasa Dry puts down a wonderfully saturated line, writes smoothly, and comes in three tip sizes. Like many other Sarasa pens, this gel pen has a hinged clip that opens wide so it slides easily over notebooks and pockets.
							</p><p>As with many water-based gel inks, the Sarasa Dry smears readily beneath highlighters. Color-coders should consider using ballpoint pens like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211">Pilot Acro and Acroball</a> instead. Oil-based ballpoint inks won’t react to water-based highlighter inks, so you can go over your notes without worrying about smudges.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>Additionally, Pilot’s Acro ink is a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a>, so it writes smoothly without blobbing.</p>

							The most comfortable ergonomic pen will differ from person to person, with the best options depending on factors like hand size. Even so, we think the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-207-Premier-Retractable-Gel-Pen-0.7-mm-Silver-Body-Black-Ink/pd/8466">Uni-ball Signo 207 Premier</a> is the best ergonomic pen for most writers. It uses the same ink as other <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-Gel-Pens/ct/2576">Signo Gel Pens</a>, so it flows freely and glides across the page with little pressure. The pigmented ink is satisfyingly dark regardless of how lightly you write. If you <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pen-for-Your-Hand-Grip/pt/454">hold your pens tightly</a>, its squishy grip will relieve your achy fingers. In addition, the 207 Premier has a lightweight body with a low center of gravity that won’t tire your hand as you write.
							</p><p>If you prefer ballpoint ink, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-Ballpoint-Pen-Series/ct/857">Pilot Dr. Grip</a> is another excellent ergonomic pen. It has a carefully balanced barrel, and its double layer grip design is moderately soft without being too squishy or too hard.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The Dr. Grip, which is also available as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-4-1-Multi-Pens/ct/306">multi pen</a>, has even earned an “Ease-of-Use” Commendation from the Arthritis Foundation.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-bLen-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5949">Zebra bLen Ballpoint Pen</a> provides the most comfortable writing experience. Most people are unaware of how visual and audible clutter can affect their focus, but the bLen was created with stress-free writing in mind. The name is inspired by the Japanese word <em>burenai</em> (ブレない), which means non-vibrating. This carefully engineered ballpoint pen eliminates all the little rattles and vibrations which can cause frustration and distract us from writing.
							</p><p>Its minimalist design is beautiful and calming to look at, and will fit seamlessly into any aesthetic. We especially enjoy Zebra’s smooth and vibrant <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a>, which is darker and smoother than regular ballpoint inks. The bLen is also available as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-bLen-3C-3-Color-Ballpoint-Multi-Pens/ct/6030">three-color multi pen</a>.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>We also like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Calme-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/6500">Pentel Calme</a> and its clicker, which makes almost no sound. Its grip section has a leather-like texture that covers almost the entirety of the lower barrel, so your fingers have something to grip no matter where you hold your pen. Like the bLen, the Calme is available in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Calme-Multi-Pens/ct/6653">multi pen versions</a>, including some with <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Calme-Multi-Pens/ct/6653?&amp;f=e0522e1495ef94d7a231937c7b9d96eaaa3960751dda7ba6">mechanical pencil components</a>.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Gel-Pens/ct/2574">Pilot FriXion</a> is by far the best “erasable” pen. This remarkable pen offers the best combination of vibrancy, consistency, and “erasability.” It accomplishes this with a special thermosensitive ink that writes just like any other ink, yet disappears without a trace when rubbed with the hard “eraser” on the end of the pen. The friction generated by this rubbing action raises the temperature of the ink and turns it invisible.
							</p><p>The Pilot FriXion comes in several colors, tip sizes, and body designs so that you can find one that fits your style. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Series/ct/4201">FriXion ink technology</a> can be found in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Light-Erasable-Highlighters/ct/682">highlighters</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Colors-Erasable-Markers/ct/1123">markers</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Stamps/ct/2531">stamps</a>.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>FriXion inks are less saturated in color than standard gel inks. This is most noticeable with the black ink, which can appear gray. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Ball-Knock-Zone-Retractable-Gel-Pens/ct/6729">Ball Zone</a> improves the ink’s saturation so the black ink no longer has a green tint and the colored inks are more vibrant. </p>
					
					<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Pilot FriXion ink will “erase” with any heat, so don’t store your notebooks in hot cars or on top of radiators. Additionally, don’t use FriXion ink to take tests or write on important documents, especially those that need permanent signatures. If you accidentally make your writing disappear, you may be able to get it to reappear by placing the paper in a freezer that reaches below 14°F (-10°C).</p>

Not only can it reduce finger pain from repetitive swiping on digital devices, but it lets you change work surfaces without losing track of your pen.

	<p>The Best Pens for Left-Handed Writers</p>

					<div><p>
							It may not look like much, but the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Multi-Ball-Rollerball-Pens/ct/582">Pilot Multi Ball</a> is a fantastic rollerball pen for left-handed writers. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Multi-Ball-Rollerball-Pen-Medium-Black/pd/13782">medium</a> tip size dried within four seconds on Rhodia paper, which tends to make inks dry slower. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Multi-Ball-Rollerball-Pen-Fine-Black/pd/2760">fine</a> tip size dried within two seconds!
							</p><p>The Multi Ball isn’t just a great pen for paper, though. It’ll write on nonporous surfaces too, including glass, ceramic, plastic, and almost anything else. The fine tip size is perfect for signing the backs of credit cards without smearing.</p>
							<p>You may think that there must be a tradeoff to achieve this <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pens-that-Write-on-Any-Surface/pt/743">multi-surface</a> marvel, but Pilot didn’t make any sacrifices on the writing quality. It’s delightfully smooth on paper and produces a deep, dark line every time.</p>

	<p>The Best Pens for Journaling and Planning</p>
		
		<div>
				
					<div><p>
							Just about any pen can work well for journaling, but the JetPens team is especially fond of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pens/ct/262">Zebra Sarasa Clip</a>. Its vibrant pigment ink is smooth to write with and both water and fade resistant, so it won’t disappear if you accidentally spill a drink on your journal. 
							</p><p>If you keep a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Journals/pt/566">journal</a> like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Leuchtturm1917-Bullet-Journals/ct/4259">Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal</a> that you update with quick notations throughout the day, the Sarasa’s fast-drying ink will help prevent smudges. What really sets the Sarasa Clip apart, though, is its namesake clip. It opens wide to let you securely fasten the pen to a notebook so you’ll always be ready to make a new entry.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The Clip comes in a wide variety of hues for color-coding as well as tip-sizes from 0.3 mm to 1.0 mm to suit anyone’s preferences. There’s even a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Multi-Pens/ct/412">multi pen version</a> filled with Sarasa ink. Those who appreciate finer tip sizes should consider trying the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Nano-Gel-Pens/ct/6558">Sarasa Nano</a>. It uses an internal spring that allows the tip to retract slightly into the pen, reducing sideways force and preventing the tip from wiggling undesirably.</p>

							These <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733">Kuretake ZIG Clean Color Dot Markers</a> bring fun and versatility to journaling and planning. We’re big fans of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733?&amp;f=cd4aa3cda9bd1548bd4cf76df45d38a1">double-sided version</a>, which features a 0.5 mm hard plastic tip on one end and a wonderfully squishy dot tip on the other.
							</p><p>Depending on the pressure you use, the dot tip can make marks from one to five millimeters wide, though we should warn that pressing very hard can put a lot of ink on the page and cause bleedthrough. It’s easy and fun to make quick flowers and other fun doodles, or—for a slightly more practical use case—to highlight important dates in your planner or calendar. You can even make expressive brush-like strokes with the dot tip by varying the pressure as you draw!</p>

No matter which you choose, ZIG Clean Color Dot Markers come in a variety of colors, including <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733?&amp;f=ba2ad1cb79925347f016b234e8990fb2991ba285a8edabf6">metallic</a> options.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Board-Master-Dry-Erase-Markers/ct/3503">Pilot Board Master</a> is the king of school <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Whiteboard-Markers/pt/919">whiteboard markers</a>. Its highly pigmented ink delivers intense color that’s easy to read from across the room, and its thick tip is easy to control. Its dry-erase ink wipes away cleanly without leaving behind “shadows” on the whiteboard.
							</p><p>Best of all, the Board Master has an ingenious twin pipe feeder system that equalizes the pressure inside and outside the marker. Lines remain crisp, vibrant, and consistent down to the last drop of ink. You’ll never have to struggle with faint whiteboard marker lines again! Once the marker does run dry, you can <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Board-Master-Ink-Cartridges/ct/3504">refill</a> it, cutting down on waste. Even the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Marker-Replacement-Tips/ct/3505?&amp;f=36954fd9823cd2df">tips</a> are replaceable.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910">Sakura Pigma Micron</a> is a fantastic fineliner for lettering (and art, too!). Its precise tip allows letterers to make consistent marks for drawing monoline styles and elaborate letterforms. Its rich, pigment-based ink delivers vivid color that is archival quality and waterproof, so your lettering will last for years. This iconic pen comes in several colors and fineliner tip sizes ranging from <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=90a21b8d54b00f7e9554f72d2b1a94e1">003</a> (0.15 mm) for intricate embellishments to <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=0c76cccd3a5f8bf6a04e42ce0a1eb746">12</a> (0.7 mm) for text that stands out. Pigma Micron tips can be a little delicate, so use a light hand and don’t press too hard while lettering. Otherwise, you might bend the tips.
							</p><p>Other tip types including <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=9337a404131b90fa7df047e3c29eae93">bullet tips</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=0ddcea6bf85d451d32091cb827bdb85a">plastic nibs</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=7dd55fcb7563d511">brushes</a> are also available.</p>

							The best dip pen for lettering is the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Rohrer-Klingner-Glass-Pens/ct/6105">Rohrer &amp; Klingner Glass Pen</a>. It’s a beautiful writing tool and a unique work of art at the same time. A <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/How-to-Use-a-Glass-Dip-Pen/pt/344">glass pen</a> has a tip with spiraling grooves that act as reservoirs. Dip the tip in ink to fill the grooves. As you write, ink travels down the grooves to the tip of the pen. When the tip feels like it’s running dry, turn the pen in your hand to allow ink from another groove to flow to the tip. Glass nibs will never rust, so they can last a lifetime as long as they’re cleaned of ink residue. Be sure to store them in a stable area like a pen cup or tray, too: after all, they’re made of glass, and can break if dropped!
							</p><p>If the designs offered by Rohrer &amp; Klingner don’t strike your fancy, browse the different glass pen colors offered by <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/J.-Herbin-Glass-Dip-Pens/ct/724">J. Herbin</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Guridrops-Glass-Pens/ct/6952">Guridrops</a>.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>All glass pens are handmade by artisans, so no two will look exactly alike.</p>
					
					<p>Since glass dip pens are made of fragile materials, some calligraphers may feel anxious about accidentally damaging them. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Teranishi-Guitar-Aurora-Glass-Pens-with-Cap/ct/7097">Teranishi Guitar Aurora Glass Pens</a> have acrylic barrels and come with screw-on caps to protect their glass tips. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kakimori-Dip-Pen-Nibs/ct/7197?&amp;f=add42f28e0d80e67dacb8f62f5adf3e49e6ad08b7a4ff724">Kakimori Metal Dip Pen Nibs</a> are made from durable brass or stainless steel (though you’ll need to pick up a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kakimori-Dip-Pen-Nib-Metal-Nib-Brass/pd/40028/compatible#index=1">nib holder</a>, too).</p>
					
					<p>You can also try a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Iro-Utsushi-Dip-Pens/ct/6648">Pilot Iro-Utsushi Dip Pen</a>, which has a barrel made of plastic or wood. The nib is made of stainless steel and has a rounded tip similar to a fountain pen nib, so they’re less “sharp” than typical dip pen nibs and feel smoother on paper. You should still be careful not to drop the pen on its nib, but you won’t have to worry about glass shards if an accident happens.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Parallel-Pens/ct/165">Pilot Parallel</a> is the best calligraphy pen for broad edge calligraphy scripts like italic or blackletter. This unique calligraphy pen features a nib made of two metal plates stacked on top of each other. This allows the ink to flow between the plates and along the entire width of the nib for a juicy and consistent line. Its cartridge-filled design makes the Parallel particularly easy and convenient to use, and its <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Parallel-Calligraphy-Pen-Refill-Cartridges/ct/603">mixable ink</a> allows for fun gradation effects. This pen comes in six nib sizes for projects of all sizes.

Their archival-safe, pigment-based inks dry very quickly. We were able to paint over them with watercolors immediately and saw no bleeding whatsoever. And since Multiliners are made by Copic, they’re compatible with alcohol-based <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Markers/ct/3075?&amp;f=1b8763b30df3730297f215786bb046761f4737d59d8d7acd">Copic Markers</a>.

They’re also available in ten colors, so you can line your artwork in a different color for visual appeal.</p>

							<p>Artists who do a great deal of inking should consider the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pens/ct/686">Multiliner SP</a>. They require a higher up-front investment than their disposable siblings, but they’re <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pen-Refills/ct/2357">refillable</a> and even have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pen-Replacement-Nibs-Accessories/ct/3427">replaceable tips</a>.</p>

Unlike traditional drawing pens with metal tips that must be held vertically, the Graphic Liner has a rollerball tip that can be used at your natural drawing angle. Since it’s made of metal rather than felt or plastic, the tip creates consistent lines without fraying or flexing. This makes it especially suitable for beginners, but even experienced artists can appreciate its natural feel and waterproof, Copic-proof, and archival pigment-based ink.

							The best <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Manga-and-Comic-Art-Supplies/pt/956"><em>manga</em> pen</a> for art combines a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Nikko-Comic-Pen-Nibs/ct/3065?&amp;f=a220e003961af2ce">Nikko G Nib</a> with a nib holder like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Tachikawa-T-40-Nib-Holder-Natural/pd/4573">Tachikawa Model 40</a>. A G Nib has a sharp tip that creates both broad and thin lines ideal for facial features, action-packed scenes, and more. We recommend that beginners start with the Nikko G because it’s relatively firm compared to other G nibs. This firmness makes it easy to control while still allowing a satisfying amount of flex.
							</p><p>For consistent lines, try Nikko’s <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Nikko-Comic-Pen-Nibs-Standard/ct/3794?&amp;f=add42f28e0d80e67dacb8f62f5adf3e49e6ad08b7a4ff724">Maru Nibs</a>. Also known as mapping nibs, these stiff nibs don’t flex at all. They work well for precise details.</p>
							<p>Comic pen nibs can’t be used on their own and must be paired with nib holders. The Tachikawa Model 40 is our favorite nib holder for <em>manga</em> artists.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>Its double rubber rings can hold a wide variety of nibs, and its rubber grip makes it comfortable to hold. It even comes with a plastic cap to protect nibs during transport.</p>

							As its name suggests, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Series/ct/4076">Faber-Castell PITT Artist Pen</a> is a great marker for art. It combines the permanence and vibrancy of India ink with the convenience of a marker. Other inks can fade when exposed to light, but the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pens-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/309">PITT Artist Pen</a> uses ink that’s lightfast so you can confidently display your art. Because some colors are more lightfast than others, Faber-Castell prints a rating on each pen’s barrel to help you choose the right hues. A one-asterisk rating means the ink is lightfast for at least five years, while a three-asterisk rating is lightfast for more than 100 years!
							
							</p><p>Faber-Castell offers PITT Pens in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pens/ct/3076">marker</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Brush-Pens/ct/5181">brush pen</a> forms. And no matter which pen you prefer, it’s color-matched with other Faber-Castell products like <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-Polychromos-Colored-Pencils/ct/4107">Polychromos Colored Pencils</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-Albrecht-Durer-Watercolor-Pencils/ct/5448">Albrecht Dürer Watercolor Pencils</a> for consistency in your multimedia projects.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Royal-Talens-Ecoline-Watercolor-Brush-Pens/ct/4166">Royal Talens Ecoline</a> is the best watercolor brush pen for art. Its soft felt tip puts down swaths of bright, juicy color with each stroke. This softness means that it takes some practice to learn how to control the Ecoline, but it makes such wonderful lines that it’s worth it for this excellent watercolor brush pen. The Ecoline contains highly <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Watercolor-Brush-Pens/pt/952">water-soluble ink</a> that blends easily and can continue to be layered and blended after it dries. We recommend pairing the Ecoline with thick <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Watercolor-Supplies/ct/2941?&amp;f=ca1f8d859dd3bdb2">watercolor paper</a> because heavy applications of ink can bleed through thinner papers.

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090">Uni Posca</a> is consistently one of the most popular <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Paint-Pens-For-Arts-and-Crafts/pt/917">paint pens</a> at JetPens, and for good reason. Its opaque, water-based ink writes on a wide variety of porous and nonporous surfaces, including paper, plastic, wood, and metal. This marker has intense color payoff and is easy to remove from nonporous surfaces like glass, which makes it great for window signs. It comes in several different tip sizes from <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=6c3e2810f75bf0d14191bd7ebbc0e799">extra fine</a> to <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=0405f6b2421bcd951f4737d59d8d7acd">broad</a>, and there’s even a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=7dd55fcb7563d511">brush version</a> for lettering and art.

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-One-Gel-Pens-Standard/ct/6100">Uni-ball One</a> might look simple, but it’s hands down the best gel pen for coloring. Its fast-drying, bleed-resistant ink is specially formulated with large pigment particles that stay on the surface of the paper instead of getting absorbed into the fibers. Dark inks look darker and bright inks look brighter, so your <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Coloring-Books/ct/3582">coloring books</a> will be packed with vibrant art. It comes in tons of different colors as well as three tip sizes, all of which are smooth to draw with. Its simple white barrel is accented by a detail near the clicker, which lets you know exactly what color is inside.
							</p><p>Fans of the Sarasa—another popular colored gel pen—can take a look at the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-R-Gel-Pens/ct/6253">Zebra Sarasa R</a>. Its ink has 27% more color density than standard Sarasa ink, so colors are more saturated.</p></div>

							If you want a simple effect that still grabs your attention, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Hybrid-Mattehop-Gel-Pens/ct/7072">Pentel Hybrid Mattehop</a> is the best matte gel pen for art. It features an opaque ink that dries to a matte, plastic-like finish. Our JetPens team members especially liked the way that the Mattehop performed on glossy papers, like those found in yearbooks. It even shows up on dark papers, so you can write over backgrounds without worry. However, we found that the gel pen does take a while to dry, so be careful not to smudge your writing.

							Just like its matte and metallic cousins, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Hybrid-Milky-Gel-Pens/ct/5645">Pentel Hybrid Milky</a> is packed with opaque ink that makes it the best pastel gel pen for art. We love its bold 0.8 mm tip, which puts down smooth lines that stand out on light and dark papers. The water-based ink is acid free, so you can rest assured that your projects won’t deteriorate over time.
							</p><p>The Hybrid Milky is also available in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Milky-Brush-Pens/ct/6696">brush pen</a> form. You can use it to create lettering with line variation, or to quickly fill in large areas with ink. </p>
						</div>
					
					<p>If the Hybrid Milky’s six colorful hues are a bit too vibrant for your taste, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Souffle-Gel-Pens/ct/445">Sakura Souffle</a> might be what you need. It comes in ten colors and has a unique ink with a three-dimensional effect! This finish isn’t as noticeable on porous surfaces like paper, so we recommend saving the Souffle for photos and glossy cards.</p>

		<h3><i><span>Study reveals 75 percent of the world’s industrial fishing vessels are hidden from public view</span></i></h3>
<p><span><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> – A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06825-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study published today</a> in the journal Nature offers an unprecedented view of previously unmapped industrial use of the ocean and how it is changing.</span></p>
<p><span>The groundbreaking study, led by Global Fishing Watch, uses machine learning and satellite imagery to create the first global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure, finding a remarkable amount of activity that was previously “dark” to public monitoring systems.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39537" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39537"><a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/GFW-visualization-all-activity_North-Sea.webp"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://globalfishingwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/GFW-visualization-all-activity_North-Sea.webp" alt="" width="1400" height="784" srcset="https://globalfishingwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/GFW-visualization-all-activity_North-Sea.webp 1400w, https://globalfishingwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/GFW-visualization-all-activity_North-Sea-500x280.webp 500w, https://globalfishingwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/GFW-visualization-all-activity_North-Sea-768x430.webp 768w, https://globalfishingwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/GFW-visualization-all-activity_North-Sea-50x28.webp 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39537">Global Fishing Watch uses AI and satellite imagery to map vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure to provide an unprecedented view of previously unmapped industrial use of the ocean, as seen here in the North Sea. ⓒ 2023 Global Fishing Watch</figcaption></figure>
<p><span><em>“A new industrial revolution has been emerging in our seas undetected—until now,”</em> said <strong>David Kroodsma, director of research and innovation at Global Fishing Watch</strong> and co-lead author of the study. <em>“On land, we have detailed maps of almost every road and building on the planet. In contrast, growth in our ocean has been largely hidden from public view. This study helps eliminate the blind spots and shed light on the breadth and intensity of human activity at sea.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Researchers from Global Fishing Watch, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Duke University, UC Santa Barbara and SkyTruth analyzed 2 million gigabytes of satellite imagery spanning 2017-2021 to detect vessels and offshore infrastructure in coastal waters across six continents where more than three-quarters of industrial activity is concentrated.</span></p>
<p><span>By synthesizing GPS data with five years of radar and optical imagery, the researchers were able to identify vessels that failed to broadcast their positions. Using machine learning, they then concluded which of those vessels were likely engaged in fishing activity.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Historically, vessel activity has been poorly documented, limiting our understanding of how the world’s largest public resource—the ocean—is being used,”</em> said <strong>co-lead author Fernando Paolo, senior machine learning engineer at Global Fishing Watch</strong>. <em>“By combining space technology with state-of-the-art machine learning, we mapped undisclosed industrial activity at sea on a scale never done before.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>While not all boats are legally required to broadcast their position, vessels absent from public monitoring systems, often termed “dark fleets,” pose major challenges for protecting and managing natural resources. Researchers found numerous dark fishing vessels inside many marine protected areas, and a high concentration of vessels in many countries’ waters that previously showed little-to-no vessel activity by public monitoring systems.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Publicly available data wrongly suggests that Asia and Europe have similar amounts of fishing within their borders, but our mapping reveals that Asia dominates—for every 10 fishing vessels we found on the water, seven were in Asia while only one was in Europe,”</em> said<strong> co-author Jennifer Raynor, assistant professor of natural resource economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison</strong>. <em>“By revealing dark vessels, we have created the most comprehensive public picture of global industrial fishing available.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The study also shows how human activity in the ocean is changing. Coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, fishing activity dropped globally by about 12 percent, with an 8 percent decline in China and a 14 percent drop elsewhere. In contrast, transport and energy vessel activity remained stable.</span></p>
<p><span>Offshore energy development surged during the study period. Oil structures increased by 16 percent, while wind turbines more than doubled. By 2021, turbines outnumbered oil platforms. China’s offshore wind energy had the most striking growth, increasing ninefold from 2017 to 2021.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39855"><img decoding="async" src="https://globalfishingwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/GFW-offshore-Infrastructure-global-map-animated_opt.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39855">Two million gigabytes of satellite imagery from 2017-2021 were analyzed to detect offshore infrastructure in coastal waters across six continents where more than three-quarters of industrial activity is concentrated. ⓒ 2023 Global Fishing Watch</figcaption></figure>
<p><span><em>“The footprint of the Anthropocene is no longer limited to terra firma,”</em> said <strong>co-author Patrick Halpin, professor of marine geospatial ecology at Duke University</strong>. <em>“Having a more complete view of ocean industrialization allows us to see new growth in offshore wind, aquaculture and mining that is rapidly being added to established industrial fishing, shipping and oil and gas activities. Our work reveals that the global ocean is a busy, crowded and complex industrial workspace of the growing blue economy.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The study highlights the potential of this new technology to tackle climate change. Mapping all vessel traffic will improve estimates of greenhouse gas emissions at sea, while maps of infrastructure can inform wind development or aid in tracking marine degradation caused by oil exploration.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Identifying offshore infrastructure is critical for understanding offshore energy development impacts and trends, and is crucial data for our work to detect marine pollution events and hold responsible parties to account,”</em> said <strong>co-author Christian Thomas, a geospatial engineer at SkyTruth</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The open data and technology used in the study can help governments, researchers and civil society to identify hotspots of potentially illegal activity, determine where industrial fishing vessels may be encroaching on artisanal fishing grounds, or simply better understand vessel traffic in their waters.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Previously, this type of satellite monitoring was only available to those who could pay for it. Now it is freely available to all nations,”</em> concluded <strong>Kroodsma</strong>. <em>“This study marks the beginning of a new era in ocean management and transparency.”</em></span></p>
<p><span>The study was made possible thanks to the generous support of Bloomberg Philanthropies, National Geographic Pristine Seas and Oceankind, and our technology partner, Google. As an <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/open-ocean-project/">awardee of The Audacious Project</a>, a collaborative funding initiative that is catalyzing social impact on a grand scale, Global Fishing Watch is able to further the application of this innovative work.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/january/giant-worm-fossils-.html">https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/january/giant-worm-fossils-.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38865924">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p property="description">Fossils of a new group of animal predators have been located in the Early Cambrian Sirius Passet fossil locality in North Greenland. These large worms may be some of the earliest carnivorous animals to have colonised the water column more than 518 million years ago, revealing a past dynasty of predators that scientists didn’t know existed.</p><div property="articleBody"><p>The new fossil animals have been named <em>Timorebestia</em>, meaning ‘terror beasts’ in Latin. Adorned with fins down the sides of their body, a distinct head with long antennae, massive jaw structures inside their mouth and growing to more than 30cm in length, these were some of the largest swimming animals in the Early Cambrian times.</p>
<p>“We have previously known that primitive arthropods were the dominant predators during the Cambrian, such as the bizarre-looking anomalocaridids,” said <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Jakob-Vinther-c20784b6-d4a2-4d48-849b-57f899bddaef/">Dr Jakob Vinther</a> from the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol’s</a> <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/">Schools of Earth Sciences</a>, a senior author on the study. “However, <em>Timorebestia</em> is a distant, but close, relative of living arrow worms, or chaetognaths. These are much smaller ocean predators today that feed on tiny zooplankton.</p>
<p>“Our research shows that these ancient ocean ecosystems were fairly complex with a food chain that allowed for several tiers of predators.</p>
<p>“<em>Timorebestia</em> were giants of their day and would have been close to the top of the food chain. That makes it equivalent in importance to some of the top carnivores in modern oceans, such as sharks and seals back in the Cambrian period.”</p>
<p>Inside the fossilised digestive system of <em>Timorebestia</em>, the researchers found remains of a common, swimming arthropod called <em>Isoxys</em>. “We can see these arthropods was a food source many other animals,” said Morten Lunde Nielsen, a former PhD student at Bristol and part of the current study. “They are very common at Sirius Passet and had long protective spines, pointing both forwards and backwards. However, they clearly didn’t completely succeed in avoiding that fate, because <em>Timorebestia</em> munched on them in great quantities.”</p>
<p>Arrow worms are one of the oldest animal fossils from the Cambrian. While arthropods appear in the fossil record about 521 to 529 million years ago, arrow worms can be traced back at least 538 million years back in time. Dr Vinther explained: “Both arrow worms, and the more primitive <em>Timorebestia</em>, were swimming predators. We can therefore surmise that in all likelihood they were the predators that dominated the oceans before arthropods took off. Perhaps they had a dynasty of about 10-15 million years before they got superseded by other, and more successful, groups.”</p>
<p>Luke Parry from Oxford University, who was part of the study, added “<em>Timorebestia</em> is a really significant find for understanding where these jawed predators came from.</p>
<p>"Today, arrow worms have menacing bristles on the outside of their heads for catching prey, whereas <em>Timorebestia </em>has jaws inside its head.</p>
<p>"This is what we see in microscopic jaw worms today—organisms that arrow worms shared an ancestor with over half a billion years ago. <em>Timorebestia </em>and other fossils like it provide links between closely related organisms that today look very different.”</p>
<p>“Our discovery firms up how arrow worms evolved,” added Tae Yoon Park from the Korean Polar Research Institute, senior author and field expedition leader. “Living arrow worms have a distinct nervous centre on their belly, called a ventral ganglion. It is entirely unique to these animals.</p>
<p>“We have found this preserved in <em>Timorebestia</em> and another fossil called <em>Amiskwia</em>. People have debated whether or not <em>Amiskwia</em> was closely related to arrow worms, as part of their evolutionary stem lineage. The preservation of these unique ventral ganglia gives us a great deal more confidence in this hypothesis.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to have discovered such unique predators in Sirius Passet. Over a series of expeditions to the very remote Sirius Passet in the furthest reaches of North Greenland more than 82,5˚ north, we have collected a great diversity of exciting new organisms. Thanks to the remarkable, exceptional preservation in Sirius Passet we can also reveal exciting anatomical details including their digestive system, muscle anatomy, and nervous systems.</p>
<p>“We have many more exciting findings to share in the coming years that will help show how the earliest animal ecosystems looked like and evolved,” Dr Park concluded.</p>

Appearing in the wake of the Z-Library shutdown late 2022, shadow library 'Anna's Archive' now bills itself as the "largest truly open library in human history." A complaint filed in December 2023 by the Italian Publishers Association, which represents publishers of books, scientific journals, and digital content, paints a somewhat different picture. As a result, telecoms regulator AGCOM has issued immediate blocking instructions to ISPs.

<p>In 2022, a platform called Pirate Library Mirror appeared on the scene, courting controversy right from the start after obtaining a full copy of Z-Library before the site’s legal troubles began.</p>
<p>“We deliberately violate the copyright law in most countries. This allows us to do something that legal entities cannot do: making sure books are mirrored far and wide,” the team behind ‘PiLiMi’ wrote.</p>
<p>In November 2022, PiLiMi team member ‘Anna Archivist’ founded ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=anna%27s+archive">Anna’s Archive</a>‘, a platform promising access to Z-Library and Libgen content from the same interface. Just over a year later, the site describes itself as the “largest truly open library in human history” mirroring Sci-Hub, Libgen, Z-Library, and other platforms, to offer 25.5 million books and 99.4 million papers for download.</p>
<h2>90% of Italian Publishing Market Behind Complaint</h2>
<p>Anna’s Archive is a relative newcomer to the world of online shadow libraries, but its impact has already ensured the inevitable. In common with its counterparts who are already blocked by ISPs in several countries, a year after its launch Anna’s Archive will receive the same treatment, starting in Italy.</p>
<p>On December 4, 2023, the Italian Publishers Association (AIE) filed a copyright complaint against Anna’s Archive. Founded in 1869, AIE represents publishers of books, scientific journals, and digital content; together, these companies control 90% of the local market. AIE’s complaint lists over 30 books, but the association stresses this represents just a sample of the content distributed by Anna’s Archive to which its members hold the rights.</p>
<center><em>A sample of books listed in the complaint</em><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png" alt="AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023" width="650" height="991" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png 710w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023-300x458.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20991'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png 710w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023-300x458.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png"></a></center>
<p>“The site annas-archive.org calls itself a mirror of various ‘shadow libraries’ and claims to have over 25 million books and nearly 100 million scholarly articles, which it makes available by disseminating numerous links to each work. Unauthorized reproductions of works belonging to Italian publishers number several thousand,” the complaint reads.</p>
<h2>Investigation Led to Ukraine</h2>
<p>An investigation by Italy’s Digital Services Directorate verified that the content listed in the complaint was actually accessible from Anna’s Archive. In view of the facts, that led investigators to believe that this was probably a case of “serious and massive infringement.”</p>
<p>Official papers indicate that the operator of Anna’s Archive proved “unidentifiable” but with assistance from Cloudflare, Epinatura LLC – a hosting provider in Kiev, Ukraine – was identified as the likely host of at least some of the platform’s servers. Notifications were sent to various service providers warning that “spontaneous compliance” with a blocking request filed by the publishers was a potential outcome.</p>
<h2>Decision: Site Must Be Blocked</h2>
<p>With no counterclaims received from the contacted parties and having determined mass infringement on the site, an order to disable https://annas-archive.org through a DNS block was issued to Italian ISPs, to be completed in 48 hours. Visitors to the site are now greeted by the blocking page below in Italian. <em>(translation on the right)</em></p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AGCOM_block_page_annas_archive.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AGCOM_block_page_annas_archive.png" alt="AGCOM_block_page_annas_archive" width="650" height="352" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20352'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AGCOM_block_page_annas_archive.png"></a></center>
<p>While Anna’s Archive operates alternative domains that aren’t specifically mentioned in the order (annas-archive.gs, annas-archive.se), the site faces perpetual blocking measures against “all future domain names of the same site.”</p>
<p>If the shadow library wishes to challenge the decision, it has until the middle of February to file a response before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court. All things considered, that seems unlikely.</p>

Johanna, Maud, and I were leaving Sweden, and Covid restrictions meant we were forbidden from returning once we boarded the ferry. Hence the second truck, which we had gotten a stranger to ferry from the island to us: the Swedish truck had to stay in Sweden.</p><p>The motivation to leave was that we wanted to homeschool Maud, who was 3. In Sweden, this is illegal, so most Swedish homeschoolers end up on one of two islands in the Baltic Sea. On our island, we knew no one. We had no jobs awaiting. We were leaving something, more than going somewhere. The life we had grown piecemeal over 30 years disappeared overnight. We had to figure out what to replace it with. Should I start another software consultancy to support us? Could I write? How would we find a meaningful social context?</p><p>The moldy apartment we rented as we looked for a house has a view of the sea. Every day, deep into winter, I’d walk down to the water and dive from the cliffs. Swimming in the channels between the rocks, I realized I could model our situation using a concept from probability theory.</p><p><span>It was a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" rel="">multi-armed bandit problem</a><span>. This problem, which, under a different name, had&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhn9prnr5bz0156/1933-thompson.pdf" rel="">first been studied</a><span>&nbsp;by the biologist&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_R._Thompson" rel="">William R. Thompson</a><span>&nbsp;in 1933, centers on a rather surreal thought experiment. A gambler faces a slot machine (“a one-armed bandit”), except this machine doesn’t have one arm—following some twisted dream logic, it has&nbsp;</span><em>k&nbsp;</em><span>arms, arms sticking out in every direction. Some of these arms have a high probability of paying out the jackpot, others are worse. But the gambler does not know which is which.</span></p><p>The problem is pulling the arms in an order that maximizes the expected total gains. ("Gains" could be anything. Early on, the problem was used to design drug trials. There, the jackpot was defined as finding a successful treatment. If you are looking for a partner, talking to people is how you pull the multi-armed bandit and the resonance (or lack thereof) is the payoff.)</p><p><span>The gambler needs to learn new knowledge about the machines&nbsp;</span><em>and simultaneously</em><span>&nbsp;use what they have already learned to optimize their decisions. In the literature, these two activities are referred to as&nbsp;</span><em>exploring</em><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><em>exploiting.</em><span>&nbsp;You can’t do both things at the same time. When you explore, you are pulling new arms on the bandit trying to figure out their expected payout. When you exploit, you pull the best arm you’ve found. You need to find the right balance. If you spend too little time exploring, you get stuck playing a machine with a low expected payoff. But if you spend too much time exploring, you will earn less than you would if you played the best arm. This is the explore/exploit trade-off.</span></p><p><span>People tend to gravitate to different sides of the explore/exploit spectrum. If you are high on openness, like I am, exploring comes easy. But it is harder to make a commitment and exploit what you’ve learned about yourself and the world. Other people are more committed, but risk being too conventional in their choices. They miss better avenues for their effort. Most, however, tend to do less than optimal of&nbsp;</span><em>both—</em><span>not exploring, not exploiting; but doing things out of blind habit, and half-heartedly.</span></p><p>First, I’ll say a few words about exploration and exploitation in real life. Then I'll return to the question of how to navigate the tradeoff between them.</p><p>There are two kinds of people. Those who do not understand how complex the world is, and those who know that they do not understand how complex the world is.</p><p>To navigate life we create mental models of the world out there, and then we confuse the models for reality. Have you ever noticed this when interacting with someone who has a less accurate model than you: that it’s like they have a VR headset on and are fighting against monsters you know are not there? For instance, there was a Swedish couple who were working at the embassy in New Delhi in the 1990s. They had a housekeeper. On the housekeeper’s birthday, they made her a cake and invited her to eat at their table. She refused. She insisted she had to eat on the floor, or else she’d be reborn as a lower animal. It is tempting to say, “You can take off the headset, there is nothing there. Have some cake.” But we all have headsets on. There is no way of living in direct contact with reality.</p><p>The trick is to collide your mental model with the outside world as often as possible. This is what exploring does. You think you know the distribution of payoffs of the slot machines, but you try something new. You discover that you were wrong. You update your model.</p><p>Many of the mental models I have are things I’ve picked up from others. On closer inspection, it turns up that they too picked up from someone else, who picked it up from someone else—going back to someone who lived in the 1950s. This is not the 1950s. Have some cake.</p><p><span>For instance, as I wrote in “</span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query" rel="">A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting things to your inbox</a><span>,” I wasn’t able to get my blog to “work” until I unlearned the patterns of communication I had picked up from mass media. Blogs are not mass media. They are more powerful than that. I was stuck in the 50s.</span></p><p><span>Some mental models have more leverage than others. I try to focus on these. Realizing that I didn’t understand </span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/being-patient-with-problems" rel="">process</a><span>, or priorities, or </span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/looking-for-alice" rel="">relationships</a><span>, was highly rewarding. Understanding those areas better pays off every day.</span></p><p>If you can break inaccurate mental models, life becomes easier to navigate. But how do you do that? I know two ways.</p><ol><li><p>Find people who understand things better than you and read what they have to say. Read with the intention of answering your questions. If you can’t find the answers, email them.</p></li><li><p><span>Perform experiments. By this I don’t mean do random things. I mean,&nbsp;</span><em>STATE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS </em><span>and&nbsp;</span><em>FIND WAYS TO TEST IF THEY ARE FALSE</em><span>. Most of the time, the slot machine of an experiment yields nothing. But that’s ok. A few will rearrange the world around you.</span></p></li></ol><p>But, as I was saying before, there is a tradeoff. Time spent exploring to gather new information means less time acting on it. Besides, exploiting is often more valuable than it seems, since narrowing your focus to “slot machines” you know are promising can have nonlinear returns.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, you can only do 1 or 2 things well. Some people are exceptional: they can do 3. I’m not exceptional.</p><p><span>I learned this, as many do, when I had my first child. I had been a bit nervous about becoming a father. Having failed to achieve what I had expected I would, I thought strapping a child to my chest meant setting myself up for permanent failure. It did not. When Maud ate about half my time, I had to force myself to make priorities: I would care for her, I would write,&nbsp;</span><em>and I would say no to everything else.</em></p><p>Narrowing my life like this, at least doubled how much I could achieve. When I had more time, I had spread myself too thin to get stuff done.</p><p>This is something I now notice whenever I read biographies of people who have done exceptional work: they lived narrow lives. They allowed themselves to care about less than others do. To take two quotes at random, here is Jony Ives who designed the iPhone:</p><blockquote><p><span>One of the things Steve [Jobs] would say [to me] because he was worried I wasn’t focused — he would say, “How many things have you said no to?” I would tell him I said no to this. And I said no to that. But he knew I wasn’t interested in doing those things. There was no&nbsp;</span><em>sacrifice</em><span>&nbsp;in saying no [to those things]. What focus means is saying no to something that with every bone in your body you think is a phenomenal idea, you wake up thinking about it, but you say no to it because you are focusing on something else.”</span></p></blockquote><p>And here is Werner Herzog, the German filmmaker:</p><blockquote><p>Although for many years I lived hand to mouth—sometimes in semi-poverty—I have lived like a rich man ever since I started making films. Throughout my life I have been able to do what I truly love, which is more valuable than any cash you could throw at me. At a time when friends were establishing themselves by getting university degrees, going into business, building careers and buying houses, I was making films, investing everything back into my work.</p></blockquote><p>In the terminology of multi-armed bandits, they found a good arm. Then they exploited it to the exclusion of everything else.</p><p>Why do some people achieve so many of the things they want, and others not? Do people have a fixed budget of things they can achieve in a lifetime? It doesn’t seem so. Rather, it seems like our achievement budget is a function of the number of priorities we have. Interestingly, it seems to be a&nbsp;nonlinear&nbsp;function. Meaning that if you go from 4 priorities to 3, you can get, say, 10 percent more done; but if you go from 4 to 1, you get 400 percent more done. (I’m obviously making these numbers up.) If I look at Elon Musk, I have a hard time even grasping that he has the same number of hours in a day as I have. But he has, of course. We all do. It is just that his decisions have compounded because of a sharp focus.</p><p><span>Why would focus compound? Part of it is time. If you care about less, you spend more time doing what you care about most. Also, you are always nonconsciously processing the thing you focus on.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>So cutting priorities means you work even when it looks like you’re not working. These days,</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>I’ll spend the afternoon playing with the kids, doing the dishes, repairing the houses—being busy in a mind-clearing way. Then, when I sit down to write the next morning, I can type 700 words without thinking. The ideas have been churning in my head, just below the surface of conscious thought, and come fully formed.</span></p><p>When I was younger, I was never this lucky. It is partly because I was less skilled. But it is also partly because I would interrupt the nonconscious processing back then. Unintentionally, I would tell my brain to focus on something else—a conflict in a TV series I was watching, for instance. I would watch an episode before bed, and the cliffhanger would open a loop in my head. That loop would be churning in my head as I slept; I woke to a blank page. I don’t have time for that anymore. I make sure to always have an open loop concerning my writing. And I close every other loop—by wrapping it up as fast as I can, or by writing it down on a list, or, preferably, by not opening the loop at all.</p><p>Allocating more time and mental processing power alone doesn’t explain the nonlinearity, though. More time is just a linear increase. I would guess the nonlinearity comes from:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Focus accelerates the accumulation of skills and accurate world models.</strong><span>&nbsp;In open-ended domains, such as writing, relationships, or business, there is nearly endless room for skill growth. When you spend more time, you get a better model of the situation which allows you to allocate your time better, which accelerates your rate of learning, and so on, in a nonlinear way.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Focus attracts “resources.”&nbsp;</strong><span>This is obvious in business: if you have a ferocious focus investors will start following you around begging you to take their money. Then you can use the money to pull even faster on the arms of the bandit. This is true in writing, too: the more I write, the more interesting people my blog attracts. They start giving me feedback and advice which helps me write better, which, in a flywheel, attracts more interesting people (and some money). If you are curious and kind to people around you, you attract strong supportive networks. Networks have nonlinear properties.</span></p></li></ul><p>But for me, as a person for whom narrow focus is against my instincts, the most remarkable thing about it is how rich it feels. My life these days is small and boring. I bicycle across the same fields every day, I notice how the wind turbines turn to face the wind, I rarely travel, and I spend my spare time staring at a Word document. Annie Dillard calls the writer’s life colorless to the point of sensory deprivation. That fits. But, as she also knows, there is another kind of color that can only be discovered three years down a writing hole. It is a subtle, nightly color; your eyes need time to adjust to the dark before you can see them. You wouldn't believe their beauty if I told you.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg" width="1456" height="873" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:873,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1150745,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8666c64-0109-4d9a-a9f0-fc73aa5a3e7b_3264x1958.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>So, as I was saying, I was swimming by the cliffs. Every day, walking up and down the coast I found new places to dive in. I got interested in high diving—something I had been too much of a coward to do as a kid. I felt a childish excitement for water. The kids on the beach would look at me, whisper, and laugh. That is one of the pleasures of youth. The pleasure of being a dad is knowing I was having more fun than them.</p><p>But beyond being a dad, I didn’t know what to do with my life. Swimming and thinking about the things I’ve said in this essay, I made a decision. I would approach my situation algorithmically. I would apply rules to decide when to explore and when to exploit to counteract my natural tendencies (which would push me to do too little of both).</p><p>There are several algorithmic solutions to the multi-armed bandit problem, going back to Thompson sampling in the 1930s, all the way up to contemporary algorithms used in machine learning, such as EXP3 and Upper Confidence Bounds. What they all have in common is some version of: 1) prioritize exploration early on and 2) dial up exploitation as the situation becomes more clear. If you are new in a city, it makes sense to meet as many people as possible. If you find someone you love hanging with early, you will have years of happiness. But if you are about to leave, it makes more sense to hang with your best friends. Even if you found someone you liked more, you wouldn’t have any time to hang out. The amount of exploration that is optimal depends on the complexity of the problem and the time horizon.</p><p>What I decided to do was this. I would divide the next 30 months into three parts. For the first ten months, I would allow myself to explore freely. After that, I’d switch to exploring 2/3 of the time and using 1/3 to double down on the most interesting opportunity I had found, then I’d do 1/3 exploring and 2/3 exploiting, and so on.</p><p>We can think of the amount of time I spent on explorative open-ended search as my “temperature.” When you heat atoms, they bounce around faster; when you heat a life, it becomes more explorative. When you cool it, you narrow down and spend more time exploiting what you know. Here’s what it looks like when you search for the highest peak while gradually reducing the “temperature”:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif" width="500" height="161" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:161,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44a6a537-8851-4039-aef6-c61c66bcc26f_500x161.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Notice that the search starts in the area to the right, which does not contain the highest peak. If it had been a focused search early on it would have gotten stuck at a local optimum. (This is one of the reasons why education is a nightmare for many, by the way. Schooling forces you to decide what you will pursue long before you get to try it. It makes your future, more knowledgeable self, the servant of the younger, ignorant self.)</p><p>It felt comforting to put strict rules on myself like this, especially in the early part of the search. I felt stressed that I would not find the right thing to spend my time on and support my family. This made me want to go into exploit mode too soon. Knowing that there would be a time for focus later made me more willing to try anything and fail. I learned the piano and played around with coding. I wrote a few chapters of a novel. I got involved with a kindergarten/goat farm and studied the history of the island. I took a job at an art gallery. </p><p>After 10 months, I reduced the amount of randomness for the first time. I decided to spend 1/3 of my spare time programming. But I kept exploring 2/3s of my days.</p><p>The next time I dialed down the temperature I had started this blog. Since writing it was more interesting than programming, I stopped coding and switched 2/3s of my spare time to the blog. In retrospect, this seems like an obvious choice. Writing had always been my main obsession. But it wasn’t obvious at the time. I had for years been frustrated that no one was interested in what I wrote. The magazines that had published me when I was in my early twenties wanted nothing to do with the stuff I was exploring now. Writing seemed like a dead end.</p><p><span>I didn’t tell anyone that I was writing a blog. Having my friends read it would have made it harder for me to experiment and do things that risked embarrassment or failure. I wanted to put myself in a social context where I was rewarded for </span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/writing-as-communion" rel="">exploring my illegible potential</a><span>.</span></p><p>It worked. In January 2023, I dialed down the temperature to 0. I had landed on a peak I could not have imagined when we arrived on the island: being on track to supporting my family by emailing my thoughts to strangers. Even better, it is a small family writing business since Johanna and I work as a team these days (and we project that the essays will be our main income by the end of 2024).    </p><p>If I had decided on a path when I swam by the cliffs, before exploring, this possibility would not have occurred to me. Thoughtful emails did not seem like the type of thing that can support a family. Had I known it was, I would have thought I lacked what it takes to pull it off. This is an important thing to keep in mind: you don’t know until you try. </p><p><span>Warmly,</span><br><span>Henrik</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2>A <span>new language</span> and <span>live environment</span> made for the web.
        </h2>

        <p>The Amber language is deeply inspired by Smalltalk. It is designed to make client-side development faster
                and easier.
                Amber includes a live development environment with a class browser, workspace, unit test runner,
                transcript, object inspector and debugger.</p>

        <p>Amber is written in itself, including the compiler, and compiles into efficient JavaScript, mapping
                one-to-one with the JS equivalent.</p>

        

        

    </div><div id="content">
        <blockquote>
    The app is in Amber Smalltalk and the html is done with Silk. Silk is very exciting and makes web programming fun again. I am completely enthusiastic about it 🙂 !

  <dl>
    <dt>So...What is it about again?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Amber is a language (derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>) and environment built for the web.</p>
With Amber, client-side web development finally gets the power and productivity that exists in other Smalltalk dialects.
    </dd>

    <dt>Why should I care?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Having a true live &amp; incremental development environment where you can build your application interactively in the browser is unbeatable.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Why a Smalltalk dialect?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Smalltalk stands head and shoulders above most other languages for clarity, conciseness, and human-friendliness.</p>
      <p>As a language, it is immensely clean and mature, both syntactically and semantically. It is a pure OO language, with objects all the way down.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>But what about all the JS ecosystem?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Amber plays very well with the outer world. You can interact with JavaScript objects seamlessly, and even inspect them as any Amber object.</p>
      <p>Evaluating JavaScript object methods is transparent and makes using libraries a breeze.</p>
    </dd>

<blockquote>
  It's a 3D WebGL game engine that is very easy to get to work with Amber. Specifically though I am using its WebVR integration.  This is a pretty nice way to do VR development.  Being able to take the headset off, change a method, and then put the headset back on without having to restart is pretty nice.

<p>What’s wrong with that? Well, MD5 is badly broken. So broken that experts have been <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/12/forging_ssl_cer.html">saying for over a decade that “no one should be using MD5 anymore.”</a></p>
<p>Given the wide variety of better alternatives, using MD5 today makes no sense.</p>
<p>And more puzzling: it’s not just the International Criminal Court using MD5. Apparently, the entire American legal and forensics community uses MD5.</p>
<p>So, why <em>are</em> lawyers using broken, outdated technology?</p>
<p>In asking this, I should be clear: I’m not a lawyer and I’m not a cryptographer. I’m a software engineer<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> and consultant in applied cryptography. And I suspect that I might be one of the only people interested in both cryptography and law, otherwise someone else would have written this article already.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why lawyers are still using broken, outdated technology. Fundamentally, the legal community disputes that MD5 <em>is</em> broken, for them. Yes, they say, MD5 is broken for <em>encryption,</em> but since they’re not doing encryption, it’s fine for them to use it.</p>
<p>This post is my exploration of how this dispute came about, and whether the legal community is correct in believing they can safely use MD5.</p>
<h2>How law uses hashing</h2>
<p>Let’s start with how MD5 and other hash functions are used in law.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that we have 200 documents that we must store as evidence for a case. It’s important that each of these 200 documents is 1) identified correctly, 2) copied correctly from the originals, and 3) unchanged since the time we collected it.</p>
<p>We can use something called a <strong>cryptographic hash function</strong> to accomplish these goals. A cryptographic hash function produces a unique identifier (called a “hash” or “hash value”) for a document, based on the contents of the document.</p>
<p>Importantly, if anything at all in the document changes, even just a single character added or subtracted, the hash value will be different. As Judge Paul W. Grimm points out in <em>Lorraine v. Markel American Ins. Co.</em>, hashing a document can help to easily distinguish between the “final” (and thus legally operative) version and earlier versions. While both documents might look similar to the human eye, the hash value of two very similar but different documents is completely different.</p>
<p>We can test this out. For instance, in less than a second of computation, the 783 page book <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4300/pg4300.txt">Ulysses</a> by James Joyce hashes to:</p>
<p><small>c6061f63b03774425a5b06083af4c9cb33f6f47cf0efd71b1258828f3332a604</small></p>
<p>And if we change a <em>single letter</em> three-quarters of the way through the book, we get a completely different hash:</p>
<p><small>2e605eca536c927d629fec4c8ab4759af59bd2ba15ef562989766c348b1a72a6</small></p>
<p>And thus, by hashing, we know–<em>without reading a single line of the book</em>–that the book has been altered and is no longer the original. And we can do the same check for millions of documents at a time. That’s pretty useful as a time-saving device!</p>
<p>So, in law, we want to be able to identify a document with a particular id, and then be able to know that 1) we’re all talking about the same document and aren’t confusing it with some other document or a different version, and that 2) our copy of the document is the same as the original, and 3) that the document hasn’t been changed or altered without our awareness. Cryptographic hash functions help us accomplish all of these goals.</p>
<h2>MD5 is obsolete</h2>
<p>There are many cryptographic hash functions, and only a few are recommended for current use. The others are obsolete. MD5 is extremely old, in tech years. It was introduced in 1992, problems were noticed in 1996 and 2005, and by 2008, it was deemed unusable. <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/836068">Carnegie Mellon’s Software Engineering Institute</a> stated in 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not use the MD5 algorithm. Software developers, Certification Authorities, website owners, and users should avoid using the MD5 algorithm in any capacity. As previous research has demonstrated, it should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this was not controversial in any sense among technologists. But, we find ourselves in the year 2023, a full 15 years after being told not to use MD5, with the legal community using and even <em>recommending</em> MD5.</p>
<h2>What exactly is wrong with MD5, and does it matter for law?</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell as an outsider, there’s very little current discussion in the legal community about whether MD5 should be replaced. For instance, the <a href="https://thesedonaconference.org/sites/default/files/publications/2_ESI_Evidence_and_Admissibility_0.pdf">Sedona Conference 2021 commentary on ESI Evidence &amp; Admissibility</a> mentions MD5 as one of the “most commonly used algorithms” for hashing, and eDiscovery and forensics software such as <a href="https://blogs.opentext.com/what-counts-as-a-duplicate-in-your-ediscovery-software/">OpenText</a> and <a href="https://www.exterro.com/blog/md5-hashing-the-foundation-of-a-defensible-e-discovery-process">Exterro</a> are apparently proud to use MD5.</p>
<p>And, when the legal community does attempt to grapple with MD5 being broken, the problem is dismissed because it is “only broken for encryption”, whatever that means.</p>
<p>For example, the Sedona commentary references a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081208024210/https://www.forensicmag.com/articles.asp?pid=238">2008 article by Don L. Lewis</a> (now taken down and only available through the Internet Archive) that has the following exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I testified recently a defense attorney brought this subject up. The testimony went something like this.</p>
<p>Q. “Mr. Lewis, are you aware that the MD5 algorithm has been compromised?”</p>
<p>A. “Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>Q. “So, its use to authenticate evidence is no longer valid!”</p>
<p>A. “No, the use of the MD5 algorithm is still a valid function for authentication.”</p>
<p>Q. “Why is that?”</p>
<p>A. “There are multiple uses for hash algorithms. One is cryptography (encryption), another is identification, and another is authentication. In digital evidence forensics, we use hash algorithms for known file identification and evidence authentication, which differs from its use in encryption.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Lewis is simply wrong. The primary use of hashing in cryptography <em>is</em> identification and authentication, same as in law. Of course, the context differs – outside of the law, the hashed files don’t end up in a courtroom. But, this idea that the tech world mainly uses cryptographic hash functions for something other than identification and authentication is wrong.</p>
<h2>How Tech Uses Hashing</h2>
<p>Cryptographic hash functions have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Applications">number of use cases in tech</a>.</p>
<p>First, hashes are often used to verify that data was not tampered with or altered in transit. For instance, a file download page might also include a signed hash so that users can check that the file they have on their computer is an identical copy of the original. This is very similar to the legal use case of checking that a forensic image is an identical copy of the original.</p>
<p>Second, a major use of hashes in tech is in digital signatures. A digital signature is like a handwritten signature in that it connotes that the signer has either witnessed or approved of whatever is being signed, but a digital signature is very different in form. A digital signature uses cryptography, and effectively proves to the general public that only the person or entity that knows a particular secret has signed the file or data, without revealing the secret to anyone else.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to understand about digital signatures (see <a href="https://youtu.be/-HWhqxSiXoE?si=baa9QGmtZ_ULFpxz">a talk on digital signatures for economists that I gave at APEE</a>), but for our purposes, the important thing about digital signature schemes is that they use cryptographic hash functions to get a unique identifier for the file, and it’s the unique identifier that is signed, not the entire file.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few more ways in which cryptographic hash functions are used in tech – for instance, as a way of identifying files in peer-to-peer file sharing and content-addressed storage (so still identification, contrary to Lewis.) But let’s focus on the digital signature example.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050615005726/http://www.cits.rub.de/MD5Collisions/">2005, a group of researchers showed how the problems with MD5 could be used in a real world attack</a>. Their <a href="https://www.sos.cs.ru.nl/applications/courses/security2015/md5collisions/index.html">example</a> is a bit convoluted, but essentially, they showed that an attacker could make the victim sign a harmful document. Importantly, it requires that the attacker can create two files, one innocuous and one harmful, both of which have the same MD5 hash. MD5 is broken in this particular way: given access to two files, it is <a href="https://natmchugh.blogspot.com/2014/10/how-i-created-two-images-with-same-md5.html">easy to change some data in both of them to result in the same MD5 hash</a>.</p>
<p>In their particular example, the innocuous file is a letter of recommendation, and the harmful file is a security clearance, both postscript files. (If your computer can’t read postscript files, here are screenshots of both so that you see what each says. The hashes of the screenshots are of course not the same; only the postscript files have the same hash.)</p>

<figcaption>The Harmful File: The Security Clearance Order</figcaption>
<p>In this case, the key element is that a third party believes that Julius Caesar has signed a security clearance for Alice when he has not, and Alice has set up both files for the deception. In other words, the deception must be preplanned.</p>
<p>We can easily imagine a similar example in the legal world, even without digital signatures. For example, suppose that a witness has identified a particular file provided by the opposition as the legally operative document. And that the particular file is identified by its MD5 hash. It would be easy for the opposing party to create two documents with the same MD5 hash, which say different things. Depending on which is advantageous to them at the time, they could say either document is the legally operative version, since the legally operative version was only identified by the broken MD5 hash. Of course, like the postscript files, on close and thorough manual inspection, the two files will be found to be distinct. But the whole point of cryptographic hashes is that we don’t need to use manual inspection, especially for large files that are hundreds of pages long.</p>
<p>Another example: suppose someone is arrested for possession of CSAM, but ahead of time, they have manipulated both the harmful image and an innocuous image so that they both have the same MD5 hash. If law enforcement only records the MD5 hash of the image, law enforcement cannot say for sure, based on the hash alone, whether the image was CSAM or not. The image must be manually inspected, which defeats the entire purpose of the cryptographic hash. A cryptographic hash should <em>uniquely identify</em> a file.</p>
<p>It might be possible that the adversarial setup of the American court system can help in this regard, to provide an opportunity for manual inspection. But this assumes that the attack is detected in the first place. What if the attack is undetected? What if it is subtle enough, or the files large enough that it is not caught? For instance, what if the harmful file has a slightly different excel function hidden in the background, that changes the calculations just a tad, but enough to make a difference?</p>
<p>It’s best not to gamble, especially since the fix is trivial.</p>
<h2>MD5 isn’t collision resistant</h2>
<p>In each of the above examples, MD5 is badly broken in a particular way: it isn’t collision resistant. Practically, for MD5, this means that given access to two files, it is easy, <a href="https://github.com/corkami/collisions">given the right software</a>, to change both of them such that they will produce the same MD5 hash. In other words, to produce a particular collision. In fact, producing <em>any</em> arbitrary collision would be enough to make MD5 unusable.</p>
<p>But, I want to be careful not to claim too much. So far, it is <em>not</em> possible, given a particular, non-manipulated file and the MD5 hash for that file, to find a second file that has that same MD5 hash. This is called a second-preimage attack. This is good news in the case in which we know an attacker or a malicious party doesn’t have access to files before we hash them. For instance, as Lewis points out, the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/national-software-reference-library-nsrl/about-nsrl/nsrl-introduction">“hash sets”</a> (databases of MD5 hashes for known operating system and application files) are unlikely to be affected by MD5’s lack of collision-resistance, given that the hashes are of presumably non-manipulated files.</p>
<p>However, as society becomes more tech-adept, and particularly when <a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-vayner-1">the defendants and their associates are familiar with forgery</a>, malicious manipulation of evidence should be prevented as much as possible, especially since doing so is trivial: just use an up-to-date, unbroken hash function instead of MD5.</p>
<h2>What to use instead of MD5</h2>
<p>NIST’s <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/hash-functions/nist-policy-on-hash-functions">current recommendation is the SHA3 family</a>. It does not have any of the flaws that MD5 does, and works just as well.</p>
<p>If speed is a particular concern, perhaps with very large files, <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3?tab=readme-ov-file">Blake3</a> is one of the fastest algorithms.</p>
<p>Do not use SHA1, which is also broken.</p>
<p>Shameless plug: If you’d like help integrating SHA3 or Blake3 into your current practice, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:katelynsills@gmail.com">katelynsills@gmail.com</a> for consulting.</p>
<h2>How did this happen? The difference between law and tech</h2>
<p>So, going back to our question: why <em>are</em> lawyers using broken, outdated technology?</p>
<p>In addition to lawyers mistakenly believing Lewis’ argument that MD5 is only broken for “encryption,” I think there are a few more reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legal community started using MD5 at the same time that they started hashing, and it stuck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legal community doesn’t know that better alternatives to MD5 exist, because digital forensics is isolated from computer science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legal community hasn’t updated to the latest technology because legal culture isn’t accustomed to (and might even be hostile to) performing continuity-breaking updates at the pace that tech requires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, in the previously mentioned Sedona commentary, the mention of MD5 is from a 2007 text: <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/eldscpkt_1.pdf"><em>Managing Discovery of Electronic Information: A Pocket Guide for Judges</em>.</a> It’s admirable that a 2007 text included hashing, and it is somewhat excusable that MD5 is recommended, since the text was published before the major publicity of MD5’s flaws in 2008.</p>
<p>But making software recommendations based on what a 2007 text recommends is deeply negligent. There’s no reason to believe that what was true in 2007 is true now. In software years, 2007 is ancient history.</p>
<p>However, in legal culture, 2007 is yesterday, which is why this reference wasn’t seen as problematic.</p>
<p>It also appears that the legal community does not know that better alternatives to MD5 exist – algorithms that don’t have known weaknesses. For example, many forensics textbooks only reference MD5 and SHA1, both of which are <em>not</em> recommended for use by NIST. The textbook <em>Digital Evidence and Computer Crime</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One approach to addressing concerns about weaknesses in any given hash algorithm is to use two independent hash algorithms. For this reason, some digital forensic tools automatically calculate both the MD5 and SHA-1 hash value of acquired digital evidence, and other tools provide multiple hashing options for the user to select.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, you know, you could just use <em>a single cryptographic hash function that actually works.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, I think a big part of the problem is cultural. Legal culture is hostile to rapid updates, and for good reason: lawyers and law-makers are used to running “code” on human beings, who simply can’t handle rapid change.</p>
<h2>Law needs to learn to update</h2>
<p>In the Morality of Law, legal theorist Lon L. Fuller identified the ways in which we can “fail to make law.” One of those is “introducing such frequent changes in the rules that the subject cannot orient his action by them.”</p>
<p>This makes sense: people need to be able to know what the rules are and will be, so that they can plan their actions accordingly.</p>
<p>But software, unlike law, doesn’t run on people. Software runs on computers, which can handle rapid change. And software has to defend against motivated attackers, who will exploit any weaknesses in old code at a rapid pace themselves. So software has a very different culture than law. In software security, it is expected that if any weakness is found or even suspected, it is patched and everyone updates as quickly as possible to new code. At times, this can be jarring, but for the most part, it happens entirely outside of human perception.</p>
<p>When law adopts technology, law must also adopt tech culture: a culture of regular updates for that particular technology. Otherwise, as in the case of hashing, the legal community will be going through the motions but won’t be able to reap the full benefits of the technology, because what they are using is badly outdated.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to instantly uniquely identify a document, no matter how large it is, and know for certain that it is distinct from any other document, without any confusion. Imagine knowing that the document is 1) identified correctly, 2) copied correctly from the originals, and 3) unchanged since the time we collected it.</p>
<p>If law uses a proper cryptographic hash function rather than MD5, we can be certain of all three.</p>

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->
<p>In this blog post, we’ll do an end-to-end example of the math within a transformer model. The goal is to get a good understanding of how the model works. To make this manageable, we’ll do lots of simplification. As we’ll be doing quite a bit of the math by hand, we’ll reduce the dimensions of the model. For example, rather than using embeddings of 512 values, we’ll use embeddings of 4 values. This will make the math easier to follow! We’ll use random vectors and matrices, but you can use your own values if you want to follow along.</p>
<p>As you’ll see, the math is not that complicated. The complexity comes from the number of steps and the number of parameters. I recommend you to read the <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">The Illustrated Transformer</a> blog before reading this blog post (or reading in parallel). It’s a great blog post that explains the transformer model in a very intuitive (and illustrative!) way and I don’t intend to explain what it’s already explained there. My goal is to explain the “how” of the transformer model, not the “what”. If you want to dive even deeper, check out the famous original paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention is all you need</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>A basic understanding of linear algebra is required - we’ll mostly do simple matrix multiplications, so no need to be an expert. Apart from that, basic understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning will be useful.</p>
<p><strong>What is covered here?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An end-to-end example of the math within a transformer model during inference</li>
<li>An explanation of attention mechanisms</li>
<li>An explanation of residual connections and layer normalization</li>
<li>Some code to scale it up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get started! The original transformer model has two parts: encoder and decoder. Our goal will be to use this model as a translation tool! We’ll first focus on the encoder part.</p>
<section id="encoder">
<h2 data-anchor-id="encoder">Encoder</h2>
<p>The whole goal of the encoder is to generate a rich embedding representation of the input text. This embedding will capture semantic information about the input, and will then be passed to the decoder to generate the output text. The encoder is composed of a stack of N layers. Before we jump into the layers, we need to see how to pass the words (or tokens) into the model.</p>
<div>

<p>Embeddings are a somewhat overused term. We’ll first create an embedding that will be the input to the encoder. The encoder also outputs an embedding (also called hidden states sometimes). The decoder will also receive an embedding! 😅 The whole point of an embedding is to represent a token as a vector.</p>
</div>
<section id="embedding-the-text">
<h3 data-anchor-id="embedding-the-text">1. Embedding the text</h3>
<p>Let’s say that we want to translate “Hello World” from English to Spanish. The first step is to turn each input token into a vector using an embedding algorithm. This is a learned encoding. Usually we use a big vector size such as 512, but let’s do 4 for our example so we can keep the maths manageable. I’ll assign some random values to each token (as mentioned, this mapping is usually learned by the model).</p>
<p>Hello -&gt; [1,2,3,4]</p>
<p>World -&gt; [2,3,4,5]</p>
<p>We can represent our input as a single matrix</p>
<p><span>\[
E = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<div>

<p>Although we could manage the two embeddings as separate vectors, it’s easier to manage them as a single matrix. This is because we’ll be doing matrix multiplications as we move forward!</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="positional-encoding">
<h3 data-anchor-id="positional-encoding">2 Positional encoding</h3>
<p>The embedding above has no information about the position of the word in the sentence, so we need to feed some positional information. The way we do this is by adding a positional encoding to the embedding. There are different choices on how to obtain these - we could use a learned embedding or a fixed vector. The original paper uses a fixed vector as they see almost no difference between the two approaches (see section 3.5 of the original paper). We’ll use a fixed vector as well. Sine and cosine functions have a wave-like pattern, and they repeat over time. By using these functions, each position in the sentence gets a unique yet consistent pattern of numbers. These are the functions they use in the paper (section 3.5):</p>
<p><span>\[
PE(pos, 2i) = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p><span>\[
PE(pos, 2i+1) = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>The idea is to interpolate between sine and cosine for each value in the embedding (even indices will use sine, odd indices will use cosine). Let’s calculate them for our example!</p>
<p>For “Hello”</p>
<ul>
<li>i = 0 (even): PE(0,0) = sin(0 / 10000^(0 / 4)) = sin(0) = 0</li>
<li>i = 1 (odd): PE(0,1) = cos(0 / 10000^(2*1 / 4)) = cos(0) = 1</li>
<li>i = 2 (even): PE(0,2) = sin(0 / 10000^(2*2 / 4)) = sin(0) = 0</li>
<li>i = 3 (odd): PE(0,3) = cos(0 / 10000^(2*3 / 4)) = cos(0) = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>For “World”</p>
<ul>
<li>i = 0 (even): PE(1,0) = sin(1 / 10000^(0 / 4)) = sin(1 / 10000^0) = sin(1) ≈ 0.84</li>
<li>i = 1 (odd): PE(1,1) = cos(1 / 10000^(2*1 / 4)) = cos(1 / 10000^0.5) ≈ cos(0.01) ≈ 0.99</li>
<li>i = 2 (even): PE(1,2) = sin(1 / 10000^(2*2 / 4)) = sin(1 / 10000^1) ≈ 0</li>
<li>i = 3 (odd): PE(1,3) = cos(1 / 10000^(2*3 / 4)) = cos(1 / 10000^1.5) ≈ 1</li>
</ul>
<p>So concluding</p>
<ul>
<li>“Hello” -&gt; [0, 1, 0, 1]</li>
<li>“World” -&gt; [0.84, 0.99, 0, 1]</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these encodings have the same dimension as the original embedding.</p>
</section>
<section id="add-positional-encoding-and-embedding">
<h3 data-anchor-id="add-positional-encoding-and-embedding">3. Add positional encoding and embedding</h3>
<p>We now add the positional encoding to the embedding. This is done by adding the two vectors together.</p>
<p>“Hello” = [1,2,3,4] + [0, 1, 0, 1] = [1, 3, 3, 5] “World” = [2,3,4,5] + [0.84, 0.99, 0, 1] = [2.84, 3.99, 4, 6]</p>
<p>So our new matrix, which will be the input to the encoder, is:</p>
<p><span>\[
E = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\
2.84 &amp; 3.99 &amp; 4 &amp; 6

<p>We’ll now introduce the concept of multi-head attention. Attention is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on certain parts of the input. Multi-head attention is a way to allow the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces. This is done by using multiple attention heads. Each attention head will have its own K, V, and Q matrices.</p>
<p>Let’s use 2 attention heads for our example. We’ll use random values for these matrices. Each matrix will be a 4x3 matrix. With this, each matrix will transform the 4-dimensional embeddings into 3-dimensional keys, values, and queries. This reduces the dimensionality for attention mechanism, which helps in managing the computational complexity. Note that using a too small attention size will hurt the performance of the model. Let’s use the following values (just random values):</p>

<p>We then softmax to normalize so they are all positive and add up to 1.</p>
<div title="What is softmax?">
<p>Softmax is a function that takes a vector of values and returns a vector of values between 0 and 1, where the sum of the values is 1. It’s a nice way of obtaining probabilities. It’s defined as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{x_j}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Don’t be intimidated by the formula - it’s actually quite simple. Let’s say we have the following vector:</p>
<p><span>\[
x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>The softmax of this vector would be:</p>
<p><span>\[
\text{softmax}(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{e^1}{e^1 + e^2 + e^3} &amp; \frac{e^2}{e^1 + e^2 + e^3} &amp; \frac{e^3}{e^1 + e^2 + e^3} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.09 &amp; 0.24 &amp; 0.67 \end{bmatrix}

</div>
<p>We confirm we got same values as above. Let’s chear and use this to obtain the attention scores the second attention head:</p>

       [8.84, 3.99, 7.99]])</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you’re wondering how come the attention is the same for the two embeddings, it’s because the softmax is taking our scores to 0 and 1. See this:</p>
<div>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1">softmax(((embedding <span>@</span> WQ2) <span>@</span> (embedding <span>@</span> WK2).T) <span>/</span> np.sqrt(<span>3</span>))</span></code></pre></div>

</div>
</div>
<p>This is due to bad initialization of the matrices and small vector sizes. Large differences in the scores before applying softmax will just be amplified with softmax, leading to one value being close to 1 and others close to 0. In practice, our initial embedding matrices’ values were maybe too high, leading to high values for the keys, values, and queries, which just grew larger as we multiplied them.</p>
<p>Remember when we were dividing by the square root of the dimension of the keys? This is why we do that. If we don’t do that, the values of the dot product will be too large, leading to large values after the softmax. In this case, though, it seems it wasn’t enough given our small values! As a short-term hack, we can scale down the values by a larger amount than the square root of 3. Let’s redefine the attention function but scaling down by 30. This is not a good long-term solution, but it will help us get different values for the attention scores. We’ll get back to a better solution later.</p>

<p>After the self-attention layer, the encoder has a feed-forward neural network (FFN). This is a simple network with two linear transformations and a ReLU activation in between. The Illustrated Transformer blog post does not dive into it, so let me briefly explain a bit more. The goal of the FFN is to process and transformer the representation produced by the attention mechanism. The flow is usually as follows (see section 3.3 of the original paper):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>First linear layer:</strong> this usually expands the dimensionality of the input. For example, if the input dimension is 512, the output dimension might be 2048. This is done to allow the model to learn more complex functions. In our simple of example with dimension of 4, we’ll expand to 8.</li>
<li><strong>ReLU activation:</strong> This is a non-linear activation function. It’s a simple function that returns 0 if the input is negative, and the input if it’s positive. This allows the model to learn non-linear functions. The math is as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p><span>\[
\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
\]</span></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Second linear layer:</strong> This is the opposite of the first linear layer. It reduces the dimensionality back to the original dimension. In our example, we’ll reduce from 8 to 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can represent all of this as follows</p>
<p><span>\[
\text{FFN}(x) = \text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
\]</span></p>
<p>Just as a reminder, the input for this layer is the Z we calculated in the self-attention above. Here are the values as a reminder</p>
<p><span>\[
Z =
\begin{bmatrix}
11.46394281 &amp; -13.18016469 &amp; -11.59340253 &amp; -17.04387833 \\

<section id="residual-and-layer-normalization">
<h4 data-anchor-id="residual-and-layer-normalization">5.3 Residual and Layer Normalization</h4>
<p>Uh oh! We’re getting NaNs! It seems our values are too high, and when being passed to the next encoder, they end up being too high and exploding! This is called <strong>gradient explosion</strong>. Without any kind of normalization, small changes in the input of early layers end up being amplified in later layers. This is a common problem in deep neural networks. There are two common techniques to mitigate this problem: residual connections and layer normalization (section 3.1 of the paper, barely mentioned).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Residual connections:</strong> Residual connections are simply adding the input of the layer to it output. For example, we add the initial embedding to the output of the attention. Residual connections mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The intuition is that if the gradient is too small, we can just add the input to the output and the gradient will be larger. The math is very simple:</li>
</ul>
<p><span>\[
\text{Residual}(x) = x + \text{Layer}(x)
\]</span></p>
<p>That’s it! We’ll do this to the output of the attention and the output of the feed-forward layer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layer normalization</strong> Layer normalization is a technique to normalize the inputs of a layer. It normalizes across the embedding dimension. The intuition is that we want to normalize the inputs of a layer so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps with the gradient flow. The math does not look so simple at a first glance.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>\[
\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} \times \gamma + \beta
\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s explain each parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>\(\mu\)</span> is the mean of the embedding</li>
<li><span>\(\sigma\)</span> is the standard deviation of the embedding</li>
<li><span>\(\epsilon\)</span> is a small number to avoid division by zero. In case the standard deviation is 0, this small epsilon saves the day!</li>
<li><span>\(\gamma\)</span> and <span>\(\beta\)</span> are learned parameters that control scaling and shifting steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike batch normalization (no worries if you don’t know what it is), layer normalization normalizes across the embedding dimension - that means that each embedding will not be affected by other samples in the batch. The intuition is that we want to normalize the inputs of a layer so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.</p>
<p>Why do we add the learnable parameters <span>\(\gamma\)</span> and <span>\(\beta\)</span>? The reason is that we don’t want to lose the representational power of the layer. If we just normalize the inputs, we might lose some information. By adding the learnable parameters, we can learn to scale and shift the normalized values.</p>
<p>Combining the equations, the equation for the whole encoder could look like this</p>
<p><span>\[
\text{Z}(x) = \text{LayerNorm}(x + \text{Attention}(x))
\]</span></p>
<p><span>\[
\text{FFN}(x) = \text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
\]</span></p>
<p><span>\[
\text{Encoder}(x) = \text{LayerNorm}(Z(x) + \text{FFN}(Z(x) + x))
\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s try with our example! Let’s go with E and Z values from before</p>
<p><span>\[

<p>Let’s now calculate the layer normalization, we can divide it into three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compute mean and variance for each embedding.</li>
<li>Normalize by substracting the mean of its row and dividing by the square root of its row variance (plus a small number to avoid division by zero).</li>
<li>Scale and shift by multiplying by gamma and adding beta.</li>

<p>Amazing! These values make sense and we don’t get NaNs! The idea of the stack of encoders is that they output a continuous representation, z, that captures the meaning of the input sequence. This representation is then passed to the decoder, which will genrate an output sequence of symbols, one element at a time.</p>
<p>Before diving into the decoder, here’s an image from Jay’s amazing blog post:</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="decoder">Decoder</h2>
<p>Most of the thing we learned for encoders will be used in the decoder as well! The decoder has two self-attention layers, one for the encoder and one for the decoder. The decoder also has a feed-forward layer. Let’s go through each of these.</p>
<p>The decoder block receives two inputs: the output of the encoder and the generated output sequence. The output of the encoder is the representation of the input sequence. During inference, the generated output sequence starts with a special start-of-sequence token (SOS). During training, the target output sequence is the actual output sequence, shifted by one position. This will be clearer soon!</p>
<p>Given the embedding generated by the encoder and the SOS token, the decoder will then generate the next token of the sequence, e.g.&nbsp;“hola”. The decoder is autoregressive, that means that the decoder will take the previously generated tokens and again generate the second token.</p>
<ul>
<li>Iteration 1: Input is SOS, output is “hola”</li>
<li>Iteration 2: Input is SOS + “hola”, output is “mundo”</li>
<li>Iteration 3: Input is SOS + “hola” + “mundo”, output is EOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, SOS is the start-of-sequence token and EOS is the end-of-sequence token. The decoder will stop when it generates the EOS token. It generates one token at a time. Note that all iterations use the embedding generated by the encoder.</p>
<div>

<p><strong>This autoregressive design makes decoder slow.</strong> The encoder is able to generate its embedding in a single forward pass while the decoder needs to do many forward passes. This is one of the reasons why architectures that only use the encoder (such as BERT or sentence similarity models) are much faster than decoder-only architectures (such as GPT-2 or BART).</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s dive into each step! Just as the encoder, the decoder is composed of a stack of decoder blocks. The decoder block is a bit more complex than the encoder block. The general structure is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>(Masked) Self-attention layer</li>
<li>Residual connection and layer normalization</li>
<li>Encoder-decoder attention layer</li>
<li>Residual connection and layer normalization</li>
<li>Feed-forward layer</li>
<li>Residual connection and layer normalization</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re already familiar with all the math from 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. See the right side of the image below, you’ll see that all these blocks you already know (the right part):</p>

<section id="embedding-the-text-1">
<h3 data-anchor-id="embedding-the-text-1">1. Embedding the text</h3>
<p>The first text of the decoder is to embed the input tokens. The input token is <code>SOS</code>, so we’ll embed it. We’ll use the same embedding dimension as the encoder. Let’s assume the embedding vector is the following:</p>
<p><span>\[
E = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
</section>
<section id="positional-encoding-1">
<h3 data-anchor-id="positional-encoding-1">2. Positional encoding</h3>
<p>We’ll now add the positional encoding to the embedding, just as we did for the encoder. Given it’s the same position as “Hello”, we’ll have same positional encoding as we did before:</p>
<ul>
<li>i = 0 (even): PE(0,0) = sin(0 / 10000^(0 / 4)) = sin(0) = 0</li>
<li>i = 1 (odd): PE(0,1) = cos(0 / 10000^(2*1 / 4)) = cos(0) = 1</li>
<li>i = 2 (even): PE(0,2) = sin(0 / 10000^(2*2 / 4)) = sin(0) = 0</li>
<li>i = 3 (odd): PE(0,3) = cos(0 / 10000^(2*3 / 4)) = cos(0) = 1</li>
</ul>

<section id="add-positional-encoding-and-embedding-1">
<h3 data-anchor-id="add-positional-encoding-and-embedding-1">3. Add positional encoding and embedding</h3>
<p>Adding the positional encoding to the embedding is done by adding the two vectors together:</p>

1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}

<p>Things are quite simple for inference. For training, things are a bit tricky. During training, we use unlabeled data: just a bunch of text data, frequentyl scraped from the web. While the encoder’s goal is to capture all information of the input, the decoder’s goal is to predict the most likely next token. This means that the decoder can only use the tokens that have been generated so far (it cannot cheat and see the next tokens).</p>
<p>Because of this, we use masked self-attention: we mask the tokens that have not been generated yet. This is done by setting the attention scores to -inf. This is done in the original paper (section 3.2.3.1). We’ll skip this for now, but it’s important to keep in mind that the decoder is a bit more complex during training.</p>

<p><strong>This part is the new one!</strong> If you were wondering where do the encoder-generated embeddings come in, this is their moment to shine!</p>
<p>Let’s assume the output of the encoder is the following matrix</p>
<p><span>\[

<p>In the self-attention mechanism, we calculate the queries, keys, and values from the input embedding.</p>
<p>In the encoder-decoder attention, we calculate the queries from the previous decoder layer and the keys and values from the encoder output! All the math is the same as before; the only difference is what embedding to use for the queries. Let’s look at some code</p>

<p>This worked! You might be asking “why do we do this?”. The reason is that we want the decoder to focus on the relevant parts of the input text (e.g., “hello world”). The encoder-decoder attention allows each position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This is very helpful for tasks such as translation, where the decoder needs to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence. The decoder will learn to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence by learning to generate the correct output tokens. This is a very powerful mechanism!</p>

<p>How do we go from the decoder’s output to a word? We need to add a final linear layer and a softmax layer on top of the decoder. The whole algorithm looks like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The encoder receives the input sequence and generates a representation of it.</li>
<li>The decoder begins with the SOS token and the encoder output. It generates the next token of the output sequence.</li>
<li>We then apply a linear layer to generate the logits.</li>
<li>We then apply a softmax layer to generate the probabilities.</li>
<li>The decoder uses the encoder output and the previously generated token to generate the next token of the output sequence.</li>
<li>We repeat steps 2-5 until we generate the EOS token.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is mentioned in the section 3.4 of the paper.</p>
<section id="linear-layer">
<h3 data-anchor-id="linear-layer">1. Linear layer</h3>
<p>The linear layer is a simple linear transformation. It takes the decoder’s output and transforms it into a vector of size <code>vocab_size</code>. This is the size of the vocabulary. For example, if we have a vocabulary of 10000 words, the linear layer will transform the decoder’s output into a vector of size 10000. This vector will contain the probability of each word being the next word in the sequence. For simplicity, let’s go with a vocabulary of 10 words and assume the first decoder output is a very simple vector: [1, 0, 1, 0]. We’ll use random weights and biases matrices of the size <code>vocab_size</code> x <code>decoder_output_size</code>.</p>

<section id="softmax">
<h3 data-anchor-id="softmax">2. Softmax</h3>
<p>These are called logits but they are not easily interpretable. We need to apply a softmax function to obtain the probabilities.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>array([[0.01602618, 0.06261303, 0.38162024, 0.03087794, 0.0102383 ,

</div>
<p>This is giving us probabilities! Let’a assume the vocabulary is the following:</p>
<p><span>\[
\text{vocab} = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{hello} &amp; \text{mundo} &amp; \text{world} &amp; \text{how} &amp; \text{?} &amp; \text{EOS} &amp; \text{SOS} &amp; \text{a} &amp; \text{hola} &amp; \text{c}
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>The above tells us that the probabilities are</p>
<ul>
<li>hello: 0.01602618</li>
<li>mundo: 0.06261303</li>
<li>world: 0.38162024</li>
<li>how: 0.03087794</li>
<li>?: 0.0102383</li>
<li>EOS: 0.00446011</li>
<li>SOS: 0.01777314</li>
<li>a: 0.00068275</li>
<li>hola: 0.46780959</li>
<li>c: 0.00789871</li>
</ul>
<p>From these, the most likely next token is “hola”. Picking always the most likely token is called greedy decoding. This is not always the best approach, as it might lead to suboptimal results, but we won’t dive into generation techniques at the moment.

<p>Ok, so we got the tokens “how”, “a”, and “c”. This is not a good translation, but it’s expected! We only used random weights!</p>
<p>I suggest you to look again in detail at the whole encoder-decoder architecture from the original paper:</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I hope that was fun and informational! We covered a lot of ground. Wait…was that it? And the answer is, mostly, yes! New transformer architectures add lots of tricks, but the core of the transformer is what we just covered. Depending on what task you want to solve, you can also only the encoder or the decoder. For example, for understanding-heavy tasks such as classification, you can use the encoder stack with a linear layer on top. For generation-heavy tasks such as translation, you can use the encoder and decoder stacks. And finally, for free generation, as in ChatGPT or Mistral, you can use only the decoder stack.</p>
<p>Of course, we also did lots of simplifications. Let’s briefly check which were the numbers in the original transformer paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedding dimension: 512 (4 in our example)</li>
<li>Number of encoders: 6 (6 in our example)</li>
<li>Number of decoders: 6 (6 in our example)</li>
<li>Feed-forward dimension: 2048 (8 in our example)</li>
<li>Number of attention heads: 8 (2 in our example)</li>
<li>Attention dimension: 64 (3 in our example)</li>
</ul>
<p>We just covered lots of topics, but it’s quite interesting we can achieve impressive results by scaling up this math and doing smart training. We didn’t cover training in this blog post as the goal was to understand the math when using an existing model, but I hope this provided strong foundations for jumping into the training part. I hope you enjoyed this blog post!</p>

<p>Here are some exercises to practice your understanding of the transformer.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is the purpose of the positional encoding?</li>
<li>How does self-attention and encoder-decoder attention differ?</li>
<li>What would happen if our attention dimension was too small? What about if it was too large?</li>
<li>Briefly describe the structure of a feed-forward layer.</li>
<li>Why is the decoder slower than the encoder?</li>
<li>What is the purpose of the residual connections and layer normalization?</li>
<li>How do we go from the decoder output to probabilities?</li>
