Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></div><p>A sweeping crackdown on posts on Instagram and Facebook that are critical of Israel—or even vaguely supportive of Palestinians—was directly orchestrated by the government of Israel, according to internal Meta data obtained by Drop Site News. The data show that Meta has complied with 94% of takedown requests issued by Israel since October 7, 2023. Israel is the biggest originator of takedown requests globally by far, and Meta has followed suit—widening the net of posts it automatically removes, and creating what can be called the largest mass censorship operation in modern history.</p><p>Government requests for takedowns generally focus on posts made by citizens inside that government’s borders, Meta insiders said. What makes Israel’s campaign unique is its success in censoring speech in many countries outside of Israel. What’s more, Israel's censorship project will echo well into the future, insiders said, as the AI program Meta is currently training how to moderate content will base future decisions on the successful takedown of content critical of Israel’s genocide.</p><p>The data, compiled and provided to Drop Site News by whistleblowers, reveal the internal mechanics of Meta’s “Integrity Organization”—an organization within Meta dedicated to ensuring the safety and authenticity on its platforms. Takedown requests (TDRs) allow individuals, organizations, and government officials to request the removal of content that allegedly violates Meta’s policies. The documents indicate that the vast majority of Israel’s requests—95%—fall under Meta’s “terrorism” or “violence and incitement” categories. And Israel’s requests have overwhelmingly targeted users from Arab and Muslim-majority nations in a massive effort to silence criticism of Israel.</p><p>Multiple independent sources inside Meta confirmed the authenticity of the information provided by the whistleblowers. The data also show that Meta removed over 90,000 posts to comply with TDRs submitted by the Israeli government in an average of 30 seconds. Meta also significantly expanded automated takedowns since October 7, resulting in an estimated 38.8 million additional posts being “actioned upon” across Facebook and Instagram since late 2023. “Actioned upon” in Facebook terms means that a post was either removed, banned, or suppressed.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_5760,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;full&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:728,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2137517,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/i/161041203?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038abf2e-627f-44bd-afdf-966cc2568323_12799x6399.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Number of posts reported by the Israeli government over time, by country of post origin.

Obtained by Drop Site News.</figcaption></figure></div><p>All of the Israeli government’s TDRs post-October 7th contain the exact same complaint text, according to the leaked information, regardless of the substance of the underlying content being challenged. Sources said that not a single Israeli TDR describes the exact nature of the content being reported, even though the requests link to an average of 15 different pieces of content. Instead, the reports simply state, in addition to a description of the October 7th attacks, that:</p><blockquote><p><em>This is an urgent request regarding videos posted on Facebook which contain inciting content. The file attached to this request contains link [sic] to content which violated articles 24(a) and 24(b) of the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Act (2016), which prohibits incitement to terrorism praise for acts of terrorism and identification or support of terror organizations. Moreover, several of the links violate article 2(4) of the Privacy Protection Act (1982), which prohibits publishing images in circumstances that could humiliate the person depicted, as they contain images of the killed, injured, and kidnapped. Additionally, to our understanding, the content in the attached report violates Facebook’s community standards.</em></p></blockquote><p>Meta's content enforcement system processes user-submitted reports through different pathways, depending on who is reporting it. Regular users can report posts via the platform’s built-in reporting function, triggering a review. Reported posts are typically first labeled as violating or non-violating by machine-learning models, though sometimes human moderators review them as well. If the AI assigns a high confidence score indicating a violation, the post is removed automatically. If the confidence score is low, human moderators review the post before deciding whether to take action.</p><p>Governments and organizations, on the other hand, have privileged channels to trigger content review. Reports submitted through these channels receive higher priority and are almost always reviewed by human moderators rather than AI. Once reviewed by humans, the reviews are fed back into Meta’s AI system to help it better assess similar content in the future. While everyday users can also file TDRs, they are rarely acted upon. Government-submitted TDRs are far more likely to result in content removal.</p><p><span>Meta has overwhelmingly complied with Israel’s requests, making an exception for the government account by taking down posts without human reviews, according to the whistleblowers, while still feeding that data back into Meta’s AI. A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and" rel="">investigating Meta’s moderation of pro-Palestine content</a><span> post-October 7th found that, of 1,050 posts HRW documented as taken-down or suppressed on Facebook or Instagram, 1,049 involved peaceful content in support of Palestine, while just one post was content in support of Israel.</span></p><p>A source within Meta’s Integrity Organization confirmed that internal reviews of their automated moderation found that pro-Palestinian content that did not violate Meta’s policies was frequently removed. In other cases, pro-Palestinian content that should have been simply removed was given a “strike,” which indicates a more serious offense. Should a single account receive too many strikes on content that it publishes, the entire account can be removed from Meta platforms.</p><p>When concerns about overenforcement against pro-Palestinian content were raised inside the Integrity Organization, the source said, leadership responded by saying that they preferred to overenforce against potentially violating content, rather than underenforce and risk leaving violating content live on Meta platforms.</p><p>Within Meta, several key leadership positions are filled by figures with personal connections to the Israeli government. The Integrity Organization is run by Guy Rosen, a former Israeli military official who served in the Israeli military’s signals intelligence unit, Unit 8200. Rosen was the founder of Onavo, a web analytics and VPN firm that then-Facebook acquired in October 2013. (Previous reporting has revealed that, prior to acquiring the company, Facebook used data Onavo collected from their VPN users to monitor the performance of competitors—part of the anti-competitive behavior alleged by the Federal Trade Commission under the Biden administration in its suit against Meta.)</p><p>Rosen’s Integrity Organization works synergistically with Meta’s Policy Organization, according to employees. The Policy Organization sets the rules, and the Integrity Organization enforces them—but the two feed one another, they said. “Policy changes are often driven by data from the integrity org,” explained one Meta employee. As of this year, Joel Kaplan replaced Nick Clegg as the head of the Policy Organization. Kaplan is a former Bush administration official who has worked with Israeli officials in the past on fighting “online incitement.”</p><p><span>Meta’s Director of Public Policy for Israel and the Jewish Diaspora, Jordana Cutler, has also intervened to investigate pro-Palestine content. Cutler is a former senior Israeli government official and advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Cutler </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/10/21/instagram-israel-palestine-censorship-sjp/" rel="">has reportedly used her role</a><span> to flag pro-Palestine content. According to internal communications reviewed by Drop Site, as recently as March, Cutler actively instructed employees of the company to search for and review content mentioning Ghassan Kanafani, an Arab novelist considered to be a pioneer of Palestinian literature. Immediately prior to joining Meta as a senior policymaker, she spent nearly three years as Chief of Staff at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C—and nearly five years serving as deputy to one of Netanyahu’s senior advisors, before becoming Netanyahu’s advisor on Diaspora Affairs.</span></p><p>According to internal information reviewed by Drop Site, Cutler has continued to demand the review of content related to Kanafani under Meta’s policy “Glorification, Support or Representation” of individuals or organizations “that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on our platforms.” Kanafani, who was killed in a 1972 car bombing orchestrated by the Mossad, served as a spokesperson for the left-wing Palestinian nationalist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The PFLP was designated as a terrorist group over a quarter century after he was killed, which, according to Meta’s guidelines and Cutler’s efforts, serves as a basis to flag his content for removal, strikes, and possible suspension.</p><p>The leaked documents reveal that Israel’s takedown requests have overwhelmingly targeted users from Arab and Muslim-majority nations, with the top 12 countries affected being: Egypt (21.1%), Jordan (16.6%), Palestine (15.6%), Algeria (8.2%), Yemen (7.5%), Tunisia (3.3%), Morocco (2.9%), Saudi Arabia (2.7%), Lebanon (2.6%), Iraq (2.6%), Syria (2%), Turkey (1.5%). In total, users from over 60 countries have reported censorship of content related to Palestine, according to Human Rights Watch—with posts being removed, accounts suspended, and visibility reduced through shadow banning.</p><p>Notably, only 1.3% of Israel’s takedown requests target Israeli users, making Israel an outlier among governments that typically focus their censorship efforts on their own citizens. For example, 63% of Malaysia’s takedown requests target Malaysian content, and 95% of Brazil’s requests target Brazilian content. Israel, however, has turned its censorship efforts outward, focusing on silencing critics and narratives that challenge its policies, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the West Bank.</p><p>Despite Meta’s awareness of Israel’s aggressive censorship tactics for at least seven years, according to Meta whistleblowers, the company has failed to curb the abuse. Instead, one said, the company “actively provided the Israeli government with a legal entry-point for carrying out its mass censorship campaign.”</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/leaked-data-israeli-censorship-meta/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/leaked-data-israeli-censorship-meta/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The effort to ensure that open-source software is <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible</a> has been
gathering steam over the years, and gaining traction with major Linux
distributions. Debian, for example, has been <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/985739/">working toward reproducible
builds</a> for more than a decade; it can <a href="https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2025-March/003675.html">now</a>
produce <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleInstalls/LiveImages#Status">official
live CDs</a> of the current stable release that are 
reproducible. Fedora started on the path much later, but it has
progressed far enough that the project is now considering a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Package_builds_are_expected_to_be_reproducible">change
proposal</a> for the Fedora&nbsp;43 development cycle, expected to be
released in October, with a goal of
making 99% of Fedora's package builds reproducible. So far, reaction
to the proposal seems favorable and focused primarily on how to
achieve the <span>goal—with</span> minimal pain for <span>packagers—rather</span> than whether to attempt it.</p>

<h4>Defining reproducible builds</h4>

<p>The Reproducible Builds project <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/">defines</a> a
build as reproducible if "<q>given the same source code, build
environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit
identical copies of all specified artifacts</q>". In a <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/report-from-the-reproducible-builds-hackfest-during-flock-2023/87469">2023
hackfest report</a>, Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek said that Fedora has
not prioritized reproducible builds in the past because Fedora has
more control over its build process than Debian and other
distributions. Because Debian allows maintainers to
generate source packages on their local system and to upload
some locally built packages for distribution to users, he said that "<q>trust
in the contents of both source and binary packages is low</q>."
(Debian's build daemons build <em>most</em> binary packages from
source for distribution to users, <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/pkgs.html#source-and-binary-uploads">but
there are exceptions</a>.)
Fedora, on the other hand, exercises much more control over packages.</p>

<blockquote>
In Fedora, all packages that are distributed to users are built in the
centralized, strongly controlled infrastructure. All source rpms are
built from "dist-git": a git repository which contains the build
"recipe" and a cryptographic hash of package sources, so it is
relatively easy to verify what changed between package versions, what
"inputs" went into a particular source package, and in what
environment the binary packages were built.
</blockquote>

<p>However, even though Fedora has a tighter control over its
packages, <span>Jędrzejewski-Szmek</span> said that
one of the benefits of reproducible builds was to help detect and
mitigate any kind of supply-chain attack on Fedora's builders and
allow others to perform independent verification that the package
sources match the binaries that are delivered by Fedora. It's
interesting to note that Fedora had embarked on this work before <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967866/">the XZ backdoor</a> drew even
more attention to supply-chain attacks.</p>

<p>He acknowledges that Debian is more advanced in its reproducible
builds processes, and notes that Fedora is setting a different 
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/reproducible-builds/">definition</a>
for reproducible builds. This definition excludes signatures and
some metadata and focuses solely on the payload of packaged files in a given
RPM:</p>

<blockquote>
A build is reproducible if given the same source code, build
environment and build instructions, and metadata from the build
artifacts, any party can recreate copies of the artifacts that are
identical except for the signatures and parts of metadata.
</blockquote>

<p>The reason Fedora is pursuing a different definition of
reproducible build is that it <em><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/reproducible-builds/#_caveats">cannot</a></em>
achieve "<q>bit-by-bit</q>" reproducibility by the
original definition. This is because of differences in the package
format and the way that Fedora builds its packages. RPMs embed the
package signature in the RPM when they are built, but Debian uses
detached signatures. RPMs also include information, such as the build
time (<tt>BUILDTIME</tt>) and build host (<tt>BUILDHOST</tt>) in the RPM's
header, that can affect reproducibilty. There was a <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2603">discussion</a>
about allowing these variables to be overridden. However, the
prevailing opinion was that the information provided by
<tt>BUILDHOST</tt> is useful, and
overriding its inclusion is not desirable. The contents, however,
should still be "<q>bit-by-bit</q>" identical, even though that phrase
does not turn up in Fedora's definition.</p>

<p>The openSUSE project, which also distributes software using the RPM
format, sets <tt>BUILDHOST</tt> to "<tt>reproducible</tt>", <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/2603#issuecomment-1713960828">according</a>
to Jan Zerebecki. The actual build host is printed in the build logs,
and interested users can search openSUSE's build logs to find the
host.</p>

<h4>Path to reproducibility</h4>

<p>For <tt>BUILDTIME</tt>, openSUSE sets the build time to the date of
the latest changelog entry. This is provided to builds by the <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/"><tt>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</tt></a>
environment variable. This is where Fedora's reproducible builds work
began, with a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/ReproducibleBuildsClampMtimes">change</a>
that was made during the Fedora&nbsp;38 development cycle to "clamp"
the modification time (mtime) of packaged files to
<tt>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</tt>. This ensured that the mtimes were
independent of the time of an actual build. Packagers were given the
ability to <span>opt-out</span> of this if, for some
reason, their package would be broken by the new behavior. </p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>During the Fedora&nbsp;41 development cycle, the project
implemented another <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/ReproduciblePackageBuilds">change
in the RPM build process</a> to remove common sources of
irreproducibility. That change made use of a Rust program, <a href="https://github.com/keszybz/add-determinism?tab=readme-ov-file#build-postprocessor-to-reset-metadata-fields-for-build-reproducibility"><tt>add-determinism</tt></a>,
that attempts to standardize metadata in binary or source files to
ensure consistency. It is similar to Debian's <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism"><tt>strip-nondeterminism</tt></a>,
which is a Perl library that is part of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/debhelper.7.html"><tt>debhelper</tt></a>
tool for building Debian packages. Using
<tt>strip-nondeterminism</tt>, the <tt>debhelper</tt> tool removes
non-deterministic information such as timestamps and filesystem
ordering from various file and archive formats. The Fedora project
chose to write its own tool because it was undesirable to pull Perl
into the build root for every package.</p>

<p>According to the new change proposal, the modifications to Fedora's build
infrastructure to date have allowed it to make 90% of package builds
reproducible. The goal now is to reach 99% of package builds. 
It appears that Fedora has gotten as much mileage out of
infrastructure changes, without requiring individual packagers to deal
with reproducibility problems, as it can. To get to 99% the project is going
to have to ask packagers to treat reproducibility problems in their
packages as bugs.</p>

<p>The change <span>owners—Jędrzejewski-Szmek</span>, Davide
Cavalca, and Jelle <span>van der Waa—would</span>
package the <a href="https://github.com/keszybz/fedora-repro-build"><tt>fedora-repro-build</tt></a>
utility to allow developers to make local rebuilds of packages built in <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji">Koji</a> (Fedora's build
system) to test their reproducibility. It will also require standing up a public instance of <a href="https://github.com/kpcyrd/rebuilderd/?tab=readme-ov-file#rebuilderd1---">rebuilderd</a>, which is a system for providing independent verification that binary
packages can be reproduced from source code. It can scan a package
repository's metadata for new or updated packages and then queue them
for rebuilding, and it provides an API to query for the reproducibility
status of packages. Rebuilderd can also, optionally, use the <a href="https://diffoscope.org/">diffoscope</a> tool to generate a
report of differences. The <a href="https://reproducible.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux reproducible
status page</a> provides a good example of rebuilderd in use.</p>

<p>If accepted, the proposal would also require an update to Fedora's <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/">packaging
guidelines</a> that would say packages should (not, at least
currently, "must") build reproducibly and allow bugs to be filed
against packages when they are not reproducible.</p>

<p>Aside from the security benefits of reproducibility, the proposal
also makes the case that it will lead to packages of higher
quality. Irreproducible bits in packages are quite often "<q>caused by
an error or sloppiness in the code</q>". For example, dependence on
hardware architecture in architecture-independent (noarch) packages is
"<q>almost always unwanted and/or a bug</q>", and reproducibility tests
can uncover those bugs.</p>

<p>The proposal acknowledges that some packages will have problems
with reproducibility that cannot be fixed easily. For example, Haskell
packages are not currently reproducible when compiled by more than one
thread, though <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/12935">a fix is
being worked on</a>. Packages produced with Go have <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-reproducible-builds/project/issue/15">debug
data that is not reproducible</a> because the GNU Debugger index file
(<tt>.gdb_index</tt>) can be of varying size even given the same
input. No fix is yet in the works for that. Another known problem is
that the Linux kernel uses an ephemeral key for module signatures. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1012946/">covered</a> a patch set from
Thomas Weißschuh that may solve that problem.</p>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>In the discussion thread on Fedora's Discourse forum, Fedora's
infrastructure lead Kevin Fenzi <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f43-change-proposal-package-builds-are-expected-to-be-reproducible-system-wide/147320/8">asked</a>,
"<q>where will this [rebuilderd] instance live and who will maintain
it? 🙂</q>" He also noted it would be good to have documentation on
setting up a rebuilderd instance. "<q>Otherwise I like the
idea!</q>" Cavalca <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f43-change-proposal-package-builds-are-expected-to-be-reproducible-system-wide/147320/9">said</a>
that the reproducibility work was currently using an Amazon Web
Services (AWS) account sponsored by Meta, but "<q>we can look at
moving into Fedora infra if there's a preference for that</q>". Fenzi
<a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f43-change-proposal-package-builds-are-expected-to-be-reproducible-system-wide/147320/10">replied</a>
that it might be good to keep running the work outside Fedora
infrastructure to make it more independent. "<q>Although of course we could run one and
then others could run others and compare</q>".</p>

<p>Daniel P. Berrangé <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z9vPRyCDNOunM0yY%40redhat.com/">asked</a>
if rebuilderd could be integrated with Koji so that maintainers did
not have to learn another build tool. "<q>I'm pretty unenthusiastic
about dealing with yet another standalone web service providing
post-build testing.</q>" Jędrzejewski-Szmek <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z9vacXyfaLMAqpbu@kawka3.in.waw.pl/">said</a>
that using Koji to perform the build was an interesting idea, but "<q>we
also want our rebuilds to be as independent as possible</q>", so it
would still be desirable to do them in a system other than
Koji. Rebuilding a package the second time in the same build
environment means "<q>we are not testing much</q>".</p>

<p>Miroslav Suchý, a member of Fedora's infrastructure team, 
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/1f4e42ae-8730-4c12-b9b3-b9ba98ab4979@redhat.com/">wondered</a>
if rebuilderd could submit builds to Fedora's <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/">Copr</a> build system
instead of standing up yet another build system in Fedora. This led to
a discussion about Copr's capabilities and whether it would integrate
well with rebuilderd. Jędrzejewski-Szmek <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z9vUWrmpqwMi4RDm@kawka3.in.waw.pl/">noted</a>
that rebuilderd is a "<q>complete project that does things in its own
way</q>" and it may be complicated to try to teach it to talk to an
external service asynchronously.</p>

<p>Integrating rebuilderd tooling and reports into Fedora's existing
infrastructure has been a recurring theme in the discussion. Simon de
Vlieger <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/e47d555a-9bb1-42fd-81ad-6c08eaee5214@app.fastmail.com/#t">said</a>
he was not set on having builds performed in Koji, but wanted the
project "<q>to integrate well with Fedora's <span>pre-existing</span> tools and things so it has the
highest chance of people actually using it</q>" and performing as
people expect.</p>

<h4>Next</h4>

<p>The next step for the proposal is to file a <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/#ticket-votes">ticket</a>
with the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo), at least one
week after the proposal was <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAJqbrbcQ2g-rWNUQ4ee2g8bOR3z-_bgvGL+zNKBS48+C5GVFmw@mail.gmail.com/#t">announced</a>. In
this case, that would be no sooner than March&nbsp;26. If FESCo
approves, the owners can begin work on the proposal with an eye to
completion by October, when Fedora&nbsp;43 is planned for release.</p>

<p>Most of Fedora's users have probably not noticed the
reproducibility work in Fedora thus far and won't appreciate any
difference when they install Fedora&nbsp;43 (or 44, 45, and so
on). However, given the continual efforts of bad actors to find and
exploit supply-chain weaknesses in open-source projects, it is a
valuable effort nonetheless.</p><br clear="all"><hr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>People in tech business circles love this quote by Henry Ford:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to think outside the box and create entirely new markets instead of just new products in existing ones. Like Apple creating the iPhone (sure, smartphones existed before—but cars also existed before the Ford Model T).</p>
<p>But sometimes, I really want a faster horse.</p>
<p>Netflix in 2012 was a super fast horse. It had a simple but massive catalog of movies and shows, solid recommendations, and basic library management. Compared to my limited local media library it was great. You could actively tune your tastes and rate things with a 5-star system.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/vzBUOzXXWZU_1BzCoyxsZ.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/uJGx0a12ohaZNjAlWkdGO.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/48DF8RvJ0y7NGhXiHV35C.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Netflix today is very different. It’s not a library—it’s an <em>experience</em>.
Instead of reliably showing me what I "have" and recommending what I might like, it shuffles content on each interaction, sometimes changing the cover images of shows in real time, like some black-market charlatan. It has no meaningful catalog, no real categories—just short-lived, auto-generated groups like “Binge-worthy” or “Festive spirit.”</p>
<p>Even the “New” section is meaningless. It opens with a “For You” row (huh?), then “Continue Watching”, followed by generic "Popular in <your country="">" rows. It feels like YouTube search: ask for something specific, get a few hits, and then a flood of unrelated "popular" and "recommended" content.</your></p>
<p>“My List” on Netflix randomly shuffles items and changes their covers every few hours. “Continue Watching” may or may not include what I actually watched recently. Sometimes, the engagement algorithms resurrect some random Slovakian cartoon I opened three years ago—one and immediately closed because it that had no English subtitles here in Finland, even though they do exist in other regions.</p>
<p>I just want a faster horse.</p>
<p>Spotify in 2015 was also a super fast horse. It was like my iTunes library, but with millions more tracks. Getting new music became faster, but it didn’t change the nature of my relationship with music.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/2fD6yw340md6C_hY0gy2L.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/k2gx8LUtCVBrliige2EgS.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Spotify today is... basically Netflix. An inconsistent stream of ever-changing content, weak library tools, and an endless barrage of podcasts.</p>
<p>Overall, consistency, user control, and actual UX innovation are in decline. Everything is converging on TikTok—which is basically TV with infinite channels. You don’t control anything except the channel switch. It's like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation">Carcinisation</a>, a form of convergent evolution where unrelated crustaceans all evolve into something vaguely crab-shaped.</p>
<p>The list goes on:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube. YouTube: Once a video catalog with social discovery. Now? TikTok.</li>
<li>LinkedIn. Once a network of resumes. Now? TikTok.</li>
<li>Substack. Yeah, a newsletter platform... now launching TikTok-style videos. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/substack-is-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-in-its-app/">Seriously</a>.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“People are package deals; you take the good with the confused. In most cases, strengths and weaknesses are two sides of the same coin.”</em> — Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve noticed something interesting about almost every engineer I’ve managed: their biggest strengths and their most frustrating weaknesses are often the exact same trait showing up in different contexts.</p>



<p>I learned this lesson personally when I was still a junior engineer. My ability to code quickly made me very productive — I’d often ship features in half the time estimated. My manager praised my speed constantly. </p>



<p>Well, until one day… During a particularly painful postmortem, we discovered that a production issue happened because of an edge case I had missed in my rush to complete the feature. My strength (coding speed) and my weakness (occasionally overlooking details) weren’t separate traits — they were the exact same characteristic showing up differently depending on the context.</p>



<p>This isn’t just true for me or a few people — it’s nearly universal. <strong>The qualities we celebrate in our team members are usually the same ones causing our biggest headaches</strong>. They’re not separate traits; they’re two sides of the same coin.</p>



<p>So what can we do about this? Three things have helped me:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Get real about this duality in your 1:1s.</strong> Most people see their strengths and weaknesses as separate things. They’re not. In 1:1s, I’ll say something like: “Your ability to dive deep into problems is why you find solutions nobody else can. It’s also why you sometimes miss deadlines. Same trait, different outcomes.” This simple reframing helps people stop beating themselves up over their “flaws.”</li>



<li><strong>Be crystal clear about context.</strong> Don’t make people guess when their natural tendencies help versus hurt. One of my engineers was incredibly collaborative—wouldn’t make a single decision without getting everyone’s input. I told him exactly when this worked and when it didn’t: “For architecture decisions? Get all the input you want. For day-to-day coding decisions? You have permission to just decide and move on.” This clear guidance helped him develop his own judgment about when to lean into his collaborative nature.</li>



<li><strong>Use tension as a feature, not a bug.</strong> Some managers try to build teams where everyone works the same way. <a href="https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/03/12/why-your-harmonious-team-is-actually-failing/">That’s a mistake</a>. I once paired our fastest coder with our most methodical, thorough reviewer. The first week was pure chaos—they drove each other nuts. By the third week, they were producing better code than either could alone; the fast coder started anticipating the thorough one’s concerns, and the methodical one learned which shortcuts were actually okay to take.</li>
</ol>



<p>The goal isn’t to create “balanced” engineers with no pronounced strengths or weaknesses. That’s just impossible. <strong>We want self-aware engineers who understand their natural tendencies and can adjust them based on what each situation demands</strong>.</p>



<p>I don’t think our job is to sand down people’s edges until everyone’s the same boring shape. We’re not trying to “fix” our engineers. Instead, we’re helping them see themselves clearly, warts and all, and teaching them when to crank up or dial back their natural tendencies. It’s more like coaching someone to use their power effectively than trying to rebuild them from scratch.</p>



<p>After all, we’re all package deals. The traits that make us brilliant will inevitably challenge us in other contexts. Understanding this doesn’t just make us better managers — it makes us more compassionate humans.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://funcall.blogspot.com/2025/04/why-i-program-in-lisp.html">http://funcall.blogspot.com/2025/04/why-i-program-in-lisp.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43651576">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3404727118065375102" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>Lisp is not the most popular language.  It never was.  Other
  general purpose languages are more popular and ultimately can do
  everything that Lisp can (if Church and Turing are correct).  They
  have more libraries and a larger user community than Lisp does.
  They are more likely to be installed on a machine than Lisp is.</p>

<p>Yet I prefer to program in Lisp.  I keep a Lisp REPL open at all
  times, and I write prototypes and exploratory code in Lisp.  Why do
  I do this?  Lisp is easier to remember, has fewer limitations and hoops you
  have to jump through, has lower “friction” between my
  thoughts and my program, is easily customizable, and, frankly, more
  fun.</p>

<p>Lisp's dreaded Cambridge Polish notation is uniform and
  universal.  I don't have to remember whether a form takes curly
  braces or square brackets or what the operator precedency is or some
  weird punctuated syntax that was invented for no good reason.  It is (operator
  operands ...) for everything.  Nothing to remember.  I basically stopped
  noticing the parenthesis 40 years ago.  I can indent how I
  please.</p> 

<p>I program mostly functionally, and Lisp has three features that
  help out tremendously here.  First, if you avoid side effects, it
  directly supports the substitution model.  You can tell Lisp
  that when it sees this simple form, it can just replace it with that
  more complex one.  Lisp isn't constantly pushing you into thinking
  imperatively.  Second, since the syntax is uniform and doesn't depend on
  the context, you can refactor and move code around at will.  Just
  move things in balanced parenthesis and you'll pretty much be
  ok.</p>

<p>Third, in most computer languages, you can abstract a specific value by
  replacing it with a variable that names a value.  But you can perform a further
  abstraction by replacing a variable that names a quantity with a
  function that computes a quantity.  In functional programming, you often downplay
  the distinction between a value and a function that produces that
  value.  After all, the difference is only one of time spent waiting for the
  answer.  In Lisp, you can change an expression that denotes an
  object into an abtraction that computes an object by simply wrapping
  a <code>lambda</code> around it.  It's less of a big deal these
  days, but properly working <code>lambda</code> expressions were only
  available in Lisp until recently.  Even so, <code>lambda</code>
  expressions are generally pretty clumsy in other languages.</p>

<p>Functional programming focuses on functions (go figure!).  These
  are the ideal black box abstraction:  values go in, answer comes
  out.  What happens inside?  Who knows!  Who cares! But you can plug
  little simple functions together and get bigger more complex
  functions.  There is no limit on doing this.  If you can frame your
  problem as "I have this, I want that", then you can code it as a
  functional program.  It is true that functional programming takes a
  bit of practice to get used to, but it allows you to build complex
  systems out of very simple parts.  Once you get the hang of it, you
  start seeing everything as a function.  (This isn't a limitation.
  Church's lambda calculus is a model of computation based on
  functional composition.)</p>

<p>Lisp lets me try out new ideas as quickly as I can come up
  with them.  New programs are indistinguishable from those built in to
  the language, so I can build upon them just as easily.  Lisp's
  debugger means I don't have to stop everything and restart the world
  from scratch every time something goes wrong.  Lisp's safe memory
  model means that bugs don't trash my workspace as I explore the
  problem.</p>

<p>The REPL in lisp evaluates <em>expressions</em>, which are the
  fundamental fragments of Lisp programs.  You can type in part of a
  Lisp program and see what it does immediately.  If it works, you can
  simply embed the expression in a larger program.  Your program takes
  shape in real time as you explore the problem.</p>

<p>Lisp's dynamic typing gives you virtually automatic ad hoc
  polymorphism.  If you write a program that calls +, it will work on
  any pair of objects that have a well-defined + operator.  Now this
  can be a problem if you are cavalier about your types, but if
  you exercise a little discipline (like not defining + on
  combinations of strings and numbers, for example), and if you avoid
  automatic type coercion, then you can write very generic code that
  works on a superset of your data types.  (Dynamic typing is a
  two-edged sword.  It allows for fast prototyping, but it can hide
  bugs that would be caught at compile time in a statically typed
  language.)</p>

<p>Other languages may share some of these features, but Lisp has them all
  together.  It is a language that was designed to be used as a tool
  for thinking about problems, and that is the fun part of
  programming.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article lang="en-US"><figure><img alt="Default styles for h1 elements are changing." src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/h1-element-styles/featured.png" height="420" width="800"></figure><p>Browsers are starting to roll out changes in default UA styles for nested section headings. Developers should check that their sites don't rely on UA styles for certain cases to avoid unexpected results and failing Lighthouse checks. In this post, we'll have a look at what the incoming changes are, how to identify if it's an issue on your pages, and some hints for conformant and better-structured websites.</p><section aria-labelledby="whats_changing"><h2 id="whats_changing"><a href="#whats_changing">What's changing</a></h2><div><p>The HTML spec used to define an outline algorithm that gave <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> elements an implicit semantic heading level based on how many sectioning elements (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/section"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/aside"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/nav"><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/article"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>) it was nested inside.</p>
<p>The browser rendering was such that <code>section &gt; h1</code> would have the same font-size and margin as <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>. The <code>section &gt; section &gt; h1</code> would be represented as <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, and so on. The default rendering was implemented in browsers in their UA styles, but not the heading level in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree">accessibility tree</a> (what screen readers use). Websites started to use sectioning elements, but didn't expect to see the automatic heading levels from the outline algorithm.</p>
<p>In general, this created confusion about where developers could use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements, tools handled the HTML differently, and the outline algorithm was considered problematic. The outline algorithm was <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/7829" target="_blank">removed from the HTML spec in 2022</a>, but the UA stylesheet rules still remain. The rules in the default styles are what browser vendors are starting to remove now.</p>
<!--  prettier-ignore-start  -->
<div><pre><code>/* where x is :is(article, aside, nav, section) */
x h1 { margin-block: 0.83em; font-size: 1.50em; }
x x h1 { margin-block: 1.00em; font-size: 1.17em; }
x x x h1 { margin-block: 1.33em; font-size: 1.00em; }
x x x x h1 { margin-block: 1.67em; font-size: 0.83em; }
x x x x x h1 { margin-block: 2.33em; font-size: 0.67em; }
</code></pre></div>
<!--  prettier-ignore-end  -->
<p>For example:</p>
<div><pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Level 1&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Level 2&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Level 3&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Level 4&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="what_to_expect_and_when"><h2 id="what_to_expect_and_when"><a href="#what_to_expect_and_when">What to expect and when</a></h2><div><p>Alongside the changes in browser styles, page auditing tools like Lighthouse now flag cases of <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>s without defined <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size"><code>font-size</code></a> as bad practice. Here's the gist of what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> will no longer adapt its style based on surrounding sectioning elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>. UA stylesheet will apply the same style to <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> with no implicit styles that demote <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to match <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Lighthouse will flag a warning if <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is used without a specified font-size. The Lighthouse deprecation warning to look out for is <code>H1UserAgentFontSizeInSection</code>. Hints for dealing with this are described in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of when this is happening, changes are rolling out in the following browsers in this timeline:</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="firefox"><h3 id="firefox"><a href="#firefox">Firefox</a></h3><div><ul>
<li>From March 31, 2025, Firefox is rolling out changes to 50% of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#beta" target="_blank">Beta 138</a> users to remove UA styles for <code>h1</code> in <code>article</code>, <code>aside</code>, <code>nav</code>, or <code>section</code> on desktop. The plan is to roll out to 5% of users on the Firefox 138 stable release, ramp up to 50% of users, then ship on all platforms in Firefox 140. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1885509" target="_blank">bug 1885509</a>.</li>
<li>Since Firefox 136, developers will see a console warning for <code>h1</code>s in <code>article</code>/<code>aside</code>/<code>nav</code>/<code>section</code> without author-defined font-size or margins: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1937568" target="_blank">bug 1937568</a>.</li>
<li>To test in Firefox with the new behavior, set <code>layout.css.h1-in-section-ua-styles.enabled</code> to false in about:config.</li>
</ul></div></section><section aria-labelledby="chrome"><h3 id="chrome"><a href="#chrome">Chrome</a></h3><div><ul>
<li>Since version 136, Chrome shows deprecation warnings for <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> inside the 4 elements, when the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> uses the default smaller font size. Marking something deprecated in Chromium <strong>will lower Lighthouse scores</strong> for "Best Practices": <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/394111284" target="_blank">issue 394111284</a></li>
</ul></div></section><section aria-labelledby="safari"><h3 id="safari"><a href="#safari">Safari</a></h3><div><ul>
<li>There's no implementation bugs to track in Safari for these changes yet, but we <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7867#issuecomment-2124317504" target="_blank">can expect WebKit to follow</a> with equivalent updates.</li>
</ul></div></section><section aria-labelledby="fixing_the_lighthouse_warning"><h2 id="fixing_the_lighthouse_warning"><a href="#fixing_the_lighthouse_warning">Fixing the Lighthouse warning</a></h2><div><p>Lighthouse has recently <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/16404" target="_blank">inherited a check</a> based on Chromium's DevTools warnings for sites that don't specify a <code>font-size</code> for <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements. The new rule is called <code>H1UserAgentFontSizeInSection</code> and shows up since March following the addition of deprecation warnings. If you see the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> warning, make sure you're applying an explicit <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> font-size and margins. Here's some recommended styles to use:</p>
<div><pre><code>h1 {
  margin-block: 0.67em;
  font-size: 2em;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>To avoid overwriting other style rules that target <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where"><code>:where()</code></a>, which has zero <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity">specificity</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code>:where(h1) {
  margin-block: 0.67em;
  font-size: 2em;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The MDN page for heading elements now contains <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements#specifying_a_uniform_font_size_for_h1">the usage notes listed above</a> so there is a visible place for developers to see this information.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="summary"><h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary">Summary</a></h2><div><p>Here's some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> rely on default browser styles for conveying a heading hierarchy. Explicitly define your document hierarchy using <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for second-level headings, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for third-level, etc.</li>
<li>Always define your own <code>font-size</code> and <code>margin</code> for <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements.</li>
<li>Consider updating your CSS resets to account for the change.</li>
<li>Audit your site <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank">using Lighthouse</a> and browser <a href="https://firefox-dev.tools/" target="_blank">DevTools</a> to check for deprecated usage.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="AI company logos with suspicious circular designs" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fwhy-do-AI-company-logos-look-like-buttholes.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fwhy-do-AI-company-logos-look-like-buttholes.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fwhy-do-AI-company-logos-look-like-buttholes.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>If you pay attention to AI company branding, you'll notice a pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Circular shape (often with a gradient)</li>
<li>Central opening or focal point</li>
<li>Radiating elements from the center</li>
<li>Soft, organic curves</li>
</ol>
<p>Sound familiar? It should, because it's also an apt description of... well, you know.</p>
<p>A butthole.</p>
<h2>The circular AI logo epidemic</h2>
<p>If you ever thought that AI company logos look like buttholes, you're not alone.</p>
<p>FastCompany noticed this trend in 2023 and published an article about it, but (I could only presume) their editors and lawyers didn't let them title the article the way the wanted it to title, so it got published with a more safe for work title: <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90869029/ai-boom-logo-trend-swirling-hexagon">The AI boom is creating a new logo trend: the swirling hexagon</a>. They also were careful not to mention anything anatomical.</p>
<p>I don't have editors or lawyers, so let's take a closer look at some examples:</p>
<h4>OpenAI's logo evolution</h4>
<p><img alt="OpenAI's logo evolution" loading="lazy" width="1510" height="438" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fopenai-logo-evolution.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fopenai-logo-evolution.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fopenai-logo-evolution.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>OpenAI's original logo was a simple, text-based mark. Then came the redesign: a perfect circle with a subtle gradient and central void.</p>
<p><a href="https://openai.com/brand/">OpenAI's official explanation</a> is a masterclass in corporate euphemism:</p>
<p><em>"The Blossom logo is more than just a visual symbol; it represents the core philosophy that guides our approach to design and innovation. At its heart, the logo captures the dynamic intersection between humanity and technology—two forces that shape our world and inspire our work. The design embodies the fluidity and warmth of human-centered thinking through the use of circles, while right angles introduce the precision and structure that technology demands."</em></p>
<p>Sure, Sam.</p>
<p>Translation: "We made a circular shape with some angles because it looked nice, then wrote flowery language to justify why our butthole-adjacent design is actually profound."</p>
<p>The <strong>fluidity and warmth of human-centered thinking through the use of circles</strong> is perhaps the most elegant way anyone has ever described making a logo that resembles an anus.</p>
<h4>The Big AI companies</h4>
<p><img alt="Big AI companies logos" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fbig-ai-companies-logos.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fbig-ai-companies-logos.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fbig-ai-companies-logos.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Looking at the logos of the Big AI companies, you can see that they almost all of them have a circular or snowflake-like shape and a central opening.</p>
<p>Only DeepSeek and DeepMind don't follow the trend. Interestingly, both are sea-related.</p>
<h4>Smoking gun: Anthropic's Claude</h4>
<p>Up until this point, the logos have been subtle. You might say that the logos are simply circular and there's not much more to it.</p>
<p>But Anthropic's Claude takes it to the next level.</p>
<p>Here's a side-by-side comparison with a drawing from Kurt Vonnegut's book "Breakfast of Champions". I added Claude's logo below for easy comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="Vonnegut vs Claude" loading="lazy" width="832" height="687" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2FVonnegut-vs-Claude.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2FVonnegut-vs-Claude.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2FVonnegut-vs-Claude.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Both the drawing and the description in the book are unambiguous. This is not just "a circular shape with a gradient" anymore, is it?</p>
<h4>It's not just AI companies</h4>
<p>Even traditional companies aren't immune. Here are a few notable or funny examples. But the percentage of AI company logos that look like buttholes is still significanly higher than than any other industry.</p>
<p><img alt="Non-AI butthole logos" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="481" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fnon-ai-logos.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fnon-ai-logos.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fnon-ai-logos.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>I especially like the Electrolux one. It's simple, memorable, and once you see a butt and bikini, you can't unsee it.</p>
<h2>Why does this keep happening?</h2>
<p>There are several factors at play:</p>
<h4>Circular design psychology</h4>
<p>Circles represent wholeness, completion, and infinity—concepts that align with AI's promise. They're also friendly and non-threatening, qualities companies desperately want to project when selling potentially job-replacing technology.</p>
<h4>Unintentional biomimicry</h4>
<p><img alt="Face on Mars" loading="lazy" width="832" height="614" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fface-on-mars.jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fface-on-mars.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fface-on-mars.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>The human brain finds familiar patterns in random shapes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">pareidolia</a>), like a face on Mars, taken by the Viking 1 orbiter and released by NASA in 1976.</p>
<p>But sometimes, designers inadvertently recreate biological forms without realizing the... anatomical implications.</p>
<h4>The copycat effect</h4>
<p>Once a few major players adopted the circular sphincter aesthetic, everyone followed suit. Now we have an industry where standing out means looking exactly like everyone else's butthole.</p>
<p>Basically, the same reason <a href="https://velvetshark.com/why-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else">why so many brands change their logos and look like everyone else</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Tech and fashion logos using sans serif fonts" loading="lazy" width="2483" height="1419" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fwhy-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else%2F5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fwhy-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else%2F5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<h4>Design by committee</h4>
<p>Another factor is how these logos are created. Important corporate decisions involve many stakeholders. The result is often the safest, most inoffensive option, the average of everyone's opinions. In design meetings at AI companies, conversations probably sound like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we make it more futuristic?</li>
<li>It needs to feel advanced but approachable.</li>
<li>Let's add a subtle gradient to convey intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<p>No single person suggests making a logo that resembles an anus, but when everyone's feedback gets incorporated, that's what often emerges. Risk aversion in corporate environments naturally pushes designs toward familiar, "safe" territory, which apparently means anatomical openings.</p>
<h2>What this says about tech branding</h2>
<p>This phenomenon reveals something deeper about the tech industry: the fear of standing out too much. Despite claims of innovation and disruption, there's tremendous pressure to look legitimate by conforming to established visual language.</p>
<p>When OpenAI's sphincter-like logo became successful, it created a template that said, "This is what serious AI looks like." Now, any new AI company that doesn't resemble a colorful anatomical opening risks being seen as unserious or unprofessional.</p>
<h3>Tech design trends through history</h3>
<p>This isn't the first time tech design has gone through a conformity phase. Consider these previous waves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1990s-2000s: 3D and Glossy</strong> - Remember when every logo needed a drop shadow and a glassy shine? Apple's aqua interface set the standard.</li>
<li><strong>2010-2013: Skeuomorphism</strong> - Digital designs mimicking physical objects, with stitched leather textures and realistic dials.</li>
<li><strong>2013-2018: Flat Design</strong> - Reaction to skeuomorphism brought minimal, clean interfaces with bright colors and no shadows.</li>
<li><strong>2018-2022: Neomorphism</strong> - Soft shadows and semi-flat design creating subtle, "touchable" interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>2022-Present: The Butthole Era</strong> - Circular gradients with central focal points dominating AI branding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each era started with innovations that were quickly copied until the industry reached saturation point and moved on to the next trend.</p>
<p><img alt="Sans serif bags" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="667" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fwhy-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else%2F5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fwhy-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else%2F5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fwhy-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else%2F5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p><em>Logos become increasingly interchangeable (one of the bags is real, but they all look the same)</em></p>
<h2>Historic logo disasters: You're not alone</h2>
<p>AI companies can take some comfort in knowing they're not the first to face unintended anatomical comparisons. Logo history is filled with disasters but to keep this consistent with the theme of the article, here's a couple of them.</p>
<p><img alt="Logo disasters" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="481" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fother-logo-disasters.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fother-logo-disasters.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://velvetshark.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes%2Fother-logo-disasters.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<ul>
<li>Zune logo, when flipped, says something different. Maybe that's one of the reasons why iPod won?</li>
<li>Brazilian Institute of Oriental Studies is a stylized pagoda sillhouetted against the setting sun. Or so the designers wanted it to look. The final result was much more... anatomical. They since changed it to something less suggestive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe companies should have a panel of "middle schoolers" on their payroll to review logos before launch. They'll find every possible inappropriate interpretation with ruthless efficiency.</p>
<h2>Breaking free from the butthole</h2>
<p>For companies brave enough to differentiate, here are some alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embrace sharp angles</strong> - geometric shapes with defined edges create a distinct visual identity</li>
<li><strong>Use negative space creatively</strong> - think FedEx arrow, not biological openings</li>
<li><strong>Avoid radial symmetry</strong> - not everything needs to be perfectly circular</li>
<li><strong>Skip the gradient</strong> - flat design still works</li>
<li><strong>Test with diverse audiences</strong> - if five different people independently say "that looks like a butthole," it probably does (show it to teenagers if you want to uncover even the most subtle anatomical implications)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Does this mean AI companies should change their branding? Not necessarily. The familiarity clearly works in building trust. But perhaps the next wave of AI innovation could be accompanied by some visual innovation too.</p>
<p>For companies looking to break the mold, consider these approaches that successful tech brands have used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embrace meaningful abstraction</strong> - Slack's hashtag-inspired logo communicates collaboration without circular clichés</li>
<li><strong>Leverage letterforms</strong> - Netflix's simple "N" has become instantly recognizable without anatomical confusion</li>
<li><strong>Tell a story</strong> - Stripe's distinctive parallel lines reflect payment flows moving seamlessly</li>
<li><strong>Use distinctive color combinations</strong> - Twitch's purple branding stands out in a sea of blue tech logos</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge for the next generation of AI companies isn't just technological - it's finding visual language that communicates innovation without resorting to the same tired sphincter-inspired patterns.</p>
<p><strong>PS.</strong> <em>This post is meant to be humorous, but let's not pretend there isn't a serious point here about <a href="https://velvetshark.com/why-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else">the depressing sameness in modern design</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">


<p>We are announcing a new Crystal release 1.16.0 with several new features and bug fixes.</p>

<p>Pre-built packages are available on <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.16.0">GitHub Releases</a>
and our official distribution channels.
See <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/install/">crystal-lang.org/install</a> for
installation instructions.</p>

<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>

<p>This release includes <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.16.0">162 changes since 1.15.1</a>
by 19 contributors.  We thank all the contributors for all the effort put into
improving the language! ❤️</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>Below we list the most remarkable changes in the language, compiler and stdlib.
For more details, visit the <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.16.0">full changelog</a>.</p>

<h3 id="breaking">Breaking</h3>

<p>The following changes break prior behavior of the compiler, but we expect them to not break much in existing code. If this is not the case, please let us know in the <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues">issue tracker</a> or <a href="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/">forum</a>.</p>

<h4 id="fixed-implementation-of-filematch">Fixed implementation of <code><span>File</span><span>.</span><span>match?</span></code></h4>

<p>The implementation of <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.16.0/File.html#match%3F(pattern%3AString%2Cpath%3APath|String)%3ABool-class-method"><code><span>File</span><span>.</span><span>match?</span></code></a> was insufficient and has been replaced by a new algorithm.
This change should not affect any behaviour that was previously working as documented.</p>

<p>The correction of implementation bugs leads to the following changes in observed behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wildcard and globstar are able to match non-greedily. For example, <code><span>**</span><span>/a</span></code> now matches <code><span>a</span></code>.</li>
  <li>Globstar matches full path segments only, otherwise it’s just two wildcards (which is equivalent to a single one). For example, <code><span>a</span><span>**</span></code> no longer matches <code><span>ab</span><span>/</span><span>c</span></code> (but it matches <code><span>ab</span></code>).</li>
  <li>Subpatterns in branches are parsed with respect to their respective syntactical context. For example, <code><span>{[}]}</span></code> now matches <code><span>}</span></code>.
It parses as a branch with one subpattern that describes the character set <code><span>}</span></code>. Previously, this was a parse error.</li>
  <li>Escapes for special character are recognized. For example, <code><span>\\</span><span>t</span></code> now matches <code><span>\</span><span>t</span></code> while previously it matched <code><span>t</span></code>.</li>
  <li>The grammar for parsing character classes is more flexible. For example, <code><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>-</span><span>]</span></code>, now matches <code><span>a</span></code> and <code><span>-</span></code>. Previously, it was a pattern error (incomplete character range).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.16.0/Dir.html#glob(patterns:Enumerable,match:File::MatchOptions=File::MatchOptions.glob_default,follow_symlinks:Bool=false):Array(String)-class-method"><code><span>Dir</span><span>.</span><span>glob</span></code></a> is implemented differently and is not affected by that invalid behaviour. There were no changes to it.</p>

<h4 id="parameter-name-suffixes-are-deprecated">Parameter name suffixes are deprecated</h4>

<p>The suffixes <code><span>?</span></code> and <code><span>!</span></code> for parameter names of defs, macros and blocks are deprecated.  This aligns them with other variable names.  They produce a warning now (<a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/12197">#12197</a>).</p>

<h4 id="implicit-return-type-of-enumerablesum-and-product">Implicit return type of <code><span>Enumerable</span><span>#sum</span></code> and <code><span>#product</span></code></h4>

<p><a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.16.0/Enumerable.html#sum-instance-method"><code><span>Enumerable</span><span>#sum</span></code></a> and <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.16.0/Enumerable.html#product-instance-method"><code><span>#product</span></code></a> no longer resolve an implicit return type when the element type is a union. This can’t work reliably.
Instead, you need to specify the sum/product type explicitly by the <code><span>initial</span></code> parameter with a value of the intended return type (<a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15314">#15314</a>).
In effect, this moves a runtime error condition to a compile time error.</p>

<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10000000000_u64</span><span>].</span><span>sum</span> <span># Error: `Enumerable#sum` and `#product` do not support Union types.</span>
                         <span># Instead, use `Enumerable#sum(initial)` and `#product(initial)`,</span>
                         <span># respectively, with an initial value of the intended type of the call.</span>

<h4 id="resource-string-in-httprequest">Resource string in <code><span>HTTP</span><span>::</span><span>Request</span></code></h4>

<p><a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.16.0/HTTP/Request.html#-instance-method"><code><span>HTTP</span><span>::</span><span>Request</span></code></a> was fixed to correctly parse HTTP resource strings that look like an absolute URL.
This may break code that relied on the previous, buggy behaviour (<a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15499">#15499</a>).</p>

<div><pre><code><span># Crystal 1.16.0</span>
<span>HTTP</span><span>::</span><span>Request</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>"http://example.com/foo"</span><span>).</span><span>path</span> <span># =&gt; "http://example.com/foo"</span>

<span># Crystal &lt; 1.16.0</span>
<span>HTTP</span><span>::</span><span>Request</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>"http://example.com/foo"</span><span>).</span><span>path</span> <span># =&gt; "/foo"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/straight-shoota">@straight-shoota</a></em></p>

<h4 id="environment-changes-for-subcommands">Environment changes for subcommands</h4>

<p>The compiler won’t set the environment variable <code><span>$CRYSTAL</span></code> when running a process for a subcommand.
This variable was only in introduced in <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/14953">#14953</a> in 1.14.0.
We addded a more flexible alternative <code><span>$CRYSTAL_EXEC_PATH</span></code>, and the equivalent to <code><span>$CRYSTAL</span></code> is now <code><span>$CRYSTAL_EXEC_PATH</span><span>/</span><span>crystal</span></code>. The compiler also prepends its path to <code><span>$PATH</span></code> (<a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15186">#15186</a>).</p>

<p><em>Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/straight-shoota">@straight-shoota</a></em></p>

<h3 id="execution-contexts">Execution Contexts</h3>

<p>Execution contexts from <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/rfcs/pull/2">RFC 0002</a> are available as a preview feature.
It has already proven to be quite robust, but there might be some rough edges.</p>

<p>You can test execution contexts with the compiler flags <code><span>-</span><span>Dpreview_mt</span> <span>-</span><span>Dexecution_context</span></code>.
The default context is single threaded (unlike standalone <code><span>-</span><span>Dpreview_mt</span></code>).
But you can then start additional contexts as you need (for example, a <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/master/Fiber/ExecutionContext/MultiThreaded.html"><code><span>Fiber</span><span>::</span><span>ExecutionContext</span><span>::</span><span>MultiThreaded</span></code></a> or <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/master/Fiber/ExecutionContext/Isolated.html"><code><span>Fiber</span><span>::</span><span>ExecutionContext</span><span>::</span><span>Isolated</span></code></a>).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>mt_context</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fiber</span><span>::</span><span>ExecutionContext</span><span>::</span><span>MultiThreaded</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"worker-threads"</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>

<span>10</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>mt_context</span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>do_something</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>gtk</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fiber</span><span>::</span><span>ExecutionContext</span><span>::</span><span>Isolated</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Gtk"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Gtk</span><span>.</span><span>main</span>
<span>end</span>
<span>gtk</span><span>.</span><span>wait</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Execution contexts are supported on most targets, including, Linux, macOS, Windows and the different BSDs, on X86 and ARM architectures.
This addition marks the peak of the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2024/02/09/84codes-manas-mt/">ongoing project to improve multi-threading support</a> with the help of <a href="https://www.84codes.com/">84codes</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Albert Saniger, the founder and former CEO of Nate, an AI shopping app that promised a “universal” checkout experience, was charged with defrauding investors on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tech-ceo-charged-artificial-intelligence-investment-fraud-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according</a> to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Founded in 2018, Nate raised over $50 million from investors like Coatue and Forerunner Ventures, most recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210617005139/en/Universal-Shopping-App-nate-Raises-%2438M-to-Expand-Its-Online-Payment-Solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">raising</a> a $38 million Series A in 2021 led by Renegade Partners.</p>







<p>Nate said its app’s users could buy from any e-commerce site with a single click, thanks to AI. In reality, however, Nate relied heavily on hundreds of human contractors in a call center in the Philippines to manually complete those purchases, the DOJ’s Southern District of New York alleges.</p>

<p>Saniger raised millions in venture funding by claiming that Nate was able to transact online “without human intervention,” except for edge cases where the AI failed to complete a transaction. But despite Nate acquiring some AI technology and hiring data scientists, its app’s actual automation rate was effectively 0%, the DOJ claims.</p>

<p>Nate’s heavy usage of human contractors was the subject of <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/shaky-tech-and-cash-burning-giveaways-ai-shopping-startup-shows-excesses-of-funding-boom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an investigation</a> by The Information in 2022.</p>

<p>Saniger didn’t respond to a request for comment. He is currently <a href="https://buttercore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listed</a> as a managing partner at New York VC Buttercore Partners, which didn’t respond to a request for comment either.</p>

<p>The DOJ’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/media/1396131/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indictment</a> says that Nate ran out of money and was forced to sell its assets in January 2023, leaving its investors with “near total” losses. Albert Saniger’s LinkedIn profile indicates he was no longer CEO as of 2023.</p>


<p>Nate isn’t the only startup that has allegedly exaggerated its AI capabilities. For example, an “AI” drive-through software startup was also powered largely by humans in the Philippines, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/8/23993427/artificial-intelligence-presto-automation-fast-food-drive-thru-philippines-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More recently, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/evenup-ai-errors-hallucinations-former-employees-2024-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that an AI legal tech unicorn, EvenUp, used humans to do much of its work.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Black Mirror is more than science fiction – its stories about modernity have become akin to science folklore, shaping our collective view of technology and the future.</p><p>Each new innovation gets an allegory: smartphones as tools for a new age caste system, robot dogs as overzealous human hunters, drones as a murderous swarm, artificial intelligence as new age necromancy, virtual reality and brain chips as seizure-inducing nightmares, to name a few. Episodes most often channel our collective anxieties about the future – or foment new ones through masterly writing, directing, casting and acting. It is a must-watch, but must we take it so seriously?</p><p>Black Mirror fails to consistently explore the duality of technology and our reactions to it. It is a critical deficit. The show mimics the folly of Icarus and Daedalus – the original tech bros – and the hubris of Jurassic Park’s Dr Hammond. Missing are the lessons of the Prometheus myth, which shows fire as a boon for humanity, not doom, though its democratization angered benevolent gods. Absent is the plot twist of Pandora’s box that made it philosophically useful: the box also contained hope and opportunity that new knowledge brings. While Black Mirror explores how humans react to technology, it too often does so in service of a dystopian narrative, ignoring Isaac Asimov’s <a href="https://newsletter.pessimistsarchive.org/p/how-isaac-asimov-predicted-the-openai" data-link-name="in body link">observation</a>: that humans are prone to irrationally fear or resist technology.</p><p>Black Mirror is more pessimism porn than Plato’s parable, imparting to its audience a tacit lesson: fear the future more than the past. Fear too much technological change, not too little. It is an inherently populist narrative, one that appeals to nostalgia: intellectually, we understand the present is better than the past in large part due to scientific and technological change, yet emotionally and instinctually we can’t help but feel this time in history is different, that the future can only get worse.</p><h2 id="the-heavy-consequences-of-technological-fearmongering">The heavy consequences of technological fearmongering</h2><p>This kind of reductive dystopianism – a hallmark of post-1960s science fiction – clouds our thinking about the future because it “cannot imagine a better future, and it doesn’t ask anyone to bother to make one”, as New Yorker writer Jill Lepore <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/a-golden-age-for-dystopian-fiction" data-link-name="in body link">noted</a> in 2017.</p><p>We run from the speculative risks of the future, towards the proven dangers of the past, a dynamic I call the <a href="https://x.com/LouisAnslow/status/1786627656655818781" data-link-name="in body link">Frankenstein fallacy</a>. This pessimistic archetype has bipartisan allure because “it requires so little by way of literary, political, or moral imagination”, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/a-golden-age-for-dystopian-fiction" data-link-name="in body link">according</a> to Lepore; consequently, it is politically useful but unconstructive – as populism tends to be.</p><p>Technological pessimism will not insure against a more dystopian tomorrow. Fear of genetically modified organisms – which kicked off around the <a href="https://medium.com/timeline/gmo-food-labeling-rifkin-d5f125ba19f7" data-link-name="in body link">release</a> of Jurassic Park – has seen countries run from GMO <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/jun/01/gm.zimbabwenews" data-link-name="in body link">food aid</a> toward famine, from vitamin-enriched GMO “golden rice” towards malnutrition leading to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/26/gm-golden-rice-delay-cost-millions-of-lives-child-blindness" data-link-name="in body link">millions of avoidable deaths</a>. Countries such as the United States and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-shuts-down-its-last-nuclear-power-stations/a-65249019" data-link-name="in body link">Germany</a> ran from a future of nuclear energy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/20/nuclear-plant-closure-carbon-emissions-new-york" data-link-name="in body link">towards coal</a> and oil. In the Philippines, a nuclear plant built in the 1970s sits unused – <a href="https://www.rappler.com/philippines/145299-national-consensus-reopen-bataan-nuclear-power-plant-doe/" data-link-name="in body link">never turned on</a> – while its population deals with sky-high energy prices. All three countries are now trying to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-nuclear-lobby-says-up-six-reactors-could-restart-2025-03-05/" data-link-name="in body link">reverse course</a>, realizing that the certainty of stasis and stagnation is its own form of dystopia. In contrast, France ran from the past towards the future, overcoming public fears of nuclear disasters, now getting <a href="https://www.euronews.com/business/2024/05/16/economics-of-nuclear-power-the-france-germany-divide-explained" data-link-name="in body link">70%</a> of its electricity from nuclear power.</p><p>Countries such as India, Brazil, Mexico and Thailand have run from vapes – <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/countries-that-ban-the-sale-of-vapes-e-cigarettes" data-link-name="in body link">outlawing</a> them, while permitting traditional tobacco cigarettes for 1.8 billion of their citizens. Better unsafe than sorry.</p><p>In the US, Robert F Kennedy Jr runs from vaccines towards natural herd immunity – although he might be having second <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury" data-link-name="in body link">thoughts</a> now that the risks have become less abstract. Bipartisan efforts have sought to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/4/23819578/kosa-kids-online-safety-act-privacy-danger" data-link-name="in body link">remove online anonymity</a> to protect children, forgetting that as adults they’ll lose the protection that anonymity brings in the context of free speech. Attacks on environmentally friendly lab-grown beef from Republicans have drawn support by Democrats such as <a href="https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1786509165340357115" data-link-name="in body link">John Fetterman</a>.</p><p>In the UK, encryption is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644367/apple-inc-v-the-uk-government" data-link-name="in body link">under siege</a>, a modern-day Promethean protection that angers the powerful, in the name of keeping society from runaway technology. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/04/07/boris-johnson-criticises-plans-to-show-hit-netflix-show-adolescence-in-secondary-schools" data-link-name="in body link">Adolescence</a> is the latest dystopian Netflix show to shape public policy conversations about technology and the future.</p><p>Artificial intelligence has been touted as an <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" data-link-name="in body link">existential threat</a> to humanity while it accelerates <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/07/ai-is-coming-skin-cancer-detection/" data-link-name="in body link">cancer treatments</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/27/1-in-3-americans-who-die-in-hospital-had-sepsis-and-thats-just-one-of-the-many-areas-where-ai-can-improve-early-diagnosis/" data-link-name="in body link">reduces</a> sepsis deaths and produces <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz6e9edy3o" data-link-name="in body link">new antibiotics</a> to treat stubborn superbugs.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-12" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The folly of treating the miracles of science and technology as inevitable curses became unavoidable in the global coronavirus pandemic. The risk of inaction and stasis was too real to ignore, and the absence of technology became the threat. Tellingly, it was in this period – between 2020 and 2022 – that Black Mirror went on hiatus. Charlie Brooker <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/black-mirror-creator-charlie-booker-not-working-on-black-mirror-because-life-is-black-mirror/" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> this was because people didn’t want to consume dystopian fiction when everything felt so bleak. In a moment when screens kept us connected, protected and employed, the reductiveness of dystopian science fiction felt silly. Biotechnology like GMOs and mRNA offered existential hope, rather than risk.</p><p>Suddenly, it became deeply uncool and unintellectual to fear technology – as 5G masts burned and Black Mirror-esque conspiracy theories of computer chips being injected through vaccines spread, dystopian fiction lost its allure, though its vestiges still lurked: Chipotle offered free burritos to the vaccinated, burritos it proudly markets as GMO-free. King Charles, who once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/prince.charles.gm.farming#:~:text=Prince%20Charles%20has%20warned%20that,environmentally%2C%20of%20all%20time%22." data-link-name="in body link">warned</a> that genetically modified organisms would cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time, would <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/11/23/vaccine-news-astrazeneca-oxford-earns-praise-prince-william/6389217002/" data-link-name="in body link">congratulate</a> Oxford researchers for their GMO-based Covid vaccine.

But the story starts much earlier, back in 2018.</span></p><p><span>At this time, I was working in Switzerland, refactoring a C++ legacy codebase. Together with my colleague and friend </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dchambon/" rel="">Damien Chambon</a><span>, we started evaluating Scala and </span><a href="https://akka.io/" rel="">Akka</a><span> (an actor model framework) for a potential rewrite. Why Scala and Akka, you may wonder? Well, back then I had mostly Java/JVM experience, and I was intrigued by the promises of the actor model.</span></p><p>But things were… definitely not simple. First off, it was a whole new language to learn. Second, Akka is a beast. It takes time to ramp up, and we even had to hire an external consultant to help with the implementation. After months of work, we finally had our first PoC. And yet, neither my colleague nor I were really convinced.</p><p>So, we started looking at another language to counterbalance Scala. Maybe this new one wasn’t the sexiest language ever invented, but it looks promising, efficient, and much easier to ramp up with: Go.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png" width="249" height="93.10434782608695" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:129,&quot;width&quot;:345,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:249,&quot;bytes&quot;:7350,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Go logo.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Go logo." title="Go logo." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>After just a couple of weeks in Go, we were able to cover the same scope as our Scala/Akka PoC.

In this email, I was saying, “</span><em>I’m at 80%</em><span>” because for most of the mistakes, I already had some content written:</span></p><ul><li><p>The mistake itself</p></li><li><p>A surrounding example</p></li><li><p>And various solutions to fix the mistake</p></li></ul><p>So, in my head, the hardest part was already done.</p><p><strong>I haven’t been more wrong in my entire life.</strong></p><p>The next day, I got a reply from someone at Manning with the title of acquisition editor. If you’re not familiar with that role, an acquisition editor is someone who evaluates and signs new book projects for publication. Basically, a scout. Throughout my writing journey, he was my main contact at Manning, and as you will see, he helped me at a critical moment later in the process.</p><p>We had a first meeting to briefly discuss my idea, and Manning was on board to move to the next step: filling out a proposal. This proposal was a document with 21 questions to frame the project, including things like:</p><ul><li><p>Speaking about yourself</p></li><li><p>A summary of the book</p></li><li><p>Describing your target reader</p></li><li><p>A table of contents</p></li></ul><p><span>This document was then sent by Manning to external reviewers, all with Go experience, who wrote their own evaluations of the proposal. Funny enough, my mate </span><a href="https://x.com/val_deleplace" rel="">Valentin Deleplace</a><span>, who would become my colleague a few years later, was actually the first reviewer of the book.</span></p><p>As a potential author, I had access to all the reviews. And while it’s obviously essential for a publisher to judge the technical quality of a project, it was also super valuable for me. It helped me see whether the idea only sounded good in my own head or if it could actually be interesting to others, too.</p><p>I received a total of seven reviews, and all of them were positive. Some included constructive feedback on how to improve certain aspects (like the table of contents, for example), but the overall tone was fully supportive.</p><p><span>It was December 7, 2020, roughly two weeks after I sent my first email, and </span><strong>I received an offer from Manning</strong><span>:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png" width="1164" height="405" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:405,&quot;width&quot;:1164,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:289710,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Screenshot of the email from Manning offering the author a publishing contract for 100 Go Mistakes, outlining the review and editing process involved.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Screenshot of the email from Manning offering the author a publishing contract for 100 Go Mistakes, outlining the review and editing process involved." title="Screenshot of the email from Manning offering the author a publishing contract for 100 Go Mistakes, outlining the review and editing process involved." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Let’s talk about one of the aspects people ask about the most: my contract.</p><p><strong>In terms of royalties, I got paid 10% on all sales</strong><span>. On one hand, yes, that’s not a lot. Yet, you really have to understand how helpful a publisher can be for a first-time “author” with zero experience like I was back then, for two main reasons:</span></p><ul><li><p>First, and we will go over the process later, but the number of reviews from different people is insane. If I had written the book completely on my own, I can guarantee the quality would have been way lower.</p></li><li><p>Second, in terms of visibility, going with a publisher helps a lot, especially if, like me back then, you had around 400 followers on Twitter. Sure, content can still go viral without a big audience, but it’s a lot less likely.</p></li></ul><p>When I signed the contract, I also received an advance: $2,000 upfront, and $2,000 after delivering one-third of the book.</p><p>The contract also included deadlines:</p><ul><li><p>One-third of the book will be delivered by February 15, 2021</p></li><li><p>Two-thirds by April 15, 2021</p></li><li><p>A full draft of the complete manuscript by July 2021</p></li></ul><p>As the book was eventually published in August 2022, you can imagine I was slightly late. But when I spoke with people at Manning, they told me most technical books are late. We all know that in tech, we’re not great at planning. So why would it be any different when we start writing books? 🙂</p><p>Jokes aside, at that stage, I didn’t fully realize how much work was ahead of me, so July 2021 seemed doable.</p><p>At the very beginning, Manning asked me to think deeply about what they call the MQR: Minimum Qualified Reader. In a nutshell, what’s the minimum level of knowledge or experience someone needs to read your book?</p><p>That may sound like a basic question, but at that point, I hadn’t even considered it. Over the next few weeks, I refined my MQR to target someone who already knows the Go language. That meant about 15% of my content could go directly into the nearest trash can as it was just too basic.</p><p><span>Around the same time, </span><strong>I met the person who probably had the biggest impact on the book: my development editor (DE)</strong><span>.</span></p><p>A DE helps refine the structure, content, and flow of a manuscript to improve things like clarity, coherence, and how well ideas are conveyed. Note that a DE doesn’t need to be a technical person. Mine had some experience in computer science but absolutely none in Go, and that was perfectly fine. We don’t expect technical reviews from a DE but instead, a valuable contribution to the quality of the writing.</p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong><span>: </span><em><span>This was the person who taught me the key lessons I shared in </span><a href="https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/10-technical-writing-rules" rel="">10 Rules I Learned About Technical Writing</a></em><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p>I learned a ton from my DE. Like, really, a ton. Before that, I had been writing on various blogs for about a decade, but writing online is all about being direct because most people don’t have time. With a book, it’s different. People made a deliberate decision to buy your book. Now, it’s your job to bring them somewhere valuable. And if that takes time (meaning more words), so be it.</p><p><span>For example, here’s how I introduced one mistake in </span><em>The Top 10 Most Common Mistakes I’ve Seen in Go Projects</em><span>

It’s about making sure the flow works well, that readers know where you’re going, and that they can follow you all the way. There’s a huge gap between writing a blog post and writing a book.</p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong><em>: In my newsletter, I try not to keep that gap too big. I feel like someone who deliberately shared their email is also making a clear statement: “I’m interested in your content”. I don’t take as much time as I do in the book, but I definitely take more than I did in my older blog posts.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is just one example, but my DE helped me massively. I absolutely loved every single bit of his feedback. To be honest, at the beginning of our collaboration, he had a lot of comments. Some things I picked up quickly, but others were much more difficult for me. Yet, over the next months, I will significantly improve my writing.</p><p>I wanted to talk a little bit about my mindset when I started writing the content of my book, chapter after chapter, mistake after mistake.</p><p><span>At this stage, my mindset was simple: </span><strong>I wanted to make the best Go book. Period.</strong></p><p><span>Let me clarify, though, just to make sure I don’t come across as someone full of ego, as there’s an important nuance here. I wasn’t thinking, “</span><em>My book is going to be the best.</em><span>” Instead, I was thinking, “</span><em>I will give everything I have to bring it to a level where it could be considered the best.</em><span>”</span></p><p>I already knew at that point that it would probably be my first and last book. So, if I was going to write one, I might as well give everything I had to make sure that what’s going to sit on my shelf for the rest of my life is something I will be proud of.</p><p><span>Also, having this mindset was a commitment to future readers: you bought my book, I don’t know if you’ll love it, </span><strong>but I promise it’s the best version I could have made</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>1P stands for </span><em>first part</em><span>. Basically, the process that starts once one-third of the book is written and accepted by the DE (which happened for me after a lot of back and forth to be honest).</span></p><p>For each third of the book (1P, 2P, and then 3P), the process is similar: the manuscript is sent to external reviewers who can leave comments directly on your text but also fill out a detailed document with questions like:</p><ul><li><p>Is the writing interesting? Does it hold your attention?</p></li><li><p>Are the examples good and applicable in the real world? Are there enough of them?</p></li><li><p>What do you think of the overall concept of the book and the approach toward the</p><p>intended audience?</p></li></ul><p>This document is very thorough. These reviews are invaluable for an author. While you can be confident that the writing itself is fairly solid thanks to the work you were doing with your DE, from a technical standpoint, this is really the first time your content is being confronted by other technical people.</p><p><span>We got the results for 1P in April 2021. In total, I received 13 reviews, with </span><strong>an average star rating of 4.10 out of 5</strong><span>. Not a fantastic score, but at that point, it was OK. I wasn’t too disappointed.</span></p><p>Of course, some of the feedback you receive as an author can hurt:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png" width="1216" height="208" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:208,&quot;width&quot;:1216,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:39244,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Excerpt of reviewer feedback highlighting a concern that some statements in the manuscript lack sufficient background or justification to confidently earn a 5-star rating.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Excerpt of reviewer feedback highlighting a concern that some statements in the manuscript lack sufficient background or justification to confidently earn a 5-star rating." title="Excerpt of reviewer feedback highlighting a concern that some statements in the manuscript lack sufficient background or justification to confidently earn a 5-star rating." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>But if it hurts, it probably means there’s some truth behind it. You have to accept it and improve your book.</p><p><span>During that period, Manning offered to connect me with another author, </span><a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/instructors/bill-kennedy/" rel="">Bill Kennedy</a><span>, who also wrote a book with them called </span><em><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action" rel="">Go in Action</a></em><span>. Beyond the fact that I have immense respect for him (he’s one of the people who contributes the most to the Go ecosystem), Bill taught me something crucial:</span></p><p>If you get one comment, you must address it, even if it doesn’t seem important to you. If one person raised it, imagine when thousands of people read your book.</p><p>That was golden advice. Thanks to Bill, I gave my best to address (almost) every single comment, from changing a single word to fully rewriting how a mistake was explained.</p><p>It’s time to talk about my first hiccup with Manning (there will be two).</p><p>I already explained how crucial my development editor (DE) was in the process. However, I was also supposed to be accompanied by another person: a technical development editor (TDE).</p><p>While external reviewers only come in at each third of the book, the TDE is supposed to work more closely with the author throughout the entire process, helping shape the content, the overall structure, how chapters are divided, and so on.</p><p>This isn’t a personal criticism, but my TDE simply wasn’t an MQR. This means he didn’t have the basic Go knowledge expected from someone reading the book. Of course, I wasn’t expecting the world’s top Go expert as a TDE, but I did expect someone who at least matched the Minimum Qualified Reader profile, a concept introduced by Manning themselves. That felt like the bare minimum.</p><p>I raised this issue with Manning after 1P, but unfortunately, they didn’t really listen and kept the same TDE on the project. I was a bit annoyed, to be honest, but I had to move on.</p><p>Until 1P, the book is in a kind of trial phase, meaning that either Manning or the author can still decide to stop the collaboration. Apparently, a certain percentage of books fail at 1P when Manning realizes that external reviewers aren’t convinced by how the initial idea is being executed.</p><p><span>After 1P, Manning launches their </span><em>Manning Early Access Program</em><span> (MEAP), which allows people to buy the book and access it while it’s still being written. For the author, it becomes an additional source of feedback, as readers can leave comments on an online platform.</span></p><p><span>When we say people can start buying your book, </span><strong>it also means a shift for Manning: it’s time to sell it.</strong></p><p>That brings a few new responsibilities, like keeping the content regularly updated for those who already paid, writing a welcome letter for MEAP readers, and starting to work with the marketing team on how to promote the book and raise awareness about it.</p><p>On that last point, Manning asked me several times during this period to promote the book at public events (meetups, conferences, etc.), but I always declined. Writing was already taking up so much time and energy that I didn’t feel like adding one more thing to my plate by preparing talks.</p><p><span>The only “promotion” I did during that time was joining a podcast since it required less preparation. I was invited to </span><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2cKdcxETn7jDp7uJCwqmSE" rel="">Go Time</a></em><span>, which was a weekly podcast about Go and the most popular one in the community (unfortunately, it stopped).</span></p><p><span>The episode I appeared in, titled sarcastically </span><em><a href="https://changelog.com/gotime/190" rel="">How to make mistakes in Go</a></em><span>, was </span><a href="https://x.com/GoTimeFM/status/1475953635569848321" rel="">really well received</a><span>. That was another interesting signal that writing about mistakes was a compelling angle.</span></p><p>During that period, it was time to choose a book cover. Manning has a (very) special way of illustrating their books, all based on drawings from Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur, an 18th-century illustrator.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

So I went from 4.10 to 4.15, and honestly, at that point, I was starting to feel a bit disappointed.</span></p><p><span>I’m a regular user of </span><a href="https://goodreads.com/" rel="">Goodreads</a><span>. On that platform, books are also rated out of 5 stars; in my mind, a “great” book starts at 4.5 and up. Why 4.5? No idea. But that was definitely my goal.</span></p><p><span>4.15 isn’t bad, but it’s still far from 4.5. So yes, I was disappointed but not dejected. Once again, I went through all the reviews, and </span><strong>I just kept improving the book over and over</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>To give you a sense of what I mean by improving the book “</span><em>over and over</em><span>“, keep in mind that between feedback from my DE, external reviewers, and others, there are parts of the book that I rewrote more than ten times. I don’t know if that’s common, to be honest. Maybe it’s because I was terrible at the beginning. Maybe it’s because I’m literally obsessed with details. Or maybe it’s both.</span></p><p><span>From 2P to 3P is almost a blackout for me. This time, the period lasted five months, during which </span><strong>I wrote the last third of the book and completely rewrote the first few chapters</strong><span>. Indeed, once I reached the end of the book, I reread the first part and thought: </span><em>“This is awful; I can’t publish that.”</em></p><p>That’s more proof that going through the long, demanding process of writing a book really did improve my writing skills. Some parts that felt fine in the beginning ended up being terrible once I had more experience.</p><p>From those five months, I only clearly remember one week of "holiday" that I spent working on my book. And by week, I don’t mean a peaceful 40-hour work week. I mean waking up at 3 p.m., working 14 to 15 hours straight, and going to bed around 8 a.m.</p><p><span>Funny enough, I didn’t hate that week. In my mind, it was </span><em>my</em><span> author week. If I had crossed a stranger on the street and they had asked what I did for a living, I would’ve proudly said: “</span><em>I’m an author!</em><span>”</span></p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t speak to anyone that week. Except my janitor.</p><p>But during that week, I made a lot of progress. I managed to write the first draft of the last chapter. I’m sharing this to give you an idea of the pace. The book had 12 chapters, and the one that went the fastest still took me about 100 hours to write. You can imagine how long the rest took. And that’s not even counting the endless rewrites after all the feedback from my DE and the reviewers.</p><p><span>During that period, I also worked on my inside cover. I’m a big fan of </span><em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em><span> by </span></p><p><span>. His book is full of beautiful visual maps like this one:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

If you want a simple anecdote to understand Tim’s importance was for this book: during 3P, I received feedback from 15 reviewers. Yet I think Tim’s single review was possibly as valuable as all the others combined. The guy is an absolute rockstar; my book wouldn’t have been the same without him. Thanks again, Tim. 🙇‍♂️</span></p><p>One more month of work to take all the reviews into account, and…</p><p>We’re at the end of February 2022, and the book officially moves from the development stage to production. At this stage, only a few steps remain, and they are mostly handled by the publisher:</p><ul><li><p>Copyediting to refine grammar, style, and consistency</p></li><li><p>Proofreading to catch spelling, punctuation, and formatting errors</p></li><li><p>Typesetting to arrange the text, code, and images for publication</p></li><li><p>Indexing to compile a list of key terms and topics with page references</p></li></ul><p>One thing to note: from an author’s standpoint, the book is more or less complete at this stage. You can still add minor things, but the publisher wants to lock in a first version. That’s because adding even a single new paragraph means going through the process again for that section. That’s why publishers insist on fixing the version.</p><p>Reaching that point is a big milestone. To express what I felt at the time, there’s a great quote by Gene Fowler:</p><p>A book is never finished; it's abandoned.</p><p><span>Real question: how can you say a book is finished? For example, I could have improved a figure here, tweaked an example there, rephrased a sentence, or refined a conclusion. But that loop could have lasted forever. At some point, you just have to consider this version final, move to the next stage, and, in a way, </span><strong>abandon your book</strong><span>.</span></p><p>It’s a tough feeling, but that’s how it goes.</p><p><span>That being said, finishing a book calls for a celebration. I remember having a drink one evening with my girlfriend, and we toasted to “</span><em>the end of the book.</em><span>” 🥂</span></p><p>Once again, I was way too naive.</p><p>It’s now time to talk about my second hiccup with Manning, but this time, it was way more serious.</p><p>We started the copyediting process, which is meant to refine grammar, style, and consistency. I don’t know about you, but I imagined the author’s involvement at this stage would be pretty lightweight, right? Absolutely not. At least, not for my book.</p><p><strong>First, the review process was an exercise in frustration and inefficiency.</strong></p><p><span>During the development phase, I wrote everything in </span><a href="https://asciidoc.org/" rel="">AsciiDoc</a><span>, generated content, and got feedback either as PDF comments from the DE or through the Manning website from reviewers.</span></p><p>But copyediting was different. The copyeditor was directly editing my content and leaving questions in the source itself.</p><p>To clarify, my content was stored in a Git repository. Instead of going through a classic pull request (PR) workflow, the copyeditor was directly modifying the source files and adding comments on top of that.</p><p>For example, here is my original sentence:</p><pre><code>Throughout this section we also used an example with errors because ...</code></pre><p>And here’s what it looked like after her changes:</p><pre><code>// AQ: please clarify leading to this error. Which error?
In this section, we used an example with errors because ...</code></pre><p>So she was:</p><ul><li><p>Modifying the content directly</p></li><li><p>Adding comments in the source code itself (🤯)</p></li></ul><p>I tried to explain how review workflows work in a PR-based setup, and gave concrete suggestions for how we could improve the process. But they didn’t want to try it. That might sound like a small thing, but at that stage, all I wanted was a smooth and efficient collaboration process. The easier it was for me to track changes, the better.</p><p>But if that were the only problem, it would have been fine. Unfortunately, it was way more than that.</p><p><span>To put it simply, </span><strong>my experience with the copyeditor was catastrophic</strong><span>. She completely wrecked the content and introduced countless typos and mistakes.</span></p><p>For example, many of the issues came from her confusing the programming language Go with the verb to go. That led to many sentences that made absolutely no sense anymore.</p><p>Let me be clear: it’s totally fine if a copyeditor introduces a few mistakes. It’s supposed to be a collaborative process: they adapt the content, we go back and forth, and we improve it together.</p><p>But in this case, the number of mistakes was absurd. In just one chapter, she introduced 23 errors. I don’t mean things that could be improved; I mean factual errors. Now multiply that by 12 chapters.</p><p><span>And it wasn’t just about errors. When I asked questions like, “</span><em>Why did you remove this sentence? I think it’s an important transition, and we should keep it</em><span>”, she would sometimes just delete my comment. Such a great collaboration, right?</span></p><p>Eventually, when I raised more and more concerns, what was her response?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png" width="725.1500244140625" height="194.36206251787036" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:249,&quot;width&quot;:929,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:725.1500244140625,&quot;bytes&quot;:487151,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Screenshot of an email from the copyeditor stating \&quot;Chapters 1–5 are ready for indexing,\&quot; sent without the author's approval after major issues were raised.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Screenshot of an email from the copyeditor stating &quot;Chapters 1–5 are ready for indexing,&quot; sent without the author's approval after major issues were raised." title="Screenshot of an email from the copyeditor stating &quot;Chapters 1–5 are ready for indexing,&quot; sent without the author's approval after major issues were raised." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>She basically said chapters 1 to 5 were ready to move to the next phase without even letting me fix the mistakes she introduced.</p><p>Let me try to put you in my shoes so you understand how I felt.</p><p><span>You’ve spent 15 months writing your book. You’ve done countless iterations to carefully improve every single one of the 100 mistakes. You’ve spent more hours than you can count. You’ve carefully processed hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces of feedback. You even took dedicated holidays just to make progress on it. And then, all of a sudden, someone jumps into your book, completely butchers it, and says, “</span><em>These chapters are ready!</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>How would you feel?</strong></p><p>Well, that’s exactly how I felt. And to be honest, it was too much for me. I wrote an escalation email (which I won’t share here as it was way too salty) explaining that until this was resolved (meaning she had to leave), I would stop working on my own book.</p><p>To be fair to Manning, the situation was handled fairly quickly. Especially by one person: my acquisition editor (the scout). I really think that he saved the book. Because at that point, I swear that I was ready to give up everything.</p><p>In March 2022, the copyeditor stopped working on my book (she was external to Manning), and I was assigned someone new. That change was a huge relief.</p><p>Unfortunately, it meant going through everything again. I had to fix myself every single error she had introduced in the first five chapters, which delayed the book and cost me way more time and energy than I had anticipated.</p><p>Finally, at the end of July 2022, after six months of work after I thought the book was "finished", we reached the end. And this time, for real.</p><p><span>Did I try to celebrate again with my girlfriend? Yes. What did she reply? “</span><em>I can’t trust you anymore with your book.</em><span>”</span></p><p>A few months later, I received a box in the mail. I opened it, and inside were copies of my own book, sent by Manning. As you can imagine, I must have felt a mix of pride and extreme happiness, right? Nope.</p><p><span>I just couldn’t feel anything. I remember holding my own book in my hands and thinking, “</span><em>What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I just be happy?</em><span>”</span></p><p><span>This feeling isn’t that uncommon and is often referred to as </span><strong>post-publication depression</strong><span>.</span></p><p>It’s incredibly hard to put words to what I was feeling. It was around August 2022 and I had started working on the content back in July 2019. That’s almost three years of work.

People who can’t or just don’t want to buy the book can still visit </span><a href="https://100go.co/" rel="">100go.co</a><span> and access a significant part of the content for free. The traffic ended up being quite strong for such a specialized website: 150k views in 2024.</span></p><p><span>I discussed </span><a href="https://100go.co/" rel="">100go.co</a><span> with Manning, and they said it was a “</span><em>brilliant idea</em><span>”. They even offered me a paid role to help other authors promote their content.</span></p><p>In all honesty, I think they overestimate my sales skills. I haven’t done a lot in that area. For example, last year, I gave a talk at a public conference, and I didn’t even mention that I had written a book. Not because I hate promotion. Well, I do, but that wasn’t the main reason. The real reason was that mentioning my book wouldn’t have improved this talk in any way. So I just didn’t say anything.</p><p>What about Manning’s offer to help other authors? I didn’t take it.</p><p>If it were up to me, people would still have the option to buy my book physically, but the whole content would be available online for free, with no login required.</p><p><span>I’ve considered talking to Manning about that. We will see if they still believe I have “</span><em>brilliant</em><span>” ideas. 😅</span></p><p>At the end of 2022, Manning informed me they had secured licensing deals for four translations. For each of them, I received a fixed payment along with royalties. For example, I earned $4,000 and 6% royalties for the Japanese translation.</p><p><span>As of the end of September 2024, </span><strong>the English version had sold 10,494 copies</strong><span>. I don’t have the sales figures for the translations, but someone at Manning told me that usually, the combined sales of all translated versions may match the English copies sold.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong><span>: My book also started a new Manning </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amanning.com+%22100%22+%22mistakes+and+how+to+avoid+them" rel="">series</a><span> called </span><em>100 … Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</em><span>, with editions in Java, C++, and SQL Server, for instance.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>To this day, </span><strong>I’ve earned around $47,000 from the book</strong><span> (before taxes). If I consider the time spent, using a conservative lower bound of 2,000 hours, that comes out to about $23 per hour.</span></p><p>There are two ways to look at that hourly rate.</p><p>One could say it’s pretty low compared to what a software engineer could earn. I could have invested 2,000 hours into some paid technical work and probably made a lot more.</p><p><span>The other way to approach it is not to care too much about it. Sure, the money I earned isn’t negligible (it paid for quite a few holidays, to be honest), but my main message is this: </span><strong>if you’re a new author, don’t think about writing your book to become rich</strong><span>.</span></p><p>I’m sure there are well-known authors like Robert Martin who can make significant income from pretty much any book they release.

<h2><a href="#abstract" role="doc-backlink">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This PEP introduces template strings for custom string processing.</p>
<p>Template strings are a generalization of f-strings, using a <code><span>t</span></code> in place of
the <code><span>f</span></code> prefix. Instead of evaluating to <code><span>str</span></code>, t-strings evaluate to a new
type, <code><span>Template</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>template</span><span>:</span> <span>Template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Templates provide developers with access to the string and its interpolated
values <em>before</em> they are combined. This brings native flexible string
processing to the Python language and enables safety checks, web templating,
domain-specific languages, and more.</p>
</section>
<section id="relationship-with-other-peps">
<h2><a href="#relationship-with-other-peps" role="doc-backlink">Relationship With Other PEPs</a></h2>
<p>Python introduced f-strings in Python 3.6 with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/" title="PEP 498 – Literal String Interpolation">PEP 498</a>. The grammar was
then formalized in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/" title="PEP 701 – Syntactic formalization of f-strings">PEP 701</a> which also lifted some restrictions. This PEP
is based on PEP 701.</p>
<p>At nearly the same time PEP 498 arrived, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0501/" title="PEP 501 – General purpose template literal strings">PEP 501</a> was written to provide
“i-strings” – that is, “interpolation template strings”. The PEP was
deferred pending further experience with f-strings. Work on this PEP was
resumed by a different author in March 2023, introducing “t-strings” as template
literal strings, and built atop PEP 701.</p>
<p>The authors of this PEP consider it to be a generalization and simplification
of the updated work in PEP 501. (That PEP has also recently been updated to
reflect the new ideas in this PEP.)</p>
</section>
<section id="motivation">
<h2><a href="#motivation" role="doc-backlink">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Python f-strings are easy to use and very popular. Over time, however, developers
have encountered limitations that make them
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/utils/#django.utils.html.format_html">unsuitable for certain use cases</a>.
In particular, f-strings provide no way to intercept and transform interpolated
values before they are combined into a final string.</p>
<p>As a result, incautious use of f-strings can lead to security vulnerabilities.
For example, a user executing a SQL query with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>sqlite3</span></code></a>
may be tempted to use an f-string to embed values into their SQL expression,
which could lead to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection attack</a>.
Or, a developer building HTML may include unescaped user input in the string,
leading to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting (XSS)</a>
vulnerability.</p>
<p>More broadly, the inability to transform interpolated values before they are
combined into a final string limits the utility of f-strings in more complex
string processing tasks.</p>
<p>Template strings address these problems by providing
developers with access to the string and its interpolated values.</p>
<p>For example, imagine we want to generate some HTML. Using template strings,
we can define an <code><span>html()</span></code> function that allows us to automatically sanitize
content:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>evil</span> <span>=</span> <span>"&lt;script&gt;alert('evil')&lt;/script&gt;"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"&lt;p&gt;</span><span>{evil}</span><span>&lt;/p&gt;"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('evil')&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Likewise, our hypothetical <code><span>html()</span></code> function can make it easy for developers
to add attributes to HTML elements using a dictionary:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>attributes</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"src"</span><span>:</span> <span>"shrubbery.jpg"</span><span>,</span> <span>"alt"</span><span>:</span> <span>"looks nice"</span><span>}</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"&lt;img </span><span>{attributes}</span><span> /&gt;"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'&lt;img src="shrubbery.jpg" alt="looks nice" /&gt;'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Neither of these examples is possible with f-strings. By providing a
mechanism to intercept and transform interpolated values, template strings
enable a wide range of string processing use cases.</p>

<h2><a href="#specification" role="doc-backlink">Specification</a></h2>
<section id="template-string-literals">
<h3><a href="#template-string-literals" role="doc-backlink">Template String Literals</a></h3>
<p>This PEP introduces a new string prefix, <code><span>t</span></code>, to define template string literals.
These literals resolve to a new type, <code><span>Template</span></code>, found in the standard library
module <code><span>string.templatelib</span></code>.</p>
<p>The following code creates a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>string.templatelib</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Template</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"This is a template string."</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>,</span> <span>Template</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Template string literals support the full syntax of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/" title="PEP 701 – Syntactic formalization of f-strings">PEP 701</a>. This includes
the ability to nest template strings within interpolations, as well as the ability
to use all valid quote marks (<code><span>'</span></code>, <code><span>"</span></code>, <code><span>'''</span></code>, and <code><span>"""</span></code>). Like other string
prefixes, the <code><span>t</span></code> prefix must immediately precede the quote. Like f-strings,
both lowercase <code><span>t</span></code> and uppercase <code><span>T</span></code> prefixes are supported. Like
f-strings, t-strings may not be combined with <code><span>u</span></code> or the <code><span>b</span></code> prefix.</p>
<p>Additionally, f-strings and t-strings cannot be combined, so the <code><span>ft</span></code>
prefix is invalid. t-strings <em>may</em> be combined with the <code><span>r</span></code> prefix;
see the <a href="#raw-template-strings">Raw Template Strings</a> section below for more information.</p>

<h3><a href="#the-interpolation-type" role="doc-backlink">The <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> Type</a></h3>
<p>The <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> type represents an expression inside a template string.

    <span>):</span>
        <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> type is shallow immutable. Its attributes
cannot be reassigned.</p>
<p>The <code><span>value</span></code> attribute is the evaluated result of the interpolation:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>==</span> <span>"World"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>expression</span></code> attribute is the <em>original text</em> of the interpolation:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>expression</span> <span>==</span> <span>"name"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We expect that the <code><span>expression</span></code> attribute will not be used in most template
processing code. It is provided for completeness and for use in debugging and
introspection. See both the <a href="#common-patterns-seen-in-processing-templates">Common Patterns Seen in Processing Templates</a>
section and the <a href="#examples">Examples</a> section for more information on how to process
template strings.</p>
<p>The <code><span>conversion</span></code> attribute is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" title="(in Python v3.13)"><span>optional conversion</span></a>
to be used, one of <code><span>r</span></code>, <code><span>s</span></code>, and <code><span>a</span></code>, corresponding to <code><span>repr()</span></code>,
<code><span>str()</span></code>, and <code><span>ascii()</span></code> conversions. As with f-strings, no other conversions
are supported:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name!r}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>conversion</span> <span>==</span> <span>"r"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If no conversion is provided, <code><span>conversion</span></code> is <code><span>None</span></code>.</p>
<p>The <code><span>format_spec</span></code> attribute is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec" title="(in Python v3.13)"><span>format specification</span></a>.
As with f-strings, this is an arbitrary string that defines how to present the value:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Value: </span><span>{value:.2f}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>".2f"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Format specifications in f-strings can themselves contain interpolations. This
is permitted in template strings as well; <code><span>format_spec</span></code> is set to the eagerly
evaluated result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>precision</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Value: {value:.</span><span>{precision}</span><span>f}"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>".2f"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If no format specification is provided, <code><span>format_spec</span></code> defaults to an empty
string (<code><span>""</span></code>). This matches the <code><span>format_spec</span></code> parameter of Python’s
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>format()</span></code></a> built-in.</p>
<p>Unlike f-strings, it is up to code that processes the template to determine how to
interpret the <code><span>conversion</span></code> and <code><span>format_spec</span></code> attributes.
Such code is not required to use these attributes, but when present they should
be respected, and to the extent possible match the behavior of f-strings.
It would be surprising if, for example, a template string that uses <code><span>{value:.2f}</span></code>
did not round the value to two decimal places when processed.</p>

<section id="template-string-concatenation">
<h3><a href="#template-string-concatenation" role="doc-backlink">Template String Concatenation</a></h3>
<p>Template strings support explicit concatenation using <code><span>+</span></code>. Concatenation is
supported for two <code><span>Template</span></code> instances as well as for a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance
and a <code><span>str</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Concatenation of templates is “viral”: the concatenation of a <code><span>Template</span></code> and
a <code><span>str</span></code> always results in a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance.</p>
<p>Python’s implicit concatenation syntax is also supported. The following code
will work as expected:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>t</span><span>"Hello "</span> <span>t</span><span>"World"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span> <span>==</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello World"</span><span>,)</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>Template</span></code> type supports the <code><span>__add__()</span></code> and <code><span>__radd__()</span></code> methods
between two <code><span>Template</span></code> instances and between a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance and a
<code><span>str</span></code>.</p>

<p><code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> instances compare with object identity

<h3><a href="#no-support-for-ordering" role="doc-backlink">No Support for Ordering</a></h3>
<p>The <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> types do not support ordering. This is
unlike all other string literal types in Python, which support lexicographic
ordering. Because interpolations can contain arbitrary values, there is no
natural ordering for them. As a result, neither the <code><span>Template</span></code> nor the
<code><span>Interpolation</span></code> type implements the standard comparison methods.</p>
</section>
<section id="support-for-the-debug-specifier">
<h3><a href="#support-for-the-debug-specifier" role="doc-backlink">Support for the debug specifier (<code><span>=</span></code>)</a></h3>
<p>The debug specifier, <code><span>=</span></code>, is supported in template strings and behaves similarly
to how it behaves in f-strings, though due to limitations of the implementation
there is a slight difference.</p>
<p>In particular, <code><span>t'{value=}'</span></code> is treated as <code><span>t'value={value!r}'</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello {name=}"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Hello name="</span>

</pre></div>
<p>If a separate format string is also provided, <code><span>t'{value=:fmt}</span></code> is treated
instead as <code><span>t'value={value!s:fmt}'</span></code>.</p>
<p>Whitespace is preserved in the debug specifier, so <code><span>t'{value</span> <span>=</span> <span>}'</span></code> is
treated as <code><span>t'value</span> <span>=</span> <span>{value!r}'</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="raw-template-strings">
<h3><a href="#raw-template-strings" role="doc-backlink">Raw Template Strings</a></h3>
<p>Raw template strings are supported using the <code><span>rt</span></code> (or <code><span>tr</span></code>) prefix:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>trade</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shrubberies'</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>rt</span><span>'Did you say "</span><span>{trade}</span><span>"?</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>

</pre></div>
<p>In this example, the <code><span>\n</span></code> is treated as two separate characters
(a backslash followed by ‘n’) rather than a newline character. This is
consistent with Python’s raw string behavior.</p>
<p>As with regular template strings, interpolations in raw template strings are
processed normally, allowing for the combination of raw string behavior and
dynamic content.</p>

<section id="interpolation-expression-evaluation">

<p>Expression evaluation for interpolations is the same as in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/#expression-evaluation" title="PEP 498 – Literal String Interpolation § Expression evaluation">PEP 498</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expressions that are extracted from the string are evaluated in the context
where the template string appeared. This means the expression has full access to its
lexical scope, including local and global variables. Any valid Python expression

<h3><a href="#example-implementing-f-strings-with-t-strings" role="doc-backlink">Example: Implementing f-strings with t-strings</a></h3>
<p>It is easy to “implement” f-strings using t-strings. That is, we can
write a function <code><span>f(template:</span> <span>Template)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span></code> that processes a <code><span>Template</span></code>
in much the same way as an f-string literal, returning the same result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>

<h3><a href="#example-structured-logging" role="doc-backlink">Example: Structured Logging</a></h3>
<p>Structured logging allows developers to log data in machine-readable
formats like JSON. With t-strings, developers can easily log structured data
alongside human-readable messages using just a single log statement.</p>
<p>We present two different approaches to implementing structured logging with
template strings.</p>
<section id="approach-1-custom-log-messages">
<h4><a href="#approach-1-custom-log-messages" role="doc-backlink">Approach 1: Custom Log Messages</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-cookbook" title="(in Python v3.13)"><span>Python Logging Cookbook</span></a>
has a short section on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#implementing-structured-logging">how to implement structured logging</a>.</p>
<p>The logging cookbook suggests creating a new “message” class, <code><span>StructuredMessage</span></code>,
that is constructed with a simple text message and a separate dictionary of values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>StructuredMessage</span><span>(</span><span>"user action"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"action"</span><span>:</span> <span>"traded"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"amount"</span><span>:</span> <span>42</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"item"</span><span>:</span> <span>"shrubs"</span>
<span>})</span>
<span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>

<span># Outputs:</span>
<span># user action &gt;&gt;&gt; {"action": "traded", "amount": 42, "item": "shrubs"}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>StructuredMessage.__str__()</span></code> method formats both the human-readable
message <em>and</em> the values, combining them into a final string. (See the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#implementing-structured-logging">logging cookbook</a>
for its full example.)</p>
<p>We can implement an improved version of <code><span>StructuredMessage</span></code> using template strings:</p>

<p>Template strings give us a more elegant way to define the custom message
class. With template strings it is no longer necessary for developers to make
sure that their format string and values dictionary are kept in sync; a single
template string literal is all that is needed. The <code><span>TemplateMessage</span></code>
implementation can automatically extract structured keys and values from
the <code><span>Interpolation.expression</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation.value</span></code> attributes,
respectively.</p>

<section id="approach-2-custom-formatters">
<h4><a href="#approach-2-custom-formatters" role="doc-backlink">Approach 2: Custom Formatters</a></h4>
<p>Custom messages are a reasonable approach to structured logging but can be a
little awkward. To use them, developers must wrap every log message they write
in a custom class. This can be easy to forget.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to define custom <code><span>logging.Formatter</span></code> classes. This
approach is more flexible and allows for more control over the final output. In
particular, it’s possible to take a single template string and output it in
multiple formats (human-readable and JSON) to separate log streams.</p>
<p>We define two simple formatters, a <code><span>MessageFormatter</span></code> for human-readable output
and a <code><span>ValuesFormatter</span></code> for JSON output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

</pre></div>
<p>We can then use these formatters when configuring our logger:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>logging</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>sys</span>

<span># Outputs to sys.stdout:</span>
<span># User traded: 42.00 shrubs</span>

<span># At the same time, outputs to sys.stderr:</span>
<span># {"action": "traded", "amount": 42, "item": "shrubs"}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This approach has a couple advantages over the custom message approach to structured
logging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers can log a t-string directly without wrapping it in a custom class.</li>
<li>Human-readable and structured output can be sent to separate log streams. This
is useful for log aggregation systems that process structured data independently
from human-readable data.</li>

</section>
<section id="how-to-teach-this">
<h2><a href="#how-to-teach-this" role="doc-backlink">How To Teach This</a></h2>
<p>Template strings have several audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers using template strings and processing functions</li>
<li>Authors of template processing code</li>
<li>Framework authors who build interesting machinery with template strings</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that teaching developers will be straightforward. At a glance,
template strings look just like f-strings. Their syntax is familiar and the
scoping rules remain the same.</p>
<p>The first thing developers must learn is that template string literals don’t
evaluate to strings; instead, they evaluate to a new type, <code><span>Template</span></code>. This
is a simple type intended to be used by template processing code. It’s not until
developers call a processing function that they get the result they want:
typically, a string, although processing code can of course return any arbitrary
type.</p>
<p>Developers will also want to understand how template strings relate to other
string formatting methods like f-strings and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>str.format()</span></code></a>. They will need
to decide when to use each method. If a simple string is all that is needed, and
there are no security implications, f-strings are likely the best choice. For
most cases where a format string is used, it can be replaced with a function
wrapping the creation of a template string. In cases where the format string is
obtained from user input, the filesystem, or databases, it is possible to write
code to convert it into a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance if desired.</p>
<p>Because developers will learn that t-strings are nearly always used in tandem
with processing functions, they don’t necessarily need to understand the details
of the <code><span>Template</span></code> type. As with descriptors and decorators, we expect many more
developers will use t-strings than write t-string processing functions.</p>
<p>Over time, a small number of more advanced developers <em>will</em> wish to author their
own template processing code. Writing processing code often requires thinking
in terms of formal grammars. Developers will need to learn how to work with the
<code><span>strings</span></code> and <code><span>interpolation</span></code> attributes of a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance and how
to process interpolations in a context-sensitive fashion. More sophisticated
grammars will likely require parsing to intermediate representations like an
abstract syntax tree (AST). Great template processing code will handle format
specifiers and conversions when appropriate. Writing production-grade template
processing code – for instance, to support HTML templates – can be a large
undertaking.</p>
<p>We expect that template strings will provide framework authors with a powerful
new tool in their toolbox. While the functionality of template strings overlaps
with existing tools like template engines, t-strings move that logic into
the language itself. Bringing the full power and generality of Python to bear on
string processing tasks opens new possibilities for framework authors.</p>

<section id="why-another-templating-approach">
<h2><a href="#why-another-templating-approach" role="doc-backlink">Why another templating approach?</a></h2>
<p>The world of Python already has mature templating languages with wide adoption,
such as Jinja. Why build support for creating new templating systems?</p>
<p>Projects such as Jinja are still needed in cases where the template is less part
of the software by the developers, and more part of customization by designers
or even content created by users, for example in a CMS.</p>
<p>The trends in frontend development have treated templating as part of the
software and written by developers. They want modern language features and a
good tooling experience. PEP 750 envisions DSLs where the non-static parts are
Python: same scope rules, typing, expression syntax, and the like.</p>

<section id="memoizing">
<h3><a href="#memoizing" role="doc-backlink">Memoizing</a></h3>
<p>Template functions can efficiently process both static and dynamic parts of templates.
The structure of <code><span>Template</span></code> objects allows for effective memoization:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>strings</span> <span>=</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span>  <span># Static string parts</span>

<p>This separation enables caching of processed static parts while dynamic parts
can be inserted as needed. Authors of template processing code can use the static
<code><span>strings</span></code> as cache keys, leading to significant performance improvements when
similar templates are used repeatedly.</p>
</section>
<section id="parsing-to-intermediate-representations">
<h3><a href="#parsing-to-intermediate-representations" role="doc-backlink">Parsing to Intermediate Representations</a></h3>
<p>Code that processes templates can parse the template string into intermediate
representations, like an AST. We expect that many template processing libraries
will use this approach.</p>
<p>For instance, rather than returning a <code><span>str</span></code>, our theoretical <code><span>html()</span></code> function
(see the <a href="#motivation">Motivation</a> section) could return an HTML <code><span>Element</span></code> defined in the
same package:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>@dataclass</span><span>(</span><span>frozen</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Element</span><span>:</span>

    <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Calling <code><span>str(element)</span></code> would then render the HTML but, in the meantime, the
<code><span>Element</span></code> could be manipulated in a variety of ways.</p>
</section>
<section id="context-sensitive-processing-of-interpolations">
<h3><a href="#context-sensitive-processing-of-interpolations" role="doc-backlink">Context-sensitive Processing of Interpolations</a></h3>
<p>Continuing with our hypothetical <code><span>html()</span></code> function, it could be made
context-sensitive. Interpolations could be processed differently depending
on where they appear in the template.</p>
<p>For example, our <code><span>html()</span></code> function could support multiple kinds of
interpolations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>attributes</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>"main"</span><span>}</span>
<span>attribute_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>"shrubbery"</span>
<span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hello"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"&lt;div </span><span>{attributes}</span><span> data-value=</span><span>{attribute_value}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{content}</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;"</span>
<span>element</span> <span>=</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'&lt;div id="main" data-value="shrubbery"&gt;hello&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because the <code><span>{attributes}</span></code> interpolation occurs in the context of an HTML tag,
and because there is no corresponding attribute name, it is treated as a dictionary
of attributes. The <code><span>{attribute_value}</span></code> interpolation is treated as a simple
string value and is quoted before inclusion in the final string. The
<code><span>{content}</span></code> interpolation is treated as potentially unsafe content and is
escaped before inclusion in the final string.</p>
</section>
<section id="nested-template-strings">
<h3><a href="#nested-template-strings" role="doc-backlink">Nested Template Strings</a></h3>
<p>Going a step further with our <code><span>html()</span></code> function, we could support nested
template strings. This would allow for more complex HTML structures to be
built up from simpler templates:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>"&lt;p&gt;Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>&lt;/p&gt;"</span><span>)</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"&lt;div&gt;</span><span>{content}</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;"</span>
<span>element</span> <span>=</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because the <code><span>{content}</span></code> interpolation is an <code><span>Element</span></code> instance, it does
not need to be escaped before inclusion in the final string.</p>
<p>One could imagine a nice simplification: if the <code><span>html()</span></code> function is passed
a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance, it could automatically convert it to an <code><span>Element</span></code>
by recursively calling itself on the nested template.</p>
<p>We expect that nesting and composition of templates will be a common pattern
in template processing code and, where appropriate, used in preference to
simple string concatenation.</p>
</section>
<section id="approaches-to-lazy-evaluation">
<h3><a href="#approaches-to-lazy-evaluation" role="doc-backlink">Approaches to Lazy Evaluation</a></h3>
<p>Like f-strings, interpolations in t-string literals are eagerly evaluated. However,
there are cases where lazy evaluation may be desirable.</p>
<p>If a single interpolation is expensive to evaluate, it can be explicitly wrapped
in a <code><span>lambda</span></code> in the template string literal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello {(lambda: name)}"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>callable</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"World"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes, of course, that template processing code anticipates and handles
callable interpolation values. (One could imagine also supporting iterators,
awaitables, etc.) This is not a requirement of the PEP, but it is a common
pattern in template processing code.</p>
<p>In general, we hope that the community will develop best practices for lazy
evaluation of interpolations in template strings and that, when it makes sense,
common libraries will provide support for callable or awaitable values in
their template processing code.</p>
</section>
<section id="approaches-to-asynchronous-evaluation">
<h3><a href="#approaches-to-asynchronous-evaluation" role="doc-backlink">Approaches to Asynchronous Evaluation</a></h3>
<p>Closely related to lazy evaluation is asynchronous evaluation.</p>
<p>As with f-strings, the <code><span>await</span></code> keyword is allowed in interpolations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>example</span><span>():</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_name</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Sleepy"</span>

    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello {await get_name()}"</span>
    <span># Use the f() function from the f-string example, above</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Hello Sleepy"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>More sophisticated template processing code can take advantage of this to
perform asynchronous operations in interpolations. For example, a “smart”
processing function could anticipate that an interpolation is an awaitable
and await it before processing the template string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>example</span><span>():</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_name</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Sleepy"</span>

    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{get_name}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>await</span> <span>async_f</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Hello Sleepy"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes that the template processing code in <code><span>async_f()</span></code> is asynchronous
and is able to <code><span>await</span></code> an interpolation’s value.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>reusable</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>question</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Template</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>, </span><span>{question}</span><span>?"</span>

<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>reusable</span><span>(</span><span>"friend"</span><span>,</span> <span>"how are you"</span><span>)</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>reusable</span><span>(</span><span>"King Arthur"</span><span>,</span> <span>"what is your quest"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is, of course, no different from how f-strings can be reused.</p>

<section id="relation-to-format-strings">
<h3><a href="#relation-to-format-strings" role="doc-backlink">Relation to Format Strings</a></h3>
<p>The venerable <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>str.format()</span></code></a> method accepts format strings that can later
be used to format values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>alas_fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>"We're all out of </span><span>{cheese}</span><span>."</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>alas_fmt</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>cheese</span><span>=</span><span>"Red Leicester"</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"We're all out of Red Leicester."</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If one squints, one can think of format strings as a kind of function definition.
The <em>call</em> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>str.format()</span></code></a> can be seen as a kind of function call. The
t-string equivalent is to simply define a standard Python function that returns
a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>make_template</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>cheese</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Template</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>t</span><span>"We're all out of </span><span>{cheese}</span><span>."</span>

<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>make_template</span><span>(</span><span>cheese</span><span>=</span><span>"Red Leicester"</span><span>)</span>
<span># Using the f() function from the f-string example, above</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"We're all out of Red Leicester."</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>make_template()</span></code> function itself can be thought of as analogous to the
format string. The call to <code><span>make_template()</span></code> is analogous to the call to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>str.format()</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it is common to load format strings from external sources like a
filesystem or database. Thankfully, because <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code>
are simple Python types, it is possible to write a function that takes an
old-style format string and returns an equivalent <code><span>Template</span></code> instance:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>from_format</span><span>(</span><span>fmt</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>/</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>object</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>:</span> <span>object</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Template</span><span>:</span>
<span>     </span><span>"""Parse `fmt` and return a `Template` instance."""</span>
     <span>...</span>

 <span># Load this from a file, database, etc.</span>
 <span>fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>"We're all out of </span><span>{cheese}</span><span>."</span>
 <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_format</span><span>(</span><span>fmt</span><span>,</span> <span>cheese</span><span>=</span><span>"Red Leicester"</span><span>)</span>
 <span># Using the f() function from the f-string example, above</span>
 <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"We're all out of Red Leicester."</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is a powerful pattern that allows developers to use template strings in
places where they might have previously used format strings. A full implementation
of <code><span>from_format()</span></code> is available in the examples repository,
which supports the full grammar of format strings.</p>

<section id="rejected-ideas">
<h2><a href="#rejected-ideas" role="doc-backlink">Rejected Ideas</a></h2>
<p>This PEP has been through several significant revisions. In addition, quite a few interesting
ideas were considered both in revisions of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0501/" title="PEP 501 – General purpose template literal strings">PEP 501</a> and in the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-750-tag-strings-for-writing-domain-specific-languages/60408/196">Discourse discussion</a>.</p>
<p>We attempt to document the most significant ideas that were considered and rejected.</p>
<section id="arbitrary-string-literal-prefixes">
<h3><a href="#arbitrary-string-literal-prefixes" role="doc-backlink">Arbitrary String Literal Prefixes</a></h3>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates">JavaScript tagged template literals</a>,
an earlier version of this PEP allowed for arbitrary “tag” prefixes in front
of literal strings:</p>

<p>The prefix was a special callable called a “tag function”. Tag functions
received the parts of the template string in an argument list. They could then
process the string and return an arbitrary value:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>my_tag</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>Interpolation</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Any</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This approach was rejected for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was deemed too complex to build in full generality. JavaScript allows for
arbitrary expressions to precede a template string, which is a significant
challenge to implement in Python.</li>
<li>It precluded future introduction of new string prefixes.</li>
<li>It seemed to needlessly pollute the namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of a single <code><span>t</span></code> prefix was chosen as a simpler, more Pythonic approach and
more in keeping with template strings’ role as a generalization of f-strings.</p>
</section>
<section id="delayed-evaluation-of-interpolations">
<h3><a href="#delayed-evaluation-of-interpolations" role="doc-backlink">Delayed Evaluation of Interpolations</a></h3>
<p>An early version of this PEP proposed that interpolations should be lazily
evaluated. All interpolations were “wrapped” in implicit lambdas. Instead of
having an eagerly evaluated <code><span>value</span></code> attribute, interpolations had a
<code><span>getvalue()</span></code> method that would resolve the value of the interpolation:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Interpolation</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>_value</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[],</span> <span>object</span><span>]</span>

    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>getvalue</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>object</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_value</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This was rejected for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overwhelming majority of use cases for template strings naturally call
for immediate evaluation.</li>
<li>Delayed evaluation would be a significant departure from the behavior of
f-strings.</li>
<li>Implicit lambda wrapping leads to difficulties with type hints and
static analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, there are viable (if imperfect) alternatives to implicit
lambda wrapping in many cases where lazy evaluation is desired. See the section
on <a href="#approaches-to-lazy-evaluation">Approaches to Lazy Evaluation</a>, above, for more information.</p>
<p>While delayed evaluation was rejected for <em>this</em> PEP, we hope that the community
continues to explore the idea.</p>

<h3><a href="#making-template-and-interpolation-into-protocols" role="doc-backlink">Making <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> Into Protocols</a></h3>
<p>An early version of this PEP proposed that the <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code>
types be runtime checkable protocols rather than classes.</p>
<p>In the end, we felt that using classes was more straightforward.</p>

<h3><a href="#overridden-eq-and-hash-for-template-and-interpolation" role="doc-backlink">Overridden <code><span>__eq__</span></code> and <code><span>__hash__</span></code> for <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code></a></h3>
<p>Earlier versions of this PEP proposed that the <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code>
types should have their own implementations of <code><span>__eq__</span></code> and <code><span>__hash__</span></code>.</p>
<p><code><span>Templates</span></code> were considered equal if their <code><span>strings</span></code> and <code><span>interpolations</span></code>
were equal; <code><span>Interpolations</span></code> were considered equal if their <code><span>value</span></code>,
<code><span>expression</span></code>, <code><span>conversion</span></code>, and <code><span>format_spec</span></code> were equal. Interpolation
hashing was similar to tuple hashing: an <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> was hashable if and
only if its <code><span>value</span></code> was hashable.</p>
<p>This was rejected because <code><span>Template.__hash__</span></code> so defined was not useful as a
cache key in template processing code; we were concerned that it would be
confusing to developers.</p>
<p>By dropping these implementations of <code><span>__eq__</span></code> and <code><span>__hash__</span></code>, we lose the
ability to write asserts such as:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello "</span> <span>+</span> <span>t</span><span>"</span><span>{name}</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because <code><span>Template</span></code> instances are intended to be quickly processed by further
code, we felt that the utility of these asserts was limited.</p>

<section id="an-additional-decoded-type">
<h3><a href="#an-additional-decoded-type" role="doc-backlink">An Additional <code><span>Decoded</span></code> Type</a></h3>
<p>An early version of this PEP proposed an additional type, <code><span>Decoded</span></code>, to represent
the “static string” parts of a template string. This type derived from <code><span>str</span></code> and
had a single extra <code><span>raw</span></code> attribute that provided the original text of the string.
We rejected this in favor of the simpler approach of using plain <code><span>str</span></code> and
allowing combination of <code><span>r</span></code> and <code><span>t</span></code> prefixes.</p>

<section id="enable-full-reconstruction-of-original-template-literal">
<h3><a href="#enable-full-reconstruction-of-original-template-literal" role="doc-backlink">Enable Full Reconstruction of Original Template Literal</a></h3>
<p>Earlier versions of this PEP attempted to make it possible to fully reconstruct
the text of the original template string from a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance. This was
rejected as being overly complex. The mapping between template literal source
and the underlying AST is not one-to-one and there are several limitations with
respect to round-tripping to the original source text.</p>
<p>First, <code><span>Interpolation.format_spec</span></code> defaults to <code><span>""</span></code> if not provided:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>template1</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"</span><span>{value}</span><span>"</span>
<span>template2</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"</span><span>{value:}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>""</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>""</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Next, the debug specifier, <code><span>=</span></code>, is treated as a special case and is processed
before the AST is created. It is therefore not possible to distinguish
<code><span>t"{value=}"</span></code> from <code><span>t"value={value!r}"</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>template1</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"{value=}"</span>
<span>template2</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"value=</span><span>{value!r}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>"value="</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>expression</span> <span>==</span> <span>"value"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>conversion</span> <span>==</span> <span>"r"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>"value="</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>expression</span> <span>==</span> <span>"value"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>conversion</span> <span>==</span> <span>"r"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, format specifiers in f-strings allow arbitrary nesting. In this PEP
and in the reference implementation, the specifier is eagerly evaluated to
set the <code><span>format_spec</span></code> in the <code><span>Interpolation</span></code>, thereby losing the original
expressions. For example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>precision</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>template1</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"</span><span>{value:.2f}</span><span>"</span>
<span>template2</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"{value:.</span><span>{precision}</span><span>f}"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>".2f"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>".2f"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We do not anticipate that these limitations will be a significant issue in practice.
Developers who need to obtain the original template string literal can always
use <code><span>inspect.getsource()</span></code> or similar tools.</p>
</section>
<section id="disallowing-string-concatenation">
<h3><a href="#disallowing-string-concatenation" role="doc-backlink">Disallowing String Concatenation</a></h3>
<p>Earlier versions of this PEP proposed that template strings should not support
concatenation. This was rejected in favor of allowing concatenation.</p>
<p>There are reasonable arguments in favor of rejecting one or all forms of
concatenation: namely, that it cuts off a class of potential bugs, particularly
when one takes the view that template strings will often contain complex grammars
for which concatenation doesn’t always have the same meaning (or any meaning).</p>
<p>Moreover, the earliest versions of this PEP proposed a syntax closer to
JavaScript’s tagged template literals, where an arbitrary callable could be used
as a prefix to a string literal. There was no guarantee that the callable would
return a type that supported concatenation.</p>
<p>In the end, we decided that the surprise to developers of a new string type
<em>not</em> supporting concatenation was likely to be greater than the theoretical
harm caused by supporting it. (Developers concatenate f-strings all the time,
after all, and while we are sure there are cases where this introduces bugs,
it’s not clear that those bugs outweigh the benefits of supporting concatenation.)</p>
<p>While concatenation is supported, we expect that code that uses template strings
will more commonly build up larger templates through nesting and composition
rather than concatenation.</p>
</section>
<section id="arbitrary-conversion-values">
<h3><a href="#arbitrary-conversion-values" role="doc-backlink">Arbitrary Conversion Values</a></h3>
<p>Python allows only <code><span>r</span></code>, <code><span>s</span></code>, or <code><span>a</span></code> as possible conversion type values.
Trying to assign a different value results in <code><span>SyntaxError</span></code>.</p>
<p>In theory, template functions could choose to handle other conversion types. But this
PEP adheres closely to <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/" title="PEP 701 – Syntactic formalization of f-strings">PEP 701</a>. Any changes to allowed values should be in a
separate PEP.</p>
</section>
<section id="removing-conversion-from-interpolation">
<h3><a href="#removing-conversion-from-interpolation" role="doc-backlink">Removing <code><span>conversion</span></code> From <code><span>Interpolation</span></code></a></h3>
<p>While drafting this PEP, we considered removing the <code><span>conversion</span></code>
attribute from <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> and specifying that the conversion should be
performed eagerly, before <code><span>Interpolation.value</span></code> is set.</p>
<p>This was done to simplify the work of writing template processing code. The
<code><span>conversion</span></code> attribute is of limited extensibility (it is typed as
<code><span>Literal["r",</span> <span>"s",</span> <span>"a"]</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span></code>). It is not clear that it adds significant
value or flexibility to template strings that couldn’t better be achieved with
custom format specifiers. Unlike with format specifiers, there is no
equivalent to Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>format()</span></code></a> built-in. (Instead, we include a
sample implementation of <code><span>convert()</span></code> in the <a href="#examples">Examples</a> section.)</p>
<p>Ultimately we decided to keep the <code><span>conversion</span></code> attribute in the
<code><span>Interpolation</span></code> type to maintain compatibility with f-strings and to allow
for future extensibility.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternate-interpolation-symbols">
<h3><a href="#alternate-interpolation-symbols" role="doc-backlink">Alternate Interpolation Symbols</a></h3>
<p>In the early stages of this PEP, we considered allowing alternate symbols for
interpolations in template strings. For example, we considered allowing
<code><span>${name}</span></code> as an alternative to <code><span>{name}</span></code> with the idea that it might be useful
for i18n or other purposes. See the
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-750-tag-strings-for-writing-domain-specific-languages/60408/122">Discourse thread</a>

<p>This was rejected in favor of keeping t-string syntax as close to f-string syntax
as possible.</p>

<section id="alternate-layouts-for-template">
<h3><a href="#alternate-layouts-for-template" role="doc-backlink">Alternate Layouts for <code><span>Template</span></code></a></h3>
<p>During the development of this PEP, we considered several alternate layouts for
the <code><span>Template</span></code> type. Many focused on a single <code><span>args</span></code> tuple that contained
both strings and interpolations. Variants included:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><span>args</span></code> was a <code><span>tuple[str</span> <span>|</span> <span>Interpolation,</span> <span>...]`</span></code> with the promise that
its first and last items were strings and that strings and interpolations
always alternated. This implied that <code><span>args</span></code> was always non-empty and that
empty strings would be inserted between neighboring interpolations. This was
rejected because alternation could not be captured by the type system and was
not a guarantee we wished to make.</li>
<li><code><span>args</span></code> remained a <code><span>tuple[str</span> <span>|</span> <span>Interpolation,</span> <span>...]</span></code> but did not support
interleaving. As a result, empty strings were not added to the sequence. It
was no longer possible to obtain static strings with <code><span>args[::2]</span></code>; instead,
instance checks or structural pattern matching had to be used to distinguish
between strings and interpolations. This approach was rejected as offering
less future opportunity for performance optimization.</li>
<li><code><span>args</span></code> was typed as a <code><span>Sequence[tuple[str,</span> <span>Interpolation</span> <span>|</span> <span>None]]</span></code>. Each
static string was paired with is neighboring interpolation. The final
string part had no corresponding interpolation. This was rejected as being
overly complex.</li>

<h3><a href="#mechanism-to-describe-the-kind-of-template" role="doc-backlink">Mechanism to Describe the “Kind” of Template</a></h3>
<p>If t-strings prove popular, it may be useful to have a way to describe the
“kind” of content found in a template string: “sql”, “html”, “css”, etc.
This could enable powerful new features in tools such as linters, formatters,
type checkers, and IDEs. (Imagine, for example, <code><span>black</span></code> formatting HTML in
t-strings, or <code><span>mypy</span></code> checking whether a given attribute is valid for an HTML
tag.) While exciting, this PEP does not propose any specific mechanism. It is
our hope that, over time, the community will develop conventions for this purpose.</p>

<p>The combination of t-strings and bytes (<code><span>tb</span></code>) is considered out of scope for
