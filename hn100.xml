                <h2><span><strong>In 2022, the team had the opportunity to test the Third Thumb at the annual Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, where members of the public of all ages were able to use the device during different tasks. </strong></span></h2>
                <p>The results are published today <span>in <em>Science Robotics</em>.</span></p>
                <p>Over the course of five days, the team tested 596 participants, ranging in age from three to 96 years old and from a wide range of demographic backgrounds. Of these, only four were unable to use the Third Thumb, either because it did not fit their hand securely, or because they were unable to control it with their feet (the pressure sensors developed specifically for the exhibition were not suitable for very lightweight children).</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Participants were given up to a minute to familiarise themselves with the device, during which time the team explained how to perform one of two tasks.</p>
                <p>The first task involved picking up pegs from a pegboard one at a time with just the Third Thumb and placing them in a basket. Participants were asked to move as many pegs as possible in 60 seconds. 333 participants completed this task.</p>
                <p>The second task involved using the Third Thumb together with the wearer’s biological hand to manipulate and move five or six different foam objects. The objects were of various shapes that required different manipulations to be used, increasing the dexterity of the task. Again, participants were asked to move as many objects as they could into the basket within a maximum of 60 seconds. 246 participants completed this task.</p>
                <p>Almost everyone was able to use the device straightaway. 98% of participants were able to successfully manipulate objects using the Third Thumb during the first minute of use, with only 13 participants unable to perform the task.</p>
                <p>Ability levels between participants were varied, but there were no differences in performance between genders, nor did handedness change performance – despite the Thumb always being worn on the right hand. There was no definitive evidence that people who might be considered ‘good with their hands’ – for example, they were learning to play a musical instrument, or their jobs involved manual dexterity – were any better at the tasks.</p>
                <p>Older and younger adults had a similar level of ability when using the new technology, though further investigation just within the older adults age bracket revealed a decline in performance with increasing age. The researchers say this effect could be due to the general degradation in sensorimotor and cognitive abilities that are associated with ageing and may also reflect a generational relationship to technology.</p>
                <p>Performance was generally poorer among younger children. Six out of the 13 participants that could not complete the task were below the age of 10 years old, and of those that did complete the task, the youngest children tended to perform worse compared to older children. But even older children (aged 12-16 years) struggled more than young adults.</p>

                <p><strong>Dani Clode </strong>said: "<span>Augmentation is about designing a new relationship with technology—creating something that extends beyond being merely a tool to becoming an extension of the body itself.</span></p>
                <p><span>"Given the diversity of bodies, it's crucial that the design stage of wearable technology is as inclusive as possible. It's equally important that these devices are accessible and functional for a wide range of users. Additionally, they should be easy for people to learn and use quickly."</span></p>
                <p>Co-author <strong>Lucy Dowdall</strong>, also from the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit, added: "If motor augmentation – and even broader human-machine interactions – are to be successful, they’ll need to integrate seamlessly with the user’s motor and cognitive abilities.</p>
                <p>"We’ll need to factor in different ages, genders, weight, lifestyles, disabilities – as well as people’s cultural, financial backgrounds, and even likes or dislikes of technology. Physical testing of large and diverse groups of individuals is essential to achieve this goal."</p>

However, I contend that the <i>relentless pace of our lives</i> has accelerated this moment of reflection, prompting us to nostalgically revisit past moments and rediscover the allure of <strong>childhood possessions</strong> — whether acquired, lost, or long-dreamt of.</p><p>In my case, I can affirm that I was enticed by the notion of an improbable mission: the restoration and repair of an <strong>iconic computer from the past</strong>, armed with no specific technical expertise other than a robust and innate passion for computers. The chosen endeavor revolved around a genuine instant classic in the realms of computer science and industrial design: the original <mark>Macintosh</mark>.</p><h4>The Macintosh</h4><p>Originally overseen by <strong>Jeff Raskin</strong>, the “Macintosh” project was envisioned as Apple’s inaugural computer, specifically targeted at <strong>families</strong> and marketed with a price tag <strong>below $1,000</strong> <sup>01</sup>.</p><p>However, the trajectory took an unexpected turn in 1980 when Apple, citing <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>’ <strong>intense perfectionism</strong> and limited team-building skills, decided to reassign him from the helm of the flagship “Lisa” project.</p><blockquote>Apple’s strategy was to shift Jobs to a project of lesser prominence like the Macintosh, one deemed less pivotal to the company’s future, where his disposition could be more constrained.</blockquote><p>Jobs found himself transitioning from the design of a <strong>groundbreaking computer</strong> like the Lisa, Apple’s first professional workstation featuring an operating system with an iconographic interface and mouse-operable windows — to the Macintosh, a more <strong>traditional, budget-friendly computer</strong> with a text-based operating system, targeting families.</p><h4>Jobs’s leadership</h4><p>Under Jobs’s leadership, his initial response was to distance Raskin and <strong>decisively reshape the project</strong>. While the Macintosh was intended to be an economically accessible computer, Jobs believed it couldn’t be solely from a financial perspective.</p><p>Recognizing the need to cater to individuals unfamiliar with computers, the Macintosh couldn’t compromise on the user-friendly experience offered by a <strong>graphical interface and a mouse</strong>. Jobs envisioned the computer being prominently displayed in homes, akin to any other household appliance, and insisted on a design that was nothing short of “<mark>insanely great</mark>”.</p><p>This new trajectory, coupled with an exceptional marketing campaign, propelled the project into <strong>unprecedented levels of hype</strong> <sup>01</sup>. However, it also led to a substantial increase in the costs associated with design, production, and promotion.</p><div><ul><li><figure><span> <video width="1080" height="1080" preload="none" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="https://84-24.org/01_01.bfcf8e8b.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> </span><figcaption><strong>Apple “1984” Super Bowl Commercial directed by Ridley Scott</strong> © All original content Copyright &amp; TM Retro Recipes™ LLC 1988-present. <i>Via YouTube <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErwS24cBZPc">Retro Recipes</a></i></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><span> <video width="1080" height="1080" preload="none" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="https://84-24.org/01_02.60317902.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> </span><figcaption><strong>Steve Jobs introduces the Macintosh</strong> © All original content copyright and Computer History Museum. <i>Via YouTube <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tQ5XwvjPmA">Computer History Museum</a></i></figcaption></figure></li><li></li></ul></div><p>The Macintosh made its debut on <strong>January 24, 1984</strong> <sup>02</sup>, hitting American shelves with a price tag of <strong>$2,495</strong>.</p><p>Despite its competitive pricing, especially when considering the initial positioning of the Lisa at $9,995 and the incorporation of numerous new technologies and features inherited from it, the Macintosh still entailed <strong>hardware compromises</strong>. Its placement in that price range proved challenging for the average American family.</p><p>While the goal of bringing the concept of a graphical interface and mouse to a broad user base was partially achieved, thanks to widespread promotion and adoption of the Macintosh in <strong>educational</strong> (schools, universities) and professional environments (constituting 90% of total sales), it fell short of reaching the intended consumer market <sup>02</sup> <sup>03</sup>.</p><p>The Macintosh became a <strong>topic of conversation</strong> for everyone, but it was <strong>not yet accessible</strong> to everyone, and sales never fully met expectations. Jobs bore the brunt of this setback, to the extent that he was ousted from the company he co-founded before the year’s end.</p><ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)" target="blank">Steve Jobs (Book)</a> - Walter Isaacson (2011)</li><li><a target="blank" href="https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/news/when-mac-came-market-street">When the Mac Came to Market Street</a> - LeBow College of Business Drexel University (2014)</li><li><a target="blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/10/nyregion/computer-makers-find-rich-market-in-schools.html">Computer makers find rich market in schools</a> - New York Times (1984)</li></ol></div><div id="right"><h3>Let the search begin</h3><p>Okay, let’s begin with the obvious. The original Macintosh (128K <sup>04</sup>) hasn’t been available for over three decades. Obtaining one now requires finding someone willing to part with it <del>or, as my wife puts it, “<strong>to get rid of it</strong>”</del>.</p><p>While I’m sure there are numerous sales channels and opportunities in the United States, in Italy, aside from a stroke of luck at a vintage electronics market, the primary option is <mark>eBay</mark>.</p><h4>Key considerations</h4><p>I must concede that I may have overstated in the introduction: even at the time, 128KB of RAM wasn’t quite sufficient, a realization users came to fairly quickly <sup>05</sup>.</p><p>A few months later, Apple took evasive action by <strong>quadrupling the RAM</strong> with the 512K model. Many early adopters opted to upgrade, undergoing a <strong>complete motherboard replacement</strong> as the RAM was soldered onto the PCB. This approach proved more cost-effective than the alternative, which involved bearing the expense of RAM in addition to specialized labor for individually replacing all (16) chips.</p><p>Despite being a mass-produced industrial product on a global scale, with hundreds of thousands in circulation, the <strong>rush to upgrade</strong> (justifiable at the time) and the subsequent need for maintenance or component replacement over the years have rendered intact units a rarity.</p><h4>The market</h4><p>Machines that remain entirely original and operational are currently being sold at prices ranging <strong>from $2,000 to $4,000</strong> <sup>06</sup>. This extensive range is frequently attributed to the aesthetic state of different components, the production week indicated by the serial number, and the inclusion of accessories and accompanying software.</p><p>Fortunately, <strong>the value experiences a sharp decline</strong> when, under similar conditions and equipment, the computer is marketed as non-functional, often due to a <strong>problem</strong> identified to varying degrees by the seller.</p><h4>The right problem</h4><p>The notion of acquiring one for restoration, akin to reviving an old vintage car that no longer runs, <strong>intrigued me</strong>. The immediate allure of substantial cost savings persuaded me to delve deeper (unaware that I would eventually spend the equivalent of obtaining a fully operational unit in the ensuing months). My requirements were:</p><ul><li>A Macintosh with a <strong>commonly documented issue</strong>.<ul><li>A problem complex enough to require attention but not beyond my capabilities.</li><li>An issue seemingly confined and identifiable through a photograph or an error code.</li></ul></li><li>A Macintosh complete with <strong>essential accessories</strong>: keyboard, mouse, power cable, and boot floppy.</li><li>An <strong>aesthetically pleasing Macintosh</strong>, serving as a <del>paperweight</del> decorative item if repair proved unsuccessful.</li></ul><p>After months of research and numerous rejected purchase proposals, I found the ideal synthesis of these requirements in an eBay auction by a vintage electronics store in <strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>.</p><p>Adding to the myriad variables inherent in acquiring a non-functioning item from almost four decades ago was the challenge of an <strong>intercontinental journey</strong>. Despite the uncertainties, I decided to take the leap: a deep breath, closed eyes, and a click on the “<mark>Buy it now</mark>” button <sup>03</sup>.</p><blockquote>Over the ensuing three weeks, I cycled through various emotions, from pure excitement to regret and occasional despair.</blockquote><p>Then, it arrived. Finally, the courier at the door. Unboxing time. Yes! That’s it! What a beauty! <sup>05-06</sup>.</p><p>Admittedly, it’s a bit dirty with signs of weathering, but try spending three decades in an attic, crossing a continent, and presenting yourself like this for a <strong>first date</strong>.</p><ol><li><a target="blank" href="https://lowendmac.com/1984/macintosh-128k/">Macintosh 128K</a> - lowendmac.com</li><li><a target="blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726175452/http://www.mac-history.net/top/2011-01-24/the-history-of-the-apple-macintosh">The history of the Apple Macintosh</a> - mac-history.net</li><li>eBay auction closing period from July to December 2022 for a functional Macintosh 128K.</li></ol></div><div id="boot"><p><h3>First boot</h3></p></div><div id="boot-2"><p><h3>Sad Mac</h3></p></div><div id="sadmac"><h3>We have a problem.</h3><p>Okay, the initial attempt to boot didn’t go as planned, but I shouldn’t have expected anything different.</p><p>After swiftly unpacking, connecting a voltage reducer to the socket, and powering up the computer <sup>07</sup>, I hear a familiar [beep], as anticipated from all the repair videos on YouTube that I’ve watched to prepare myself.</p><h4>The Devil’s Interval</h4><p>This is the renowned Apple <strong>boot sound</strong>, still present in the current lineup across all Mac products. However, the complete and reassuring sound we hear in today’s Macs is the result of subsequent work <sup>07</sup> initiated in 1988 by <a target="_blank" href="https://reekes.net/">Jim Reekes</a>, a sound engineer.</p><p>In 1984, hardware limitations prevented achieving such sophisticated sounds. Consequently, it had to be simplified into something much more basic: a three-note chord with sounds that were far from soothing, historically known even in the 1800s as the “<strong>devil’s interval</strong>” <sup>07</sup>.</p><div><ul><li><figure><span> <video width="1080" height="1080" preload="none" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="https://84-24.org/03_01.04f4ecfe.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> </span><figcaption><strong>First tests</strong> Failed boot attempt and Sad Mac.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><span> <img loading="lazy" src="https://84-24.org/03_02.80449c91.jpg" alt=""> </span><figcaption><strong>Motherboard detail</strong> Location of RAM chips inside the motherboard.</figcaption></figure></li><li></li></ul></div><h4>Sad Mac</h4><p>Displayed on the screen is the <mark>Sad Mac</mark>, one of the legendary icons from the original set designed by <a href="https://kareprints.com/" target="_blank">Susan Kare</a> specifically for the first Macintosh. While it stands as a genuine pixel art manifesto <sup>08</sup>, unfortunately, in my case, this icon identifies an <strong>error</strong>, and a <strong>big one</strong> at that.</p><p>During this boot phase, the computer conducts tests on various components, and the memory is filled with data for a subsequent consistency check. The failure of this test indicates a hardware malfunction, identified by a specific <strong>error code</strong> displayed immediately below the Sad Mac icon.</p><p>The code I won is <code>04040A</code>.</p><p>In the 80s and 90s, detailed information to decipher these error codes wasn’t extensively provided even in the <strong>technical service manuals</strong> for installers and repairers <sup>09</sup>. For Sad Mac, the suggested generic process often involved replacing the entire logic board.</p><p>Fortunately, with the advent of the Internet, Apple has digitized and publicly shared <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211224234010/https://support.apple.com/kb/TA46376?locale=en_US">more detailed indications</a>, allowing users to interpret the code comprehensively and pinpoint the problem to more specific components.</p><blockquote>The table at this link serves as my Rosetta Stone for decoding the error.</blockquote><h4>It’s a memory trap!</h4><p>Finally, the code is “clear”. The first two characters (04) represent the type of failed test, “<mark>Memory Mod3 test</mark>”, while each of the next four characters (040A) identifies the status of a set composed of four memory chips, totaling 16 chips.</p><p>The specific damaged chips within a set are identified by a number (1, 2, 4, or 8), corresponding to a <strong>pair of coordinates</strong> with a letter (F or G) and a number (from 5 to 12), determining their precise location on the motherboard <sup>08</sup>.</p><table><tbody><tr><th><span>0</span></th><th><span>4</span></th><th><span>0</span></th><th><span>A</span></th></tr><tr><td><span>1</span><code>G9</code></td><td><span>1</span><code>G5</code></td><td><span>1</span><code>F9</code></td><td><span>1</span><code>F5</code></td></tr><tr><td><span>2</span><code>G10</code></td><td><span>2</span><code>G6</code></td><td><span>2</span><code>F10</code></td><td><span>2</span><code>F6</code></td></tr><tr><td><span>4</span><code>G11</code></td><td><span>4</span><code>G7</code></td><td><span>4</span><code>F11</code></td><td><span>4</span><code>F7</code></td></tr><tr><td><span>8</span><code>G12</code></td><td><span>8</span><code>G8</code></td><td><span>8</span><code>F12</code></td><td><span>8</span><code>F8</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you’ve stuck with me this far, under the assumption that each character can only have a value of 1, 2, 4, or 8, the question you’ve likely pondered is: why <del>the hell</del> is there an A in my error code?</p><p>The answer came to light through the experience of <a target="_blank" href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/mac-128k-unlisted-error-code.37876/post-410052">a user on the 68kmla.org forum</a>, who, like me, encountered an error code with an unexpected character.

These are the <strong>MT4264</strong> <sup>10</sup>, a <strong>64Kbit</strong> DRAM chip manufactured by <i>Micron Technology</i>, which was practically a standard in computers of that era, albeit under various names and codes depending on the manufacturer <sup>11</sup>.</p><p>This integrated circuit, no longer in production for many years, is now only obtainable through private sellers offering used parts or from suppliers specializing in <strong>vintage components</strong>.</p><p>Despite numerous eBay auctions being geographically closer, I chose to rely on <strong>Jameco</strong> <sup>12</sup>, a well-known Californian retailer. This decision was influenced by recommendations from specialized forums during my preliminary research <sup>11</sup>.</p><h4>Let’s open it!</h4><p>Okay, I understand that the disassembly process might look straightforward and quick on this animation, but the reality involves dealing with screws, cables, dust, and cathode ray tubes that can hold <strong>extremely high electrical voltages</strong> (up to 10kV), even several minutes after being powered off <sup>13</sup>.</p><p>As the first computer created with non-professional users in mind, the Macintosh 128K was deliberately designed to <mark>discourage self-repair</mark>, thereby making even the simple act of opening its casing a significant challenge.</p><p>For its exterior, <strong>Torx T15</strong> security screws, which were quite rare at that time, were used. These screws were deeply set near the upper “handle”, necessitating the use of an extendable or sufficiently long screwdriver for access <sup>14</sup>.</p><blockquote>Unlike any other computer of its era, the Macintosh was deliberately “armored”.</blockquote><p>However, as of 2024, the situation has greatly simplified. All necessary tools are readily available in <strong>hardware stores</strong>. With <strong>basic manual skills</strong>, removing the motherboard and its damaged chips is straightforward, especially with detailed guides like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Macintosh+128K+Teardown/21422">iFixit detailed teardown</a> available.</p><h4>Open heart surgery</h4><p>At this juncture, I’d love to claim that I channeled my inner <strong>MacGyver</strong> and replaced the damaged chips on the board using nothing more than a banana and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09UlB17cgKw">a paperclip</a>. However, my modest soldering skills dissuaded me from attempting repairs on a board that is not only older than myself but also holds great sentimental value.</p><p>Yes, I cheated. My family includes several individuals far more adept with hardware than I am, and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to <strong>entrust the task</strong> to my cousin, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-giorgi-hts-srls-19971434/">Luca Giorgi</a>.

Following the thorough cleaning of the area <sup>10</sup>, he skillfully resoldered the <strong>16-pin sockets</strong> onto the board and installed the newly acquired chips <sup>12</sup>.</p><p>Now, the moment of truth: crossing our fingers and attempting to <mark>power it on once more</mark>.</p><p>The boot sound remains that familiar, uncomforting tone, but this time, the monitor shows signs of life.

Vintage.</h3><p>I must admit, this chapter was not originally part of my plan. For a while, I had considered my restoration project complete:</p><ul><li>All the damaged components were <strong>repaired</strong>.</li><li>The computer was <strong>operational and usable</strong>.</li><li>I had found the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ikea.com/it/it/p/bekant-elemento-contenitore-con-rotelle-rete-bianco-s59282535/"><strong>ideal furniture</strong></a> at Ikea to showcase and use the Macintosh, occupying minimal space in the house <del>and thereby avoiding being kicked out by my wife</del>.</li><li>Additionally, I had just discovered the <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.bigmessowires.com/products/floppy-emu-model-c-bundle"><strong>Floppy Emu</strong></a>, a <strong>floppy emulator</strong> that would enable me to explore all the software ever created for the Macintosh 128K without further financial strain.</li></ul><p>So, what more could I have asked for? Yes, it’s true, the casing was still somewhat <strong>dirty and had yellowed</strong> over time, but wasn’t this a perfect reflection of its history and the character of this iconic machine?</p><p>For a while, I convinced myself of this <mark>romanticized view</mark> and thought it unnecessary to risk reopening and completely disassembling a Macintosh that had just begun working again, merely for cosmetic reasons. That was until my timeline started to be filled with articles and videos about <strong>retrobright</strong>, and a new doubt started to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksjTWm9XaII">take root in my mind</a>.</p><h4>Retrobright</h4><p>This mixture was developed by <strong>Dave Stevenson</strong>, an English chemist with a passion for retrocomputers <sup>18</sup>. Its purpose is to restore the original color of ABS plastics <sup>19</sup>, a material extensively used in the casings of various electronic devices over the past 50 years.</p><p>Stevenson hypothesized that the yellowing was not due to the ABS itself, but rather to <strong>bromine</strong>, an element added to ABS for its flame-retardant properties. When exposed to UV rays from the sun, bromine naturally tends to revert to its original brown color, thereby causing the entire plastic to yellow <sup>20</sup>.</p><p>The Retrobright formula was made public in 2008 and consists of a blend of <strong>high-concentration hydrogen peroxide</strong> (10%–15%), active oxygen, and thickeners to create a spreadable product.</p><blockquote>The outcome of this formula is a gel. When applied to plastics and exposed to UV rays, it is intended to return the oxygen molecule to the bromine, thereby it should reverse the yellowing process.</blockquote><p>I use the conditional tense because, since 2008, the community of enthusiasts has continuously experimented with and modified the compound, leading to the creation of <strong>numerous variations</strong> <sup>21</sup>. Over the years, there have been documented instances of failures and long-term effects on plastics. These findings have <strong>raised questions</strong> about both the role of bromine and UV rays in the yellowing process, as well as the effectiveness and safety of the mixture and method itself <sup>22</sup>.</p><p>I confess that despite the <strong>wealth of information available</strong> for research, my complete lack of knowledge in chemistry, combined with the overwhelming number of highly positive reviews, led me to <strong>overlook any potential risks</strong> or negative aspects. I <del>wanted</del> had to try!</p><h4>Everything under control</h4><p>For my experiment, I selected one of the <strong>brightest (and hottest) days of the year</strong>, considering the significance of UV rays in the process. Prior to starting, I removed any labels, logos, or tags that might get damaged <sup>20</sup>. Each piece of plastic was thoroughly washed to eliminate any dirt or dust residue from the surface <sup>21-22</sup>.</p><p>I prepared about a liter of Retrobright and gradually transferred it to a basin for application on each plastic piece <sup>23</sup>. To <strong>prevent the mixture</strong> from evaporating quickly under the sun, I followed several tutorial suggestions and covered each piece with a film <sup>24</sup>. In hindsight, this was <mark>the first of many mistakes</mark>.</p><p>After approximately 2 hours of exposure, I decided to check the results of this initial attempt, and that’s when I encountered my <strong>first major setback</strong>. Despite the film covering, the gel had almost entirely evaporated and had done so unevenly, following the creases of the film. <strong>The outcome was disheartening</strong>. The gel had only managed to lighten certain areas of the plastic, creating stains and streaks across all surfaces <sup>25-26</sup>.</p><h4>Panic</h4><p>Following that setback, I embarked on a <strong>series of hasty attempts</strong>, hoping that another application might even out the coloration. Initially, I repeated the process without the film, refreshing the mixture <strong>every 20 minutes</strong> throughout an entire morning to prevent evaporation. Subsequently, I replicated the procedure in an environment with <strong>controlled UV light</strong> <sup>27</sup>.</p><p>In both instances, I managed only to <strong>lighten the different areas proportionally</strong>. The darker parts became lighter, but so did the already light areas, which further intensified and essentially preserved the initial streaks.</p><hr data-text="Happy ending"><h4>Plan B</h4><p>It dawned on me that any further attempts would be futile, only serving to <strong>further degrade plastics</strong> already stressed by various treatments. This realization was followed by a few weeks of discouragement, during which I hesitantly returned to eBay to browse through auctions for exorbitantly priced spare parts. Eventually, I settled on the only viable option: <strong>painting the plastics</strong>.</p><p>Interestingly, <strong>Apple had abandoned the practice</strong> of painting plastics with the introduction of the Macintosh. They believed that using ABS plastic already colored appropriately would prevent the natural variation in paint color when exposed to sunlight. Ironically, the <strong>opposite occurred</strong>: all the painted plastics from earlier models withstood the test of time much better <sup>23</sup>.</p><p>This time, <del>thank God,</del> I decided it was best to directly consult professionals. My sole task was to find the correct color reference <sup>24</sup>. I entrusted the job to a local body shop specializing in <strong>plastic painting</strong>, and they executed the work with great precision and care <sup>28-29</sup>.</p><p>What can I say? The Macintosh had not only become “presentable” but had almost turned into a <mark>showpiece</mark> <sup>31</sup>, and I had finally run out of ways to potentially compromise its safety again.</p><p>The restoration could at last be considered complete. Just in time to celebrate the <strong>40th anniversary of the Mac</strong>!</p><ol><li><a href="http://retr0bright.com/" target="_blank">The “Retr0bright” Project</a> - retr0bright.com (2008)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene" target="_blank">Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene</a> - Wikipedia</li><li><a href="https://www.vecchicomputer.com/retr0bright/" target="_blank">Retr0Bright: how to restore yellowed plastics</a> (IT) - Giacomo Vernoni</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZYbchvSUDY" target="_blank">New retrobrite techniques</a> - The 8-Bit Guy</li><li><a href="https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/blog/2013-01-15-retr0bright-only-temporary.htm" target="_blank">RetroBright treated plastics re-yellowing even with minimal light exposure?</a> - Terry Stewart’s (Tezza’s) Blog</li><li><a href="https://bzotto.medium.com/what-color-was-apple-beige-acd14bca0c1a" target="_blank">What color was “Apple Beige”?</a> - Ben Zotto</li><li><a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/mac-128k-color.12107/" target="_blank">Mac 128k color</a> - 68kMLA Forum</li></ol></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://itch.io/jam/spring-lisp-game-jam-2024">Spring Lisp Game Jam
2024</a> ended one week
ago.  48 games were submitted, a new record for the jam!  This past
week has been a time for participants to play and rate each other’s
games.  As I explored the entries, I noticed two distinct
meta-patterns in how people approached building games with Lisp.  I
think these patterns apply more broadly to all applications of Lisp.
Let’s talk about these patterns in some detail, with examples.</p><h2>But first!</h2><p>Here’s the breakdown of the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/spring-lisp-game-jam-2024/entries">jam
submissions</a> by
language:</p><pre><code>lang       entries    % (rounded)
----       -------    -----------
guile      15         31
fennel     10         21
clojure    5          10
cl         5          10
racket     4          8
elisp      4          8
s7         3          6
kawa       1          2
owl        1          2</code></pre><p>I haven’t rolled up the various Schemes (Guile, Racket, S7, Kawa) into
a general <code>scheme</code> category because Scheme is so minimally specified
and they are all very distinct implementations for different purposes,
not to mention that Racket has a lot more going on than just Scheme.</p><p>For the first time ever, <a href="https://gnu.org/software/guile">Guile</a> came
out on top with the most submissions!  There’s a very specific reason
for this outcome.  11 out of the 15 Guile games were built for the web
with <a href="https://spritely.institute/hoot">Hoot</a>, a Scheme-to-WebAssembly
compiler that I work on at the <a href="https://spritely.institute/">Spritely
Institute</a>.  2 of those 11 were official
Spritely projects.  We <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/make-a-game-with-hoot-for-the-lisp-game-jam.html">put out a
call</a>
for people to try making games with Hoot before the jam started, and a
lot of people took us up on it!  Very cool!</p><p>The next most popular language, which is typically <em>the</em> most popular
language in these jams, is <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>.  Fennel
is a Lisp that compiles to Lua.  It’s very cool, too!</p><p>Also of note, at least to me as a Schemer, is that three games used
<a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html">S7</a>.  Hmm, there
might be something relevant to this post going on there.</p><p>The patterns I’m about to talk about could sort of be framed as “The
Guile Way vs. The Fennel Way”, but I don’t want to do that.  It's not
an “us vs. them” thing.  It’s wonderful that there are so many flavors
of Lisp these days that anyone can find a great implementation that
suits their preferences.  Not only that, but many of these
implementations can be used to make games that anyone can easily play
in their web browser!  That was <em>not</em> the case several years ago.
Incredible!</p><p>I want to preface the rest of this post by saying that <strong>both patterns
are valid</strong>, and while I prefer one over the other, that is not to say
that the other is inferior.  I'll also show how these patterns can be
thought of as two ends of a spectrum and how, in the end, compromises
must be made.  Okay, let’s get into it!</p><h2>Lisp as icing</h2><p>The icing pattern is using Lisp as a “scripting” language on top of a
cake that is made from C, Rust, and other static languages.  The
typical way to do this is by embedding a Lisp interpreter into the
larger program.  If you’re most interested in writing the high-level
parts of an application in Lisp then this pattern is the fastest way
to get there.  All you need is a suitable interpreter/compiler and a
way to add the necessary hooks into your application.  Since the
program is mainly C/Rust/whatever, you can then use emscripten to
compile it to WebAssembly and deploy to the web.  Instant
gratification, but strongly tied to static languages and their
toolchains.</p><p>S7 is an example of an embeddable Scheme.  Guile is also used for
extending C programs, though typically that involves dynamically
linking to libguile rather than embedding the interpreter into the
program’s executable.  Fennel takes a different approach, recognizing
that there are many existing applications that are already extensible
through Lua, and provides a lispy language that <em>compiles to</em> Lua.</p><h2>Lisp as cake</h2><p>The cake pattern is using Lisp to implement as much of the software
stack as possible.  It’s Lisp all the way down... sorta.  Rather than
embedding Lisp into a non-Lisp program, the cake pattern does the
inverse: the majority of the program is written in Lisp.  When
necessary, shared libraries can be called via a foreign function
interface, but this should be kept to a minimum.  This approach takes
longer to yield results.  Time is spent implementing missing libraries
for your Lisp of choice and writing wrappers around the C shared
libraries you can’t avoid using.  Web deployment gets trickier, too,
since the project is not so easily emscriptenable.</p><p>(You may recognize this as the classic embed vs. extend debate.
You’re correct!  I'm just adding my own thoughts and applying it
specifically to some real-world Lisp projects.)</p><p>I mentioned Guile as an option for icing, but Guile really shines best
as cake.  The initial vision for Guile was to Emacsify other programs
by adding a Scheme interpreter to them.  These days, the best practice
is to write your program in Scheme to begin with.  Common Lisp is
probably the best example, though.  Implementations like SBCL have
good C FFIs and can compile efficient native executables, minimizing
the desire to use some C for performance reasons.</p><h2>Case studies</h2><p>Let’s take a look at some of the languages and libraries used for the
Lisp Game Jam and evaluate their icing/cake-ness.</p><h3>Fennel + love2d</h3><p><a href="https://love2d.org/">love2d</a> has been a popular choice for solo or
small team game development for many years.  It is a C++ program that
embeds a Lua interpreter, which means it’s a perfect target for
Fennel.  Most Linux distributions package love2d, so it’s easy to run
<code>.love</code> files natively.  Additionally, thanks to emscripten, love2d
games can be deployed to the web.  Thus most Fennel games use love2d.
<a href="https://jleightcap.itch.io/sokobin">./soko.bin</a> and <a href="https://alexjgriffith.itch.io/gnomic-vengeance">Gnomic
Vengeance</a> are two
games that use this stack.</p><p>Fennel + love2d is a perfect example of Lisp as icing.  Fennel sits at
the very top of the stack, but there’s not really a path to spread
Lisp into the layers below.  It is also the most successful Lisp game
development stack to date.</p><h3>S7 + raylib</h3><p>This stack is new to me, but two games used it this time around:
<a href="https://gcmas.itch.io/ghosthop">GhostHop</a> and <a href="https://illusion-fisherman.itch.io/life-predictor">Life
Predictor</a>.  (You
really gotta play GhostHop, btw.  It’s a great little puzzle game and
it is playable on mobile devices.)  <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">Raylib</a>
is a C library with bindings for many higher-level languages that has
become quite popular in recent years.  S7 is also implemented in C and
is easily embeddable.  This makes the combination easy to deploy on
the web with emscripten.</p><p>S7 + raylib is another example of Lisp as icing.  I’m curious to see
if this stack becomes more popular in future jams.</p><h3>Guile + Chickadee</h3><p>This is the stack that I helped build.
<a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html">Chickadee</a> is a game library for Guile that
implements almost all of the interesting parts in Scheme, including
rendering.  Two games were built with Chickadee in the most recent
jam: <a href="https://etenil.itch.io/turbo-racer-3000">Turbo Racer 3000</a> and
<a href="https://snamellit.itch.io/bloatrunner">Bloatrunner</a>.</p><p>Guile + Chickadee is an example of Lisp as cake.  Chickadee wraps some
C libraries for low-level tasks such as loading images, audio, and
fonts, but it is written in pure Scheme.  All the matrix and vector
math is in Scheme.  Chickadee comes with a set of rendering primitives
comparable to love2d and raylib but they’re all implemented in Scheme.
I’ve even made progress on rendering vector graphics with Scheme,
whereas most other Lisp game libraries use a C library such as
<a href="https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg">nanosvg</a>.  Chickadee has pushed
the limits of Guile’s compiler and virtual machine, and Guile has been
improved as a result.  But it’s the long road.  Chickadee is mostly
developed by me, alone, in my very limited spare time.  It is taking a
long time to reach feature parity with more popular game development
libraries, but it works quite well for what it is.</p><h3>Hoot + HTML5 canvas</h3><p>I also helped build this one.  Hoot is a Scheme-to-WebAssembly
compiler.  Rather than compile the Guile VM (written in C) to Wasm
using emscripten, Hoot implements a complete Wasm toolchain and a new
backend for Guile’s compiler that emits Wasm directly.  Hoot is
written entirely in Scheme.  Unlike C programs compiled with
emscripten that target Wasm 1.0 with linear memory, Hoot targets Wasm
2.0 with GC managed heap types.  This gives Hoot a significant
advantage: Hoot binaries <strong>do not ship a garbage collector</strong> and thus
are much smaller than Lisp runtimes compiled via emscripten.  The Wasm
binary for my game weighs in at &lt; 2MiB whereas the love2d game I
checked had a nearly 6MiB <code>love.wasm</code>.  Hoot programs can also easily
interoperate with JavaScript.  Scheme objects can easily be passed to
JavaScript, and vice versa, as they are managed in the same heap.
With all of the browser APIs just a Wasm import away, an obvious
choice for games was the built-in HTML5 canvas API for easy 2D
rendering.</p><p>11 games used Hoot in the jam, including (shameless plug)
<a href="https://davexunit.itch.io/cirkoban">Cirkoban</a> and <a href="https://fluxharmonic.itch.io/lambda-dungeon">Lambda
Dungeon</a>.</p><p>Hoot + HTML5 canvas is mostly dense cake with a bit of icing.  On one
hand, it took a year and significant funding to <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/05/16/on-hoot-on-boot">boot
Hoot</a>.  We
said “no” to emscripten, built <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/05/24/hoots-wasm-toolkit">our own
toolchain</a>,
and extended Guile’s compiler.  It's Lisp all the way until you hit
the browser runtime!  We even have a Wasm interpreter that runs on the
Guile VM!  Hoot rules!  It was a risk but it paid off.  On the other
hand, the canvas API is very high-level.  The more cake thing to do
would be to use Hoot’s JS FFI to call WebGL and/or WebGPU.  Indeed,
this is the plan for the future!  Wasm GC needs some improvements to
make this feasible, but my personal goal is to get Chickadee ported to
Hoot.  I want Chickadee games to be easy to play natively and in
browsers, just like love2d games.</p><h2>The cake/icing spectrum</h2><p>I must acknowledge the limitations of the cake approach.  We’re not
living in a world of Lisp machines, but a world of glorified PDP-11s.
Even the tallest of Lisp cakes sits atop an even larger cake made
mostly of C.  All modern Lisp systems bottom out at some point.  Emacs
rests on a C core.  Guile’s VM is written in C.  Hoot runs on mammoth
JavaScript engines written in C++ like V8.  Games on Hoot currently
render with HTML5 canvas rather than WebGL/WebGPU.  Good luck using
OpenGL without libGL; Chickadee uses guile-opengl which uses the C FFI
to call into libGL.  Then there’s libpng, FreeType, and more.  Who the
heck wants to rewrite all this in Lisp?  Who even has the resources?
Does spending all this time taking the scenic route matter at all, or
are we just deluding ourselves because we have fun writing Lisp code?</p><p>I think it <em>does</em> matter.  Every piece of the stack that can be
reclaimed from the likes of C is a small victory.  The parts written
in Lisp are much easier to hack on, and some of those things become
<strong>live hackable</strong> while our programs are running.  They are also
memory safe, typically, thanks to GC managed runtimes.  Less FFI calls
means less overhead from traversing the Lisp/C boundary and more
safety.  As more of the stack becomes Lisp, it starts looking less
like icing and more like cake.</p><p>Moving beyond games, we can look to the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>
project as a great example of just how tasty the cake can get.  Guix
took the functional packaging model from the Nix project and made a
fresh implementation, replacing the Nix language with Guile.  Why?
For code staging, code sharing, and improved hackability.  Guix also
uses an init system written in Guile rather than systemd.  Why?  For
code staging, code sharing, and improved hackability.  These are real
advantages that make the trade-off of not using the industry-standard
thing worth it.</p><p>I’ve been using Guix since the early days, and back then it was easy
to make the argument that Guix was just reinventing wheels for no
reason.  But now, over 10 years later, the insistence on maximizing
the usage of Lisp has been key to the success of the project.  As a
user, once you learn the Guix idioms and a bit of Guile, you unlock
extraordinary power to craft your OS to your liking.  It’s the closest
thing you can get to a Lisp machine on modern hardware.  The cake
approach paid off for Guix, and it could pay off for other projects,
too.</p><p>If Common Lisp is more your thing, and even if it isn’t, you’ll be
amazed by the <a href="https://shirakumo.github.io/trial/">Trial</a> game engine
and how much of it is implemented in Common Lisp rather than wrapping
C libraries.</p><p>There’s also projects like <a href="https://prescheme.org/">Pre-Scheme</a> that
give me hope that one day the layers below the managed GC runtime can
be implemented in Lisp.  Pre-Scheme was developed and successfully
used for <a href="https://s48.org/">Scheme 48</a> and I am looking forward to a
modern revival of it thanks to an <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Pre-Scheme/">NLnet
grant</a>.</p><h2>I'm a cake boy</h2><p>That’s right, I said it: I’m a cake boy.  I want to see projects
continue to push the boundaries of what Lisp can do.  When it comes to
the Lisp Game Jam, what excites me most are not the games themselves,
but the small advances made to reclaim another little slice of the
cake from stale, dry C.  I intend to keep pushing the limits for Guile
game development with my Chickadee project.</p><p>It’s <em>not</em> a piece of cake to bake a lispy cake, and the way is often
hazy, but I know we can’t be lazy and just do the cooking by the book.
Rewrite it in Rust?  No way!  Rewrite it in Lisp!</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://allenpike.com/2024/llms-trained-on-internet">https://allenpike.com/2024/llms-trained-on-internet</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40549021">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A path to continued model improvement.</p><div>
<p>I often see a misconception when people try to reason about the capability of LLMs, and in particular how much future improvement to expect.</p>

<p>It’s frequently said that that LLMs are “trained on the internet,” and so they’ll always be bad at producing content that is rare on the web. A recent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40333672">example from Hacker News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LLMs are mostly trained on Internet posts, so they are Internet simulators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">frames LLM training this way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LLMs are trained on increasingly large corpora of text largely scraped from the web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even former Apple SVP of Engineering – and famously sharp computer scientist – Bertrand Serlet explains them thus, in his recent video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwtyIDmhxh4">Why AI Works</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[An LLM has] been trained on the entire internet, so it has packed all this knowledge that’s in the internet, but also all the reasoning patterns that can be found [there.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admittedly, this used to be true! And is still <em>mostly</em> true. But it’s increasingly becoming less true.</p>

<p>Because it’s becoming less true, the idea of an “internet simulator” is not a useful way to predict how GPT-5 and beyond will work. New models are already exceeding this definition, and the shift is only beginning.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-wall">The Data Wall</h2>

<p>Way back in 2020, OpenAI’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165">GPT-3 paper</a> described their training dataset in some detail. GPT-3 was, basically, trained on the internet.</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://allenpike.com/images/2024/gpt3-data.png"></p><p>An artifact from a bygone era, when frontier AI was open.</p>
</div>

<p>By 2022, LLMs were being <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155">trained to follow instructions</a> using custom human feedback. Since then, frontier model labs like OpenAI have gotten very cagey about what they’re adding to their training datasets. We don’t know what GPT-4o was trained on, let alone Sora or GPT-5.</p>

<p>But we do know <strong>it’s not just the internet</strong>.</p>

<p>Recently, LLM trainers have hit a “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/1/24117828/the-internet-may-not-be-big-enough-for-the-llms">data wall</a>”. More data generally improves model training, but OpenAI already has roughly all the data on the web – even inconvenient-to-access data like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/6/24122915/openai-youtube-transcripts-gpt-4-training-data-google">Youtube video transcriptions</a>. So other than training ever-larger models on the same internet data, how can they make better LLMs?</p>

<p>The answer, for labs with money, is acquiring and creating non-public data. At first, their focus was making existing training data more useful, or adding existing non-public data to the training pool. For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Annotation and filtering</strong>: Researchers have been creating annotations for their training data for years. Good annotations let them focus LLM training on the highest value data, which allows for better (or smaller) models.</li>
  <li><strong>RLHF</strong>: Labs also have humans rate model outputs. They use this data to fine-tune the models, and encourage useful behaviours like instruction-following and refusing to say naughty things.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: ChatGPT is <a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-data-wall">said to</a> generate on the order of 10 billion tokens of data per day – even before they opened their more compelling GPT-4o model to free users.</li>
  <li><strong>Data acquisition</strong>: While a lot of humanity’s data is on the internet, much of it is not. Emails, chat logs, proprietary manuals and procedures, JIRA tickets, phone recordings, internal reports, and contracts are all useful data. While examples exist on the internet, model trainers can cut deals to add more of these to their training data.</li>
</ol>

<p>So that’s all helpful.</p>

<p>But none of these techniques are a complete solution to a famous weakness of current models: the “<strong>LLMs suck at producing outputs that don’t look like existing data</strong>” problem.</p>

<p>Here are some of the many things that LLMs are bad at doing, in part because there isn’t a lot of text online that demonstrates them:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Expressing doubt or uncertainty in one’s answer</li>
  <li>Having long conversations without repeating phrasings or looping</li>
  <li>Making high-level plans for LLM agents to pursue</li>
  <li>Reasoning like a Principal Engineer about a massive legacy codebase</li>
  <li>Reliably following extremely long or complex prompts</li>
</ol>

<p>While improved architectures and more parameters might help with these limitations, you can bet your butt that OpenAI, Meta, Google, and/or Microsoft are paying big money to fill some of these gaps in a simpler way: <strong>creating novel examples to train on</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="llms-are-now-being-trained-on-custom-data">LLMs are now being trained on custom data</h2>

<p>A recent example of the rise of custom data is Microsoft’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219">Phi-3 Technical Report</a>, published in April. phi-3-mini is only 3.8 billion parameters – a waif in LLM terms – but claims performance competitive with the impressive but much-heavier Mixtral model. The paper credits some of this improvement to including high-quality synthetic data, generated by larger LLMs, in the training data. Synthetic data allows them to fill gaps in the internet-sourced data, and improves model performance for a given size.</p>

<p>Now, synthetic data is a hot topic in LLM research. It’s not yet clear how far you can go with training LLMs on their own output before things <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01413">go horribly wrong</a>, like a giant neural snake eating its own tail.</p>

<p>At the minimum, though, synthetic data will help fill the kind of gaps that arise simply from LLMs behaving like “internet simulators.” For example, if your model is hallucinating because you don’t have enough training examples of people expressing uncertainty, or biased because it has unrepresentative data, then generate some better examples!</p>

<p>Still, creating great synthetic data with LLMs is a challenging problem, and will have its limits. That’s why there’s one last huge source of non-internet data inbound: Humans.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-data-can-you-create-for-1byr">How much data can you create for $1B/yr?</h2>

<p>It turns out that if you pay people money, they’re willing to make data for you. <a href="https://scale.ai/">Scale.ai</a>, which bills itself as “the data foundry for AI,” operates a service where labs pay humans to do just this. Reportedly, AI companies are paying more than $1B a year for Scale’s services already. While some of this is for annotation and ratings on data that came from the web or LLMs, they also <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/scale-ai-funding-valuation-ceo-alexandr-wang-profitability/">create new training data whole-hog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company has shifted its focus to more highly-specialized workers such as Ph.D-level academics, lawyers, accountants, poets, authors, and those fluent in specific languages. These workers, who help train and test models for companies from OpenAI and Cohere to Anthropic and&nbsp;Google, also work through a third-party, often another Scale subsidiary called Outlier, but are paid higher hourly wages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only can companies like OpenAI pay to have professionals create new, good data that fills holes in the internet-sourced data, they then keep that data to train subsequent models. A dataset like “50,000 examples of Ph.Ds expressing thoughtful uncertainty when asked questions they don’t know the answer to” could be worth a lot more than it costs to produce.</p>

<p>So yes, LLMs were originally trained on the internet. Yes, we can understand a lot of their early weaknesses as stemming from the foibles of whatever crap people post on the web.</p>

<p>However. As the size and impact of custom training data increases, we should expect LLMs to markedly exceed “internet simulation”. In particular, they’ll continue to get better at things that aren’t on the internet, but can be demonstrated in $1B+ of custom data creation.</p>

<p>That is to say: this train will keep rollin’ for a while yet.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In a fitting illustration last week of the Chinese leadership’s unrelenting efforts to manipulate collective memory, an online essay with a shocking revelation about the wholesale disappearance of Chinese internet content spanning the 2000s was deleted by content monitors. But the post, quickly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240523001943/https:/mp.weixin.qq.com/s/afg3zHPpEyRzSfOR1Aeh3w">archived</a> and <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/708143.html">shared</a>, reverberated in platforms beyond PRC-managed cyberspace.</p>



<p>Written by He Jiayan (何加盐), an internet influencer active since 2018, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240523001943/https:/mp.weixin.qq.com/s/afg3zHPpEyRzSfOR1Aeh3w">the essay</a> concluded, based on a wide range of searches of various entertainment and cultural figures from the late 1990s through the mid-2000s, that nearly 100 percent of content from major internet portals and private websites from the first decade of China’s internet has now been obliterated. “No one has recognized a serious problem,” wrote He. “The Chinese-language internet is rapidly collapsing, and Chinese-language internet content predating the emergence of the mobile internet has almost entirely disappeared.”</p>



<p>Simple searches through the Baidu search engine for public figures such as Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun (雷军), who would have yielded perhaps millions of unique posts during the period of the “traditional internet” from the late 1990s through the end of the 2000s, turned up few if any results, He Jiayan revealed. These wholesale absences in Chinese-language content from inside China were repeated when He used non-Chinese search engines, including Google and Bing.</p>



<p>The post cited several reasons for this mass vanishing, including the phasing out of private websites and blog platforms as technologies developed, the shuttering of old and unprofitable platforms by commercial providers who have no commercial incentive to maintain archives, and a lack of social resources in China that might handle archiving as a preservation initiative (like <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> in the United States). But as others <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNQ6r-qSymw">commented outside</a> the Great Firewall, the most decisive factor in the loss of content and the failure to archive has been the Chinese Communist Party and its mandate for political and ideological control of history and public opinion.</p>



<p>Posted on Wednesday, May 22, He’s post had been removed from WeChat by the following day, yielding a 404 message that read: “This content violates regulations and cannot be viewed.”</p>



<div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/404-missing-internet-1024x439.jpg" alt="" width="548" height="235" srcset="https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/404-missing-internet-1024x439.jpg 1024w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/404-missing-internet-300x129.jpg 300w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/404-missing-internet-768x329.jpg 768w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/404-missing-internet.jpg 1438w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p></figure></div>



<p>Acknowledging the various reasons for the widespread outage of content from the period of China’s traditional internet, the fact of this mass vanishing raises huge questions about the role of the internet in the formation of collective identity — and what it will mean for entire landscapes of history to be simply gone. “In the internet era to come, as people look back on the first two decades of the 21st century, it will be a 20-year period absent from the historical record,” He wrote. “If you still glimpse old information right now on the Chinese internet, these are just the last rays of the setting sun.”</p>



<p>___________</p>



<p>[A partial translation of He Jiayan’s post follows]</p>



<p><strong><em>“The Chinese Internet is Collapsing” (中文互联网正在加速崩塌)</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Let me ask you a small question:</em></p>



<p><em>If we search for the name “Jack Ma” (马云) on Baidu, and then set our search parameters from 1998 to 2005, how many pieces of information do you suppose we’ll turn up? 100 million? 10 million? One million?</em></p>



<p><em>I have asked in several groups, and most feel it should be somewhere in the neighborhood of millions or tens of millions. After all, the internet is such a vast reservoir of information. Jack Ma, as the stormy entrepreneur of that era, must have left a lot of traces on the Internet.</em></p>



<p><em>The full search results, in fact, are as follows:</em></p>



<div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ma-Yun-2-1024x502.jpg" alt="" width="555" height="271" srcset="https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ma-Yun-2-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ma-Yun-2-300x147.jpg 300w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ma-Yun-2-768x377.jpg 768w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ma-Yun-2.jpg 1252w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px"></p></figure></div>



<p><em>Within the selected date range of “May 22, 1998 to May 22, 2005” on Baidu, there is just one positive result for “Jack Ma” (dated May 22, 2024).</em></p>



<p><em>This piece of information is also false. Click on the result and you’ll find it is an article posted in 2021, which does not fall within the specified time frame but is somehow, inexplicably, returned</em>.</p>



<p><em>This means that if we set out to understand Jack Ma’s experience over this particular time period — </em>i<em>ncluding news reports, public discussions, his speeches, company developments, and so on — the sum total of the material we derive from this search is zero.</em></p>



<p><em>You may imagine this is a problem unique to Baidu. But if you switch to Bing or Google, can you obtain search results?</em></p>



<p><em>I tested, these two sites to search for valid information, and both were not much different from Baidu. They had slightly more, but only in the single digits still. There were also more cases again of invalid information out of order [within the time frame], results that were wrongly pulled out of the search for some unspecified technical reason.</em></p>



<p><em>You might wonder if this could happen because Jack Ma is one of the more controversial people out there — that for some indescribable reason, his information is unsearchable.</em></p>



<p><em>But Jack Ma is in fact not an isolated case. If we search for [Tencent founder] Pony Ma (马化腾), [Xiaomi CEO] Lei Jun (雷军), [Huawei CEO] Ren Zhengfei (任正非), and so on, or even for figures like [Chinese entrepreneur and internet celebrity] Luo Yonghao (罗永浩) and Sister Fu Rong (芙蓉姐姐) who were hot topics at that time, and even if we search for internet stars like [Taiwanese singer and musician] Jay Chou (周杰伦) or [Super Girl contest winner] Li Yuchun (李宇春), we still get the same results.</em></p>



<p>W<em>hen we search for information about Lei Jun for the period, here are the results we get:</em></p>



<div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lei-Jun-2-1024x424.jpg" alt="" width="753" height="311" srcset="https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lei-Jun-2-1024x424.jpg 1024w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lei-Jun-2-300x124.jpg 300w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lei-Jun-2-768x318.jpg 768w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lei-Jun-2-1536x636.jpg 1536w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lei-Jun-2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px"></p><figcaption>A search by He Jiayuan for Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun on Baidu turns up no results. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>After testing various websites and people’s names, over varying time periods, I discovered a shocking phenomenon:</em></p>



<p><em>Nearly all of the Chinese websites that were popular back in those days — the likes of NetEase (网易), Sohu (搜狐), Campus BBS (校园BBS, Xici Hutong (西祠胡同), Kaidi Maoyan (凯迪猫眼), Tianya Forum (天涯论坛), SchoolNet (校内网), Sina blogs (新浪博客), Baidu Post (百度贴吧), and a massive number of personal websites — have completely vanished before a certain date, or in most cases have disappeared altogether. The only apparent exception is Sina.com, where you can still find some information from more than ten years ago, but still very little. More than 99.9999 percent of the other content from that time has disappeared.</em></p>



<p><em>No one has recognized a serious problem: the Chinese-language internet is rapidly collapsing, and Chinese-language internet content predating the emergence of the mobile Internet has almost entirely disappeared.</em></p>



<p><em>We once believed that the internet had a memory. We failed to realize that this memory was like the memory of a goldfish.</em></p>

</p><figcaption>A Chinese YouTube influencer reads He Jiayan’s deleted essay aloud, and comments on the case. </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>[2</strong>]</p>



<p><em>This problem came to my attention because the subject of the He Jiayan public account is the research of leading lights in society. For this reason, I routinely need to research material about such figures.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Over the past two years, I had a very distinct feeling: the amount of original material I could find online was declining in a sharp, cliff-like manner. Some of the original reports I had seen in the past were later slowly vanishing. The speeches that my target subjects had made in the past, or the articles they had written, were also becoming impossible to find. Video interviews and discussions I had seen before were also slowly disappearing.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Perhaps there was a monster devouring webpages, and it was following the historical timeline — swallowing pages starting in the past and moving on toward the present, first in nibbles and then in great bites, chomping away the Chinese internet in five and ten-year chunks.</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>

But I want to keep telling parts of her story, because I think she was the kind of leader who over-performed and under-self-promoted. And I want to share a personal anecdote at the end that I didn’t share in the book.</span></p><p>But first, Frances’s story. (If you know it already, you can skip to the bottom section for the personal anecdote, and the quote I want to end the year with.):&nbsp;</p><p>Frances grew up in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. When she arrived at the University of Pittsburgh’s junior college (“Junior Pitt”), she dreamed of a bookish life as a playwright — until her father died her freshman year. She was 17, the oldest of three, and was stroking his cheek when he passed, promising to care for the family. So she dropped out.&nbsp;</p><p>She worked as an “adman’s assistant” at the Penn Traffic Company department store, until she got married. Just in time for her husband, John, to report to the Navy during World War II. John was a combat aircrew photographer, and when he came back, he set up a studio. Frances was the studio’s jack-of-all-trades, helping with anything from high school portraits, to documentary films, to weird customer requests — like the time a customer wanted a photo of a dog to look like a painting, so Frances grabbed oil paints and got it done.&nbsp;</p><p>Frances adored Johnstown’s diversity, but it afforded her some ugly lessons. John was on the new Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission. When a barber claimed he didn’t have the tools to serve Black customers, John said he’d better buy them. Frances decided then that a community that valued inclusiveness should answer “yes” to the question: “When they look at us, can they find themselves?”&nbsp;</p><p>Frances was 34 when a prominent woman in the community stopped by her home to ask if she would volunteer to lead Girl Scout Troop 17. The previous leader had left to be a missionary in India, and other neighbors had turned down the request. So did Frances, three times. She had an eight-year-old boy and professed to know nothing about little girls. Finally, the woman told her that the group of ten-year-old girls from modest families who met in a church basement would just have to be disbanded. Frances agreed to fill in for six weeks, until a real leader was found.&nbsp;</p><p>To prepare, she read up on the Girl Scouts. She learned that the organization was founded eight years before women could vote in the U.S., and that the founder had reminded girls that they could be “a doctor, a lawyer, an aviatrix, or a hot-air balloonist.” Frances thought back to second grade, when she announced that she wanted to be a pilot and her classmates laughed. She ended up sticking with Troop 17 for eight years, until they graduated high school.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, she kept picking up Girl Scout roles she didn’t seek out, often declined initially, and then ended up sticking with. She later described her life philosophy as: “doing what’s needed at the time.” She chaired a local United Way campaign at a time when that role was as foreign for women as aviatrix had once been.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1970, she declined a request to run the local Girl Scout council. She’d never take a “professional” job, she said. Then the businessmen entreating her said that the council would lose the United Way partnership if the finances weren’t fixed in a hurry. Frances agreed to fill in for six months, and then step aside for an experienced professional. At 54, she began what she called her first professional job. She stayed for four years, and fell in love with learning about management. Unfortunately, the overall picture for Girl Scouts was bleak.&nbsp;</p><p>Society had changed dramatically in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Girl Scouts had not. Girls needed info on thorny topics like sex and drugs, and preparation for careers. Membership fell off a cliff. The national CEO position went vacant for nearly an entire year. In 1976, Frances was invited to interview for the position. She declined.&nbsp;</p><p>Previous CEOs had staggering leadership credentials. One had been founding director of the U.S. Coast Guard Women’s Reserve. Another had a PhD from MIT and worked with wartime technology. Frances was one of 335 local council leaders. But John told her that if she wanted to say “no,” he would drive her to New York City so she could do it in person.&nbsp;</p><p>With nothing to lose, she plainly told the committee everything that needed to change. They needed more math and science. They needed to lose the one hallowed handbook and get material that appealed to different demographics. They needed to dismantle the hierarchical leadership structure in favor of her “circular management,” where staff members are like beads on concentric circles, with many contacts at adjacent levels through whom they could get and give feedback. And when girls of all backgrounds looked at Girl Scouts, they needed to see themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Frances arrived in Manhattan on July 4, 1976, as CEO of a 3 million member organization. Out went the lone handbook in favor of multiple handbooks targeted at different ages. She commissioned research on effective messaging that led to poetic marketing. A poster that targeted Native American girls read: “Your names are on the rivers.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>Diversity was great, Frances was told, but it was too much too soon. Fix the organizational problems first, then worry about diversity. But she decided that diversity </span><em>was </em><span>the organizational problem, so she kept going. Ultimately, she tripled minority membership. She also added 130,000 new volunteers — people she paid in a sense of mission — and grew the cookie business to $300 million a year. She added badges for math and science. One had binary code, for girls learning about computers.&nbsp;</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg" width="1456" height="1511" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1511,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:782142,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5ad5b96-fbff-437c-b4f6-a243a7ffa89c_1815x1883.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Frances made tough decisions, like selling campgrounds that volunteers and staff loved from their childhoods but that were no longer getting enough use. Ultimately, she remained CEO for 13 years. Revered management expert Peter Drucker called her the best CEO in the country. When the head of General Motors retired a few months after her, </span><em>Business Week </em><span>asked Drucker who should take over. “I would pick Frances,” he told them.&nbsp;</span></p><p>---</p><p>Frances’s leadership story didn’t end there. She had been retired for all of a day when the chairman of Mutual of America offered her an office to do whatever she wanted with. An odd proposition, but by that point she realized none of her contributions grew out of long-term plans, but rather from doing what’s needed at the time. So she took it, and started a leadership institute, where she continued working through the age of 107. She also taught at the United States Military Academy at West Point.&nbsp;</p><p>Frances never did graduate from college, but the second time I visited her at her office, I counted 23 honorary doctorates. Not to mention a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the U.S. (When President Bill Clinton conferred it, he jokingly asked Frances to “come forward,” rather than “up,” because she didn’t like hierarchical language.)&nbsp;</p><p>But for all the honors and awards, it was just being around Frances that left the biggest impression on me. One day, she invited me to lunch at a cafeteria, and someone in front of us was rude to the cashier. When it was Frances’s turn to talk to the cashier, she said something to the effect of: “It’s so busy here at lunch hour! You’re doing a fantastic job. You must be great at handling pressure. I’m not sure everyone could do that. We’re lucky to have you here. Thank you.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>I’m pretty sure everyone behind us in line was suddenly extremely polite to the cashier. Being around Frances, I just couldn’t help but be a better person, and compliment people more. It feels to me like that kind of leader doesn’t get enough attention these days. Frances wasn’t a big self-promoter, which is one reason I feel obliged to keep promoting her and her brand of leadership. So thank you for joining me in 2022, and I want to give Frances the last </span><em>Range Widely </em><span>words of the year:</span></p><p>“Leadership is a matter of how to be, not how to do.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>-</span><strong>Frances Hesselbein (1915-2022)</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1726787,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7edf1054-35e7-49e7-94b1-e057a5afc762_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster-logo-old.jpg" alt="napster logo" width="300" height="167" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster-logo-old.jpg 540w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster-logo-old-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">The <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-mp3-pirates-and-apple-changed-the-music-industry-210117/">invention of the MP3</a> format in 1993 didn’t make any mainstream news headlines. In hindsight, however, it was a pivotal moment that would revolutionize music consumption, and more. </p>
<p>Invented by the German engineer Karlheinz Brandenburg and colleagues at the Fraunhofer Society, the coding format made it possible to reduce the size of music files without any significant loss of audible sound quality.</p>
<p>Due to the size reductions, these digital files could be stored on flash-memory devices. This led to the invention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_media_player">dedicated MP3 players</a> capable of playing music ripped from CDs. Many considered this a more compact and shock-resistant alternative to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discman">Discman</a>. </p>
<p>At the time, music industry insiders were already fantasizing about the ‘celestial jukebox’; a tool or service that would make it possible to play any track on demand. The MP3 helped to bring this concept a step closer too, as Napster would soon prove. </p>
<h2>Napster: June 1, 1999</h2>
<p>At the end of the nineties, technology and the Internet were a playground for young engineers and ‘hackers’. Some of them regularly gathered in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201222012204/http://www.w00w00.org/">w00w00</a> IRC chatroom on the EFnet network. This tech-think-tank had many notable members, including WhatsApp founder Jan Koum and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning">Shawn Fanning</a>, who logged on with the nickname Napster. </p>
<p>In 1998, 17-year-old Fanning shared an idea with the group. ‘Napster’ wanted to create a network of computers that could share files with each other. More specifically, a central music database that everyone in the world could access.</p>
<p>This idea never left the mind of the young developer. Fanning stopped going to school and flanked by his friend <a href="http://Sean Parker">Sean Parker</a>, devoted the following months to making his vision a reality. That moment came on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">June 1, 1999</a>, when the first public release of Napster was released online. Soon after, the software went viral.</p>
<center><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fanning-1.jpg" alt="fanning" width="600" height="423"></center>
<p>Napster was quickly embraced by millions of users, who saw the software as something magical. It was a gateway for musical exploration, one that dwarfed even the largest record stores in town. And all for free. It sounds mundane today, but some equated it to pure technological sorcery.</p>
<p>For many top players in the music industry, Napster’s sorcery was pure witchcraft. At the time, manufacturing CDs with high profit margins felt like printing money and Napster’s appearance threatened to ruin the party.</p>
<h2>Music Industry Shocked</h2>
<p>According to the RIAA’s former CEO, Hilary Rosen, a few months after Napster’s release, the music industry shifted into full panic mode. In February 2000, all major label executives discussed the threat during an RIAA board meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“I will never forget this day. All of the heads of the labels, literally the titans of the music business, were in that room. I had somebody wheel in a PC and put some speakers up and I started doing a name that tune,” Rosen <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-mp3-pirates-and-apple-changed-the-music-industry-210117/">later recalled</a>.</p>
<p>The major music bosses started to name tracks, including some that weren’t even released yet, and time and again Napster would come up with results. Needless to say, the board was terrified.</p>
<p>Within a year, the RIAA sued Napster Inc. and soon after artists including Metallica and Dr. Dre followed. These high profile cases only raised the popularity of Napster and MP3 players began to sell like hotcakes.</p>
<h2>Peak Napster</h2>
<p>At the start of 2001, Napster’s user base reached a peak of more than 26.4 million worldwide. Yet, despite huge growth and backing from investors, the small file-sharing empire couldn’t overcome the legal challenges.</p>
<p>The RIAA lawsuit resulted in an injunction from the Ninth Circuit Court, which ordered the network to shut down. This happened during July 2001, little more than two years after Napster launched. By September that year, the case had been settled for millions of dollars.</p>
<center><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/benefit.jpg" alt="benefit" width="600" height="344" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/benefit.jpg 1613w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/benefit-1536x882.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></center>
<p>While the Napster craze was over, file-sharing had mesmerized the masses and the genie was out of the bottle. Grokster, KaZaa, Morpheus, LimeWire, and many others popped up and provided sharing alternatives, for as long as they lasted. Meanwhile, BitTorrent was also knocking on the door. </p>
<h2>Ripple Effect</h2>
<p>Today, 25 years later, music piracy certainly hasn’t disappeared, but it has changed. When Napster came out, there simply weren’t any legal options to buy digital music online; let alone one that offered ‘unlimited access’. </p>
<p>Napster paved the way for Apple’s iTunes store, to serve the demand that was clearly there. The boom in digital download sales never came close to mimicking the ‘all you can play’ experience and was soon marginalized.</p>
<p>The current music industry generates the bulk of its revenues from online streaming subscriptions, while CDs have been downgraded to rare artifacts. This music streaming landscape was largely pioneered by a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-pirate-bay-helped-spotify-become-a-success-180319/">Napster ‘fan’ from Sweden</a>, Daniel Ek.</p>
<p>Like many others, Ek was fascinated by the ‘all you can play’ experience offered by file-sharing software, and that planted the seeds for the music streaming startup Spotify, where he still serves as CEO today. In fact, Spotify itself used file-sharing technology under the hood to ensure swift playback. </p>
<p>Spotify is just one of the many examples of the Napster ripple effect, which reaches far beyond technology. The entire music industry has changed, for better and worse, depending on one’s perspective. And the ripples that started 25 years ago will still be felt in the decades to come.</p>

<p>

Earlier this week our team detected unauthorized access to our Spaces platform, specifically related to Spaces secrets. As a consequence, we have suspicions that a subset of Spaces’ secrets could have been accessed without authorization.</p>
<p>As a first step of remediation, we have revoked a number of HF tokens present in those secrets. Users whose tokens have been revoked already received an email notice. <strong>We recommend you refresh any key or token and consider switching your HF tokens to fine-grained access tokens which are the new default.</strong></p>
<p>We are working with outside cyber security forensic specialists, to investigate the issue as well as review our security policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, we have made other significant improvements to the security of the Spaces infrastructure, including completely removing org tokens (resulting in increased traceability and audit capabilities), implementing key management service (KMS) for Spaces secrets, robustifying and expanding our system’s ability to identify leaked tokens and proactively invalidate them, and more generally improving our security across the board. We also plan on completely deprecating “classic” read and write tokens in the near future, as soon as fine-grained access tokens reach feature parity. We will continue to investigate any possible related incident.</p>
<p>Finally, we have also reported this incident to law enforcement agencies and Data protection authorities.</p>
<p>We deeply regret the disruption this incident may have caused and understand the inconvenience it may have posed to you. We pledge to use this as an opportunity to strengthen the security of our entire infrastructure. For any question, please contact us at <a href="mailto:security@huggingface.co">security@huggingface.co</a>.</p>

			<p>Albert Einstein used to say that he went to his office at the Institute for Advanced Study “just to have the privilege of walking home with Kurt Gödel.” The two would meet at Einstein’s home each day between 10 and 11 and undertake the half-hour walk to the institute. At 1 or 2 in the afternoon they’d walk back, discussing politics, philosophy, and physics. Biographer Palle Yourgrau estimates that these walks consumed 30 percent of Einstein’s workday.</p>
<p>Einstein’s secretary, Helen Dukas, wrote in 1946, “I know of one occasion when a car hit a tree after its driver suddenly recognized the face of the beautiful old man walking along the street.”</p>
<p>Gödel caused no such problems. “I have so far not found my ‘fame’ burdensome in any way,” he wrote to his mother. “That begins only when one becomes so famous that one is known to every child in the street, as is the case of Einstein.” </p>
<p>(From <a href="https://archive.org/details/AWorldWithoutTime"><em>A World Without Time: The Forgotten Legacy of Godel and Einstein</em></a>, 2009.)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Ticketmaster owner Live Nation confirmed "unauthorised activity" on its database after a group of hackers said they had stolen the personal details of 560 million  customers.</b></p><p>ShinyHunters, the group claiming responsibility, says the stolen data includes names, addresses, phone numbers and partial credit card details from Ticketmaster users worldwide.</p><p>The hacking group is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c899pz84d8zo">reportedly demanding a $500,000 (£400,000</a>) ransom payment to prevent the data from being sold to other parties.</p><p>In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Live Nation said that on 27 May "a criminal threat actor offered what it alleged to be Company user data for sale via the dark web", and that it was investigating.</p><p>The number of customers affected by the data breach has not been confirmed by Live Nation.</p><p>The Ticketmaster breach was first revealed by hackers who posted an advert for the data on Wednesday evening. Ticketmaster refused to confirm it to reporters or customers and instead notified shareholders late on Friday.</p><p>The Australian government said it is working with Ticketmaster to address the issue. The FBI has also offered to assist, a spokesperson for the US Embassy in Canberra told Agence France-Presse.</p><p>A spokesperson for the FBI told the BBC it "has no comment on this matter".</p><p>In its filing, Live Nation said it was working to "mitigate risk" to its customers and that it was notifying users about the unauthorised access to their personal information.</p><p>"As of the date of this filing, the incident has not had, and we do not believe it is reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our overall business operations or on our financial condition or results of operations. We continue to evaluate the risks and our remediation efforts are ongoing", it added.</p><p>American website Ticketmaster is one of the largest online ticket sales platforms in the world.   This hack is one of the biggest in history in terms of global victims but it’s not yet clear how sensitive the data is that is in the hands of cyber criminals.</p><p>Researchers are also warning that it’s part of a larger ongoing hack involving a cloud service provider called Snowflake which is used by many large firms to store data in the cloud. Snowflake notified customers that it has been breached but would not say which firms are impacted. On Friday Santander confirmed it had data from an estimated 30m customers stolen which was being sold by the same hacking group as the Ticketmaster hackers. It’s thought these hacks are all linked and many others could become public.</p><p>An advert with some data samples allegedly obtained in the breach have been posted on the website BreachForums - a newly relaunched hacking forum on the dark web where other hackers buy and sell stolen material, and information to enable hacks to take place.</p><p>ShinyHunters has been linked to a string of high-profile data breaches resulting in millions of dollars in losses to the companies involved.</p><p>In 2021 the group sold a genuine database of stolen information from 70 million customers of US telecoms firm AT&amp;T.</p><p>In September last year, almost 200,000 Pizza Hut customers in Australia had their data breached.</p><p>The FBI cracked down on the domain in March 2023, arresting its administrator Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, but it has reappeared, according to tech media.</p><p>Users of hacking forums often inflate the scale of their hacking to attract attention from other hackers.</p><p>They are often where large stolen databases first appear but can also feature false allegations and claims.</p><p>Individuals declaring large batches of data in the past have proven to be duplicates of previous hacks rather than newly stolen information.</p><p>If the data hack is as large as claimed by ShinyHunters, the hack could be the most significant breach ever in terms of numbers and the extent of the data stolen.</p><p>This is not the first time Ticketmaster has been hit with security issues.</p><p>In 2020 it admitted it hacked into one of its competitors and agreed to pay a $10m fine.</p><p>In November it was allegedly hit by a cyber attack which led to problems selling tickets for Taylor Swift's Era's tour.</p><p>Earlier this month, US regulators sued Live Nation accusing the entertainment giant of using illegal tactics to maintain a monopoly over the live music industry.</p><p>The lawsuit from the Department of Justice said the firm's practices had kept out competitors, and led to higher ticket prices and worse service for customers.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Experts say it’s important not to panic but to be alert, if you think you may be a victim.</p><p>Watch out for bogus emails, messages and phone calls - hackers can sometimes use the details they have to trick victims into revealing more information.</p><p>In some cases scammers may try and exploit the fear caused by the hack as a way of trying to persuade you to share information.</p><p>Be especially suspicious of:</p><div><ul role="list"><li><p>official-sounding messages about "resetting passwords", "receiving compensation", "scanning devices" or "missed deliveries"</p></li></ul></div><div><ul role="list"><li><p>emails full of "tech speak", designed to sound more convincing</p></li></ul></div><div><ul role="list"><li><p>being urged to act immediately or within a limited timeframe</p></li></ul></div><p>In 2018 when a hack put some Ticketmaster customer information at risk, UK officials <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/ncsc-advice-ticketmaster-customers">also suggested users<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> kept an eye on their financial accounts for suspicious activity.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><ol><li><p><strong>The best websites are <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">home-cooked meals</a>.</strong> <a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/selkouutiset-archive/">Andrew’s Selkouutiset Archive</a> was birthed after I realized there was no obvious way to fetch the <em>previous</em> articles of the “Easy Finnish” daily news broadcast. This annoyed me as a student of the language. “Here we have a stream”, I thought, “of high-quality, human-written, interesting practice material, and no easy way to access it!” So I went out of my way to create such a way, and me and my language skills have been profiting off of it ever since. A very small website, for a very specific need, just leaves a delightful aftertaste in the mouth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cronjobs and Git complement each other nicely.</strong> ASA runs off of 3 Git repos, each submoduling and iterating upon the last. The first repo archives the page as-is with a cronjob. The second repo turns the first repo into cleaned-up Markdown with an English translation with another cronjob. The third repo turns the cleaned-up Markdown into a Hugo website with a third cronjob. If at any point an issue appears, with e.g. the shell scripts that do the actual cleaning, I always have the option to simply revert to a previous commit and work fresh.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplicity is underrated.</strong> Everything about this website is done as simply as I could stand. For example, notice how there’s no database at all. In essence we are using Git itself as our database, specifically that very first repo. That means this site is <em>entirely static</em>, and can be deployed directly to Github Pages without any complications. I don’t think I’ve had to tweak anything about that flow in the last 3 months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Working locally is <em>hella</em> underrated.</strong> Originally I started this because I got tired of spending 15 minutes every morning copying and pasting that day’s news, along with its Google Translation to English, into Anki. Later I got tired of spending 5 minutes per article copying and pasting the actual archive, even though the whole translation was right there as well. Because I made sure to make the intermediate repo as easy to work with as possible, I later found it very straightforward to write <a href="https://github.com/Selkouutiset-Archive/selkokortti/tree/main">a little Python program</a> that could process <em>all</em> of the news into a flashcard format. Crucially, because all of the Git repos are things anyone else can pull down, this program <em>clones its own local copy</em> of Repo #2 and creates flashcards on that copy on the local filesystem, making it probably an order of magnitude faster than even the fastest response-request cycle could get (and much more deterministic too).</p></li><li><p><strong>Bare HTML never goes out of style.</strong> My archive doesn’t use any JavaScript at all, it’s just HTML with the smallest amount of classless CSS I could get away with to make it easy to read the Finnish and English side-by-side. At one point I thought perhaps I should add in some code to help people find the dictionary forms of the rarer words, but it turns out <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/finstem">I already wrote a command line tool to solve that general case</a>. Adding JavaScript in to a non-JS website to solve that task felt like way more complexity than it was worth.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> is the bee’s knees!</strong></p></li></ol></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p><a href="https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e">Stealing everything you’ve ever typed or viewed on your own Windows PC is now possible with two lines of code — inside the Copilot+ Recall disaster</a> (<a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/112537206611365804" title="@GossiTheDog">via</a>) Recall is a new feature in Windows 11 which takes a screenshot every few seconds, runs local device OCR on it and stores the resulting text in a SQLite database. This means you can search back through your previous activity, against local data that has remained on your device.</p>
<p>The security and privacy implications here are still enormous because malware can now target a single file with huge amounts of valuable information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During testing this with an off the shelf infostealer, I used Microsoft Defender for Endpoint — which detected the off the shelve infostealer — but by the time the automated remediation kicked in (which took over ten minutes) my Recall data was already long gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like Kevin Beaumont's argument here about the subset of users this feature is appropriate for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a surface level, it is great if you are a manager at a company with too much to do and too little time as you can instantly search what you were doing about a subject a month ago.</p>
<p>In practice, that audience’s needs are a very small (tiny, in fact) portion of Windows userbase — and frankly talking about screenshotting the things people in the <em>real world</em>, not executive world, is basically like punching customers in the face.</p>
