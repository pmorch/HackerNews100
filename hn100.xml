	<div>
		<p>Some of us in the GTK team have spent the last month or so exploring the world of linux kernel graphics apis, in particular, dmabufs. We are coming back from this adventure with some frustrations and some successes.</p>
<h3>What is a dmabuf?</h3>
<p>A dmabuf is a memory buffer in kernel space that is identified by a file descriptor. The idea is that you don’t have to copy lots of pixel data around, and instead just pass a file descriptor between kernel subsystems.</p>
<p>Reality is of course more complicated that this rosy picture: the memory may be device memory that is not accessible in the same way as ‘plain’ memory, and there may be more than one buffer (and more than one file descriptor), since graphics data is often split into planes (e.g. RGB and A may be separate, or Y and UV).</p>
<h3>Why are dmabufs useful?</h3>
<p>I’ve already mentioned that we hope to avoid copying the pixel data and feeding it through the GTK compositing pipeline (and with 4k video, that can be quite a bit of data for each frame).</p>
<p>The use cases where this kind of optimization matters are those where frequently changing content is displayed for a long time, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Video players</li>
<li>Virtual machines</li>
<li>Streaming</li>
<li>Screencasting</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>In the best case, we may be able to avoid feeding the data through the compositing pipeline of the compositor as well, if the compositor supports <em>direct scanout</em> and the dmabuf is suitable for it.&nbsp; In particular on mobile systems, this may avoid using the GPU altogether, thereby reducing power consumption.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>GTK has already been using dmabufs since 4.0: When composing a frame, GTK translates all the render nodes (typically several for each widget) into GL commands, sends those to the GPU, and mesa then exports the resulting texture as a dmabuf and attaches it to our Wayland surface.</p>
<p>But if the only thing that is changing in your UI is the video content that is already in a dmabuf, it would be nice to avoid the detour through GL and just hand the data directly to the compositor, by giving it the file descriptor for the the dmabuf.</p>
<p>Wayland has the concept of subsurfaces that let applications defer some of their compositing needs to the compositor: The application attaches a buffer to each (sub)surface, and it is the job of the compositor to combine them all together.</p>
<p>With what is now in git main, GTK will create subsurfaces as-needed in order to pass dmabufs directly to the compositor. We can do this in two different ways: If nothing is drawn on top of the dmabuf (no rounded corners, or overlaid controls), then we can stack the subsurface above the main surface without changing any of the visuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png" alt="" width="525" height="675" srcset="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png 525w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above-233x300.png 233w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 85vw, 525px"></a>This is the ideal case, since it enables the compositor to set up <em>direct</em> <em>scanout, </em>which gives us a zero-copy path from the video decoder to the display.</p>
<p>If there is content that gets drawn on top of the video, we may not be able to get that, but we can still get the benefit of letting the compositor do the compositing, by placing the subsurface with the video <em>below</em> the main surface and poking a translucent hole in the main surface to let it peek through.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png" alt="" width="625" height="675" srcset="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png 625w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below-278x300.png 278w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></a>The round play button is what forces the subsurface to be placed below the main surface here.</p>
<p>GTK picks these modes automatically and transparently for each frame, without the application developer having to do anything. Once that play button appears in a frame, we place the subsurface below, and once the video is clipped by rounded corners, we stop offloading altogether. Of course, the advantages of offloading also disappear.</p>
<p>The graphics offload visualization in the GTK inspector shows these changes as they happen:</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-9664-1" width="840" height="660" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm?_=1"><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm">https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm</a></video></p>
<p>Initially, the camera stream is not offloaded because the rounded corners clip it. The magenta outline indicates that the stream is offloaded to a subsurface below the main surface (because the video controls are on top of it). The golden outline indicates that the subsurface is above the main surface.</p>
<h3>How do you use this?</h3>
<p>GTK 4.14 will introduce a <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.GraphicsOffload.html">GtkGraphicsOffload</a> widget, whose only job it is to give a hint that GTK should try to <em>offload</em> the content of its child widget by attaching it to a subsurface instead of letting GSK process it like it usually does.</p>
<p>To create suitable content for offloading, the new <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gdk4/class.DmabufTextureBuilder.html">GdkDmabufTextureBuilder</a> wraps dmabufs in GdkTexture objects. Typical sources for dmabufs are pipewire, video4linux or gstreamer. The dmabuf support in gstreamer will be much more solid in the upcoming 1.24 release.</p>
<p>When testing this code, we used the GtkMediaStream implementation for pipewire by Georges Basile Stavracas Neto that can be found in <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pipewire-media-stream">pipewire-media-stream</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libmks/">libmks</a> by Christian Hergert and Bilal Elmoussaoui.</p>
<h3>What are the limitations?</h3>
<p>At the moment, graphics offload will only work with Wayland on Linux. There is some hope that we may be able to implement similar things on MacOS, but for now, this is Wayland-only. It also depends on the content being in dmabufs.</p>
<p>Applications that want to take advantage of this need to play along and avoid doing things that interfere with the use of subsurfaces, such as rounding the corners of the video content. The <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.GraphicsOffload.html">GtkGraphicsOffload</a> docs have more details for developers on constraints and how to debug problems with graphics offload.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The GTK 4.14 release will have some interesting new capabilities for media playback. You can try it now, with the just-released 4.13.3 snapshot.</p>
<p>Please try it and let us know what does and doesn’t work for you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When people think of <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/28/ftc-must-free-american-workers-consumers-entrepreneurs-non-compete-agreements-politics-labor-john-arensmeyer/" target="_self" rel="">noncompete agreements</a>, they usually think of corporate executives with knowledge of prized trade secrets, whose lavish pay packages often come with a condition that if they quit or get fired, they <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/23/doctors-hospitals-noncompete-ftc-proposed-rule/" target="_self" rel="">can’t go work for an industry rival</a>.</p><div>



<p>More and more, though, employers are requiring regular workers to sign those deals. About 1 in 5 American workers, nearly 30 million people, are bound by noncompete agreements,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/non-compete-clause-rulemaking#:~:text=Overview,from%20pursuing%20better%20employment%20opportunities." target="_self" rel="">according</a>&nbsp;to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>Horror stories about companies using noncompete agreements to trap workers in middling jobs or punish them for taking their skills elsewhere for better pay prompted New York legislators to pass a bill last June that would ban noncompete agreements.</p>



<p>Five months later, though, Gov. Kathy Hochul hasn’t said whether she intends to sign the legislation, which has come under a fierce attack by business groups.</p>



<p>The Public Policy Institute of the State of New York, an affiliate of the Business Council of New York, launched a $1 million ad campaign last month in an attempt to thwart the legislation. Some of the loudest opposition has come from Wall Street, where firms see noncompete agreements as important to protecting investment strategies and keeping highly-paid workers from walking out with valuable inside information.</p>



<p>Supporters of the ban say <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/15/heres-what-chros-actually-think-about-the-potential-ban-on-noncompetes/" target="_self" rel="">it would help people</a> like lighting designer Richard Tatum, a New York City resident who had signed a noncompete agreement and spent a year fighting a former employer in court after they sued him for getting another job shortly after they laid him off in 2009. He had a family to support and wasn’t moving or leaving his industry, he said.</p>



<p>“I felt I had no choice but to fight,” said Tatum, who now works for an event production company. He said he understands being fired during the financial meltdown. “But the fact that I had to spend a year fighting off my former employer was just wrong.”</p>



<p>A handful of states, including California, already ban noncompete agreements. Other states, including Minnesota and Oklahoma, have laws that void noncompete agreements if a person is laid off.</p>



<p>The Federal Trade Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-technology-politics-business-9fb699837e8bf8ecd9c70dcf27699dcf" target="_self" rel="">proposed a regulation</a>&nbsp;in January banning noncompete agreements, arguing that they hurt workers. President Joe Biden said at the time that the agreements “block millions of retail workers, construction workers and other working folks from taking better jobs and getting better pay and benefits in the same field.”</p>



<p>If signed by Hochul, a Democrat, the New York bill would only affect noncompete agreements signed after the law goes into effect. The legislation would not restrict nondisclosure agreements.</p>



<p>Hochul’s office said she’s still reviewing the legislation. She has until the end of the year to make a decision.</p>



<p>Business groups say the ban shouldn’t apply to certain industries and job levels, like top executives or partners in tech companies or law firms. They also said it could push employers to ship jobs to states like Florida and Texas that do not have similar laws.</p>



<p>“This bill poses a serious risk to innovation and job growth and, if enacted, could unravel the delicate balance between protecting business investment and fostering a competitive job market,” said Paul Zuber, the executive vice president for the Business Council of New York.</p>



<p>Advocates for the bill argue that striking noncompete agreements will actually be good for innovation.</p>



<p>State Senator Sean Ryan, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, pointed to Silicon Valley in California, a hub for tech companies.</p>



<p>“All the flexibility you see in that economy would have been dashed had they made it so you couldn’t go work for an emerging tech company,” Ryan said.</p>



<p>The bill, he added, would give employees more flexibility and agency when considering other employment opportunities.</p>



<p>Tatum, the lighting designer who reached a legal settlement with his former employer to keep working in his profession, said, “I just don’t think anyone like me should have to go through that again.”</p></div><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the biggest headlines in business. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=ceo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-wrapper" tabindex="-1">
            


<p>Welcome back, calibre users. It has been a year since calibre
6.0. The headline new feature is <b>notes for authors, series, tags, etc.</b>
calibre can now store notes with links, images and rich text formatting associated
with every author, series, publisher, tag, etc. The notes are searchable, browseable,
linkable and can be exported as standalone HTML files.
</p>

<p>To use the new <i>Notes</i> feature, right click (or <code>Ctrl+click</code> on macOS) on 
an author or tag in the <i>Tag browser</i> or <i>Book details</i> panel and <i>Edit notes</i>.
</p>

<ul id="feature-list">
    <li>
        <span>Category notes</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            You can store notes associated with an author, publisher, series, et cetera,
            in your calibre library. To do so right click (or <code>Ctrl+click</code> on macOS) on
            an author or tag name in the <i>Tag browser</i> or <i>Book details</i> panel and
            choose <i>Edit notes</i>. Once you have created the note, a little pencil icon
            will show next to the name in the book details panel. You can click the
            pencil to view the note.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can browse and search through all notes in your library by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+N</code>
            or adding the <i>Browse notes</i> tool to the toolbar via <i>Preferences-&gt;Toolbars &amp; menus</i>.
            </p>

            <p><a title="The notes display window" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/notes-show.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/notes-show-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>

    <li>
        <span>Audio EPUB books in the E-book viewer</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre has gained support for so called "Audio EPUB" books. Typically,
            these are books that have a pre-recorded voice reading the text. Freely downloadable
            examples of such books are available at: <a title="Read Beyond books" href="https://www.readbeyond.it/ebooks.html">Read Beyond books</a>.
            When reading such a book, clicking the <i>Read Aloud</i> button in the
            viewer will automatically use the embedded audio in the book to read the text
            aloud, marking the currently read sentence and showing progress. Note that
            this may not work on Linux because of issues with patented codecs, but works on
            Windows and macOS.
            </p>

            <p><a title="Read aloud playing embedded audio" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/audio-epub.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/audio-epub-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>
            </p>
        </div>

    </li>

    <li>
        <span>Store extra data files associated with any book</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            A long requested feature in calibre, was the ability to store "data" files associated with a book
            and have calibre manage them automatically. This is finally available. Extra data files can be
            added to a book by selecting the book, right clicking the <i>Add books</i> button and choosing
            <i>Add data files to selected book records</i>. You can also manage the data files by right clicking
            the <i>Edit metadata</i> button and choosing <i>Manage data files</i>. The data files are simple
            files stored in the <code>data</code> sub-folder inside the book's folder. A common use for such
            files is storing alternate covers or supplementary material associated with the book.
            </p>

            <p><a title="Managing data files" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/data-files.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/data-files-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>

        </div>
    </li>


    <li>
        <span>calibre's own private Recycle Bin</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre now has its own private Recycle Bin instead of using the
            operating system one. This means that it is now possible undo the
            deletion of a book with a single click, restoring all its files and
            metadata automatically. Indeed when you delete a book calibre will
            show an unobtrusive popup offering to undo the deletion for a few
            seconds. You can also browse recently deleted books by right
            clicking the <i>Remove books</i> button and choosing <i>Restore
            recently deleted</i>.
            </p>

            <p><a title="Restoring recently deleted books" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/undo-delete.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/undo-delete-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>
            </p>

        </div>
    </li>

</ul>

<hr>

<p>This is an appropriate time to throw out a big thank you to the calibre
community who have contributed selflessly of their energy and enthusiasm —
without which many of the features above would never have seen the light of
day.</p>

<p>Note that some of these features were actually introduced during the
lifetime of the 6.x series. This document describes new features as compared
to 6.0</p>

<p>Congress has recently proposed multiple bills to regulate the internet (such as the recent “Kids Online Safety Act”), in the name of protecting children. This has caused a simple response: “Just have parents be parents and set up parental controls if they care.”</p>



<p>That’s simpler said than done. Parental controls right now <em>completely suck</em> by being incomplete, full of loopholes, extremely buggy, overly complicated, poorly designed, privacy invading, or a combination of the above. As someone who has used almost every ecosystem, here’s an eye opener. </p>



<p>Also here’s my rallying cry: If you don’t want Congress regulating the internet to “protect the Kids,” demand companies fix their parental controls. </p>



<p><strong>Windows 11</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft has <em>Family Safety</em> as their tool for parental controls on Windows. Here’s my hate list.</p>



<ol>
<li>Every child must have a Microsoft Account to use it. Even the 8-year-olds. Local accounts are still supported by Windows 11 after setting up the main account, but you can’t use parental controls with them. </li>



<li>You can’t disable Windows Copilot, or Edge Copilot. Don’t want your kid using AI from Bing or ChatGPT when they are just learning to write? Too bad. Don’t want them using AI for any host of ethical or personal issues? Too bad. </li>



<li>You can’t disable the Microsoft News feed of tabloid content on new Microsoft Edge tabs, without disabling Bing (rendering you unable to offer restricted “SafeSearch” browsing of any kind, to your child, at all). </li>



<li>You can’t disable the Microsoft Search button, which shows… surprise, more tabloid content. Even if you have your child’s account set to “allowed websites only.” They’ll still see headlines of the day about how the world is on fire.</li>



<li>You can’t disable the Widgets button. The entire purpose of widgets is to serve tabloid content. And once again, “allowed websites only” doesn’t disable that or do basically anything to it. </li>



<li>Windows 11 comes preloaded with Movies+TV, Xbox, Microsoft News, and other apps. Unless you as a parent <em>know</em> about these apps, open these apps individually so they appear in the dashboard, and <em>then</em> block these apps, they’re allowed. <em>What?</em></li>



<li>You can’t disable the Microsoft Store. You can set age restrictions; so setting everything to block all apps rated above the Age of 3 is the best you’ll be able to do. </li>



<li>Microsoft Office lets you embed content from Bing, and does not respect system parental controls… at all. Even if you block Bing, your 8-year-old can still watch videos to their heart’s content by embedding them in a Word document, because the internet filters <em>only work in Microsoft Edge</em>.</li>
</ol>



<p>So let’s say you want to allow your 8-year-old to work on school, on a Windows PC. What’s the point of parental controls when you can’t disable Widgets, can’t disable the tabloid content in the Search box even if you block Bing, the Bing filter can still be bypassed using Office, and your student can use AI all they want? These are “parental controls”?</p>



<p><strong>MacOS / iOS</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Quite powerful, stupidly buggy. So much so that Apple even admitted as such to a reporter a few months ago. There is, in my experience, no part of macOS more buggy than Screen Time. How so? </li>



<li> It appears that Screen Time runs using a daemon (background process) on the child’s account. That daemon has a propensity to randomly crash after running for a few hours. When it does, <em>all locks are disabled. </em>Safari will just let you open Private windows without filtering of any kind, regardless of your internet filtering settings, when that happens. This state then remains until the child logs out and logs back in. Naturally, <em>what’s the point of parental controls that randomly fail open?</em></li>



<li>The “allowed websites only” option shows Apple has never used this feature, ever. You will be swarmed on your first login with prompts to approve random IP addresses and Apple domains because of system services that can no longer communicate with the mother ship. And they will nag you <em>constantly</em> with no option to disable them, so your first experience of enabling this is entering your PIN code a dozen or more time to approve all sorts of random junk just to get to a usable state. </li>



<li>The “allow this website” button on the “website blocked” page randomly doesn’t work; and this might be because the codebase is so old (and likely untested for so long), <em>it’s not even HTML5</em>. Meaning it’s probably been, what, a decade and a half since anyone really looked at it last?</li>



<li>You can’t disable any in-box system apps. You don’t want your kid reading through the Apple Books store? You don’t want your kid seeing suggestive imagery and nudity in the Apple Music app? You don’t want your kid listening to random Podcasts from anyone in the Apple Podcasts app? You can’t do anything about it but set a time limit for 1 minute. Of course, that time limit randomly doesn’t work either.</li>



<li>The “allowed websites” list in macOS has a comical, elementary bug showing how badly tested the code is. If you open the preference pane, it shows a list of allowed websites (say, A, B, and C). Let’s say I add a website called D, and close it. I open the preference pane again – only A, B, and C are in the list, D nowhere to be seen! However, D <em>was</em> added to the system, but it’s not in the list. If I go add E (so the list is now A, B, C, and E); D will then be <em>removed</em> and opening the preference pane will one again just show A, B, and C.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch</strong></p>



<p>I generally like Nintendo, but the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls are inexcusable.</p>



<ol>
<li>Every parental control is per-device. What about families that have, say, multiple children and can’t afford (or don’t want the risk) of having multiple Switches? Seems reasonable, but no, every Switch is personal to the owner if you use Parental Controls.</li>



<li>Let’s say you then go, fine, and buy multiple Switches. There’s no ability to set a PIN lock; so theoretically the kids could just… swipe the other’s Switch?</li>



<li>You can’t hide titles on the menu. Let’s say you have two kids on the same Switch. One plays M-rated titles, the other plays E-rated titles. The kid who plays E-rated titles will see all the M-rated titles on the Home Screen, and nothing can be done about it. They can even <em>launch them and play them</em>. </li>



<li>You can’t disable the eShop from within the Parental Controls app. You can dig through the eShop settings to find the option to require a password before signing in, but that requires the kid to not know their own Nintendo password. If your kid uses, say, their actual email address on their Nintendo account, locking down the eShop is impossible – and they’ll see every game for sale regardless of how appropriate or inappropriate it is (<em>Hentai Girls</em>, <em>Waifu Uncovered</em>, anyone? Games you can “play with one hand”? Actual titles on the eShop). </li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Router based filtering</strong></p>



<p>One of the best solutions. Unfortunately, </p>



<ol>
<li>Every child must have their own device (again, poor families need not apply, making this very financially uninclusive solution).</li>



<li>Often, technically overwhelming for parents. What IP address is that kid’s laptop again? </li>



<li>Premium routers like Eero, which have very easy to use router-based parental controls, often demand subscriptions to use them. In the case of Eero, $9.99/mo. after you already paid ~$200 for the devices. That’s not a viable solution – I can’t tell a poor family to pay $200+ for routers <em>and </em>a $9.99/mo. subscription as their solution.</li>



<li>Some routers have parental controls that make me wonder what idiot thought this would work. Case in point – a Netgear router from a few years ago that let me “block websites” and had “parental controls” right on the box. Cool – but they worked by letting a parent individually enter, domain by domain, websites to block. Considering the internet’s scale, that’s criminally useless and if I had a lawyer, I would’ve sued for false advertising.</li>



<li>Remember the Nintendo eShop? Try using router-based parental controls to block eShop access without blocking software updates or online play. Good luck with that. Router-based blocking has the least nuance of any of the above solutions. </li>
</ol>



<p>But sure. It’s the parent’s job to set up parental controls. My response is, once again, if you don’t want Congress regulating the internet, parents need better tools than these. </p>

<div>
<p><a href="https://www.lmax.com/">LMAX</a> aims to be the fastest trading platform in the world.
Clearly, in order to achieve this we needed to do something special to achieve very low-latency and high-throughput with our Java platform.
Performance testing showed that using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency, so we focused on optimising this area.</p>
<p>The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing.
We found that cache misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical sympathy" for the hardware it’s running on, and that’s lock-free.</p>
<p>This is not a specialist solution, it’s not designed to work only for a financial application.
The Disruptor is a general-purpose mechanism for solving a difficult problem in concurrent programming.</p>
<p>It works in a different way to more conventional approaches, so you use it a little differently than you might be used to.
For example, applying the pattern to your system is not as simple as replacing all your queues with the <a href="https://trishagee.com/2011/06/22/dissecting_the_disruptor_whats_so_special_about_a_ring_buffer/">magic ring buffer</a>.

    <p>Hello yuz-ers! This past month, we got a plethora of GPU fixes, support for new applets, a lot of work poured into the Android builds, some interesting news of the future, and more. Let’s get to it!</p>
<h2 id="wowie-zowie">Wowie Zowie!</h2>
<p>A new Mario game! And it’s an excellent one at that.
<code>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</code> joins the fray of side-scrolling Mario games and refines the genre’s gameplay with its new and <em>wonderful</em> levels.</p>

<div>
        
            <p><a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-oct-2023/wonder1.png" title=" Such a pretty game (Super Mario Bros. Wonder)">

    </div>

<p>The game didn’t boot at release due to incorrect used memory reporting in the kernel.
Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/liamwhite">byte[]</a> quickly found the culprit. It was a <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11825" data-gh-pr="11825">single-line change!</a>
</p>

<div>
        
            <p><a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-oct-2023/wonder2.png" title=" Hope your platforming skills are up to par (Super Mario Bros. Wonder)">

Wonder)"></a></p><p> Hope your platforming skills are up to par (Super Mario Bros. Wonder)</p>
        
    </div>

<p>However, this wasn’t enough to get the game in a playable state.
Depending on where you are in the game, <code>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</code> internally switches between double and triple buffered VSync presentation modes.
This causes the number of images it has available for presentation to frequently change.</p>
<p>yuzu wasn’t ready for this due to a misunderstanding of how nvnflinger works.
On Android, SurfaceFlinger (the OG Flinger) can free buffers that are beyond the maximum count a program has allocated, but nvnflinger (the Switch’s fork) is never supposed to free any buffers unless the program requests it.
Maide made a <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11827" data-gh-pr="11827">few presentation code changes</a>
 to support this behaviour, and players are now set to grab those fun Wonder Flowers!</p>

<p>Classic Mario (Super Mario Bros. Wonder)</p>


<p>I bet you didn’t expect to see the sole input change of the month here ― yet here we are.
<code>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</code> <em>loves</em> vibration, to a point of saturating the old implementation when using HD Rumble on Nintendo controllers (Joy-Cons, Pro Controllers).
This is because waiting for the controller to reply takes time, more than the game would have the patience for, leading to noticeable and bothersome vibration stuttering. That’s right, ASTC, you’re not the only one in town causing stutters.
By <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11852" data-gh-pr="11852">making vibration calls asynchronous,</a>
 vibration is, while not entirely solved, now <em>much</em> more pleasant.</p>
<h2 id="the-gpu-changes">The GPU changes</h2>
<p>Undefined behaviour: the formal way to say “here be dragons”.
It’s a good practice to avoid dragons ― I mean, undefined behaviour ― in your code, especially when dealing with a complex graphics API like Vulkan.</p>
<p>Remember our explanation of <code>depth stencils</code> <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-aug-2023/#more-gpu-changes">back in August</a>? You may wish to reread that, as it provides useful context to what we will talk about next.</p>
<p>When a game is using a depth buffer, it is usually drawing into a busy 3D scene while taking advantage of a hardware-accelerated process called depth testing.</p>
<p>During depth testing, the GPU hardware determines if a pixel is visible or hidden (occluded) by another pixel. This is decided by their depth values.
The depth buffer tracks how far away each stored pixel is from the camera.
If a rendered pixel is further away than what has already been drawn on the scene, then the pixel is discarded; if it is closer, then it is kept and the colour buffers are updated.
Typically, the depth buffer is also updated and written to, in this case, to store the depth of the new, closer object.</p>
<p>It is possible for a game to use depth testing alone, and turn the actual writes to the depth buffer off for specific elements, and many games do this when rendering partially transparent objects.
However, the opposite is not allowed by graphics APIs like Vulkan ― hardware designs require depth testing to be enabled in order update the depth buffer.
yuzu’s masked clear path for depth/stencil buffers has a shader which updates the depth buffer, and so enables depth writes, but forgot to also enable depth tests.
Most of the time, this worked by coincidence, as the game was enabling depth tests and yuzu was not clearing this state.
However, not all games enabled them, and without depth tests, games like <code>Super Mario 64</code>, part of <code>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</code>, can’t properly render the face of a certain character (I <em>think</em> his name is in the title of the game.)</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11630" data-gh-pr="11630">the work done</a>
 by <a href="https://github.com/Kelebek1">Maide</a>, Mr. Mario Mario renders correctly now.</p>
<p>Not stopping there, Maide’s dragon-hunting continued for another pull request.
One advantage of using the standard Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA for short) is how it can help sanitise code.</p>
<p>VMA will raise asserts if things are wrong somewhere.
In this case, we were accidentally marking a device-local buffer we intend to use exclusively in VRAM as CPU mapped.
VMA is very clear here: device local buffers should not be allocated as mapped because they are outright <em>not</em> intended for CPU access.
Making it happy <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11734" data-gh-pr="11734">has soothed another dragon.</a>
</p>
<p>Thanks to users’ reports, <a href="https://github.com/FernandoS27">Blinkhawk</a> managed to figure out why the new query cache was leaking memory in many games, including <code>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</code>.
After <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11646" data-gh-pr="11646">some slight tweaking,</a>
 RAM consumption is put in its place.</p>
<p>Starting a campaign to combat holes in yuzu’s format support, <a href="https://github.com/Squall-Leonhart">Squall-Leonhart</a> has been working on implementing some of the more obscure format conversions, like  <code>D32_SFLOAT</code>.
For this particular depth format on Vulkan, it can <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11677" data-gh-pr="11677">now be converted</a>
 to <code>ABGR8_UNORM</code> when the game needs this behaviour.
Combined with <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11716" data-gh-pr="11716">adding support for</a>
 the <code>Z32</code>, <code>FLOAT</code>, <code>UINT</code>, <code>UINT</code>, <code>UINT</code>, <code>LINEAR</code> variants in the internal format table, this work solves rendering issues in games like <code>Disney Speedstorm</code> and <code>Titan Glory</code>.</p>

    </p>
</div>


<p>Look, the most powerful mouse in the world (Disney Speedstorm)</p>


<p>Some games also make aliases of images in the D32 depth format.
Since a similar limitation with format conversion was present here too, <code>ARGB8_SRGB</code> and <code>BGRA8_UNORM</code>/<code>BGRA8_SRGB</code> <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11795" data-gh-pr="11795">can now be converted to</a>
 <code>D32_SFLOAT</code> to provide proper compatibility.</p>

    </div>

<p>Continuing with this streak, Maide <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11688" data-gh-pr="11688">implemented</a>
 the <code>X8_D24</code> depth format, allowing <code>A Sound Plan</code> to start rendering.
However, more work is needed to make this game properly playable.</p>
<p>Robustness is a feature Vulkan provides that lets developers handle invalid memory accesses in a cleanly defined way.
This can help prevent the application from crashing or <del>summoning dragons</del> invoking undefined behaviour when some part of the code tries to access memory out of bounds.</p>
<p>For some reason, either Maxwell and Pascal NVIDIA GPUs have broken robustness support on uniform buffers, or yuzu’s codebase makes a wrong assumption somewhere (most likely the latter). As a result, those two NVIDIA GPU generations (GTX 750/GTX 900/GTX 1000 series) suffer from oversized graphics on <code>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</code>, due to the game accessing memory out of bounds in the shader.
<a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11789" data-gh-pr="11789">Manually clamping out-of-bounds buffer reads to 0</a>
 on the affected GPU architectures solves the issues. We are also now investigating what causes this problem in the first place.
Maide gets to play detective yet again, dear Watson.</p>

<p>Maide also fixed a hidden issue with the resolution scaler.
Images were being <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11744" data-gh-pr="11744">marked as rescaled,</a>
 even if the resolution scaler was not in use (running at 1x).
This led to a slight additional overhead, and rarely, some assertion failures.
While no game bug was known to be caused by this, it’s good to have preemptive fixes for once instead of just reactionary ones.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Maide has also been removing image alias bits for all image attachments in an effort to allow the drivers to use more memory optimizations.

<p>And now, one for the Linux gang.
<a href="https://github.com/v1993">v1993</a> tested and <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11786" data-gh-pr="11786">re-enabled CUDA video decoding</a>
 on Linux, allowing better video decoding performance for NVIDIA users (running the proprietary driver, of course).
We previously disabled CUDA by default because it can fail on systems running both a dedicated NVIDIA GPU and a dedicated AMD GPU (iGPUs are fine), a decently rare configuration that only a few people, like your writer, actually ever use.</p>
<p>For those few users running mixed hardware vendors on your systems, please manually  select “CPU Video Decoding” if you’re affected by video decoding issues now.
This was the previous default behaviour.</p>
<p>We received user reports of crashes occurring when grabbing a Grand Star in <code>Super Mario Galaxy</code>, as part of <code>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</code>.
byte[] found that the problem is in how the Vulkan scheduler incorrectly flushes data.
The solution? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNgNBsCI4EA">Use a lock</a>.
And if that doesn’t work, <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11806" data-gh-pr="11806">use more locks.</a>

Happy star hunting!</p>
<p>To improve OpenGL support even further, <a href="https://github.com/ameerj">Epicboy</a> returns.
First, he found that the <code>shfl_in_bounds</code> variable, which is used to track data used in compute shaders, could result in undefined behaviour when threads were inactive and return invalid results.
<a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11847" data-gh-pr="11847">The solution</a>
 was to move the <code>shfl_in_bounds</code> check after the <code>readInvocationARB</code> function, which requires all threads to be active, to avoid <del>dragons</del> undefined behaviour.
This fixed some graphical corruption issues in unit tests, which should lead to fixes in real games too.</p>
<p>Next, a simple gift from epicboy: <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11904" data-gh-pr="11904">force enabling</a>
 <code>Threaded optimization</code>, an NVIDIA-specific OpenGL optimization that enables the use of a new separate CPU thread for graphics rendering.
This is a solid performance boost for those running OpenGL with NVIDIA hardware.
And for those asking, yes, Vulkan allows the use of a separate thread for rendering too ― but we do it on an API level, instead of a driver setting, so all GPUs can benefit.</p>
<p>Maide found a problem occurring with compute shaders when they were triggering invalidations in the buffer cache.
yuzu has a lot of code to track the sizes of buffers used by the games.
Consider a game using two buffers: the first, with an address range from 1 to 2, and another with a range of 3 to 5. They don’t overlap, so there is no issue.
Then, after the game runs for a while, a buffer requiring a range of 1 to 5 is used.
The previous two buffers would be considered to overlap it and will be deleted.
Then, the old buffer data from the two overlaps gets moved to the new third buffer.
While this was already working for graphics-related buffers, it didn’t correctly consider compute buffers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11859" data-gh-pr="11859">Adding the missing loop</a>
 to fix this behaviour, problems ranging from minimal graphical issues to completely broken game logic are potentially solved.
You know what they say: with compute, the sky’s the limit. Just ask AI developers.</p>
<p>Another optimization Maide implemented affects how buffers are handled after they are successfully deleted.
The previous method would unnecessarily create several copies, wasting resources.
By <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11683" data-gh-pr="11683">removing one synchronisation step,</a>
 only the exact amount of needed copies are used.</p>
<p>Now let’s discuss a long-standing issue: some 2D games were flipped on AMD, Intel, and Android GPUs.
Games can use different APIs to run on the Switch.
Nintendo allows the use of Vulkan, OpenGL, and their proprietary API, NVN.
This poses a problem for emulation on Vulkan, since <a href="https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listdevicescoverage.php?extension=VK_NV_viewport_swizzle&amp;platform=all">only NVIDIA GPUs</a> support the viewport swizzle extension (which allows for transforming viewports).</p>
<p>To allow other GPU vendors to render properly in most cases, a fallback implementation was made to handle the case of vertical flips, for use by OpenGL games.
A tiny error in its implementation made it unable to correctly track invalidations of the viewport flip state, resulting in garbled graphics in several games.
byte[] <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11893" data-gh-pr="11893">solved</a>
 that issue with a one-line change, making games like <code>Stardew Valley</code>, and <code>Streets of Rage 4</code>, finally render properly on non-NVIDIA hardware.
No more mirrors needed!</p>

<p>While investigating this, a similar but different issue came to light.
Many OpenGL games (that is, games using OpenGL to render, not yuzu rendering on OpenGL) ask for a 1920x1080 framebuffer, regardless of whether the game is running in handheld or docked mode.
The game then simply moves and resizes the region it’s rendering to inside that 1920x1080 buffer, like moving a small box inside a bigger box, if you will.
In the final step, the image is flipped and sent to the bottom of that 1080p render target.
yuzu was incorrectly rendering only the top of the render target due to how it used to calculate that flip in the final pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11894" data-gh-pr="11894">Adjusting</a>
 this behaviour made <code>Tiny Thor</code> render correctly in handheld mode.</p>

<p>And to close the graphics section, by following this chain of events, the previous pull request helped spot a bug in our Vulkan presentation that led to <code>Arcaea</code> being incorrectly cropped in handheld mode.

<h2 id="android-changes">Android changes</h2>
<p>This month the Android build got not only significant UI changes to improve quality of life, but device compatibility was greatly improved for Adreno users.
Here’s the full list!</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11649" data-gh-pr="11649">GPU driver manager</a>
 was developed by <a href="https://github.com/t895">t895</a>, allowing the listing of multiple drivers, useful for quickly switching between proprietary Qualcomm or Mesa Turnip releases, or several versions of each. Due to the beta status of Turnip drivers and the immature code of Qualcomm drivers, the latest release is not always the best.</li>

<li>byte[] solved a <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11656" data-gh-pr="11656">crash related to surface recreation,</a>
 which could be triggered by simply rotating the device.</li>
<li>byte[] solved an issue affecting some Android devices that ship an <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11876" data-gh-pr="11876">outdated Vulkan 1.1 loader</a>
 instead of the current latest 1.3, causing the device to report older features than the driver in use actually supports. This resulted in specific Adreno 600 and 700 devices crashing at boot when using any Mesa Turnip driver version. Forcing the correct Vulkan 1.3 features the driver supports solves the issue. We’ll expand on this at the end of the article.</li>
<li>t895 implemented a <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11909" data-gh-pr="11909">home settings menu grid</a>
 for devices with bigger screens and/or higher DPIs. This should please our tablet and foldable users. Enjoy!</li>

<li>byte[] <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11910" data-gh-pr="11910">fixed another case</a>
 where yuzu would fail to recreate the surface on screen rotations.</li>
<li>t895 moved the <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11915" data-gh-pr="11915">game list loading process to a separate thread</a>
 to reduce stuttering when opening yuzu. The process still takes a similar amount of time, but the perceived smoothness is very welcome.</li>
<li>t895 solved an issue that caused the <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11916" data-gh-pr="11916">touch buttons overlay to get stuck</a>
 while drawing the in-game menu from the left side.</li>
<li>While waiting for a controller settings menu, t895 fixed a bug that caused <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11925" data-gh-pr="11925">all controller input to move to player 2</a>
 on some devices, blocking users from playing most games. Devices with integrated controllers should have a much better experience now.</li>
<li>And finally, following the <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-sep-2023/#of-miis-and-applets">recent changes</a> in the desktop version, t895 added a <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11931" data-gh-pr="11931">menu to access the currently supported applets,</a>
 Album and Mii editor, along with the Cabinet applet to manage amiibo data. Wii think you will have fun!</li>

<p>One of the changes german77 introduced broke the <code>Find Mii</code> stage in <code>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</code>.
Since it’s not a popular stage, even among the Smash community, we didn’t notice this issue, and no one reported in our <a href="https://discord.gg/u77vRWY">Discord server</a>, <a href="https://community.citra-emu.org/c/yuzu-support/14">forums</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/issues/new/choose">GitHub bug report page</a> ― we only found out thanks to complaints on Reddit. This is a reminder to you, the users, please try to report issues in the proper channels! Doing so ensures we see the problems you are having and can work to fix them.</p>
<p>yuzu is a large project with many “black box” areas. There will be bugs, many thousands of bugs, that our team may never encounter. Your voice is so important, we hate to see any bug reports slip through the cracks outside of our channels.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, by <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11822" data-gh-pr="11822">creating random Miis</a>
 with names, german77 solved the issue.</p>
<p>german77 also <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11846" data-gh-pr="11846">expanded the character limit of cheats</a>
 to more than 64 characters.
Now you can cheat to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>You know our developers spend a lot of time opening and closing yuzu when byte[] can accurately measure that 10% of shutdown crashes are caused by the game list.
He found that the issue was in how Qt deals with messages from objects that were destroyed or disconnected (like stopping the emulator while the game list is loading).
By <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11846" data-gh-pr="11846">changing the behaviour</a>
 of how the game list is reported to those events, another source of shutdown crashes has been defeated.</p>
<h2 id="kernel-cpu-and-file-system-changes">Kernel, CPU, and file system changes</h2>
<p>byte[] has been having a lot of “fun” lately fixing and implementing kernel changes.
First off, he <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11686" data-gh-pr="11686">fully implemented transfer memory,</a>
 fixed <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11766" data-gh-pr="11766">incorrect page group tracking,</a>
 <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11914" data-gh-pr="11914">updated the implementation</a>
 of KPageTableBase, and has now <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11843" data-gh-pr="11843">nearly completed</a>
 the entire KProcess implementation!</p>
<p>As preliminary work for NCE support coming in the near future, byte[] implemented <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11718" data-gh-pr="11718">native clock support</a>
 for arm64 devices running on Linux or Android.
There is no support for ARM Windows devices for now, as none have bothered to include a Vulkan driver yet.</p>
<p>The kernel was updated to reflect changes made in <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11748" data-gh-pr="11748">firmware version 17.0.0,</a>
 ensuring support for future games.</p>
<p>v1993 <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11772" data-gh-pr="11772">solved some warnings</a>
 that were spamming our build logs ― namely, using <code>std::forward</code> where appropriate, and qualifying <code>std::move</code> calls.
This should solve build issues for those experimenting with Darwin build targets.</p>
<p>By user request, byte[] <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11774" data-gh-pr="11774">further improved the build performance of RomFS mods</a>
 by getting rid of some unnecessary object copies.
This also fixed a file handle leak, which now allows modders to edit mod files after stopping emulation, helping them work faster on those <em>juicy and delicious</em> game mods.</p>
<h2 id="audio-changes">Audio changes</h2>
<p>Thanks to user reports, our audio connoisseur, Maide, found that <code>Ancient Rush 2</code> would crash at the end of the first developers screen.
<a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11735" data-gh-pr="11735">Clearing the DSP buffer</a>
 after each execution fixes the issue.</p>

<p>Speaking of audio, byte[] delivered another resounding victory in the shutdown department by <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11778" data-gh-pr="11778">fixing a deadlock</a>
 in the audio renderer.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-section">Hardware section</h2>
<p>We have some sad news for the old Red Team guard, a warning for the Green Team, and very good news for Adreno droids.</p>
<h3 id="nvidia-our-fault-this-time">NVIDIA, our fault this time</h3>
<p>The 545 and 546 series of drivers have solved the high VRAM usage crashes we reported this last month, but users are reporting new crashes in games with these drivers.
Reverting to the 53X series of drivers solves the problem, but this time, it’s not NVIDIA’s fault!
Mesa also has many new crashes with the 24.0.0 release, and having the top two drivers crashing under the same conditions is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>We found that the problem is in how we are recompiling shaders ― the types of some variables are mismatched.
The fix will take some time to implement, so for NVIDIA and Mesa users experiencing crashes in games like <code>Bayonetta 3</code>, we suggest not updating your drivers for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="amd-giving-a-last-hurrah-to-polaris-and-vega">AMD, giving a last hurrah to Polaris and Vega</h3>
<p>The time has come. The last 2 remnants of the GCN architecture are on their way to be discontinued.
AMD started releasing <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21126/amd-reduces-ongoing-driver-support-for-polaris-and-vega-gpus">split drivers</a> for those products, which run outdated Vulkan driver branches compared to RDNA and newer hardware.
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-24.0-Faster-RADV-Vega">The news</a> of AMDVLK, the official Linux AMD driver, killing support for these products means no new Vulkan drivers will be available.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean the show is over for their owners.
For the time being, no new change breaks compatibility with the cards, and Linux Mesa drivers like RADV will continue to provide support, most likely extending it past what the Windows drivers report as supported (as is usually the case with Mesa).</p>
<p>But for those stuck on Windows, this is the last ride.</p>
<p>GCN4.0, GCN5.0, you weren’t the most efficient cards, but you gave us good value in the worst moments, <em>years</em> of amazing gameplay, and great FineWine moments.
We salute you and thank you for your impeccable service, few GPU architectures leave the stage with such a round of applause.</p>
<p>o7</p>
<h3 id="turnip-a-very-quickly-improving-work-in-progress">Turnip, a very quickly improving work-in-progress</h3>
<p>yuzu uses a single codebase for all its releases, upstream/master/main, however you prefer to call it, Mainline, Early Access, and Android all start from there.
When improvements to the codebase are added, they eventually reach all releases, Android included.</p>
<p>We recently added improved support for <code>occlusion queries</code> (part of project Y.F.C.) to Android to increase performance and accuracy on all devices. But occlusion query support on Turnip drivers with Adreno 725 and 730 GPUs was not working correctly, and this took us a very long time to find.
Users experienced crashes that forced them to remain on outdated <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu-android/releases/">GitHub</a> versions, and we needed to stall a new Play Store release until the problem was investigated and properly solved.</p>
<p>The issue was found, reported, and resolved by Mesa in record time in their current Adreno 700 branches, which then driver packagers like <a href="https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers/releases">K11MCH1</a> use to build packages Qualcomm users can load on emulators.</p>
<p>For this reason we <em>strongly</em> recommend Adreno 730 and Adreno 725 users to update to the latest <a href="https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers/releases/tag/24.0.0-R-X">Release X</a> driver, which not only fixes the crashes caused by occlusion queries, but also the lack of support for the Adreno 725 and some variants (yes, there are several) of the Adreno 730.
It isn’t only desktop GPU vendors who love to rename things.</p>
<p>By using this driver, we were able to launch newer Android builds with the latest upstream changes, and all Qualcomm users can safely use the latest GitHub builds if they prefer.</p>
<p>By the way, the GitHub builds are now properly signed. Rejoice, as you can now update from one to the next without needing to uninstall first.
If you want to test experimental and potentially unsafe (but maybe faster) changes before Play Store updates, it’s now much easier.</p>
<h2 id="future-projects">Future projects</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with what most people want to hear about: Project Nice for Android devices.
NCE (Native Code Execution) is progressing very well, but there are still some bugs to iron out.
Games are becoming not only playable, but also <em>faster</em> on devices with thermal restrictions. Additionally, the time spent loading and closing games has been significantly reduced now!
NCE has helped us understand issues in our CPU emulation in x86_64 too, so expect gains on both fronts.</p>

<p>Blinkhawk is <em>suggesting</em> that your writer informs you he is working on a new project seeking to make the GPU process-agnostic, allowing multiprocess emulation within the GPU.
No fancy names this time, we’ve simply been calling this “Multiprocess” internally.
Multiprocess is a mandatory step towards UMA support, which will provide huge gains for iGPUs and SoC users, as well as reducing RAM consumption.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! Apologies for the delay, university homework and finals are killing your writer.
Thank you for reading until the end. See you next time!</p>

<h2 id="0-how-i-came-up-with-the-idea">How I came up with the idea.</h2>







<p><br>Yes, I know that the mouse is quite questionable in terms of convenience, but the main driver of my idea was these two clips.</p>



<p>Some time ago, I saw this video and immediately thought of what I needed to do to solve the author’s problem:</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="I fixed Apple's biggest design flaw..sort of." width="1778" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gzipeeQR2l0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>A year later, I saw this video and decided my time had come:</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="I Tried Building the ULTIMATE Magic Mouse" width="1778" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3lNrRydr4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<h2 id="1-the-idea">The idea</h2>



<p>It became obvious to me that I should just charge the battery and do not to connect mouse schematics, well as it turns out it worked. Not without some interesting findings, though.</p>



<p>To make it ergonomic and prevent problems with the sensor (which is not working perfectly as it is) I will have to divide the mouse into 2 halves. I was prepared to have to lengthen the cable from the top part (touch sensor), but luckily, the standard length turned out to be enough.</p>







<h2 id="2-implementation">Implementation</h2>



<p>The found models did not fit at all. I had to do it myself, and the first attempts were quite …. ugly, what can I say?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="850" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=1024%2C850&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=1024%2C850&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=300%2C249&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=768%2C637&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?w=1465&amp;ssl=1 1465w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>Moreover, all the Magic Mouse 3d models I’ve found aren’t perfect either. So, I adjusted the shape of the enclosure step by step, just by eye. It’s a concept, after all 🙂<br>Create-&gt; print -&gt; Adjust -&gt; print -&gt; Adjust -&gt; print -&gt; etc…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PXL_20231116_1718401852.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PXL_20231116_1718401852-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PXL_20231116_1718401852-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PXL_20231116_1718401852-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PXL_20231116_1718401852-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1157&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PXL_20231116_1718401852-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1542&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>A last, but probably not the final option. After all, there is no limit to perfection. But if I were to perfect it, I’m afraid the project would never see the light of day</p>

<p>In the photo, you can notice a frame-adapter for the upper part of the mouse. It was made in only four iterations</p>

<p>Its task is essentially to repeat and extend the original mount (which, by the way, is quite difficult to disassemble without breaking anything off).<br>There is also a place for a spring (a long metal part near the button) and an offset lever that presses the button.</p>

<p>I was so confident of success that I didn’t even bother to see if the charging idea would work.<br>Better late than never. The labeling on the battery is not standard (3.61V), but according to the tests, it is a normal one cell that can be charged to 4.2V, which is defined as 100% in the OS.</p>

<p>When I charge the battery using my BMC (TP4056) the mouse is not aware that it is in the process of charging.<br>The TP4056 raises the voltage to ~4.258V when the charge is complete. And then shuts down, and the battery stays at ~4.2V.</p>



<p>So here’s the finding:<br>If we monitor the percentage of charge in the OS, we see <strong>100%</strong> at 4.15, and then the wonders begin.<br>At ~4.17V, the percentage drops to <strong>99%</strong>.<br>~4.19V – <strong>98%</strong><br>~4.21V – <strong>97%</strong><br>~4.24V – <strong>96%</strong><br>After charging is finished and I restarted the mouse, the percentage is back to <strong>100%</strong>.<br>Maybe I’ve found why the mouse is magical? 🙂</p>

</div></div>


<p>Next, I soldered a regular TP4056 directly to the battery outputs. Don’t have to make it complicated. With this battery capacity, it will do the job just fine, there is no need for additional current limiters. Just in case, I monitored the temperature while charging, and everything seemed to be working great.</p>

<p>People say you have to be very careful when working with batteries!<br>Do not overheat, open, or short-circuit them.</p>



<p>Wear goggles and have fire extinguishers handy. Trained professionals perform these stunts.</p>

<h2>Assembling</h2>



<p>As in most advanced devices, I used double-sided tape to glue the battery on.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>However, double-sided tape was mostly used for assembly as well. By the way, for the first time, I tried printing on an FDM printer at 60 microns (0.06mm) resolution.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>I installed this adapter into the top of the mouse and taped it to the battery so it could be disassembled for fine-tuning. Once the exact position has been selected, it makes sense to glue it firmly in place and snap the top part into place.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Trying on</figcaption></figure>

<p>And then there’s the final view. I added high-tech hot glue (sarcasm) to secure the wires and USB-C port. If it works, why think of anything else?</p>

<p>Carefully connected the FFC cable and secured it with the native fasteners.<br>I added double-sided tape to the plastic extension adapter and simply taped it to the battery at the very end.</p>

<p>Final demo</p>

<p>That’s it.</p>



<h2>Sources</h2>



<p>repository in progress</p>



<h2>One more thing</h2>



<p>When I started working on the project, I immediately had very global plans.</p>



<p><br>Namely:</p>



<ol>
<li>Add RGB backlighting.</li>



<li>Add a Raspberry Pi RP2040 with an accelerometer to activate the backlighting.</li>



<li>Consider installing additional buttons connecting RP2040 to the Macbook with a separate BT channel or cable.</li>



<li>Install an additional battery to ensure the operation of the backlighting.</li>
</ol>



<p>Fortunately, I came to my senses in time. </p>

(I have since recorded podcasts with four other teachers at the studio and am completely unsure how to express my gratitude to Joe — honestly perhaps less words about it?) While I would be the one asking Joe questions on the podcast, he had an important question for me. With all the casual profundity of a yoga teacher, Joe asked, “<u>what is your earliest memory?</u>”<p>Without pause for an inhale I responded, “</p><u>probably a panic attack.</u>” I feel like Joe did his best asana poker face, based on projecting my own insecurities and/or the hyper-vigilant observance that comes with anxiety.<u>I began having panic attacks at a young age. I felt the impending doom of death before I had any concept of death.</u> (Do I really have any concept of death now, though? Does anyone??) I define panic attacks as feeling “too alive,” like diving off the deep end into awareness of existence without any proper scuba gear or knowledge of free diving. Panic attacks, I’ve learned, come like an ambulance flashing lights and blaring a siren indicating that my mind and my body are… experiencing a missed connection in terms of communication — they’re refusing to listen to each other. More accurately: my mind is disregarding the messages from my body, convinced she can think her way through feelings, and so my body goes into panic mode like she’s on strike."</li><li id="block97">Annie then basically proceeds to mention that "panic attack" doesn't quite feel like her first memory, but doesn't decisively settle on a "first memory." She concludes the article: "TBD on the first memory of that history. Here’s to exploring."<ol><li id="block98">This becomes relevant later on, as Annie ends up remembering an earlier memory than her panic attacks - Sam sexually assaulting her.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li id="block99"><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">Period lost, period found</a> - published Feb 21, 2019<ol><li id="block100">Annie started taking Zoloft at age 13 to help with symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression.</li><li id="block101">Annie tapered herself off of Zoloft at age 22.</li><li id="block102">Annie graduated from college with a major in Biopsychology, a minor and dance, and also completed all of the prerequisite courses for medical school.</li><li id="block103">After graduation, Annie chose not to pursue a pre-med route, opting instead to focus on movement, writing, comedy, music, and food.

Annie is "thanking" her relatives in a way that carries subliminal criticisms.&nbsp;</li><li id="block113">Example: "Thank you for strengthening my sense of self. I am where I am and doing what I’m doing in part because of each of you. My tenacity and gentleness to take care of myself has increased because of you. The lessons I’ve received from my relationships with you have shifted my perspectives beyond their limitations. Thank you for providing contrast." -- What I think Annie is referencing here is how her relatives screwed her out of her money and (esp. Sam) abused her for a very long time. To this, she had to adapt by developing better ways to take care of herself, and was also forced to move around in a state of relative financial poverty.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block114">As with the rest of the letter, Annie includes seemingly-upbeat, purposefully vague one-liners throughout the letter, such as "Thank you for providing me with contrast."

She was never going to be an <i>Übermensch. </i>She’s always been someone who felt the pain of the world. <u>At age 5, she began waking up in the middle of the night, needing to take a bath to calm her anxiety. By 6, she thought about suicide, though she didn’t know the word.</u>"</li><li id="block127">&nbsp;"When I visited Annie on Maui this summer, she told me stories that will resonate with anyone who has been the emo-artsy person in a businessy family, or who has felt profoundly hurt by experiences family members seem not to understand. Annie — her long dark hair braided, her voice low, measured, and intense — <u>told me about visiting Sam in San Francisco in 2018. He had some friends over. One of them asked Annie to sing a song she’d written. She found her ukulele. She began. “Midway through, Sam gets up wordlessly and walks upstairs to his room,”</u> she told me over a smoothie in Paia, a hippie town on Maui’s North Shore. “I’m like, <i>Do I keep playing? Is he okay? What just happened?</i>” The next day, she told him she was upset and asked him why he left. “And he was kind of like, ‘My stomach hurt,’ or ‘I was too drunk,’ or ‘too stoned, I needed to take a moment.’ And I was like, ‘Really? That moment? You couldn’t wait another 90 seconds?’” That same year, Jerry Altman died. He’d had his heart issues, along with a lot of stress, partly, Annie told me, from driving to Kansas City to nurse along his real-estate business. The Altmans’ parents had separated. Jerry kept working because he needed the money. After his death, Annie cracked. Her body fell apart. Her mental health fell apart. She’d always been the family’s pain sponge. She absorbed more than she could take now. <u>Sam offered to help her with money for a while, then he stopped. In their email and text exchanges, his love — and leverage — is clear. He wants to encourage Annie to get on her feet. He wants to encourage her to get back on Zoloft, which she’d quit under the care of a psychiatrist because she hated how it made her feel.</u> Among her various art projects, Annie makes a podcast called <i>All Humans Are Human.</i> The first Thanksgiving after their father’s death, all the brothers agreed to record an episode with her. <u>Annie wanted to talk on air about the psychological phenomenon of projection: what we put on other people. The brothers steered the conversation into the idea of feedback</u> — specifically, how to give feedback at work. After she posted the show online, Annie hoped her siblings, particularly Sam, would share it. He’d contributed to their brothers’ careers. Jack’s company, Lattice, had been through YC. <u>“I was like, ‘You could just tweet the link. That would help. You don’t want to share your sister’s podcast that you came on?’” He did not. “Jack and Sam said it didn’t align with their businesses.”</u></li><li id="block128">"In May 2020, she relocated to the Big Island of Hawaii. One day, shortly after she’d moved to a farm to do a live-work trade, she got an email from Sam <u>asking for her address.</u> He wanted to send her a memorial diamond he’d made out of some of their father’s ashes. “Picturing him sending a diamond of my dad’s ashes to the mailbox where it’s one of those rural places where there are all these open boxes for all these farms … It was so heavy and sad and angering, but it was also so hilarious and so ridiculous. So disconnected-feeling. Just the lack of fucks given.” Their father never asked to be a diamond. <u>Annie’s mental health was fragile. She worried about money for groceries.</u> It was hard to interact with somebody for whom money meant everything but also so little. “Like, either you aren’t realizing or you are not caring about this whole situation here,” she said. By “whole situation,” she meant her life.<u> “You’re willing to spend $5,000 — for each one — to make this thing that was your idea, not Dad’s, and you’re wanting to send that to me instead of sending me $300 so I can have food security. What?”</u>"</li><li id="block129">"The two are now estranged. <u>Sam offered to buy Annie a house.

I believe this because:<i>&nbsp;</i><ol><li id="block139">Sam Altman posted a link on Twitter in 2018 to Annie's YouTube channel ("Go check out my sister on Youtube!")&nbsp;</li><li id="block140">Annie did an episode for her podcast featuring her brothers Sam Altman, Jack Altman, and Max Altman in 2018.&nbsp;</li><li id="block141">There are old newspaper reports in various places around the Internet listing Annie as a sibling of Sam, Jack, and Max Altman in, for example, obituary-type webpages related to the death and funeral of their father, Jerry Altman.&nbsp;</li><li id="block142">Both Sam Altman and Annie Altman spoke personally to Elizabeth Weil of nymag for her "Sam Altman Is the Oppenheimer of Our Age" article she published in Sept. 2023.&nbsp;<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/hgtgosg2nmisod5bzwft" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/jn9vaml8znaw7n3ydggr 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/hwxtvddzrx0gkdtkguun 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/xflg8zxlzglj4v09z79h 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/tmxgucyjfzgcpkjahxdk 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/jlbdngbvbc3l0ftvrwgu 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/ntjgldwhpmhq8anbzien 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/mgvucqbi9sh7cqhuifqq 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/w8wbqu57pvd30lf6glwd 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/ctxv8ureykhdgkqpoomk 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/kzjjjmj73n8sf8bmgfif 1446w"><i>Picture is taken from </i><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><i>this article</i></a><i>.

From this, I infer he is aware of her other social media profiles, where she has made her claims about Sam.</li><li id="block145">Sam and Annie both personally interviewed Elizabeth Weil for her September 2023 nymag article. The article was published, and I infer that Sam, having consented to be interviewed for the article, knows that the article exists and has read it.</li></ol></li><li id="block146">Annie Altman has been posting consistently about being abused by Sam Altman (and Jack Altman, to a lesser extent) for about 4 years (~2019-present) across multiple social media platforms. Annie is largely self-consistent with the claims she makes over time.</li><li id="block147">In my view, Annie's claims have been paid little attention, considering the power and notoriety of the person about whom she is making them - Sam Altman - and the seriousness of the claims she has been making. Besides Elizabeth Weil's nymag article (<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">here</a>), there has been virtually <i>zero</i> (mainstream) media coverage of the extremely serious claims that Annie has consistently made many, many times against Sam Altman over the past 4 years.&nbsp;</li></ol><p id="block148"><i><span>So -- </span></i><span>since it seems like no writer or journalist on the planet, besides me, for some reason, has ever properly answered this question</span>, I'll take a swing at it:<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p id="block149"><i>What exactly has Annie Altman claimed about Sam Altman</i>?</p><h2 id="My_Personal_Understanding_Interpretation_of_Annie_s_story_and_the_chronology_of_her_life"><u>My Personal Understanding/Interpretation of Annie's story and the chronology of her life</u></h2><p id="block150">The following provides a chronology of Annie's life that I have constructed from her claims. This is <i>my understanding of her claims. </i>This is <i>not</i> me asserting that the following <i>has been proven to be true</i>, as it has not.</p><ol><li id="block151">In ~1998, when Annie is 4 years old, a 13-years-old Sam Altman non-consensually climbs into her bed (<i>implied</i>: sexually assaults Annie.) The specifics are unclear. All that Annie has stated is that Sam was something like her "first {sex work} client", that he used her to "help him figure out his sexuality", and that her brothers "touched her." (<i>implied</i>: in an inappropriate / nonconsensual way that would be classified as sexual abuse.)<ol><li id="block152">Annie, being 4 years old, does not form a concrete memory of this event that she fully understands / comprehends / accepts. That is, as she grows up and develops higher consciousness, sentience, intelligence, and self-awareness, <i>she does not remember what Sam did to her</i>, due to the fact that, when Sam sexually assaulted her (when she was 4 years old), <i>her brain was extremely young, and the event was extremely traumatic for her younger self in a way that was hard for her to even conceptualize, much less understand and remember</i>. Instead, Annie's "remembrances" of Sam's sexual assault of her manifest as extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts around the age of 5-6, and emotional and mental problems (e.g. issues with relationship with her own body, needing to take antidepressants, depression, etc.)</li></ol></li><li id="block153">Around age 5-6, Annie starts dealing with extreme anxiety and suicidal ideation. As Annie puts it, she "{tells} her birth mother about wanting to end this life thing and being touched by older siblings, and said 'mother' decided to instead protect her sons and demand to receive therapy and chores only from her female child."</li><li id="block154">As she grows up, though Annie does not have a complete memory of the sexual abuse she experienced in her early childhood, she practically embodies the dictionary definition of "symptoms common in those who have experienced sexual abuse in early childhood." Panic attacks, depression, body image problems, eating disorders, anxiety, suicidal thoughts - the list goes on.</li><li id="block155">Annie <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">starts using Zoloft at age 13</a> to help with symptoms of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), anxiety, and depression. She eventually tapers herself off of Zoloft at age 22.<ol><li id="block156">Zoloft becomes relevant again later on in Annie's chronology.</li></ol></li><li id="block157">Annie enters college. She ends up finishing college early (even though she was <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/my-denied-appeal-letter-for-early-college-graduation-dcd0ca74bca2">trying to graduate even earlier</a>, I think?). However, upon graduating, she is extremely depressed, and ends up forsaking the medical school route. Instead, she seeks out a place to live that, as <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">Elizabeth Weil writes</a>, "felt better to her. She wanted to make art." <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">In Annie's own words</a>, she "majored in Biopsychology in college, with a minor in dance, and took all the prerequisite courses for medical school. Then I noped out of the pre-med route to focus on movement, writing, comedy, music, and food. I got certified as a yoga teacher, worked for an online CSA (community-supported agriculture) company, began writing more frequently, started slowly going to open mic nights and putting videos on YouTube, and began a podcast and this blog."</li><li id="block158">At some point in 2018, Annie visits Sam in San Francisco and plays ukulele to an audience including Sam and his friends. While she is playing the ukulele, Sam abruptly, wordlessly gets up and walks upstairs to his room (as reported in the nymag article; see above.)&nbsp;<ol><li id="block159">The next day, Sam says something along the lines of "his stomach hurt" or "he was too drunk/stoned" or "he needed to take a moment." Annie finds this explanation to be odd.</li></ol></li><li id="block160"><a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/jerold-altman-7862632">In May 2018, Annie's Dad dies.</a>&nbsp;</li><li id="block161">In Aug 2018, Annie starts a podcast, the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0SKQ3vKzn2pSYXWRWwWb7J?si=d7fb748fff654cb5"><i>All Humans Are Human</i> podcast</a>.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block162">Annie experiences "6 months of hacking into all her accounts" after <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/1-we-are-all-self-conscious-with-avram-ellner/id1428943256?i=1000417931953">starting her podcast (in 2018)</a>.</li></ol></li><li id="block163">On <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/all-humans-are-human/21-podcastukkah-5-feedback-GV1w9h8mJld/">Dec 7, 2018</a>, Annie records and publishes an episode of her podcast featuring Sam Altman, Max Altman, and Jack Altman: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/09LDNc5PMBfpJUr3M02Tcp?si=VUxVTmnRTnGGqfu5Mld04w">21. Podcastukkah #5: Feedback is feedback with Sam Altman, Max Altman, and Jack Altman</a>.<ol><li id="block164">At this point in time, Annie still has not yet remembered / processed what Sam did to her at age 4. This is why she is ok with doing this podcast episode with Sam and her other brothers.</li><li id="block165">Following the recording of Annie's podcast episode with her brothers Sam, Jack, and Max in 2018, Sam (and Jack) refuse to share a link to the podcast, citing the argument that it "didn't align with their businesses" (as reported in nymag; see above.)</li></ol></li><li id="block166">In 2019, Annie gets sick with PCOS, an IBS flare-up, a long-term problem with her Achilles (not sure on the specifics), and posterior tibial tendinopathy, as well as with a bout of tonsilitis.</li><li id="block167">Also, in 2019, about a year after her Dad's death, Annie is notified about being (as stated in her Dad's will) the primary beneficiary of her Dad's 401K.</li><li id="block168">In light of these situational factors, Annie makes a plan to quit her job for 6 months to focus on her health. <i>She notifies her relatives </i>(from what I understand, primarily: Sam Altman, Jack Altman, Max Altman, and her mother) <i>of this plan.</i>&nbsp;</li><li id="block169"><span>Annie carries out her plan as intended. However,</span><i><span> </span></i><span>Sam, as well as Annie's mother and some of her other relatives, exploit a loophole that allows them to withhold the money that Annie's Dad left to her in his will.&nbsp;</span><br><span>At some point, Annie is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709977862252658703"><span>connected with one of Sam Altman's lawyers.</span></a><span> Annie is told that she will only receive money if she starts taking Zoloft again (c.f. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1708193951319306299"><span>this source</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><span>this source</span></a><span>), which she had stopped taking at age 22 (c.f. </span><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830"><span>this source</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><span>this source</span></a><span>.)&nbsp;</span></li><span></span><li id="block170">As a result, Annie basically ends up sick <i>and </i>low on money. She sells some items, returns to an older job, and, for the first time, asks her millionaire brothers/relatives for money, who proceed to haggle her about it and give her a hard time. She does "two family therapy sessions", which terminate when she is professionally advised to stop doing such sessions.</li><li id="block171">She moves back to Big Island (Hawai'i.) For some reason, Sam offers to send her a diamond of her Dad's ashes, even though 1) Annie is low on cash, and could use cash much more than an expensive Dad-ashes-diamond, and 2) Annie's Dad wanted just cremation, not diamond-ification. Annie finds this to be a very odd / insensitive gesture.</li><li id="block172">At this point, Annie has begun speaking out against Sam on social media. She has also begun "survival sex work." That is, because she was sick and broke, her options for (more conventional forms of) employment were very limited, and thus she was forced to resort to sex work to financially support herself.</li><li id="block173">In 2020, Sam offers to buy Annie a house...but there's strings attached. She has to meet with a Sam Altman lawyer. Annie sees this as an attempt by Sam to increase his control over her / suppress her (and her speaking out against him on social media.) She <i>refuses</i> his offer (which she frequently references as a "no contact" or "no family" decision.)</li><li id="block174">In 2020, Annie begins having <i>intense</i>, nearly day-long flashbacks, which last for 18 months. That is -<i> she begins to remember, and realize, that Sam Altman sexually assaulted her at age 4</i>.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block175">From what I understand, these flashbacks are a part of PTSD (relating to Sam's sexual assault of her 4-year-old self) that Annie begins to experience (she mentions PTSD specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1710039374224933175">here</a> and <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-the-emdr-trauma-therapist-who-fired-me-for-doing-sex-work-f5f537218b45">here</a>.)</li></ol></li><li id="block176">Annie seems to think (<a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709629089366348100">here</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709629659242242058">here</a>) that Sam was hoping that Annie would die or commit suicide before she could do too much damage to Sam' s reputation, carrying her knowledge to the grave.</li><li id="block177">Annie continues to speak out against Sam on social media, including through various posts on Twitter/X (c.f. the <i>Relevant excerpts from Annie's social media accounts</i> section of this post.)</li><li id="block178">In 2023, some of Annie's X posts receive newfound attention / rediscovery on X.<ol><li id="block179">One of the people who sees them first the first time is me. This leads to the writing of this post.</li></ol></li></ol><h2 id="How_to_interpret_these_claims_"><u>How to interpret these claims?</u></h2><ul><li id="block181">Annie has been making these claims for a long time, and has been self-consistent in the way she has been making them, from what I can tell.</li><li id="block182">However, Annie has not yet provided what I would consider <i><u>direct / indisputable proof</u></i> that her claims are true. Thus, rationally, I must consider Sam Altman innocent.</li><li id="block183">However, this is not to say that think Annie's claims are entirely false or implausible. Rather, I simply <i>do not know</i> whether Annie's claims are true or false.&nbsp;</li><li id="block184">Given the degree to which Annie has pursued these claims, I think one of the following is likely:<ol><li id="block185">The severe mental / psychological problems which Annie is dealing with have unfortunately caused her to misunderstand, misrepresent, disconnect (to some degree from), or selectively-filter reality into an incomplete understanding.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block186">Or, relatedly, perhaps <i>some</i> of the (less serious) things Annie has claimed (e.g. that she had problems with her phone service, had low engagement / potential shadowbanning on some of her social media accounts) did indeed occur, but she overextrapolated to a larger narrative behind these events that is innaccurate.</li></ol></li><li id="block187">Annie is indeed telling the truth, in whole or in part.</li></ol></li><li id="block188">I don't know which is true. Both are certainly <i>plausible</i> explanations.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id="Things_I_find_Questionable_Unexplained"><u>Things I find Questionable/Unexplained</u></h2><ul><li id="block190">Annie has been speaking out about Sam for roughly 4 years now. In 2021, she made her claims <i>quite </i>clear on her X account. I am confused as to why there has been basically 0 coverage of her claims in the media? In general, why is Annie so absent in anything related to Sam Altman on the Internet, especially considering the nature of her relationship with Sam?<ul><li id="block191">The sole exception here, of course, is Elizabeth Weil's nymag article, but even this article doesn't directly state the entirety of the claims that Annie has made. Instead, it kind of vaguely addresses them, using somewhat inspecific phrasing like "Now those memories feel like abuse", or "Since 2020, she has been having flashbacks" that don't quite capture the gravity of what Annie has been claiming.</li></ul></li><li id="block192">If was Sam Altman was completely fine with <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/959528971913146368?lang=en">posting a link to Annie's Youtube channel on Twitter on Feb 2, 2018</a>, why did he (and Jack Altman) refuse to post a link to the <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/all-humans-are-human/21-podcastukkah-5-feedback-GV1w9h8mJld/#google_vignette">podcast episode he filmed with Annie on Dec 7, 2018</a> <i>on the basis that it "didn't align with {his} businesses", </i><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">as Annie claimed to Elizabeth Weil</a>?<ul><li id="block193">Assuming that Sam did indeed say this - again, as I am trying to be unbiased, there is no current <i>proof </i>that he said this - I am a bit confused, as it seems a bit inconsistent to me that Sam identified Annie's Youtube channel as "aligning with his businesses", yet identified the podcast that he recorded with Annie as "not aligning with his businesses." The reason I state that this seems inconsistent is because I don't see what exactly what it was about Annie's podcast that made it "not align" with Sam's businesses <i>given</i> that Annie's Youtube channel "did align."</li></ul></li><li id="block194">Why, as some commenters on Hacker News claim, has a post regarding Annie's claims that Sam sexually assaulted her at age 4 been repeatedly removed?<ol><li id="block195"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37785072">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37785072</a></li><li id="block196"><a href="https://twitter.com/JOSourcing/status/1710390512455401888">https://twitter.com/JOSourcing/status/1710390512455401888</a></li></ol></li></ul><h2 id="Anticipating_and_Responding_to_Potential_Objections"><u>Anticipating and Responding to Potential Objections</u></h2><p id="block198">I initially hesitated to make this post, because I was initially skeptical of Annie's claims.

However, I think this behavior could be <i>plausible</i> in light of the chronology of Annie's life:&nbsp;<ul><li id="block203">A 13-year-old Sam sexually assaults a 4-year-old Annie.&nbsp;</li><li id="block204">As Annie grows older, she does not explicitly remember this event (until 2020), but experiences a multitude of severe psychological and mental traumas and illnesses stemming from this early sexual abuse (see above.)</li><li id="block205">When she begins to remember this event in 2020, it takes a severe toll on her (and she had already been dealing with many mental health issues since the age of 4 even without explicitly remembering Sam's sexual assault of her (as the source of her psychological maladies)), and weakens her ability to financially support herself.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li id="block206"><i>Objection 2</i>: "Annie hosted a podcast in 2018 with her brothers (Sam, Jack, and Max), but seems to have been unhappy that her brothers, particularly Sam, refused her request to share (the link to) her podcast (e.g. on Twitter.) This seems to potentially be part of a pattern of behavior wherein Annie tries to exploit the status of her brothers for her own gain."<ul><li id="block207"><i>My response</i>: I do think that this objection holds merit. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">In her nymag article</a>, Elizabeth Weil writes, "Among her various art projects, Annie makes a podcast called <i>All Humans Are Human.</i> The first Thanksgiving after their father’s death, all the brothers agreed to record an episode with her. Annie wanted to talk on air about the psychological phenomenon of projection: what we put on other people. The brothers steered the conversation into the idea of feedback — specifically, how to give feedback at work. After she posted the show online, Annie hoped her siblings, particularly Sam, would share it. He’d contributed to their brothers’ careers. Jack’s company, Lattice, had been through YC. “I was like, ‘You could just tweet the link. That would help. You don’t want to share your sister’s podcast that you came on?’” He did not. “Jack and Sam said it didn’t align with their businesses.”" I find this account to be <i>plausible</i>, yet do not think it entirely dispels the objection.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li id="block208"><i>Objection 3:</i> "It seems Annie has been dealing with a variety of severe mental and psychological ailments throughout her life. She also seems to smoke/drink occasionally. It may well be that these claims are borne purely out these sorts of ailments of hers (or are of some other untrustworthy origin)."<ul><li id="block209"><i>My response</i>: I think this is a valid concern to raise. As with much of the information presented here, I would be interested in hearing more from Annie.</li></ul></li><li id="block210"><i>Objection 4</i>: "While Annie's claims are concerning, and her online activity and presence across a variety of media platforms does potentially support her claims, Annie has provided no direct evidence to corroborate her claims.

Given the other circumstances this seems quite likely to be a false memory, but I am not familiar with the research on this topic.</p></div><div><div id="q9P8hZexG9S9RxKfo"><p>Remembering and imagination share the same pathways and are difficult to distinguish at the neuro circuit level.  The idea of recovered memories was already discredited decades ago after the peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_panic">satanic ritual abuse hysteria/panic</a> of the 80's.  At its peak some parents were jailed based on testimonies of children, children that had been coerced (both deliberately and indirectly) into recanting fantastical, increasingly outlandish tales of satanic baby eating rituals.  The FBI even eventually investigated and found 0 evidence, but the turning point was when some lawyers and psychiatrists started winning lawsuits against the psychologists and social workers at the center of the recovered memory movement.</p>
<p>Memories change every time they are rehearsed/reimagined; the magnitude of such change varies and can be significant, and the thin separation between imaginings (imagined memories, memories/stories of others, etc) and 'factual' memories doesn't really erode so much as not really exist in the first place.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some people's detailed memories from childhood are probably largely accurate, but some detailed childhood memories are complete confabulations based on internalization of external evidence, and some are later confabulations based on attempts to remember or recall and extensive dwelling on the past, and some are complete fiction.  No way with current tech to distinguish between, even for the rememberer.</p>
</div><div id="ejFAkp9msr2bpTFBc"><p>Bessel van der Kolk claimed the following in <i>The Body Keeps the Score:</i></p><blockquote><p>There have in fact been hundreds of scientific publications spanning well over a century documenting how the memory of trauma can be repressed, only to resurface years or decades later. Memory loss has been reported in people who have experienced natural disasters, accidents, war trauma, kidnapping, torture, concentration camps, and physical and sexual abuse. Total memory loss is most common in childhood sexual abuse, with incidence ranging from 19 percent to 38 percent. This issue is not particularly controversial: As early as 1980 the DSM-III recognized the existence of memory loss for traumatic events in the diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia: “an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.” Memory loss has been part of the criteria for PTSD since that diagnosis was first introduced.</p><p>One of the most interesting studies of repressed memory was conducted by Dr. Linda Meyer Williams, which began when she was a graduate student in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1970s</p></blockquote><p>... <span>(read more)</span></p></div><div id="PDyHgqK5aWGnWpt5W"><p>I know someone who recovered memories of repeated abuse including from the age of four later in their teenage years. The parents could corroborate a lot of circumstances around those memories, which suggests that they're likely broadly accurate. For instance, things like "they told their mother about the abuse when they were four, and the mother remembered that this conversation happened." Or "the parents spoke to the abuser and he basically admitted it." There was also suicidal ideation at around age six (similarity to Annie's story). In addition, the person remembers things like, when playing with children's toy figures (human-like animals), they would not play with these toy figures like ordinary children and instead think about plots that involve bleeding between legs and sexual assault. (This is much more detailed than Annie’s story, but remembering panic attacks as the first memory and having them as a child at least seems like evidence that she was strongly affected by something that had happened.)</p><p>Note that the person in question recovered these memories alone years before having any therapy.</p><p>It's probably easier to remember abuse (or for this to manifest itself in child beha... <span>(read more)</span></p></div><div id="bqXvsxhF9vDtxX9Ht"><p><span><div><p><span>8</span><span>Elizabeth</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>The chances she remembers it accurately? very small.

But the chances a four year old who was abused accurately remembers the abuse? also very small, because they're so young and because trauma messes with memory formation.&nbsp;

So barring psychosis it seems pretty likely to me that something happened, but that she isn't an accurate witness to specifics.&nbsp;</p></div></span></p></div><div id="WwG3zcr4FxKJtoQLm"><p><span><div><p><span>2</span><span>solomon alon</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>From my understanding it’s incredibly unlikely. There are roughly two possibilities.

 1. This a false memory implanted by her therapist.

 2. She always had the memory but only realized what it was later or only decided to act on it later.

Note often time children don’t process sexual assault as an incredibly traumatic until years later. either because a therapist brings a memory to the forefront or something happens to bring the memory to the forefront or even just learning about what sex is can cuase the memoru to be traumatic.</p></div></span></p><div id="Yd9LyDSd5RHwrdp9t"><p><span><div><p><span>4</span><span>Lukas_Gloor</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>The opposite is common, though.

Is it true that someone with psychosis (assuming your judgement is correct) making an allegation of sexual abuse is more likely to be lying/mistaken than not?&nbsp;

I.e someone with psychosis making a claim like the above is less likely than someone without psychosis to be accurately interpreting reality, but is their claim more likely to be false than not? Your argument leans heavily on her having psychosis. Do people with psychosis make more false allegations of sexual assault that true allegations?&nbsp;

Breiding et al., 2014 estimates that around 19.3% of women in the US have been sexually assaulted. Assuming the rate is similar for people with psychosis, more than 1 in 5 women with psychosis would need to make false allegations for the base assumption to be "person has psychosis therefore their sexual assault claim is more likely false than true".</p></div></span></p></div></div></div><div id="nMNwxrMJdQTGzDyBf"><p>Bayes can judge you now: your analysis is half-arsed, which is not a good look when discussing a matter as serious as this. &nbsp;</p><p>All you’ve done is provide one misleading statistic.

<p>A priori when a person makes a bunch of unlikely accusations in public, it would have been reasonable to first consider this as evidence of them not being truthful and sane.

It's probably partly that, but it's also partly that it's considered impolite to point out when someone is mentally ill. In part this is because unfortunately doing so can strengthen a paranoid person's feeling of persecution.

When a friend of mine suffered a psychotic break, she had many technology related delusions, and she reached out to me for advice because I work in technology. I wasn't sure how to handle it so I consulted a professional. Under their advice, I gave her general advice on how to protect herself from breaches (strong passwords, HTTPS everywhere extension, etc.) and didn't otherwise try to disillusion her. My role as a friend was to stay her friend, not try to break her delusions. Paranoid people already have enough enemies, imaginary though they may be.&nbsp;

Of course, once delusions have been put into print, it's now a public forum. (One might question the ethics of publishing such an article). But politeness norms often extend into public forums.&nbsp;

This doesn't mean that these dissmissed women were indeed psychotic and/or wrong in their allegitions. Pre-me-too perception of the world is at least not necessarily more accurate.

If anything, happening of Me-Too movement is an evidence in favor of base rates of sexual assault being highter. You can't use it existence to lower the probability estimate of this particular allegation being true, without contradicting conservation of expected evidence.

Similarly, with mental health issues. They can be downstream of sexual abuse or they can lead to falsly believing that you were abused. Priviledging one hypothesis over the other requires some kind of evidence. What are the rates of abused person developping mental health issues, similar to what can be observed of Annie Altman? What are the rates of people with similar to Annie Altman issues having delusions about sexual assault?

You are comparing wrong numbers. As I've already said what we need to compare is the rate of this kind of mental health symptoms among people who were not sexually abused in their childhood and then developped delusions about sexual assualt with the probability of people being sexually abused in their childhood and then developping this kind of simptoms. This will give us a prior to distinguish between two hypothesis.&nbsp;

All the other complications like shadowbanning, family members conspiring, being written out of the will, etc. are not relevant to the main issue. A scenario where a girl was sexually abused as by her brothers, which resulted in her devolopping mental health issues, which lead her to inaccurately believe that she is shadowbanned in the internet isn't absolving for the brothers. Of course if the other allegations are also true/partially true it makes the situation even more severe. But they have to be examined on their own and not dissmissed all together.</p></div></span></p></div></div></div><div id="htzd7BtAA9upCLkPL"><div><p>I'm confused about and skeptical of the justifiability of all the downvotes this post received.</p><ol><li>If the allegations are true, well, I'm <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/sam-altman-s-sister-annie-altman-claims-sam-has-severely?commentId=hcqiBJCAKuXqC9tKP">not sure</a> how important exactly it is, but it seems at least like it passes the bar of "worth knowing about" pretty easily.</li><li>If something passes that bar pretty easily, I guess the next question is how plausible it is.

I think, though I did a pretty good job with being rational in this post, and trying to make rational, unbiased claims from/using the information that exists, I could have been a bit more refined and clear-cut.

I honestly feel a bit bad, because this is an important issue, and I hope I didn't screw things up by (unintentionally) presenting things in a irrational or biased way. I'll try to be very rational and unbiased in this comment.

I think my statement that I was "trying to figure out the truth" in an earlier comment was misguided and imprecise. You were keen to notice this. In a situation like this, there are large amounts of uncertainty, and there is currently no proof of misconduct (that I've seen.)

I think what this post does is {provide a (relatively) accurate description of the state of affairs regarding Annie's claims.} I do feel pretty good about the way in which I presented the information relevant to this matter in this post. Though I don't want to necessarily "take shots" at Elizabeth Weil, whose nymag article provided basically the only significant written third-party acknowledgment of Annie's claims, I will say that I prefer the (hopefully, more) objective, straight-from-the-source, uncertainty-acknowledging approach I've taken here.

The key thing here is that, currently, the primary information we have is:

 1. Claims that Annie has made on social media, as well as a few pictures of her from when she was sick that she took, and a few screenshots of her social media that potentially indicate, but do not provably or definitively, indicate that she experienced shadowbanning, let alone that the low engagement/shadowbanning occured because of Sam. It is important to avoid the conjunction fallacy:
    
    Let A = the event that Annie Altman, or (digital) media relating to her did indeed experience shadowbanning, low engagement, etc.
    Let B = the event that </p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="ewihvex9FczJayebj"><div><p>Also a practical question about how to interpret this is how reliable flashbacks that occur many years later the event without memory of the event in the time inbetween are.

<p>Like as far as I understand, dissociation is A Thing, but the people who talk about it still don't have a solid understanding of how it can or cannot work, and are often mistaken about the science of it and of trauma? (In particular overestimating the validity of some of the science.)</p>
<p>And conversely, some recovered memories are fake, but the people who talk about this tend to deny the possibility of dissociation and don't really have any scalable way of determining the validity or invalidity of such memories, so they just round it off to always being fake without having solid support for that?</p>

As I note in my response to "Objection 4", Annie has provided no direct evidence to corroborate her claims, to the best of my knowledge.&nbsp;

I also acknowledge that the links I provided (e.g. from saprea.org) do not meet rigorous standards that would enable me to label them as "scientific" or "empiric" evidence to corroborate Annie's account. I provide them merely as a way of noting that the symptoms that Annie's reported seem plausible.

As I mentioned, the intent of this post is to promote discussion about the claims that Annie has made, and to spread awareness of the fact that Sam has not yet responded to Annie's (very serious claims.) This post does not claim that Annie's claims are provably or indisputably valid. In fact, I think the opposite is true: her claims are not yet corroborated by direct evidence, and they certainly are disputable. I currently hold Sam Altman to be innocent, until proven guilty.&nbsp;

In spite of this, I still thought that this post was worth making, as a means of bringing attention to Annie's claims, which I think have a nonzero probability of being true in whole or in part.</p></div></span></p><div id="b39yT8g7p8f9yHpui"><p><span><div><p><span>3</span><span>tailcalled</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>This seems like a thing that, even if true, would not lead to any direct evidence?

Deviating a bit from your reply to the more general question of "What direct evidence could be provided (e.g. by Annie) to corroborate the claims Annie is making?" -- I do think that a potentially useful piece of evidence that could be provided to corroborate (some of) Annie's claims would be proof that:

Obviously pedophiles are much more likely to sexually assault children than teliophiles are, and from what I've heard pedophiles are more likely to have no particular preference (or only weak preferences) for whether their victims are male or female. But pedophilic child molesters tend to have strong preferences for children, which is in tension with Sam Altman being attracted to adult men.

Alternatively I've heard that some teliophiles molest children out of opportunism, but that seems somewhat counterintuitive to me (in order to see children as a sexual opportunity, wouldn't they need to be attracted to them?). It's less counterintuitive if we're talking about teens (sexual attractiveness to teliophiles tends to gradually increase due to age, rather than suddenly spiking up at the age of consent), but that doesn't square with Annie being four years old. I'm pretty sure this type of child molester tends to have a correspondence between their preference for adults's sex and their preference for children's sex, but I also think their preference for children's sex is weaker than their preference for adult's sex.

These explanations are all making reference to the perpetrator's sexuality, though of course in much more complex and nuanced ways than gay/straight/bi.</p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="GcGdpqhgrMiySch6J"><p><span><div><p><span>8</span><span>DanielFilan</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>[epistemic status: i know nothing]

While I agree that:

I do not agree that:

-- 13-year-old Sam Altman choosing to explore his sexuality by sexuality assaulting his 4-year-old sister is a psychologically infeasible (I do acknowledge that this is not exactly the claim you are making.)

(Not to imply that you said that; I just say this more in an attempt to convey my motives and character.) I came to this site in particular because:

 1. I thought its users would probably understand the significance of a claim that Sam Altman has been quietly hiding the fact that he sexually assaulted his 4-year-old sister.
 2. I thought that its users would be good at calling me out on any logical/irrational bullshit that I (unintentionally) propagated. I want to be right, not to feel right. Say what you will about LessWrong, but its users do love to be quite exacting in their arguments about whether or not they think a person is making rational arguments. Indeed, I've modified this post, and my replies, many times in response to comments I've received in a way that I think has been to the benefit of the clarity of this post and its conveyance of my position. I'm glad that my karma score has jumped all over the place as I've updated my post - it means that LessWrong users are actually thinking critically about the degree to which I am being rational.&nbsp;

It seems to me, at this point, one of two things is true:

 1. Annie Altman is lying left, right,. and center, or is deluded, disconnected from reality, or just misinformed/misunderstanding things to the point that she believes she is telling the truth when she is not.
 2. She is not lying (at least, to some degree.)

We can debate whether Sam Altman's alleged offenses are relevant to this forum, but I don't think there's any case to be made that his sister's mental health or honesty is relevant to anyone here.

If this doesn't happen, it's probabilistic evidence against the worst tail scenarios of character traits, which would be helpful if we could significantly discount that.

What could cause me to change my mind? Here are my cruxes.

If character assessment posts about particular people can be shown to cause a useful actions or ways of thinking for readers more often than they distract readers by unverifiable gossip.

If character assessment posts about particular people is used as a case study for reasoning about particular people to teach a broader lesson.

If character assessment posts about particular people allows community members to protect themselves from a real danger.

However, my beliefs are that these types of posts are juicy gossip that fuel idle speculation and status hierarchy games and serve no purpose except to make those who engage with content worse people who think more simplistically about human behavior and motivation. Even though this particular post is done fairly well for what it is, I think it is "bad form" and, perhaps, on the wrong site.</p></div></span></p><div id="AzseGSZ6pzwEJ5zqm"><p><span><div><p><span>4</span><span>Adam Zerner</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>It makes me happy to see such a cruxy comment like this.

The cruxes seem reasonable. However, I feel like it's appropriate to upvote/downvote based on how confident you are on your position for each of them. Like, if it's really clear that a particular post will have the consequence of pushing people really far towards distracting gossip and away from useful actions, then downvote. If the opposite, maybe upvote. If it's unclear, probably do nothing.

Because this post is about the person who might be the most powerful person in the domain of AI, and thus is perhaps the most important person in the entire world, or even perhaps throughout history, I think it's actually a decently important topic. Because of magnitude, not probability. Like, even if there is a low probability that we figure out the truth, and of P(useful action | figure out truth), the magnitude of the positive impact could very well be large, and so it seems to me like a topic that is plausibly worth exploring. Enough that I upvoted it.

I think I personally have a tendency to see people like Sam Altman and Elon Musk and get caught up in thinking they're so awesome, and then am a victim of the halo effect. I find concrete examples of "wait, they frequently do things that aren't very awesome" helpful.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation &amp; Running</h2>
<ol start="0" dir="auto">
<li>Get Xash3D FWGS binaries: you can use <a href="https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs/releases/tag/continuous">testing</a> build or you can compile engine from source code.</li>
<li>Copy engine binaries to some directory.</li>
<li>Copy <code>valve</code> directory from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/" rel="nofollow">Half-Life</a> to directory with engine binaries.
If your CPU is NOT x86 compatible or you're running 64-bit version of the engine, you may want to compile <a href="https://github.com/FWGS/hlsdk-portable">Half-Life SDK</a>.
This repository contains our fork of HLSDK and restored source code for some of the mods. Not all of them, of course.
You still needed to copy <code>valve</code> directory as all game resources located there.</li>
<li>Run the main executable (<code>xash3d.exe</code> or AppImage).</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">For additional info, run Xash3D with <code>-help</code> command line key.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>

<p dir="auto">NOTE: NEVER USE GitHub's ZIP ARCHIVES. GitHub doesn't include external dependencies we're using!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites</h3>
<p dir="auto">If your CPU is x86 compatible, we are building 32-bit code by default. This was done to maintain compatibility with Steam releases of Half-Life and based on it's engine games.
Even if Xash3D FWGS does support targetting 64-bit, you can't load games without recompiling them from source code!</p>
<p dir="auto">If your CPU is NOT x86 compatible or you decided build 64-bit version of engine, you may want to compile <a href="https://github.com/FWGS/hlsdk-portable">Half-Life SDK</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><em>Chief technology officer Mira Murati appointed interim CEO to lead OpenAI; Sam Altman departs the company. </em></p><p><em>Search process underway to identify permanent successor.</em></p><p><br>The board of directors of OpenAI, Inc., the 501(c)(3) that acts as the overall governing body for all OpenAI activities, today announced that Sam Altman will depart as CEO and leave the board of directors. Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO, effective immediately.</p><p>A member of OpenAI’s leadership team for five years, Mira has played a critical role in OpenAI’s evolution into a global AI leader. She brings a unique skill set, understanding of the company’s values, operations, and business, and already leads the company’s research, product, and safety functions.&nbsp;Given her long tenure and close engagement with all aspects of the company, including her experience in AI governance and policy, the board believes she is uniquely qualified for the role and anticipates a seamless transition while it conducts a formal search for a permanent CEO.</p><p>Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.</p><p>In a statement, the board of directors said: “OpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity. The board remains fully committed to serving this mission. We are grateful for Sam’s many contributions to the founding and growth of OpenAI. At the same time, we believe new leadership is necessary as we move forward. As the leader of the company’s research, product, and safety functions, Mira is exceptionally qualified to step into the role of interim CEO. We have the utmost confidence in her ability to lead OpenAI during this transition period.”</p><p>OpenAI’s board of directors consists of OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, independent directors Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Helen Toner.</p><p>As a part of this transition,&nbsp;Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board and will remain in his role at the company, reporting to the CEO.</p><p>OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 with the core mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. In 2019, OpenAI restructured to ensure that the company could raise capital in pursuit of this mission, while preserving the nonprofit's mission, governance, and oversight. The majority of the board is independent, and the independent directors do not hold equity in OpenAI. While the company has experienced dramatic growth, it remains the fundamental governance responsibility of the board to advance OpenAI’s mission and preserve the principles of its Charter.<br></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/google-coral-tpu-pcie-raspberry-pi-5.jpg" width="700" height="auto" alt="Google Coral TPU running over PCIe on Raspberry Pi 5"></p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 has a much improved PCIe bus—capable of reaching Gen 3 speeds even!—and I've already tested the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXWu4SUsaY8">first PCIe NVMe HATs for Pi 5</a>.</p>

<p>So can the Pi 5 handle the Coral TPU natively over PCIe?</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>. Though currently, you need to tweak a few things to get it working.</p>

<h2>PCIe bringup for Coral TPU on Pi 5</h2>

<p>Buckle up, to get the TPU working, we are going to need to overcome some hurdles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coral's drivers only work on 4K page size, so we need to switch from the default Pi kernel</li>
<li>The Coral is a bit picky with PCIe timings, so (for now at least) we need to disable <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management#Active_State_Power_Management">PCIe ASPM</a></li>
<li>The Pi's default device tree sets up the PCIe bus to not have enough MSI-X interrupts, so we need to change it</li>
<li>Pi OS 12 'Bookworm' ships with Python 3.11, but Coral's PyCoral library only runs on 3.9, so we need to run inside Docker (or install an alternate system-wide Python version)</li>
<li>There's no A+E key adapter/HAT for the Raspberry Pi (yet), so we need a hardware interface to plug the Coral TPU into the Pi 5's PCIe header</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pi Config Changes</h3>

<p>Some of the changes required to get the Coral working are pretty easy—changing some configuration and rebooting.</p>

<p>First, to switch from the default 16k page size to 4k pages (confirm which kernel you're running with <code>uname -a</code>), you can add the line <code>kernel=kernel8.img</code> to the bottom of your <code>/boot/config.txt</code> file.</p>

<p>Then, to enable the external PCI Express connector, add the following two lines to the same file (again, at the bottom):</p>

<pre><code>dtparam=pciex1
dtparam=pciex1_gen=2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I tested with Gen 1, 2, and 3—the TPU was functional at all three speeds, but I had a few link errors (that did not cause any noticeable problems) at Gen 3 with my own setup.</p>

<p>The final configuration change is disabling ASPM for PCI Express devices—this might not be <em>absolutely</em> necessary, but it does clear up some noisy link error correction messages in the system logs.</p>

<p>Edit <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code> and in the configuration line, add in <code>pcie_aspm=off</code> somewhere (I added it prior to <code>rootwait</code>.</p>

<p>Save that file and the config.txt changes and reboot, and you can confirm the kernel was switched by running <code>uname -a</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pi@pi5:~ $ uname -a
Linux pi5 6.1.0-rpi4-rpi-v8 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 1:6.1.54-1+rpt2 (2023-10-05) aarch64 GNU/Linux
</code></pre>

<p>Yours will look a little different, but the key there is to see the <code>-v8</code> at the end of the kernel version string.</p>

<h3>Device Tree Change</h3>

<p>This next bit is slightly more complicated, as most Raspberry Pi owners don't mess around with Device Trees (the little files that describe the hardware to Linux), but it's not so bad.</p>

<p>In fact, I have a guide for the process on this very blog: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/how-customize-dtb-device-tree-overlay-on-raspberry-pi">How to customize the dtb (device tree overlay) on the Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, the exact steps for modifying the PCIe bus to use the correct <code>msi-parent</code> value is shown in that blog post—so follow it to make the correct change.</p>

<p>Why switch the value? See <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=2157674#p2157674">this post from jdb on the Pi forums</a>.</p>

<h3>Python 3.9 inside Docker</h3>

<p>The last step—assuming you have the hardware to connect up a PCIe Coral TPU to the Pi 5's PCIe connector (more on that later)—is to install Docker and run the PyCoral library inside a Debian 10 Docker container, which is much quicker and easier than trying to get PyCoral installed on the system Python on Debian 12.</p>

<p>And wouldn't you know? I have a guide for how to do <em>exactly that</em> elsewhere on this blog: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/testing-coral-tpu-accelerator-m2-or-pcie-docker">Testing the Coral TPU Accelerator (M.2 or PCIe) in Docker</a></p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/google-coral/pycoral/issues/85">Python 3.10 and 3.11 support</a> issue on the PyCoral GitHub for any updates about getting it installed on the version of Python that ships with the latest Pi OS.</p>

<h3>Physically Plugging in a Coral TPU to the Raspberry Pi 5</h3>

<p>Right now, unfortunately, there are no commercially-available Pi 5 HATs or adapter boards that go from the proprietary PCIe FFC connector on the Raspberry Pi 5 to either a standard PCIe slot, or to an A+E key M.2 connector.</p>

<p>I am certain both of those will exist at some point (hopefully soon!), but for now, your best bet is to order a <a href="https://pineberrypi.com/products/hat-top-2230-2240-for-rpi5">HatDrive! Top or Bottom</a> from Pineberry Pi and then order a PCIe M.2 M-key to A+E key adapter. Or use the Coral B+M key module with the 'Bottom' version (since it's 2280-size, and won't fit in the 'Top' HAT).</p>

<p>For my own testing, I've been using a prototype board that Mirkotronics / Pineberry Pi sent called 'uPCity'. I am hoping they can sell a version of that board at some point, because it is extremely fun to mess around with <a href="https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/">so many different PCI Express devices</a> on the Raspberry Pi 5!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Once everything is wired up, and you <a href="https://coral.ai/docs/m2/get-started">install the <code>apex</code> PCIe driver</a>—and can see <code>/dev/apex_0</code>—you could run an image classification example inside the edgetpu examples repo. Give it an image of this bird:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/edgetpu-bird.jpg" width="512" height="auto" alt="Coral Edge TPU Example Bird image"></p>

<p>And then it should spit out:</p>

<pre><code>root@7bb44c28f378:~# python3 /usr/share/edgetpu/examples/classify_image.py --model /usr/share/edgetpu/examples/models/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_inat_bird_quant_edgetpu.tflite --label /usr/share/edgetpu/examples/models/inat_bird_labels.txt --image /usr/share/edgetpu/examples/images/bird.bmp

                                <li>We now consider this anniversary version of Half Life to be the definitive version, and the one we'll continue to support going forward. Therefore, we'll be reducing the visibility of Half Life: Source on the Steam Store. We know Half-Life: Source's assets are still being used by the Source engine community, so it'll remain available, but we'll be encouraging new Half-Life players to play this version instead.</li>

        <p>At the Malmo port in southern Sweden, a cargo ship looms over row after row of shiny new cars — Volkswagens, Volvos, Mercedes.</p><p>Notably missing are Teslas. That's because dockworkers are refusing to unload them.</p><p>Goran Larsson, a cargo ship inspector, said he's informing the crew on each arriving vessel of the labor action and assessing whether any Teslas are on board.</p><p>"We want there to be good regulation in Sweden — law and order all around the workplaces," Larsson said. "And this is the first step that we will do."</p><p>Tesla has long fended off efforts to unionize its workforce around the world. But in Sweden, the electric vehicle maker is facing its first formal labor action over its anti-union stance, with potential ripple effects for the company globally.</p><p>The Swedish metal and industrial workers union, IF Metall, which represents Tesla's roughly 120 workers, launched a walkout at the company in late October.</p><p>And now, Swedish workers of all stripes – dockworkers, electricians, cleaners and others – are banding together to boycott the U.S. company in solidarity.</p><p>The strike is a response to the company's refusal to sign a collective bargaining agreement for its employees, almost all of them mechanics, because Tesla doesn't have a manufacturing plant in Sweden.</p><h3>Even postal workers will stop delivering mail to Tesla</h3><p>About 90% of the entire Swedish workforce belong to trade unions and they are covered by contracts with their employers, which standardize pay rates, insurance and pensions, among other work conditions, in each sector.</p>

"It has been very beneficial for both parties – both for employers and for employees."</p><p>The Swedish labor movement is rallying behind the relatively small group of Tesla mechanics, who repair Tesla vehicles at service centers.</p><p>Thousands of workers are refusing to touch any Teslas until the company signs a contract. And the boycott keeps expanding. Postal workers have said they will stop delivering mail addressed to the company if there's no deal by Nov. 20.</p><h3>Trade unions are part of the fabric of the Swedish economy</h3><p>They see the American EV maker's efforts to circumvent collective bargaining as an affront to the entire Swedish labor system, where trade unions are part of the fabric of the economy.</p><p>Dockworkers represented by Sweden's transport workers' union have been blocking all imports of Teslas at Sweden's four main ports since last week. And this Friday, they're set to expand their blockade to the entire country.</p><p>Tommy Wreeth, chairman of the transport workers' union, said the Swedish labor system is based on collective bargaining agreements, which Tesla, led by the staunchly anti-union Elon Musk, is reluctant to embrace.</p>

A Tesla representative told Sweden's TT News Agency that the company is choosing not to enter into a collective agreement.</p><p>"We already offer equivalent or better agreements than those covered by collective bargaining and find no reason to sign any other agreement," Tesla told TT.</p><p>A Tesla mechanic in Gothenburg, who requested anonymity due to concern about retaliation by the company, said he thinks a union agreement would provide a financial safety net that "allows us as employees to be able to have security."</p><h3>"Symbolically important" fight</h3><p>Despite the broad nature of the protests lodged by the unions, they have an uphill battle on their hands. Sweden is a relatively small market for Tesla – its fifth biggest in Europe this year. And Tesla doesn't manufacture any cars in the Nordic country, meaning it could theoretically decide to leave the country altogether.</p>

      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1206209107">UAW members aren't all assembling cars. More and more are unionized grad students</a></p><hr><p>But German Bender, a labor market analyst at Stockholm think tank Arena Idé, said it's unlikely Tesla will leave Sweden. And he doubts the Swedish unions will give up anytime soon – their fight, he said, is "too symbolically important" to abandon.</p><p>"And it becomes more symbolically important the longer the strike goes on," Bender said.</p><h3>Europe's one Tesla factory in Germany also has a union drive</h3><p>The strike is, at its core, a domestic issue – it's about a foreign company at odds with Sweden's labor norms and values.</p><p>But the labor action comes as unions in bigger markets are also challenging Tesla. Musk is facing, for instance, a union drive at its factory in Germany.</p><p>It is Tesla's only factory in Europe: the Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory, one of six such plants worldwide.</p><p>In the United States, the Texas-based automaker has so far thwarted all attempts to unionize its workforce. But the United Auto Workers union has set its sights on Tesla, after negotiating major deals with the Detroit Three automakers.</p><p>"If the Tesla workers in Sweden would manage to sign the first collective agreement ever with Tesla, I think that could have a symbolic importance in other markets," Bender said.</p><p>Atle Hoie, general secretary of IndustriALL Global Union which represents industrial workers around the world, said large-scale strikes like this one are rare in Sweden. He said the solidarity from Swedish unions across sectors, including from dockworkers, is a "big blow to Tesla" both within and beyond the Nordic country, sending the message that Tesla "is not immune to organizing."</p><p>Anders Gustafsson, a former dockworker who now works for the Swedish transport workers' union, said his union has received messages of support from unions in other countries, including in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>"We hope that Tesla workers all around the world actually take that fight," Gustafsson said. "Somebody needs to be first."</p>

To that end, here's what's on the docket for the next major release:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Migration to RWF2</strong></p><p>Discussed further in the <a href="https://rocket.rs/v0.5/news/2023-11-17-rwf2-prelaunch/">RWF2 prelaunch announcement</a>, Rocket will transition to being managed by the newly formed Rocket Web Framework Foundation: <em>RWF2</em>. The net effect is increased development transparency, including public roadmaps and periodic updates, financial support for high-quality contributions, and codified pathways into the project's governance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pluggable Connection Listeners</strong></p><p>Rocket currently expects and enjoins connection origination via TCP/IP. While sufficient for the common case, it excludes other desirable interfaces such as Unix Domain Sockets (UDS).</p><p>In the next major release, Rocket will expose [an interface for implementing and plugging-in custom connection listeners]. Rocket itself will make use of this interface to expose more common mediums out-of-the-box, such as the aforementioned UDS.</p></li><li><p><strong>Native <code>async</code> Traits</strong></p><p>Given the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/115822">stabilization of <code>async fn</code> in traits</a>, the next major release will seek to eliminate Rocket's dependence on <code>#[async_trait]</code> opting instead for native <code>async</code> traits. This will greatly improve our documentation, which currently calls out the attribute for each affected trait, as well as offer modest performance improvements.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/749"><strong>Typed Catchers</strong></a></p><p>Today's catchers cannot receive strictly typed error data. This results in workarounds where error data is queried for well-typedness at runtime. While it <em>has</em> been possible to implement a form of typed error catching prior, doing so necessitated limiting error data to <code>'static</code> values, as other Rust web frameworks do, a concession we're unwilling to make.</p><p>After much experimentation, we have an approach that is ergonomic to use, safe, and correct, all without the <code>'static</code> limitation. This will allow error catchers to "pattern match" against error types at compile-time. At runtime, Rocket will match emerging error types against the declared catchers and call the appropriate catcher with the fully-typed value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Short-Circuitable Request Processing</strong></p><p>Whether with success or failure, fairings and guards cannot presently terminate request processing early. The rationale for forbidding this functionality was that it would allow third-party crates and plugins to dictate responses without offering any recourse to the top-level application.</p><p>With the advent of typed catchers, however, we now have a mechanism by which a top-level application can intercept early responses via their type, resolving the prior concern. As such, in the next major release, fairings and guards will be able to respond to requests early, and catchers will be able to intercept those early responses at will.</p></li><li><p><strong>Associated Resources</strong></p><p>Often a set of routes will share a set requirements. For example, they may share a URI prefix, subset of guards, and some managed state. In today's Rocket, these common requirements must be repeatedly specified for each route. While this is by design (we <em>want</em> a route's requirements to be obvious), the repetition is arduous and potentially error prone.</p><p>In an upcoming major release, Rocket will introduce new mechanisms by which a set of routes can share an explicitly declared set of requirements. Their <em>explicit</em> and <em>declarative</em> nature results in requirements that are simultaneously obvious <em>and</em> declared once.</p><p>We're really excited about this upcoming change and will be announcing more in the near future.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Improvements</strong></p><p>Rocket appears to lag behind other Rust web frameworks in benchmarks. This is partly due to <a href="https://rocket.rs/guide/faq/#performance">poor benchmarking</a>, partly due to security-minded design decisions, and partially due to unexploited opportunities. In the next release, we'll be addressing the latter points. Specifically:</p><ul><li><p><em>Explore making work stealing optional.</em></p><p>Rocket currently defaults to using tokio's multithreaded, work-stealing scheduler. This avoids tail latency issues when faced with irregular and heterogeneous tasks at the expense of throughput due to higher bookkeeping costs associated with work stealing. Other Rust web frameworks instead opt to use tokio's single-threaded scheduler, which while theoretically suboptimal, may yield better performance results in practice, especially when benchmarking homogeneous workloads.</p><p>While we believe work-stealing schedulers are the right choice for the majority of applications desireing robust performance characteristics, we also believe the choice should be the user's. We'll seek to make this choice easier in the next release.</p></li><li><p><em>Reduce conversions from external to internal HTTP types.</em></p><p>Rocket revalidates and sometimes copies incoming HTTP request data. In Rocket v0.5, we began transitioning to a model where we revalidate security insensitive data in debug mode only, allowing for bugs to be caught and reported while reducing performance impacts in production. In the next release, we seek to extend this approach.</p></li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="thank-you">❤️ Thank You<a href="#thank-you" title="perma link">#</a></h3><p>A very special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/commits?author=jebrosen">Jeb Rosen</a>, Rocket's maintainer from v0.4 to v0.5-rc.1, without whom Rocket v0.5 wouldn't exist.

(US Army/Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker)</p></div>
<p><span>WASHINGTON — For the sixth year in a row, the Pentagon has failed its </span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/tag/audit/"><span>annual audit</span></a><span>, while contending it made incremental, year-over-year progress.</span></p>
<p><span>“Auditing the Department’s $3.8 trillion in assets and $4.0 trillion in liabilities is a massive undertaking… but the improvements and changes we are making every day as a result of these audits positively affect every soldier, sailor, airman, marine, guardian, and DoD civilian,” Michael McCord, the Department of Defense (DoD) Under Secretary of Defense and Chief Financial Officer, wrote in a statement Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The department unveiled its latest audit on Wednesday and, similar to<a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2022/11/not-the-progress-i-would-have-hoped-for-pentagon-fails-latest-financial-audit/"> last year’s</a>, it examined 29 standalone entities, from the Military Retirement Fund to different military agencies. Of those it gave only seven an “unmodified opinion,” or clean audit, in which auditors determined their financial statements were presented fairly and that they adhered to accounting principles.</p>

<p><span>Only one audit, the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund, received an “qualified opinion” this year, meaning auditors determined there were misstatements, or potentially undetected misstatements, but those did not adversely influence the financial statements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While there are still three outstanding audits not yet wrapped up, the DoD reported that the remaining 18 failed, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and National Security Agency.<br>
</span></p>

<p><span>“We are working hard to address audit findings as well as recommendations from the </span><span>Government Accountability Office,” McCord wrote. “The components are making good progress resulting in meaningful benefits, but we must do more, and we cannot do this alone.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The department has now failed every audit since 2018, the year the first audit took place. The audit is conducted by the DoD’s Office of Inspector General along with an independent public accounting firm.<br>
</span></p>


<p><span> In 2020, then-Acting Comptroller Thomas Harker signaled that by 2027 the Pentagon could begin to pass its annual audit, an ascertain </span><span>McCord </span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2021/11/as-most-military-agencies-fail-annual-audit-comptroller-claims-steady-progress/"><span>previously stated </span></a><span>might not be viable.</span></p>
<p><span>While there is a lot of heavy lifting to do to get to a clean audit, McCord noted several steps forward this year and outlined additional ones that can be taken to help achieve a passing grade.</span></p>
<p><span>Those additional steps include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>An Oct. 13 memo from Dense Secretary Lloyd Austin to the service secretaries and principal staff assistants emphasizing and reinforcing expectations for supporting the DoD financial statement audits;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>More collaboration across DoD’s planners and programmers, the DoD financial management community, DoD leadership, the Office of Management and Budget, and Congress “to ensure alignment of priorities and resources;”&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A call for lawmakers to pass annual budgets on time and avoid continuing resolutions and shutdowns; and&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Asking defense contractors to pitch in by introducing “innovative, time-saving enterprise solutions,” and bringing their property into audit compliance.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The call for congressional help is a timely one, coming just hours after lawmakers agreed on a new continuing resolution that pushes the DoD’s budget battle to February next year — a regular source of frustration for senior Pentagon officials.</p>

    <p>We hop in the car to get groceries or drop kids at school. But while the car is convenient, these short trips add up in terms of emissions, pollution and petrol cost.  </p>

<p>Close to half (44%) of all Australian commuter trips are by car –&nbsp;and under 10km. Of Perth’s 4.2 million daily car trips, 2.8 are for distances of less than 2km.   </p>

<p>This is common in wealthier countries. In the United States, a staggering 60% of all car trips cover <a href="https://www.urbanismnext.org/resources/summary-of-travel-trends-2017-national-household-travel-survey">less than 10km</a>. </p>

<p>So what’s the best solution? You might think switching to an electric vehicle is the natural step. In fact, for short trips, an electric bike or moped might be better for you –&nbsp;and for the planet. That’s because these forms of transport – collectively known as electric micromobility – are cheaper to buy and run. </p>

<p>But it’s more than that –&nbsp;they are actually displacing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-26/the-rise-of-the-electric-two-wheeler">four times as much demand for oil</a> as all the world’s electric cars at present, due to their staggering uptake in China and <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/9/16/2192859/-EVs-are-cutting-the-world-demand-for-oil-but-not-in-the-way-you-may-think">other nations</a> where mopeds are a common form of transport. </p>

<h2>How can that be?</h2>

<p>On the world’s roads last year, there were over 20 million electric vehicles and 1.3 million commercial EVs such as buses, delivery vans and trucks. </p>

<p>But these numbers of four or more wheel vehicles are wholly eclipsed by two- and three-wheelers. There were over 280 million electric mopeds, scooters, motorcycles and three-wheelers on the road last year. Their sheer popularity is already cutting demand for oil by a million barrels of oil a day –&nbsp;about 1% of the world’s total oil demand, according to estimates by <a href="https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2022/page/2/1">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a>. </p>

<p>What about electric vehicles, you ask? After all, EVs have been heralded as a silver bullet for car emissions and air pollution in cities, as their tailpipe emissions are zero. If charged with renewable power, they get even greener. </p>

<p>But to see them as an inarguable good is an error. They are cleaner cars, but they are still cars, taking up space on the roads and requiring a lot of electricity to power them. Their batteries make them heavier than a traditional car, and draw heavily on the extraction of rare earth elements. While EVs are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/climate/electric-vehicles-environment.html">overall much greener</a> than internal combustion engine cars, battery manufacture can undermine <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x">some of the gains</a>.</p>

<p>On the plus side, petrol cars cost about <a href="https://www.carsguide.com.au/ev/advice/do-electric-cars-actually-save-you-money-83060">A$0.14 per kilometre</a> in fuel, or about $1,820 in fuel annually for the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/tourism-and-transport/survey-motor-vehicle-use-australia/latest-release">average car doing 12,000km</a>. Maintenance averages at $910 a year, bringing the total to $2,730 for a petrol car.</p>

<p>By contrast, charging an EV would cost around $480 for that distance. Maintenance of $240 takes annual running costs to $720. So EVs are much cheaper to run. But they are expensive to buy.   </p>

<h2>What advantages do electric mopeds and bikes have?</h2>

<p>The electric transport revolution is a great chance to rethink how we move through our cities –&nbsp;and whether we even need a car at all. </p>

<p>Cars, after all, often have only one occupant. You’re expending a lot of energy to transport yourself. </p>

<p>By contrast, electric mopeds and bikes use a lot less energy to transport one or two people. They’re also a lot cheaper to buy and run than electric cars. </p>

<p>If you commute on an e-bike 20km a day, five days a week, your charging cost would be about $20 – annually. </p>

<p>In Australia, electric bikes are very rapidly going from a hobbyist pursuit to a serious mode of urban transport. Over 100,000 e-bikes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/08/its-also-just-fun-why-a-growing-number-of-australia-families-are-ditching-cars-for-e-bikes">were sold here</a> last year.</p>

<p>Of course, you’re unlikely to use electric mopeds or bikes to drive from Sydney to Melbourne. Their real value is in short-hop trips –&nbsp;the school run, the milk and bread run or even the commute –&nbsp;where they take roughly the same time or shorter than a car. </p>

<p>Smaller electric options like scooters and skateboards also offer a way to overcome the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)">last kilometre problem</a> which plagues public  transport systems. This, in short, is the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-16/study-working-near-public-transit-is-more-important-to-non-car-commuters-than-living-near-it">inconvenient distance</a> between your home and the station or bus stop. Being able to cover this distance fast can be a game-changer for public transport. </p>

<p>If taken up, electric micromobility can cut urban emissions. A study of e-scooter riders in the United Kingdom found <a href="https://www.voi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/UCL-C_Emissions-Savings-Emissions-from-Shared-E-Scooters.pdf">these trips produced</a> up to 45% less carbon dioxide than alternatives. </p>

<p>US researchers estimate that if e-bike trips expanded to 11% of all vehicle trips, transport emissions <a href="https://www.itdp.org/2019/09/24/e-bikes-e-scooters-drivers-of-climate-action/">would fall by about 7%</a>. </p>

<p>As petrol prices increase and battery prices fall, the cheaper running costs of electric vehicles and even cheaper running costs of electric mopeds, bikes and scooters will keep eating away at the demand for oil. </p>

<p>Global oil demand is now <a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/iea-forecasts-global-oil-demand-peaking-by-2028">projected to peak</a> in 2028 at 105.7 million barrels per day –&nbsp;and then begin to fall, according to the International Energy Agency. </p>

<p>Electric vehicles will play a role in cutting oil demand. But it may well be that electric micromobility cuts demand faster, given how fast these cheaper, more plentiful options are being taken up. </p>

<h2>What does this mean for me?</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to go electric, it’s worth taking a close look at your transport needs. If you live in an outer suburb or regional towns, you may find the longer range and larger capacity of an electric car is better suited.</p>

<p>But for many people, it’s likely you’ll have a range of options. You might have one electric vehicle for longer trips, or group trips, as well as an e-bike for the school run or groceries. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> 
     <div> 
       <p> <img alt="" src="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/electric-vehicle-battery-prices-falling-f/800x450.png"></p> 
       <p> It wasn’t long ago rising demand and component shortages sparked concern that <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/batteries-the-greenflation-challenge-2.html">“greenflation” would drive up prices</a> for the batteries used in electric vehicles. That’s subsiding as prices cool for battery metals, which could help make EVs more competitive with traditional cars more quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <p> Goldman Sachs Research now expects battery prices to fall to $99 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of storage capacity by 2025 — a 40% decrease from 2022 (the previous forecast was for a 33% decline). Our analysts estimate that almost half of the decline will come from declining prices of <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/infographics/green-metals/index.html">EV raw materials</a> such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Battery pack prices are now expected to fall by an average of 11% per year from 2023 to 2030, writes Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs Research’s Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, in the team’s report.</p> 
       <p> As battery prices fall, Goldman Sachs Research estimates the EV market could achieve cost parity, without subsidies, with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles around the middle of this decade on a total-cost-of-ownership basis.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <div><p> “The reduction in battery costs could lead to more competitive EV pricing, more extensive consumer adoption, and further growth in the total addressable markets for EVs and batteries,” says Bhandari.</p><p>  The EV market was initially driven by regulatory support around the world, but global EV penetration is starting to retreat from recent highs, a potential driver of which could be governments in Europe and China cutting back on subsidies.</p></div> 
        
       <p> Still, our analysts see the EV market transitioning to a new phase that is more heavily influenced by consumer adoption than government largesse as battery prices drop. The team’s base case estimate for global EV penetration jumps to 17% in 2025 from just 2% in 2020, and to 35% and 63% by 2030 and 2040, respectively. But its “hyper adoption” scenario sees EVs accounting for 21% of total global vehicle sales by 2025, 47% by 2030, and 86% by 2040.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <p> So far China is leading the way — its EVs are more competitively priced against ICEs in its local market relative to Europe and the US. While EV sales there have been subsidized by Chinese EV producers, which are selling EVs at a loss, the Goldman Sachs Research expects this to eventually change in around the middle of the decade, when battery price declines and a scale-up in EV sales volumes lead to a significant reduction in EV costs. And whereas Chinese consumers are seeing more options of competitively priced EVs, carmakers in the US and Europe have so far focused on larger and more luxurious EV models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
       <p> “We believe the EV market in China could be the closest to a consumer-led EV adoption phase,” Bhandari says.</p> 
       <p> Our analysts also credit new battery technologies for their forecast of a more rapid decline in battery prices. The report highlights a handful of EV battery innovations that could be commercialized this decade, creating “pockets of strength” along the battery value chain. These include novel anode materials featuring silicon that replace or blend with graphite and improve energy density. Bhandari also notes there are new battery structures such as those that increase the size of each battery cell (large cylindrical batteries) that help simplify the pack manufacturing process, “leading to a meaningful savings of labor and machine time.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>from the <i>gop-living-down-to-its-reputation</i> dept</h3>

<p>For decades, big ISPs like AT&amp;T have refused to upgrade low income and poor communities to fiber, despite billions in subsidies, regulatory favors, and tax breaks that were supposed to accomplish <em>precisely that</em>. Groups like the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) have released studies on cities like <a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2017/03/10/atts-digital-redlining-of-cleveland/">Cleveland</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2017/09/06/more-digital-redlining-att-deployment-and-poverty-in-detroit-and-toledo/">Detroit</a>, documenting how this discrimination lines up with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america">30s “redlining” efforts</a>. </p>
<p>Section 60506 of the 2021 infrastructure bill dedicated $65 billion in new broadband subsidies. But it also tasked the FCC with creating rules that would prevent future broadband deployment discrimination. The FCC came in just under the wire for Congress’ November 15 deadline, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-rules-prevent-eliminate-digital-discrimination">finally unveiling its full rules yesterday</a>. </p>
<p>I’ve spent much of the last few weeks talking to consumer groups, activists, and telecom policy experts about the rules.</p>
<p>The general consensus is that it’s a hugely welcome and long overdue improvement, even though the FCC stubbornly refuses to name and shame ISPs with long histories of clear discrimination (wouldn’t want to upset <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/08/17/new-leaks-confirm-ats-position-as-nsas-favorite-telco-partner/">key domestic surveillance allies</a>), the complaint process isn’t transparent, and many are worried that this FCC, with its sketchy track record on consumer protection, won’t consistently enforce them.</p>
<p>FCC boss Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-398477A2.pdf">had this to say about the new rules</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“These rules are strong. When you consider Congress explicitly directed us to “prevent”<br>and “eliminate” digital discrimination of access, they had better be. But I would also argue that they are fair and reasonable.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, these rules are a welcome and long overdue admission by the government that minority and low income Americans have been systematically discriminated against when it comes to broadband deployment, something that’s documentable and indisputably true, despite industry denials. </p>
<p>Late last year you’ll recall <a href="https://themarkup.org/still-loading/2022/10/19/dollars-to-megabits-you-may-be-paying-400-times-as-much-as-your-neighbor-for-internet-service">The Markup released a story</a> showing that not only do big ISPs systematically discriminate in deployment, they charge low income and minority customers more money for slower service than less diverse, more affluent neighborhoods. It’s not really a debate. </p>
<p>One thing consumer groups are happy about: the rules govern both “disparate treatment” (spotty broadband deployment caused by active, provable discrimination) and “disparate impact” (spotty broadband deployment that falls along discriminatory lines regardless of intent). Telecom execs don’t often put discriminatory intent in emails to staff, so proving discriminatory intent isn’t always possible. Other agencies like the NTIA had <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2023/ntia-calls-strong-digital-discrimination-rules#:~:text=NTIA's%20filing%20urges%20the%20FCC,an%20ISP%20against%20a%20group.">advised the FCC adopt this broader approach</a>. </p>
<p>“Strong rules are needed to identify and remedy unequal access to Internet service, no matter what the cause may be,” NTIA Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information Alan Davidson wrote<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;“Rules that combat these inequities will bring lasting relief for vulnerable communities that historically have been left behind online.”</p>
<p>Giant incumbent telecom monopolies with decades of discrimination under their belt are unsurprisingly upset. Key trade groups have already <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/industry-hints-at-possible-legal-challenges-to-fcc-s-digital-discrimination-rules?mc_cid=e3190e9f79&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">threatened to sue</a> over the rules, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/internet-providers-say-the-fcc-should-not-investigate-broadband-prices/">seem particularly chaffed</a> that the rules govern discrimination in broadband pricing. They insist the rules interfere with “the practical business choices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant and dynamic free enterprise system.”</p>
<p>Here in reality, U.S. broadband is anything but a vibrant and dynamic free enterprise system. It’s a failed market, dominated by a handful of politically powerful regional mono/duopolies, who hoover up untold billions in taxpayer subsidies for networks they routinely fail to fully deploy. All protected by layers upon layers of state and federal corruption policymakers like to pretend doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Enter the GOP, which was quick to hyperventilate about the rules at industry’s prompt. Senator Ted Cruz and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/14/fcc-commish-brendan-carr-takes-a-break-from-crying-about-tiktok-to-lie-about-his-agencys-plan-to-combat-racism-in-broadband-deployment/">FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr</a> were particularly incensed, and quickly got to work <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-blasts-bidens-digital-equity-plan-unlawful-power-grab">peppering the media with false claims</a> that the rules were a dystopian Biden administration attempt to <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/gop-to-fcc-back-off-from-overbroad-digital-equity-rules">exert “government control over virtually all aspects of the Internet</a>,” despite it being a congressional mandate. </p>
<p>Recall, Republicans largely voted against the infrastructure bill, despite the fact that they <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/27/republicans-keep-taking-credit-for-billions-in-broadband-subsidies-only-made-possible-by-the-covid-relief-and-infrastructure-bills-they-vehemently-opposed/">still take credit for the numerous broadband projects it’s funding</a> among local constituents. </p>
<p>Again, I’m not particularly sure this FCC will consistently enforce the rules (assuming they survive industry legal challenge) or bring any meaningful penalties against big companies, since that’s never been the agency’s strong suit. And the FCC’s failure to name and shape specific ISPs or address very clear past discrimination is a bit feckless. Also, with FCC leadership shifting every election, it’s extremely unlikely that a Trump-run FCC would ever bother to enforce the rules. </p>
<p>At the same time, absolutely <strong>any</strong> effort to hold big telecom accountable for shitty behavior is treated by the GOP as if it’s some kind of dystopian hellscape of government overreach (though this is the same GOP that wants to abuse FCC authority to bully social media companies that moderate, however sloppily, the party’s race-baiting political propaganda). </p>
<p>Still, simply having the U.S. government overtly acknowledge a generation of discrimination in broadband deployment remains a big deal. It at least <strong>attempts</strong> to begin to rebalance the scales after generations of redlining and government apathy, something predatory regional monopolies and their loyal puppies in Congress clearly aren’t too keen on. </p>
