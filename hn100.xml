      <h2>A new home for Pixelmator</h2>
    

  <p>Today we have some important news to share: the Pixelmator Team plans to join Apple.</p>
<p>We’ve been inspired by Apple since day one, crafting our products with the same razor-sharp focus on design, ease of use, and performance. And looking back, it’s crazy what a small group of dedicated people have been able to achieve over the years from all the way in Vilnius, Lithuania. Now, we’ll have the ability to reach an even wider audience and make an even bigger impact on the lives of creative people around the world.</p>

<h3>What to expect</h3>
<p>Pixelmator has signed an agreement to be acquired by Apple, subject to regulatory approval. There will be no material changes to the Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator apps at this time. Stay tuned for exciting updates to come.</p>
<h3><strong>Thank you</strong></h3>
<p>We want to give a big thanks to our amazing users for your support over the past 17 years. Your feedback has played a huge role in shaping our apps into what they are today. As we step into this exciting new chapter, we can’t wait to share what’s next.</p>
<p>– Pixelmator Team</p>

A small team - 4 people - working on fusing some novel food storage science with some cool hardware and software to offer a physical product that is truly a step-function better than any of the other devices in its category. The company is about two years old - most of that time spent in R&amp;D but we've recently shifted gears towards productizing said research. We are currently self-funded by our CEO, who previously founded a local Seattle unicorn, but do expect to raise venture funding.</p><p>This role:
In the short term, this role will be focused primarily on iterating on the UX of our PWA prototype, building our production mobile app in React Native, adapting our existing infrastructure as we scale into alpha and beta, and building out the on-device experience. We are looking for someone who is excited to work iteratively, and is just as happy tweaking margin spacing as they are building new APIs and managing data transfer between edge devices and our servers. You'll have significant ownership over our technical stack and direction, and many opportunities to explore and learn new technologies.</p><p>Technologies we're currently using:
We do not expect candidates to be an expert in, or even familiar with, every technology on this list - just to be interested in learning the ones they aren't familiar with (although we are prioritizing candidates with deep experience in technologies with an asterisk):
- React Native*
- Node*
- Preact
- Kubernetes/Helm
- Docker
- AWS
- Python
- Terraform
- Working with LLMs</p><p>To apply, please email me (zachary@edesia.ai) your LinkedIn and a few sentences about you and your background.</p></div></td></tr>

Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee.

<p>Becky Carroll was missing a few teeth, others were stained or crooked. Ashamed, she smiled with lips pressed closed. Her dentist offered to fix most of her teeth with root canals and crowns, Carroll said, but she was wary of traveling a long road of dental work.</p>
<p>Then Carroll saw a TV commercial for another path: ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers. The company advertises that it can give patients “<a href="https://www.clearchoice.com/why-clearchoice/one-day-dental-implants/">a new smile in as little as one day</a>” by surgically replacing teeth instead of fixing them.</p>
<p>So Carroll saved and borrowed for the surgery, she said. In an interview and a lawsuit, Carroll said that at a ClearChoice clinic in New Jersey in 2021, she agreed to pay $31,000 to replace all her natural upper teeth with pearly white prosthetic ones. What came next, Carroll said, was “like a horror movie.”</p>
<p>Carroll alleged that her anesthesia wore off during implant surgery, so she became conscious as her teeth were removed and titanium screws were twisted into her jawbone. Afterward, Carroll’s prosthetic teeth were so misaligned that she was largely unable to chew for more than two years until she could afford corrective surgery at another clinic, according to a sworn deposition from her lawsuit.</p>
<p>ClearChoice has denied Carroll’s claims of malpractice and negligence in court filings and did not respond to requests for comment on the ongoing case.</p>
<p>“I thought implants would be easier, and all at once, so you didn’t have to keep going back to the dentist,” Carroll, 52, said in an interview. “But I should have asked more questions … like, Can they save these teeth?”</p>
<p>Dental implants have been used for more than half a century to surgically replace missing or damaged teeth with artificial duplicates, often with picture-perfect results. While implant dentistry was once the domain of a small group of highly trained dentists and specialists, tens of thousands of dental providers now offer the surgery and place millions of implants each year in the US.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Amid this booming industry, some implant experts worry that many dentists are losing sight of dentistry’s fundamental goal of preserving natural teeth and have become too willing to remove teeth to make room for expensive implants, according to a months-long investigation by KFF Health News and CBS News. In interviews, 10 experts said they had each given second opinions to multiple patients who had been recommended for mouths full of implants that the experts ultimately determined were not necessary. Separately, lawsuits filed across the country have alleged that implant patients like Carroll have experienced painful complications that have required corrective surgery, while other lawsuits alleged dentists at some implant clinics have persuaded, pressured, or forced patients to remove teeth unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The experts warn that implants, for a single tooth or an entire mouth, expose patients to costs and surgery complications, plus a new risk of future dental problems with fewer treatment options because their natural teeth are forever gone.</p>
<p>“There are many cases where teeth, they’re perfectly fine, and they’re being removed unnecessarily,” said William Giannobile, <a href="https://hsdm.harvard.edu/people/wiliam-v-giannobile">dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine</a>. “I really hate to say it, but many of them are doing it because these procedures, from a monetary standpoint, they’re much more beneficial to the practitioner.”</p>
<p>Giannobile and nine other experts say they are combating a false public perception that implants are more durable and longer-lasting than natural teeth, which some believe stems in part from advertising on TV and social media. Implants require upkeep, and although they can’t get cavities, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26701919/">studies have shown</a> that patients can be susceptible to infections in the gums and bone around their implants.</p>
<p>“Just because somebody can afford implants doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re a good candidate,” said George Mandelaris, a Chicago-area periodontist and member of the American Academy of Periodontology Board of Trustees. “When an implant has infection, or when an implant has bone loss, an implant dies a much quicker death than do teeth.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>In its simplest form, implant surgery involves extracting a single tooth and replacing it with a metal post that is screwed into the jaw and then affixed with a prosthetic tooth commonly made of porcelain, also known as a crown. Patients can also use “full-arch” or “All-on-4” implants to replace all their upper or lower teeth—or all their teeth.</p>
<p>For this story, KFF Health News and CBS News sought interviews with large dental chains whose clinics offer implant surgery—ClearChoice, Aspen Dental, Affordable Care, and Dental Care Alliance—each of which declined to be interviewed or did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Association of Dental Support Organizations, which represents these companies and others like them, also declined an interview request.</p>
<p>ClearChoice, which specializes in full-arch implants, did not answer more than two dozen questions submitted in writing. In an emailed statement, the company said full-arch implants “have become a well-accepted standard of care for patients with severe tooth loss and teeth with poor prognosis.”</p>
<p>“The use of full-arch restorations reflects the evolution of modern dentistry, offering patients a solution that restores their ability to eat, speak, and live comfortably—far beyond what traditional dentures can provide,” the company said.</p>
<p>Carroll said she regrets not letting her dentist try to fix her teeth and rushing to ClearChoice for implants.</p>
<p>“Because it was a nightmare,” she said.</p>

<h2>“They are not teeth”</h2>
<p>Dental implant surgery can be a godsend for patients with unsalvageable teeth. Several experts said implants can be so transformative that their invention should have contended for a Nobel Prize. And yet, these experts still worry that implants are overused, because it is generally better for patients to have their natural teeth.</p>
<p>Paul Rosen, a Pennsylvania periodontist who said he has worked with implants for more than three decades, said many patients believe a “fallacy” that implants are “bulletproof.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“You can’t just have an implant placed and go off riding into the sunset,” Rosen said. “In many instances, they need more care than teeth because they are not teeth.”</p>
<p>Generally, a single implant costs a few thousand dollars while full-arch implants cost tens of thousands. Neither procedure is well covered by dental insurance, so many clinics partner with credit companies that offer loans for implant surgeries. At ClearChoice, for example, loans can be <a href="https://www.clearchoice.com/dental-implant-financing-and-costs/dental-implant-financing/">as large as $65,000 paid off over 10 years</a>, according to the company’s website.</p>
<p>Despite the price, implants are more popular than ever. Sales increased by more than 6 percent on average each year since 2010, culminating in more than 3.7 million implants sold in the US in 2022, according to a 2023 report produced by iData Research, a health care market research firm.</p>
<p>Some worry implant dentistry has gone too far. In 10 interviews, dentists and dental specialists with expertise in implants said they had witnessed the overuse of implants firsthand. Each expert said they’d examined multiple patients in recent years who were recommended for full-arch implants by other dentists despite their teeth being treatable with conventional dentistry.</p>
<p>Giannobile, the Harvard dean, said he had given second opinions to “dozens” of patients who were recommended for implants they did not need.</p>
<p>“I see many of these patients now that are coming in and saying, ‘I’ve been seen, and they are telling me to get my entire dentition—all of my teeth—extracted.’ And then I’ll take a look at them and say that we can preserve most of your teeth,” Giannobile said.</p>
<p>Tim Kosinski, who is a representative of the <a href="https://www.agd.org/">Academy of General Dentistry</a> and said he has placed more than 19,000 implants, said he examines as many as five patients a month who have been recommended for full-arch implants that he deems unnecessary.</p>
<p>“There is a push in the profession to remove teeth that could be saved,” Kosinski said. “But the public isn’t aware.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Luiz Gonzaga, a periodontist and prosthodontist at the University of Florida, said he, too, had turned away patients who wanted most or all their teeth extracted. Gonzaga said some had received implant recommendations that he considered “an atrocity.”</p>
<p>“You don’t go to the hospital and tell them ‘I broke my finger a couple of times. This is bothering me. Can you please cut my finger off?’ No one will do that,” Gonzaga said. “Why would I extract your tooth because you need a root canal?”</p>
<p>Jaime Lozada, director of an elite dental implant residency program at Loma Linda University, said he’d not only witnessed an increase in dentists extracting “perfectly healthy teeth” but also treated a rash of patients with mouths full of ill-fitting implants that had to be surgically replaced.</p>
<p>Lozada said in August that he’d treated seven such patients in just three months.</p>
<p>“When individuals just make a decision of extracting teeth to make it simple and make money quick, so to speak, that’s where I have a problem,” Lozada said. “And it happens quite often.”</p>
<p>When full-arch implants fail, patients sometimes don’t have enough jawbone left to anchor another set. These patients have little choice but to get implants that reach into cheekbones, said Sohail Saghezchi, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of California-San Francisco.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like a last resort,” Saghezchi said. “If those fail, you don’t have anywhere else to go.”</p>

<h2>“It was horrendous dentistry”</h2>
<p>Most of the experts interviewed for this article said their rising alarm corresponded with big changes in the availability of dental implants. Implants are now offered by more than 70,000 dental providers nationwide, two-thirds of whom are general dentists, according to the iData Research report.</p>
<p>Dentists are not required to learn how to place implants in dental school, nor are they required to complete implant training before performing the surgery in nearly all states. This year, Oregon started <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/dentistry/Documents/Dental%20Implant%20Rules%20FAQ%20Guidance%20-%20FINAL.pdf">requiring dentists to complete 56 hours</a> of hands-on training before placing any implants. Stephen Prisby, executive director of the Oregon Board of Dentistry, said the requirement—the first and only of its kind in the US—was a response to dozens of investigations in the state into botched surgeries and other implant failures, split evenly between general dentists and specialists.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“I was frankly stunned at how bad some of these dentists were practicing,” Prisby said. “It was horrendous dentistry.”</p>
<p>Many dental clinics that offer implants have consolidated into chains owned by private equity firms that have bought out much of implant dentistry. In health care, private equity investment is sometimes <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/private-equity/">criticized for overtreatment and prioritizing short-term profit over patients</a>.</p>
<p>Private equity firms have spent about $5 billion in recent years to buy large dental chains that offer implants at hundreds of clinics owned by individual dentists and dental specialists. ClearChoice was bought for an estimated $1.1 billion in 2020 by <a href="https://www.aspendental.com/">Aspen Dental</a>, which is owned by three private equity firms, according to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook</a>, a research firm focused on the private equity industry. Private equity firms also bought Affordable Care, whose largest clinic brand is <a href="https://www.affordabledentures.com/">Affordable Dentures &amp; Implants</a>, for an estimated $2.7 billion in 2021, according to PitchBook. And the private equity wing of the Abu Dhabi government bought <a href="https://www.dentalcarealliance.net/">Dental Care Alliance</a>, which offers implants at many of its affiliated clinics, for an estimated $1 billion in 2022, according to PitchBook.</p>
<p>ClearChoice and Aspen Dental each said in email statements that the companies’ private equity owners “do not have influence or control over treatment recommendations.” Both companies said dentists or dental specialists make all clinical decisions.</p>
<p>Private equity deals involving dental practices increased ninefold from 2011 to 2021, according to an <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2023.00574">American Dental Association study</a> published in August. The study also said investors showed an interest in oral surgery, possibly because of the “high prices” of implants.</p>
<p>“Some argue this is a negative thing,” said Marko Vujicic, vice president of the association’s Health Policy Institute, who co-authored the study. “On the other hand, some would argue that involvement of private equity and outside capital brings economies of scale, it brings efficiency.”</p>
<p>Edwin Zinman, a San Francisco dental malpractice attorney and former periodontist who has filed hundreds of dental lawsuits over four decades, said he believed many of the worst fears about private equity owners had already come true in implant dentistry.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“They’ve sold a lot of [implants], and some of it unnecessarily, and too often done negligently, without having the dentists who are doing it have the necessary training and experience,” Zinman said. “It’s for five simple letters: M-O-N-E-Y.”</p>

<h2>Hundreds of implant clinics with no specialists</h2>
<p>For this article, journalists from KFF Health News and CBS News analyzed the webpages for more than 1,000 clinics in the nation’s largest private equity-owned dental chains, all of which offer some implants. The analysis found that more than 70 percent of those clinics listed only general dentists on their websites and did not appear to employ the specialists—oral surgeons, periodontists, or prosthodontists—who traditionally have more training with implants.</p>
<p>Affordable Dentures &amp; Implants listed specialists at fewer than 5 percent of its more than 400 clinics, according to the analysis. The rest were staffed by general dentists, most of whom did not list credentialing from implant training organizations, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>ClearChoice, on the other hand, employs at least one oral surgeon or prosthodontist at each of its more than 100 centers, according to the analysis. But its new parent company, Aspen Dental, which offers implants in many of its more than 1,100 clinics, does not list any specialists at many of those locations.</p>
<p>Not everyone is worried about private equity in implant dentistry. In interviews arranged by the <a href="https://www.aaid.com/">American Academy of Implant Dentistry</a>, which trains dentists to use implants, two other implant experts did not express concerns about private equity firms.</p>
<p>Brian Jackson, a former academy president and implant specialist in New York, said he believed dentists are too ethical and patients are too smart to be pressured by private equity owners “who will never see a patient.”</p>
<p>Jumoke Adedoyin, a chief clinical officer for Affordable Care, who has placed implants at an Affordable Dentures &amp; Implants clinic in the Atlanta suburbs for 15 years, said she had never felt pressure from above to sell implants.</p>

<p>“I’ve actually felt more pressure sometimes from patients who have gone around and been told they need to take their teeth out,” she said. “They come in and, honestly, taking a look at them, maybe they don’t need to take all their teeth out.”</p>
<p>Still, lawsuits filed across the country have alleged that dentists at implant clinics have extracted patients’ teeth unnecessarily.</p>
<p>For example, in Texas, a patient alleged in a 2020 lawsuit that an Affordable Care dentist removed “every single tooth from her mouth when such was not necessary,” then stuffed her mouth with gauze and left her waiting in the lobby as he and his staff left for lunch. In Maryland, a patient alleged in a 2021 lawsuit that ClearChoice “convinced” her to extract “eight healthy upper teeth,” by “greatly downplay[ing] the risks.” In Florida, a patient alleged in a 2023 lawsuit that ClearChoice provided her with no other treatment options before extracting all her teeth, “which was totally unnecessary.”</p>
<p>ClearChoice and Affordable Care denied wrongdoing in their respective lawsuits, then privately settled out of court with each patient. ClearChoice and Affordable Care did not respond to requests for comment submitted to the companies or attorneys. Lawyers for all three plaintiffs declined to comment on these lawsuits or did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Fred Goldberg, a Maryland dental malpractice attorney who said he has represented at least six clients who sued ClearChoice, said each of his clients agreed to get implants after meeting with a salesperson—not a dentist.</p>
<p>“Every client I’ve had who has gone to ClearChoice has started off meeting a salesperson and actually signing up to get their financing through ClearChoice before they ever meet with a dentist,” Goldberg said. “You meet with a salesperson who sells you on what they like to present as the best choice, which is almost always that they’re going to take out all your natural teeth.”</p>
<p>Becky Carroll, the ClearChoice patient from New Jersey, told a similar story.</p>
<p>Carroll said in her lawsuit that she met first with a ClearChoice salesperson referred to as a “patient education consultant.” In an interview, Carroll said the salesperson encouraged her to borrow money from family members for the surgery and it was not until after she agreed to a loan and passed a credit check that a ClearChoice dentist peered into her mouth.</p>
<p>“It seems way backwards,” Carroll said. “They just want to know you’re approved before you get to talk to a dentist.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're excited to announce Oasis, the first playable, realtime, open-world AI model. It's a video game, but entirely generated by AI. Oasis is the first step in our research towards more complex interactive worlds. </p><p>Oasis takes in user keyboard input and generates real-time gameplay, including physics, game rules, and graphics. You can move around, jump, pick up items, break blocks, and more. There is no game engine; just a foundation model.</p><p>We believe fast transformer inference is the missing link to making generative video a reality. Using Decart's inference engine, we show that real-time video is possible. When Etched's transformer ASIC, Sohu, is released, we can run models like Oasis in 4K. Today, we're releasing Oasis's code, the weights of a 500M parameter model you can run locally, and a live playable demo of a larger checkpoint.</p><h2>Gameplay Results</h2><p>Oasis understands complex game mechanics, such as building, lighting physics, inventory management, object understanding, and more.</p><p>Oasis outputs a diverse range of settings, locations, and objects. This versatility gives us confidence that Oasis can be adapted to generate a wide range of new maps, games, features, and modifications with limited additional training.</p><p>Oasis is an impressive technical demo, but we believe this research will enable an exciting new generation of foundation models and consumer products. For example, rather than being controlled by actions, a game controlled completely by text, audio, or other modalities.</p><h2>Architecture</h2><p>The model is composed of two parts: a spatial autoencoder, and a latent diffusion backbone. Both are Transformer-based: the autoencoder is based on ViT<sup>[1]</sup>, and the backbone is based on DiT<sup>[2]</sup>. Contrasting from recent action-conditioned world models such as GameNGen<sup>[3]</sup> and DIAMOND<sup>[4]</sup>, we chose Transformers to ensure stable, predictable scaling, and fast inference on Etched's Transformer ASIC, Sohu.</p><p><img alt="Architecture" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="500" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://oasis-model.github.io/arch_new.png"></p><p>In contrast to bidirectional models such as Sora<sup>[5]</sup>, Oasis generates frames autoregressively, with the ability to condition each frame on game input. This enables users to interact with the world in real-time. The model was trained using Diffusion Forcing<sup>[6]</sup>, which denoises with independent per-token noise levels, and allows for novel decoding schemes such as ours. We train on a subset of open-source Minecraft video data collected by OpenAI<sup>[9]</sup>.</p><p>One issue we focused on is temporal stability--making sure the model outputs make sense over long time horizons. In autoregressive models, errors compound, and small imperfections can quickly snowball into glitched frames. Solving this required innovations in long-context generation.</p><p>We solved this by deploying dynamic noising, which adjusts inference-time noise on a schedule, injecting noise in the first diffusion forward passes to reduce error accumulation, and gradually removing noise in the later passes so the model can find and persist high-frequency details in previous frames for improved consistency. Since our model saw noise during training, it learned to successfully deal with noisy samples at inference.</p><p><img alt="Dynamic Noising" loading="lazy" width="700" height="500" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://oasis-model.github.io/dyno.png"></p><p>To learn more about the engineering underlying this model, and some of the specific optimizations in training and inference, check out the <a href="https://www.decart.ai/articles/oasis-interactive-ai-video-game-model">Decart blog post</a>.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>Oasis generates real-time output in 20 frames per second. Current state-of-the-art text-to-video models with a similar DiT architecture (e.g. Sora<sup>[5]</sup>, Mochi-1<sup>[7]</sup> and Runway<sup>[8]</sup>) can take 10-20 seconds to create just one second of video, even on multiple GPUs. In order to match the experience of playing a game, however, our model must generate a new frame every 0.04 seconds, which is over 100x faster.</p><section><img alt="Performance" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://oasis-model.github.io/speed.png"></section><p>With Decart's inference stack, the model runs at playable framerates, unlocking real-time interactivity for the first time. Read more about it on <a href="https://www.decart.ai/articles/oasis-interactive-ai-video-game-model">Decart's blog</a>.</p><p>However, to make the model an additional order of magnitude faster, and make it cost-efficient to run at scale, new hardware is needed. Oasis is optimized for Sohu, the Transformer ASIC built by Etched. Sohu can scale to massive 100B+ next-generation models in 4K resolution.</p><p>In addition, Oasis' end-to-end Transformer architecture makes it extremely efficient on Sohu, which can serve &gt;10x more users even on 100B+ parameter models. We believe the price of serving models like Oasis is the hidden bottleneck to releasing generative video in production. See more performance figures and read more about Oasis and Sohu on <a href="https://etched.ai/blog">Etched's blog</a>.</p><section><img alt="Performance" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://oasis-model.github.io/users.png"></section><h2>Future Explorations</h2><p> With the many exciting results, there come areas for future development in the model. There are difficulties with the sometimes fuzzy video in the distance, the temporal consistency of uncertain objects, domain generalization, precise control over inventories, and difficulties over long contexts.</p><p>Following an in-depth sensitivity analysis on different configurations of the architecture alongside the data and model size, we hypothesize that the majority of these aspects may be addressed through scaling of the model and the datasets. Therefore, we are currently developing this direction alongside additional optimization techniques in order to enable such large-scale training efficiently. Further, once these larger models are developed, new breakthroughs in inferencing technology would be required in order to ensure a sustainable latency and cost trade-off.

<h3>October 31 2024</h3>

<p>This is a follow-up to my blog post <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4.html">macOS Sonoma silently enabled iCloud Keychain despite my precautions</a> from five months ago. The TL;DR of that blog post is that when you have iCloud enabled but not iCloud Keychain, updating from Ventura to Sonoma causes iCloud Keychain to be silently enabled. (I don't know yet whether that still occurs when updating from Sonoma to Sequoia.) What I didn't realize at the time, indeed didn't realize until now, is that iCloud Keychain already uploaded all of my passwords and kept them in iCloud even after I disabled iCloud Keychain.</p>
<p>Let me start with some background. My main machine with all of my personal data including passwords is a MacBook Pro, which is still running Sonoma. It's logged into iCloud, but I don't use iCloud for anything personal. The only reason I enable iCloud is to work on sync features in my apps for my customers. Also for development purposes, I have an iPad and a Mac mini with macOS Big Sur through Sequoia installed on separate APFS volumes. Both devices are used only for software testing and contain no personal data. Finally, I have an iPhone, which I've never actually logged into iCloud.</p>
<p>Today I was shocked to discover a bunch of my website passwords in Safari while booted into Sequoia on the Mac mini. There shouldn't be any personal data on the mini, and iCloud Keychain is disabled in its Sequoia volume. Incidentally, the reason I was looking at Safari passwords on the Mac mini is that I noticed on the MacBook Pro that Allow Automatic Passkey Upgrades was automatically, silently enabled in Safari, and I wanted to check whether that was also true on other devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/10/4.png" width="767" height="226" alt="Safari Passwords Settings"></p>
<p>I looked around on other boot volumes on the Mac mini and other devices but didn't find my passwords anywhere else except in Sequoia. I was struggling to determine how my passwords got there when eventually I remembered my old blog post, which allowed me to reconstruct a plausible scenario.</p>
<p>The key piece of evidence was that when I opened the Sequoia Passwords app and sorted by date edited, the most recent was May 25, 2024. Coincidentally, my old blog post, written when I updated the MacBook Pro to Sonoma, was on May 26, 2024. There aren't any more recent passwords on the Mac mini, yet there are more recent passwords on the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Hence, my assumption about what happened is that when I updated the MacBook Pro to Sonoma, iCloud Keychain got silently enabled, and all of my passwords quickly got uploaded to iCloud, before I could disable it. When I disabled iCloud Keychain on the MacBook Pro, my passwords did <em>not</em> get removed from Apple's servers. They've been sitting up in iCloud all along. But I had no way of knowing that, because iCloud Keychain is not enabled on any of my devices. The <em>only</em> way to see the contents of iCloud Keychain is on an Apple device with iCloud Keychain enabled. You can't even see anything on the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/">icloud.com</a> website.</p>
<p>WWDC 2024 was in June, the month after I updated the MacBook Pro to Sonoma. I installed the new Sequoia beta on the Mac mini and signed into iCloud. When I signed into iCloud for the first time, Sequoia must have automatically enabled iCloud Keychain, which caused my already synced passwords to be downloaded. These are what I see now in Safari and the Passwords app. Once again, when I disabled iCloud Keychain in Sequoia back in June, that didn't remove the passwords from either the Mac or from iCloud.</p>
<p>The question is, how do you delete all data from iCloud Keychain? I found an old Apple support document from 2021 with the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210428170845/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085">Wayback Machine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>What happens when I turn off iCloud Keychain on a device?</h3>
<p>When you turn off iCloud Keychain for a device, you're asked to keep or delete the passwords and credit card information that you saved. If you choose to keep the information, it isn't deleted or updated when you make changes on other devices. If you don't choose to keep the information on at least one device, your Keychain data will be deleted from your device and the iCloud servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the URL <code>https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085</code> now redirects to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109016">https://support.apple.com/en-us/109016</a>, which says nothing about deleting keychain data from iCloud servers:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>If you turn off iCloud Keychain</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>When you turn off iCloud Keychain, password, passkey, and credit card information is stored locally on your device.</p></li>
<li><p>When you sign out of iCloud on your device while iCloud Keychain is turned on, you're asked to keep or delete your Keychain information. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you choose to keep the information, your passwords and passkeys are stored locally on your device, but aren't deleted or updated when you make changes on other devices. </p></li>
<li><p>If you don't keep the information, your passwords and passkeys aren't available on your device. An encrypted copy of your Keychain data is kept on iCloud servers. If you turn iCloud Keychain back on, your passwords and passkeys will sync to your device again.</p></li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently Apple now just keeps your iCloud Keychain data forever, whether you want them to or not? I didn't even want Apple to have my keychain data in the first place!</p>
<p>As a workaround, I manually deleted all of my passwords in the Passwords app in Sequoia, enabled iCloud Keychain, and then disabled iCloud Keychain again. To verify the password deletion, I booted into Sonoma on the Mac mini and enabled iCloud Keychain there. Fortunately, no passwords were downloaded from iCloud. (As I mentioned in my old blog post, Sonoma System Settings still has the bug where it hangs and crashes when you disable iCloud Keychain. Apple software quality on exhibition.)</p>
<p>I'm still concerned about other data that may still be in iCloud Keychain. For example, what about wifi passwords? I can't very well delete my wifi password on the Mac mini and then sync the deletion to iCloud Keychain, because of course I can't sync anything without wifi! And what else does iCloud Keychain store that I can't necessarily see in the user interface? Hopefully nothing else…</p>
<p>By the way, after I published my old blog post about iCloud Keychain, I did ultimately find a solution to prevent iCloud Keychain from ever getting silently enabled: <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/6/4.html">use a MDM profile</a>.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about this in preparation for the next <a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/2025/">HYTRADBOI</a>.</p>
<p>My experience of online conferences has mostly been underwhelming. They typically borrow the form and structure of an in-person conference without considering whether those still make sense online, and whether the goals of an online conference should even be the same as an in-person conference.</p>
<p>The most important function of in-person conferences is meeting people. A regular conference can turn a collection of disparate groups into a community. I've met life-long friends at conferences, but never online, and I don't think online conferences can serve this function well. (You can make friends online, but it tends to happen through repeated interactions in a persistent scene rather than during a single ephemeral event.)</p>
<p>Another important function is to keep up to date on developments in your field. This makes more sense in specialized conferences, especially academic ones, where everyone who works in the field will be in one place presenting their latest work. But for a more general conference like HYTRADBOI it's simply not possible to keep up on all the developments in such a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>So if we can't fulfill those functions, why have a conference at all? The speakers could have just posted videos on their blogs. The attendees could have spent the day browsing hacker news or reading a textbook. What does an online conference add?</p>
<h2 id="the-point">the point</h2>
<p>After mulling this over for a few years I have a couple of answers:</p>
<p><strong>Coordination</strong>. The speakers put time into preparing their talks knowing that there will be an audience to watch it. The audience takes a day out of their lives knowing that there will be many high-quality talks to watch. Everyone can expect a high density of conversation, because everyone is thinking about the same problems at the same time. Solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game">coordination problems</a> is under-rated!</p>
<p><strong>Distillation</strong>. The most experienced and knowledgable experts tend to also be the busiest. Transferring hard-won wisdom to the next generation takes a huge amount of work which few people find the time for. Preparing a short talk and answering questions is probably not as effective as, say, writing a book, but it is very time-efficient. Which means that a small nudge to a busy expert can create a lot of value. And I think this is something we can actually do slightly better than an in-person conference, because the combination of pre-recorded talks, asynchronous chat, and no travel requirements leads to a much smaller investment of time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>Serendipity</strong>. Often advancements in one field come from borrowing a tool from another. It might be possible to deliberately create the conditions for such happy accidents, by curating a selection of talks that appeal to multiple audiences, and that are aimed at explaining general ideas to outsiders rather than at explaining marginal improvements to existing experts. (Not that the latter isn't important, but it's more useful for a what-is-everyone-in-our-field-up-to kind of conference.) This can work just as well online as in-person, and maybe even better because we can have so many more attendees.</p>
<p>Think about those purposes lead me to focus on <strong>curating a coherent selection of talks</strong> and <strong>optimizing for conversation and reach</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="curation">curation</h2>
<p>Rather than holding a call for contributions I spent a lot of time reaching out to individual speakers, focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experts in subjects that are currently poorly documented, who might not otherwise have devoted time to distillation.</li>
<li>Solutions that might transfer to a different field, or problems that someone in a different field might have a solution too.</li>
<li>Unusual ideas that I want to direct attention to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chasing serendipity also pushed me towards have more and shorter talks. HYTRADBOI 2022 had 34 ten-minute talks in one day, which went down well:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HYTRADBOI is so addictive. I’m just clicking on every talk one-by-one and can’t stop. Lots of interesting material and perfect talk length (10 min each) <a href="https://t.co/6B6SUHoES6">https://t.co/6B6SUHoES6</a></p>— Никита Питонский (@nikitonsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1521511745671606272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2022</a></blockquote>  
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Indeed, it's amazing for learning about a bunch of new things in a short period of time.</p>— Gunnar Morling 🌍 (@gunnarmorling) <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1520513332570202114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2022</a></blockquote>  
<p>30-40 talks is probably as far as I can push it though. If I add too many more talks I'd need to spread it out over multiple days, which makes it harder for people to take time off to attend.</p>
<p>In academic conferences one of the ancillary functions is career progression - you can't get promoted without publishing in a major venue, which typically includes giving a conference talk. Weirdly, this idea has carried over to industrial conferences. Even though giving talks is not actually that relevant to industry career progresssion, we still feel like junior engineers should have the opportunity to give talks. I spent a lot of time thinking back and forth over whether that actually makes sense. In the end I decided to focus only on inviting whoever I thought was the best person to give each talk, which often (but not always) skews towards more experienced speakers.</p>
<p>But I'm also holding <a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/2025#lightning-talk-buffet">totally open submissions</a> for lightning talks. I've tried to make the barrier to entry <em>lower</em> than any other conference, to balance out how picky I've been with invited speakers. No need for back-and-forth with abstracts - just upload a talk that is a) vaguely on topic and b) not just a blatant sales pitch for some product, and I'll show it at the conference.</p>
<h2 id="conversation">conversation</h2>
<p>There are many platforms that offer all-in-one conference hosting, but the chat tends to be an anaemic little sidebar that has few features (eg no threads) and that disappears once the conference is over. In conferences that use these platforms I've seen much less conversation than in conferences where the chat is the main focus of the UI. </p>
<p>In HYTRADBOI 2022 the chat spawned myriad subthreads and continued for several days afterwards as people rolled in and out from various timezones. So for HYTRADBOI 2025 I'm using <a href="https://zulip.com/">zulip</a>, which has the best threading UX of any chat I've used, and I'll leave it running indefinitely.</p>
<p>Last time I had a channel per track (~18 talks). This was chaotic, and the attendees quickly reorganized themselves into a channel per talk, allowing converations to extend much longer than the timeslot assigned to the talk. With zulip this will work even better, because each channel can contain multiple threads, each of which has it's own unread count and can be subscribed to or muted.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/what-is-the-point-of-an-online-conference/zulip.png" alt="A screenshot of the bytecode alliance zulip, showing threads nested inside channels."></p>
<p>Unlike many other conferences, this chat is the main focus of the event. The talks are pre-recorded and are presented as regular videos rather than broadcast live, so attendees can pause, rewind, watch later etc. This increases the number of people who actually see each talk (vs eg missing a talk when you eat lunch) and how much time they have to think about the contents and ask interesting questions.</p>
<p>Zulip also has excellent moderation tools, beyond the regular mute/ban/delete options. My favourite is the ability to move messages to a different thread, which is nice for topics where I don't want to shut them down entirely, but I do want to prevent them from derailing an existing conversation. Eg I can move messages to a dedicated rust-vs-c++ thread with opt-in visibiilty, to keep it out of the way of people who are bored of the subject.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">advantages</h2>
<p>There are some axes on which an online conference can be <em>more</em> valuable than an in-person conference. I'm trying to lean into these strengths:</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>. For example, it's rare to see live transcription for an in-person talk (I've only ever seen this at <a href="https://bangbangcon.com/">bangbangcon</a>). But with pre-recorded talks we can transcribe everything ahead of time (and I read and hand-correct all the machine transcriptions so that they are actually useful). This doesn't matter only to people who are deaf or blind, but also to people who aren't fluent in english, or for speakers with a heavy accent, or for people watching in loud environments (I used to watch talks during my commute on the london underground).</p>
<p><strong>Affordability</strong>. A ticket for SPLASH 2024 cost $545-$980. The venue hotel cost $275 per night. Add flights and food and you might be looking at around $2000 for a single conference. Not to mention the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/visas/comments/170dhv5/denied_us_b1_visa_for_tech_conference_struggling/">endless hassle</a> of getting a US visitor visa, and maybe being rejected at the border. By comparison, in India the Ministry of Education <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/education/education-ministry-hikes-stipends-for-phd-students-and-scholars-4449046">recently increased</a> the stipend for a junior research fellow to about $450 per month. For HYTRADBOI 2025 the cheapest ticket option is $0. All you need is an internet connection (and maybe a late night or early morning if you're east of UTC).</p>

<span id="embeddings"></span>
<p>Machine learning (ML) has the potential to advance the state of the
art in technical writing. No, I’m not talking about text generation models
like Claude, Gemini, LLaMa, GPT, etc. The ML technology that might end up
having the biggest impact on technical writing is <strong>embeddings</strong>.</p>
Embeddings aren't exactly new, but they have become much more widely
accessible in the last couple years. What embeddings offer to technical
writers is <b><i>the ability to discover connections between texts at
previously impossible scales</i></b>.<section id="building-intuition-about-embeddings">
<span id="embeddings-intuition"></span><h2>Building intuition about embeddings<a href="#building-intuition-about-embeddings" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Here’s an overview of how you use embeddings and how they work.
It’s geared towards technical writers who are learning about
embeddings for the first time.</p>
<section id="input-and-output">
<span id="embeddings-intuition-i-o"></span><h3>Input and output<a href="#input-and-output" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Someone asks you to “make some embeddings”. What do you input? You input
text.<sup>1</sup> You don’t need to provide the same amount of text every time.
E.g. sometimes your input is a single paragraph while at other times it’s
a few sections, an entire document, or even multiple documents.</p>
<p>What do you get back? If you provide a single word as the
input, the output will be an array of numbers like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>[-0.02387, -0.0353, 0.0456]
</pre></div>
<p>Now suppose your input is an entire set of documents. The output
turns into this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>[0.0451, -0.0154, 0.0020]
</pre></div>
<p>One input was drastically smaller than the other, yet they both produced
an array of 3 numbers. Curiouser and curiouser. (When you work with real embeddings,
the arrays will have hundreds or thousands of numbers, not 3. More on that
later.)</p>
<p>Here’s the first key insight. Because we always get back the same amount of
numbers no matter how big or small the input text, <strong>we now have a way to
mathematically compare any two pieces of arbitrary text to each other</strong>.</p>
<p>But what do those numbers <em>MEAN</em>?</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Some embedding models are “multimodal”, meaning you can also provide images, videos,
and audio as input. This post focuses on text since that’s the medium that we
work with the most as technical writers.
Haven’t seen a multimodal model support taste, touch, or smell yet!</p>

<span id="embeddings-intuition-api"></span><h3>First, how to literally make the embeddings<a href="#first-how-to-literally-make-the-embeddings" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The big service providers have made it easy.
Here’s how it’s done with Gemini:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>google.generativeai</span> <span>as</span> <span>gemini</span>


<span>gemini</span><span>.</span><span>configure</span><span>(</span><span>api_key</span><span>=</span><span>'…'</span><span>)</span>

<span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello, world!'</span>
<span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>gemini</span><span>.</span><span>embed_content</span><span>(</span>
    <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'models/text-embedding-004'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>content</span><span>=</span><span>text</span><span>,</span>
    <span>task_type</span><span>=</span><span>'SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY'</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>embedding</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>[</span><span>'embedding'</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The size of the array depends on what model you’re using. Gemini’s
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini#text-embedding">text-embedding-004</a> model returns an array of 768 numbers whereas Voyage AI’s
<a href="https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings">voyage-3</a> model returns an array of 1024 numbers. This is one of the reasons
why you can’t use embeddings from different providers interchangeably. (The
main reason is that the numbers from one model mean something completely
different than the numbers from another model.)</p>

<p>I don’t know. After the model has been created (trained), I’m pretty sure that
generating embeddings is much less computationally intensive than generating
text. But it also seems to be the case that embedding models are trained in
similar ways as text generation models<sup>2</sup>, with all the energy usage
that implies. I’ll update this section when I find out more.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> From <a href="https://cybernetist.com/2024/10/21/you-should-probably-pay-attention-to-tokenizers/">You Should Probably Pay Attention to Tokenizers</a>: “Embeddings
are byproduct of transformer training and are actually trained on the heaps of
tokenized texts. It gets better: embeddings are what is actually fed as the
input to LLMs when we ask it to generate text.”</p>

<section id="what-model-is-best">
<h4>What model is best?<a href="#what-model-is-best" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Ideally, your embedding model can accept a huge amount of input text,
so that you can generate embeddings for complete pages. If you try to
provide more input than a model can handle, you usually get an error.
As of October 2024 <code><span>voyage-3</span></code> is the clear winner.</p>

<section id="very-weird-multi-dimensional-space">
<span id="embeddings-intuition-meaning"></span><h3>Very weird multi-dimensional space<a href="#very-weird-multi-dimensional-space" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Back to the big mystery. What the hell do these numbers <strong>MEAN</strong>?!?!?!</p>
<p>Let’s begin by thinking about <strong>coordinates on a map</strong>.
Suppose I give you three points and their coordinates:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th><p>Point</p></th>
<th><p>X-Coordinate</p></th>
<th><p>Y-Coordinate</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><p>A</p></td>
<td><p>3</p></td>
<td><p>2</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>B</p></td>
<td><p>1</p></td>
<td><p>1</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>C</p></td>
<td><p>-2</p></td>
<td><p>-2</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are 2 dimensions to this map: the X-Coordinate and the
Y-Coordinate. Each point lives at the intersection of an X-Coordinate
and a Y-Coordinate.</p>
<p>Is A closer to B or C?</p>
<figure>
<img alt="../_images/embeddings-1.png" src="https://technicalwriting.dev/_images/embeddings-1.png">
</figure>
<p>A is much closer to B.</p>
<p>Here’s the mental leap. <em>Embeddings are similar to points on a map</em>.
Each number in the embedding array is a <em>dimension</em>, similar to the
X-Coordinates and Y-Coordinates from earlier. When an embedding
model sends you back an array of 1000 numbers, it’s telling you the
point where that text <em>semantically</em> lives in its 1000-dimension space,
relative to all other texts. When we compare the distance between two
embeddings in this 1000-dimension space, what we’re really doing is
<strong>figuring out how semantically close or far apart those two texts are
from each other</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="../_images/mindblown.gif" src="https://technicalwriting.dev/_images/mindblown.gif">
</figure>
<p>The concept of positioning items in a multi-dimensional
space like this, where related items are clustered near each other,
goes by the wonderful name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space">latent space</a>.</p>
<p>The most famous example of the weird utility of this technology comes from
the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781">Word2vec paper</a>, the foundational research that kickstarted interest
in embeddings 11 years ago. In the paper they shared this anecdote:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>embedding("king") - embedding("man") + embedding("woman") ≈ embedding("queen")
</pre></div>
<p>Starting with the embedding for <code><span>king</span></code>, subtract the embedding for <code><span>man</span></code>,
then add the embedding for <code><span>woman</span></code>. When you look around this vicinity of the
latent space, you find the embedding for <code><span>queen</span></code> nearby. In other words,
embeddings can represent semantic relationships in ways that feel intuitive
to us humans. If you asked a human “what’s the female equivalent
of a king?” that human would probably answer “queen”, the same answer we get from embeddings. For more explanation of the underlying theories, see <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics">Distributional semantics</a>.</p>
<p>The 2D map analogy was a nice stepping stone for building intuition but now we need
to cast it aside, because embeddings operate in hundreds or thousands
of dimensions. It’s impossible for us lowly 3-dimensional creatures to
visualize what “distance” looks like in 1000 dimensions. Also, we don’t know
what each dimension represents, hence the section heading “Very weird
multi-dimensional space”.<sup>3</sup> One dimension might represent something
close to color. The <code><span>king</span> <span>-</span> <span>man</span> <span>+</span> <span>woman</span> <span>≈</span> <span>queen</span></code> anecdote suggests that these
models contain a dimension with some notion of gender. And so on.
<a href="https://youtu.be/7ZYqjaLaK08">Well Dude, we just don’t know</a>.</p>
<p>The mechanics of converting text into very weird multi-dimensional space are
complex, as you might imagine. They are teaching <em>machines</em> to <em>LEARN</em>, after all.
<a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">The Illustrated Word2vec</a> is a good way to start your journey down that
rabbithole.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> I borrowed this phrase from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/">Embeddings: What they are why they
matter</a>.</p>

<section id="comparing-embeddings">
<h3>Comparing embeddings<a href="#comparing-embeddings" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>After you’ve generated your embeddings, you’ll need some kind of “database”
to keep track of what text each embedding is associated to. In the experiment
discussed later, I got by with just a local JSON file:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>{
    "authors": {
        "embedding": […]
    },
    "changes/0.1": {
        "embedding": […]
    },
    …
}
</pre></div>
<p><code><span>authors</span></code> is the name of a page. <code><span>embedding</span></code> is the embedding for that page.</p>
<p>Comparing embeddings involves a lot of linear algebra.
I learned the basics from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra">Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science</a>.
The big math and ML libraries like <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/">NumPy</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> can do the
heavy lifting for you (i.e. very little math code on your end).</p>

<p>I could tell you exactly how I think we might advance the state of the art
in technical writing with embeddings, but where’s the fun in that?
You now know why they’re such an interesting and useful new tool in the
technical writer toolbox… go connect the rest of the dots yourself!</p>
<p>Let’s cover a basic example to put the intuition-building ideas into
practice and then wrap up this post.</p>

<p>Three years ago, if you had asked me what 768-dimensional space is,
I would have told you that it’s just some abstract concept that physicists
and mathematicians need for unfathomable reasons, probably something related to
string theory. Embeddings gave me a reason to think about this idea more
deeply, and actually apply it to my own work. I think that’s pretty cool.</p>

<p>When the build finishes, the embeddings data is stored in <code><span>embeddings.json</span></code> like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>{
    "authors": {
        "embedding": […]
    },
    "changes/0.1": {
        "embedding": […]
    },
    …
}
</pre></div>
<p><code><span>authors</span></code> and <code><span>changes/0.1</span></code> are docs. <code><span>embedding</span></code> contains the
embedding for that doc.</p>
<p>The last step is to find the closest neighbor for each doc. I.e. to
find the other page that is considered relevant to the page you’re currently on.
As mentioned earlier, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra">Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science</a>

<p>As you may have noticed, I did not actually implement the recommendation
UI in this experiment. My main goal was to get basic data on whether
the embeddings approach generates decent recommendations or not.</p>

<p>How to interpret the data: <code><span>Target</span></code> would be the page that you’re
currently on. <code><span>Neighbor</span></code> would be the recommended page.</p>

<p>I’m a keen user of Emacs and Org mode for a variety of tasks, including</p>
<ul>
<li>note taking,</li>
<li>generating documents for exporting to LaTeX, Word, or html.</li>
<li>creating blog posts (notably for this blog, using <a href="https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog">Org2blog</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Org mode is usually associated with Emacs, it is a markup language in its own right, and one that is far more powerful and more standardized than the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Markdown">Markdown language</a>.</p>
<p>I recently came across the excellent blog post <a href="http://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/">Org-Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Language to Use for Text</a> by Org enthusiast Karl Voit. In the post he includes a simple example displaying some of the most important aspects of Org syntax. I was struck by how much information can be conveyed in a short piece of Org code. I have adapted Karl’s example into this longer version:</p>

<div><p>We are living through an AI revolution: the past decade witnessed practically useful AI assistants, AI systems that can generate photorealistic images and videos, and even models that can predict the structure of proteins. But in spite of all these advances, human intelligence dramatically outpaces AI when it comes to the physical world. To paraphrase <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox">Moravec’s paradox</a>, winning a game of chess or discovering a new drug represent “easy” problems for AI to solve, but folding a shirt or cleaning up a table requires solving some of the most difficult engineering problems ever conceived. To build AI systems that have the kind of physically situated versatility that people possess, we need a new approach — we need to make AI systems embodied so that they can acquire physical intelligence.</p><p>Over the past eight months, we’ve developed a general-purpose robot foundation model that we call <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> (pi-zero). We believe this is a first step toward our long-term goal of developing artificial physical intelligence, so that users can simply ask robots to perform any task they want, just like they can ask large language models (LLMs) and chatbot assistants. Like LLMs, our model is trained on broad and diverse data and can follow various text instructions. Unlike LLMs, it spans images, text, and actions and acquires physical intelligence by training on embodied experience from robots, learning to directly output low-level motor commands via a novel architecture. It can control a variety of different robots, and can either be prompted to carry out the desired task, or fine-tuned to specialize it to challenging application scenarios. An extended article on our work can be found <a href="https://www.physicalintelligence.company/download/pi0.pdf">here</a>.</p></div>

<div><h3>The promise of generalist robot policies</h3><p>Today’s robots are narrow specialists. Industrial robots are programmed for repetitive motions in choreographed settings, repeatedly making the same weld in the same spot on an assembly line or dropping the same item into the same box. Even such simple behaviors require extensive manual engineering, and more complex behaviors in messy real-world environments such as homes are simply infeasible. AI could change that, allowing robots to <em>learn</em> and follow user instructions, so that programming a new behavior is as simple as telling the robot what you want done, and the robot can itself figure out how to adapt its behavior to its environment. But this requires data. Language models and other foundation models mine data from the web, utilizing a significant fraction of all available documents. There is no such treasure trove of robot data, so to enable a robot to learn a new skill, large amounts of data need to be collected <em>with that particular robot and for that particular application</em>.</p><p>If we could train a single <em>generalist</em> robot policy that can perform a wide range of different skills and control a wide range of different robots, we would overcome this challenge: such a model would need only a little bit of data from each robot and each application. Just as a person can learn a new skill quickly by drawing on a lifetime’s worth of experience, such a generalist robot policy could be specialized to new tasks with only modest amounts of data. This would not be the first time that a generalist model beat a specialist at the specialist’s own task: language models have superseded more specialized language processing systems precisely because they can better solve those downstream specialist tasks by drawing on their diverse and general purpose pretraining. In the same way that LLMs provide a <em>foundation model</em> for language, these generalist robot policies will provide a robot foundation model for physical intelligence.</p><p>To get there, we will need to solve major technical challenges. Our first step is <span>π<sub>0</sub></span>, a prototype model that combines large-scale multi-task and multi-robot data collection with a new network architecture to enable the most capable and dexterous generalist robot policy to date. While we believe this is only a small early step toward developing truly general-purpose robot models, we think it represents an exciting step that provides a glimpse of what is to come.</p><h3>A cross-embodiment training mixture</h3></div>
<div><p><span>π<sub>0</sub></span> uses Internet-scale vision-language pre-pretraining, open-source robot
manipulation datasets, and our own datasets consisting of dexterous tasks from
8 distinct robots. The model can then perform a wide variety of tasks, via
either zero-shot prompting or fine-tuning.</p></div>
<p>Our first prototype generalist robot policy is trained on the largest robot
interaction dataset to date. The full training mixture includes both
open-source data and a large and diverse dataset of dexterous tasks that we
collected across 8 distinct robots.</p>
<div><p>Our dataset contains diverse tasks, with each task exhibiting a wide variety of motion primitives, many different objects, and various scenes.</p></div>
<div><p>The tasks in this dataset exercise different dimensions of robot dexterity while covering the range of real tasks that these robots might be asked to perform, from bussing dishes to packing items into envelopes, folding clothing, routing cables, assembling boxes, plugging in power plugs, packing food into to-go boxes, and picking up and throwing out trash. Our goal in selecting these tasks is not to solve any particular application, but to start to provide our model with a general understanding of physical interactions — an initial foundation for physical intelligence.</p><h3>Inheriting Internet-scale semantic understanding</h3><p>Beyond training on many different robots, <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> inherits semantic knowledge and visual understanding from Internet-scale pretraining by starting from a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM). VLMs are trained to model text and images on the web — widely used VLMs include GPT-4V and Gemini. We use a smaller 3 billion parameter VLM as a starting point, and adapt it for real-time dexterous robot control.</p><p>VLMs effectively transfer semantic knowledge from the web, but they are trained to output only discrete language tokens. Dexterous robot manipulation requires <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> to output motor commands at a high frequency, up to 50 times per second. To provide this level of dexterity, we developed a novel method to augment pre-trained VLMs with continuous action outputs via flow matching, a variant of diffusion models. Starting from diverse robot data and a VLM pre-trained on Internet-scale data, we train our vision-language-action flow matching model, which we can then post-train on high-quality robot data to solve a range of downstream tasks.</p></div>
<div><p><img alt="Our vision-language-action model uses a novel flow matching formulation, which augments a vision-language model pre-trained on Internet-scale data with continuous outputs. This enables high-frequency dexterous control, making it particularly well-suited for fine-tuning for complex robot manipulation tasks, such as folding laundry or assembling boxes." loading="lazy" width="569" height="414" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.physicalintelligence.company/images/blog-03.jpg"></p><p>Our vision-language-action model uses a novel flow matching formulation, which augments a vision-language model pre-trained on Internet-scale data with continuous outputs. This enables high-frequency dexterous control, making it particularly well-suited for fine-tuning for complex robot manipulation tasks, such as folding laundry or assembling boxes.</p></div>
<div><h3>Post-training for dexterous manipulation</h3><p>More complex and dexterous tasks may require the model to be fine-tuned to specialize it to downstream challenges. Fine-tuning the model with high-quality data for a challenging task, such as folding laundry, is analogous to the post-training process employed by LLM designers. Pre-training teaches the model about the physical world, while fine-tuning forces it to perform a particular task <em>well</em>. Let’s take a look at some of these tasks.</p></div>
<div><p>After post-training, the robot can unload the dryer, bring the clothes over to the table, and fold the clothes into a stack. The video is uncut, from a single policy operating fully autonomously.</p></div>
<p><strong>Laundry</strong>. We fine-tuned <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> to fold laundry, using either a mobile robot
or a fixed pair of arms. The goal is to get the clothing into a neat stack.
This task is exceptionally difficult for robots (...and some humans): while a
single t-shirt laid flat on the table can sometimes be folded just by repeating
a pre-scripted set of motions, a pile of tangled laundry can be crumpled in
many different ways, so it is not enough to simply move the arms through the
same motion. To our knowledge, no prior robot system has been demonstrated to
perform this task at this level of complexity.</p>

<p>Notably, by training on diverse data, we find that the robot is able to recover
when someone tries to intervene in a variety of different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Table bussing.</strong> We also fine-tuned the model to bus a table. This requires
the robot to pick up dishes and trash on the table, putting any dishes,
cutlery, or cups into a bussing bin, and putting trash into the trash bin. This
task requires the robot to handle a dizzying variety of items. One of the
exciting consequences of training <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> on large and diverse datasets was the
range of emergent strategies that the robot employed: instead of simply
grasping each item in turn, the model could stack multiple dishes to put them
into the bin together, or shake off trash from a plate into the garbage before
placing the plate into the bussing bin.</p>

<p><strong>Assembling a box.</strong> Here, the robot has to take a flattened cardboard box and
build it, folding the sides and then tucking in the flaps. This is very
difficult, because each fold and tuck might fail in unexpected ways, so the
robot needs to watch its progress and adjust as it goes. It also needs to brace
the box with both arms, even using the table, so that the partially folded box
doesn’t come apart.</p>

<div><h3>Evaluating and comparing <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> to prior models</h3><p>We compared <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> to other robot foundation models that have been proposed in the academic literature on our tasks: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://openvla.github.io/">OpenVLA</a>, a 7B parameter VLA model that uses discretized actions, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://octo-models.github.io/">Octo</a>, a 93M parameter model that uses diffusion outputs. These tasks are very difficult compared to those that are typically used in academic experiments — for example, the tasks in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://openvla.github.io/">OpenVLA evaluation</a> typically consist of single stage behaviors (e.g., “put eggplant into pot”), whereas our simplest bussing task consisting of sorting multiple objects into either a garbage bin or a bussing bin, and our more complex tasks might require multiple stages, manipulation of deformable objects, and the ability to deploy one of many possible strategies given the current configuration of the environment. These tasks are evaluated according to a scoring rubric that assigns a score of 1.0 for a fully successful completion, with “partial credit” for partially correct execution (e.g., bussing half the objects leads to a score of 0.5). The average scores across 5 zero-shot evaluation tasks are shown below, comparing the full <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> pre-trained model, <span>π<sub>0</sub></span>-small, which is a 470M parameter model that does not use VLM pre-training, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://openvla.github.io/">OpenVLA</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://octo-models.github.io/">Octo</a>. Although OpenVLA and Octo can attain non-zero performance on the easiest of these tasks (“Bussing Easy”), <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> is by far the best-performing model across all of the tasks. The small version, <span>π<sub>0</sub></span>-small, attains the second best performance, but there is more than a 2x improvement in performance from using our full-size architecture with VLM pre-training.</p></div>
<div><div><p><img alt="Zero-shot Performance Comparison Across Tasks" loading="lazy" width="1390" height="700" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.physicalintelligence.company/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fp0-zero-shot-comparison.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.physicalintelligence.company/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fp0-zero-shot-comparison.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.physicalintelligence.company/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fp0-zero-shot-comparison.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p></div><p>Average scores for <span>π<sub>0</sub></span>, <span>π<sub>0</sub></span>-small, OpenVLA, and Octo for zero-shot evaluation on 5 test tasks. Across all of the tasks, <span>π<sub>0</sub></span> consistently attains good performance, and outperforms both the small variant and the prior models.</p></div>
<div><p>We include detailed videos from our rigorous empirical evaluation below, with examples of successful and failed episodes for both our zero-shot experiments and the fine-tuning evaluation. Complete results from all experiments can be found in the <a href="https://www.physicalintelligence.company/download/pi0.pdf">full article</a>.</p><h3>Where do we go from here?</h3><p>Our mission at Physical Intelligence is to develop foundation models that can control any robot to perform any task. Our experiments so far show that such models can control a variety of robots and perform tasks that no prior robot learning system has done successfully, such as folding laundry from a hamper or assembling a cardboard box. But generalist robot policies are still in their infancy, and we have a long way to go. The frontiers of robot foundation model research include long-horizon reasoning and planning, autonomous self-improvement, robustness, and safety. We expect that the coming year will see major advances along all of these directions, but the initial results paint a promising picture for the future of robot foundation models: highly capable generalist policies that inherit semantic understanding from Internet-scale pretraining, incorporate data from many different tasks and robot platforms, and enable unprecedented dexterity and physical capability.</p><p>We also think that succeeding at this will require not only new technologies and more data, but a collective effort involving the entire robotics community. We already have collaborations underway with a number of companies and robotics labs, both to refine hardware designs for teleoperation and autonomy, and incorporate data from our partners into our pre-trained models so that we can provide access to models adapted to their specific platforms.</p><p>If you are interested in collaborating, please <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:collaborate@physicalintelligence.company">reach out</a>. We are particularly excited to work with companies scaling up data collection with robots deployed for real-world applications, who are looking to collaborate on autonomy.</p><p>We are also hiring!

<p>
The kernel graphics driver for the Apple M1 and M2 GPUs is, rather
famously, written in Rust, but it has achieved conformance with
various graphics standards, which is also noteworthy.  At the <a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/6/">X.Org Developers Conference
(XDC)&nbsp;2024</a>, Alyssa Rosenzweig gave an update on the status of the
driver, along with some news about the kinds of games it can support (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtLP5sAXYKo">YouTube video</a>, <a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/6/contributions/284/attachments/230/310/slides.pdf">slides</a>).
There has been lots of progress since her talk at XDC last year (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36VFNdQHsE">YouTube video</a>),
with, of course, still more to come.
</p>

<p>
It is something of an XDC tradition, since she began it in Montreal in&nbsp;2019
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqAAWzchHvk">YouTube video</a>),
for Rosenzweig to give her presentations dressed like a witch.
This year's edition was no exception, though this time she started her talk in
French, which resulted in some nervous chuckles from attendees. After a few
sentences, she switched to English, "<q>I'm just kidding</q>", and
continued with her talk.
</p>

<h4>Updates and tessellation</h4>

<p>
Last year at XDC, she and Asahi Lina reported that the driver had reached
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES">OpenGL ES</a>&nbsp;3.1
conformance.  They also talked about <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Geometry_Shader">geometry
shaders</a>, because "<q>that was the next step</q>".  Since then, the
driver has become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a>&nbsp;4.6
conformant. That meant she was going to turn to talking about <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/tessellation">tessellation</a>
shaders, "<q>as I threatened to do at the end of last year's talk</q>".
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation_(computer_graphics)">Tessellation</a>,
which is a technique that "<q>allows detail to be dynamically added and
subtracted</q>" from a scene, is required for OpenGL&nbsp;4.0, and there is
a hardware tessellator on the Apple GPU—but, "<q>we can't use it</q>".  The
hardware is too limited to implement any of the standards; "<q>it is
missing features that are hard required for OpenGL, <a href="https://www.vulkan.org/">Vulkan</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct3D">Direct3D</a></q>".  That
makes it "<q>pretty much useless to anybody who is not implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API)">Metal</a></q>".  Apple
supports OpenGL&nbsp;4.1, though it is not conformant, but if you use any
of the features that the hardware does not support, it simply falls back to
software; "<q>we are not going to do that</q>".

As far as Rosenzweig is aware, the hardware lacks <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/tessellation.html#tessellation-point-mode">point mode</a>, where points
are used instead of the usual triangles; it also lacks <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/tessellation.html#tessellation-isoline-tessellation">isoline</a>
support, but those two things can be emulated. The real problem comes
with <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Transform_Feedback">transform
feedback</a> and geometry shaders, neither of which is supported by the
hardware, but the driver emulates them with <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Compute_Shader">compute
shaders</a>.  However, the hardware tessellator cannot be used at all when
those are being emulated because minute differences in the tessellation algorithms used
by the hardware and the emulation would result in <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/invariance.html">invariance</a>
failures.  She is not sure whether that is a problem in practice or not,
"<q>but the spec says not to do it</q>", so she is hoping not to have to go
that route.
</p>

<p>
Instead, "<q>we use software</q>".  In particular, Microsoft released a
reference tessellator a decade or more ago, which was meant to show
hardware vendors what they were supposed to implement when tessellation was
first introduced.  It is "<q>a giant pile of 2000 lines of C++</q>" that
she does not understand, despite trying multiple times; "<q>it is
inscrutable</q>". The code will tessellate a single <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/tessellation#Patches">patch</a>, which gave the
driver developers an idea: "<q>if we can run that code, we can get the
tessellation outputs and then we can just draw the triangles or the lines
with this <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Vertex_buffers/Index_buffer">index buffer</a></q>".
</p>

<p>
There are some problems with that approach, however, starting with the fact
that the developers are writing a GPU driver; "<q>famously, GPUs do not like running
2000 lines of C++</q>".  But, she announced, "<q>we have conformant <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a>&nbsp;3.0 support</q>"
thanks to Karol Herbst, though it has not yet been released.  OpenCL C is
"<q>pretty much the same as regular CPU C</q>", though it has a few
limitations and some extensions for GPUs.  So the idea would be to turn the
C++ tessellation code into OpenCL C code; "<q>we don't have to understand
any of it, we just need to not break anything when we do the port</q>".
</p>

<p>
That works, but "<q><tt>tessellator.cl</tt> is the most unhinged file of my
career</q>"; doing things that way was also the most unhinged thing she has done in her career
"<q>and I'm standing up here in a witch hat for the fifth year in a
row</q>". The character debuted in the exact same room in&nbsp;2019 when she
was 17 years old, she recalled.
</p>

<p>
The CPU tessellator only operates on a single patch at a time, but a scene
might have 10,000 patches—doing them all serially will be a real problem.
GPUs are massively parallel, though, so having multiple threads each doing
tessellation is "<q>pretty easy to arrange</q>".  There is a problem with
memory allocation; the CPU tessellator just allocates for each operation
sequentially, but that will not work for parallel processing.  Instead, the
driver uses the GPU atomic instructions to manage the allocation of output buffers.
</p>

<p>
In order to draw the output of the tessellators, though, there is a need to
use draw instructions with packed data structures as specified by the GPU.
That is normally done from the C driver code using functions that are <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25498">generated
by the GenXML tool</a>.  Since the tessellators are simply C code,
"<q>thanks to OpenCL</q>", the generated functions can be included into the
code that runs on the GPU.  Rosenzweig went into more detail, which fills
in the holes (and likely inaccuracies) of the above description; those
interested in the details should look at the presentation video and her
slides.
</p>

<p>
"<q>Does it work?  Yes, it does.</q>"
She showed an image of terrain tessellation from a Vulkan demo.  It was run
on an M2 Mac with "<q>entirely OpenCL-based tessellation</q>". There is also
the question of "<q>how is the performance of this abomination?</q>"  The
answer is that it is "<q>okay</q>".  On the system, software-only terrain tessellation runs at
less than one frame-per-second (fps), which "<q>is not very fun for playing
games</q>"; for OpenCL, it runs at 265fps, which is "<q>pretty good</q>"
and is unlikely to be the bottleneck for real games.  The hardware
can do
820fps; "<q>I did wire up the hardware tessellator just to get a number for
this talk.</q>"   There is still room for improvement on the driver's
numbers, she said.
</p>

<h4>Vulkan and gaming</h4>

<p>
She also announced Vulkan&nbsp;1.3 conformance for the Honeykrisp M1/M2 GPU
driver. It <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month.html">started</a>
by copying the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/nvk.html">NVK
Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs</a>, "<q>smashed against the [Open]GL&nbsp;4.6
[driver]</q>", which started passing the conformance test suite
"<q>in about a month</q>".  That was six months ago and, since then, she
has added geometry and tessellation shaders, transform feedback, and <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-objects">shader
objects</a>.  The driver now supports every feature needed for multiple
DirectX versions.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of problems "<q>if we want to run triple-A (AAA) games on
this system</q>", however.  A target game runs on DirectX and Windows on an x86 CPU with
4KB pages, but "<q>our target hardware is running literally none of those
things</q>". What is needed is to somehow translate DirectX to Vulkan,
Windows to Linux, x86 to Arm64, and 4KB pages to 16KB pages.  The first two
have a well-known solution in the form of the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki">DXVK driver</a> and <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, which are "<q>generally packaged
into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)">Proton</a>
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)">Steam</a> gaming</q>".
Going from x86 to Arm64 also has off-the-shelf solutions: <a href="https://fex-emu.com/">FEX-Emu</a> or <a href="https://box86.org/">Box64</a>.  She has a bias toward FEX-Emu;
"<q>when I am not committing <a href="https://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa</a>
crimes, I am committing FEX-Emulation crimes</q>".  The big problem,
though, is the page-size difference.
</p>

<p>
FEX-Emu requires 4KB pages; Box64 has a "<q>hack to use 16KB pages, but it
doesn't work for Wine, so it doesn't help us here</q>".  MacOS can use 4KB
pages for the x86 emulation, but "<q>this requires very invasive kernel
support</q>";  <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a> already has around 1000 patches that are making
their way toward the mainline kernel, but "<q>every one of those thousand
is a challenge</q>". Making changes like "<q>rewriting the Linux memory
manager</q>" is not a reasonable path.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that, even though Linux does not support heterogeneous page
sizes between different processes, it does support them between different
kernels; "<q>what I mean by that is virtualization</q>".  A KVM guest
kernel can have a different page size than the host kernel.  So, "<q>this
entire mess</q>", consisting of FEX-Emu, Wine, DXVK, Honeykrisp, Steam, and
the game, "<q>we are going to throw that into a virtual machine, which is
running a 4KB guest kernel</q>".
</p>

<p>
There is some overhead, of course, but it is hardware virtualization, so
that should have low CPU overhead.  The problem lies with the peripherals,
she said.  So, instead of having Honeykrisp in the host kernel, it runs in
the guest using <a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/2/contributions/53/attachments/76/121/XDC2022_%20virtgpu%20drm%20native%20context.pdf">virtgpu</a>
native contexts;  all of the work to create the final GPU command buffer is done
in the guest and handed to the host, rather than making all of the Vulkan
calls individually traverse the virtual-machine boundary.  The <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/virgl.html">VirGL</a> renderer on the
host then hands that to the GPU, which "<q>is not 100% native speed, but
definitely well above 90%</q>", Rosenzweig said.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that the overheads for the CPU and GPU do not stack, since
the two run in parallel. "<q>So all the crap overhead we have in the CPU is
actually crap that is running in parallel to the crap overhead on the GPU,
so we only pay the cost once.</q>"
</p>

<p>
"<q>'Does it work?' is the question you all want to know.</q>"  It does,
she said, it runs
games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">Portal</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2">Portal&nbsp;2</a>. She also listed a number of
others: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Crashers">Castle Crashers</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt">The
Witcher&nbsp;3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4">Fallout&nbsp;4</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(video_game)">Control</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077">Cyberpunk&nbsp;2077</a>.
</p>

<p>
All of the different pieces that she mentioned were <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html">made available</a>
on October&nbsp;10, the day of the talk.  For those running the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/fedora/">Fedora Asahi Remix</a> distribution,
she suggested immediately updating to pick up the pieces that
she had described.  Before taking questions, she launched Steam, which took
some time to come up, in part because of the virtual machine and the x86
emulation.  Once it came up, she launched Control, which ran at 45fps on an
M1 MAX system.
</p>

<p>
There was a question about resources from someone who has a Mac with 8GB of
RAM.  Rosenzweig said that the high-end gaming titles are only likely to
work on systems with 16GB or more.  She noted that she was playing Castle
Crashers on an 8GB system during the conference, so some games will play;
Portal will also work on that system.  She hopes that the resources
required will drop over time.
</p>

<p>
Another question was about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray-tracing</a>
support, since Control can use that <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/ray-tracing-in-vulkan">feature</a>.
Rosenzweig suggested that patches were welcome but that she did not see
that as a high priority ("<q>frankly, I think ray tracing is a bit of a
gimmick feature</q>").  Apple hardware only supports it with the M3 and
the current driver is for M1 and M2 GPUs, though she plans to start working
on M3 before long.  The session concluded soon after that, though
Rosenzweig played Control, admittedly poorly, as time ran down.
