<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Not content to wait for open letters to influence the European Commission, Dutch parliamentarians have taken matters into their own hands by passing eight motions urging the government to ditch US-made tech for homegrown alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>With each IT service our government moves to American tech giants, we become dumber and weaker...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The motions were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweedekamer.nl/debat_en_vergadering/plenaire_vergaderingen/details/activiteit?id=2025A02077#:~:text=Moties%20ingediend%20bij%20het%20debat%20over%20migraties%20van%20overheids%2DICT%20naar%20het%20buitenland" rel="nofollow">submitted</a> and all passed yesterday during a discussion in the Netherlands' House of Representatives on concerns about government data being shipped overseas. While varied, they all center on the theme of calling on the government to replace software and hardware made by US tech companies, acquire new contracts with Dutch companies who offer similar services, and generally safeguard the country's digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>"With each IT service our government moves to American tech giants, we become dumber and weaker," Dutch MP Barbara Kathmann, author of four of the motions, told <em>The Register</em>. "If we continue outsourcing all of our digital infrastructure to billionaires that would rather escape Earth by building space rockets, there will be no Dutch expertise left."</p>
<p>Kathmann's measures specifically call on the government to stop the migration of Dutch information and communications technology to American cloud services, the creation of a Dutch national cloud, the repatriation of the .nl top-level domain to systems operating within the Netherlands, and for the preparation of risk analyses and exit strategies for all government systems hosted by US tech giants. The other measures make similar calls for eliminating the presence of US tech companies in government systems and the preference of local alternatives.</p>
<p>"We have identified the causes of our full dependency on US services," Kathmann told us. "We have to start somewhere – by pausing all thoughtless migrations to American hyperscalers, new opportunities open up for Dutch and European providers."</p>

    

<p>The motions passed by the Dutch parliament come as the Trump administration ratchets up tensions with a number of US allies – the EU among them. Nearly 100 EU-based tech companies and lobbyists sent an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/17/european_tech_sovereign_fund/">open letter</a> to the European Commission this week asking it to find a way to divest the bloc from systems managed by US companies due to "the stark geopolitical reality Europe is now facing."</p>

        


        

<p>Concerns over European reliance on US tech companies are mounting, with tech experts in the EU <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/03/microsoft_unveils_a_finalized_eu/">sounding the call</a> as the Trump administration's international posture becomes increasingly bellicose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boffins in the Netherlands, in particular, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/26/europe_has_second_thoughts_about/">rang the alarm</a> in February, with Dutch Electoral Council technical advisor Bert Hubert warning that using US cloud services was no longer safe for either the government or civil society.</p>

        

<p>It's perhaps for that reason that parliamentarians have been considering the motions passed yesterday for a while, as Kathmann explained.</p>
<p>"The US government has made the call for tech sovereignty an urgent geopolitical issue," Kathmann said. "We support EU tech's open letter, but these motions have a longer history."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/24/trump_administration_dst_countertariffs/">Trump administration threatens tariffs for any nation that dares to tax Big Tech</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/03/eu_ai_legistlation/">EU lassos tech giants in bid to rein in the AI Wild West</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/19/congress_eu_dma_complaint/">Biden urged to do something about Europe 'unfairly' targeting American tech</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Kathmann told us her party, an opposition coalition of the Green and Labor parties, had been working with the governing centrist party, New Social Contract, to develop a new Dutch-centric tech plan since last year, the need for which has been made more pressing as American rhetoric shifts.</p>
<p>"The willingness of the Trump government to use their Big Tech monopoly to put political pressure on European governments, like the threat made to the International Criminal Court, and the attack on European tech laws (DSA, DMA) by VP Vance at the Munich Security Council, have shaken up Dutch politics," Kathmann said.</p>
<h3>Will the government actually act?</h3>
<p>If the Dutch government takes action, the Netherlands would be the first European nation to repatriate its tech stack from US companies as relations sour. The government is under no obligation to conform to the nonbinding motions, however.</p>
<p>"With eight out of eight proposals passed, it's almost impossible for the government to not take action," Kathmann insisted. "The State Secretary is not legally obligated to follow up on motions, but not acting on such a broad majority in parliament is nearly unheard of."</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the House of Representatives told us "almost all" motions put to the House are accepted, which may mean that the eight-for-eight passage puts less pressure on the government than Kathmann hopes.</p>

        

<p>That said, a ninth measure discussed alongside the other eight motions also passed, and the government has already accepted it. That particular measure, which asks the government to increase cooperation in the government service when it comes to implementing information provisions and digitization policies, doesn't mention divestment from US tech companies. Nonetheless, its passage signals the government is paying attention.</p>
<p>"Our party will do whatever we can to keep the government to the parliamentary calls to action," Kathmann said.&nbsp;®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-index="0" data-js="panel" data-type="wysiwyg-with-aside" data-modular-content="" data-modular-content-collection="">
<p>Drawing separator lines between various sections of a webpage is a common design technique, which can help to structure the content and make it more readable, as well as more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>As we’ll see in this article, there are techniques you can use today to draw separator lines with CSS, but they also come with limitations.</p>
<p>In this article, we’re introducing <strong>CSS gap decorations</strong>, a <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/CSSGapDecorations/explainer.md">new proposal</a> which we would love <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/issues/new?template=css-gap-decorations.md">your feedback</a> on. If this is of interest to you, read this article and help us shape the future of CSS by providing your feedback.</p>
<h2>Existing workarounds and limitations</h2>
<p>Using the <code>border</code> CSS property is a very common way to draw separators. However, it also comes with limitations and, with today’s CSS layout techniques, such as CSS Grid and Flexbox, using borders can often be in the way of simpler code.</p>
<p>Imagine a Flexbox container, with multiple items laid out horizontally:</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/border-workaround.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/border-workaround.png" alt="A three column layout. Each column has an image and some text. Vertical lines visually separate the columns." width="1200" height="237"></a></p></figure>
<p>One way to display a vertical separator between the items is to add a border to the right, or left, of each item. Some of the drawbacks with this solution are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a border changes the size of the items, which might not be desirable.</li>
<li>This technique requires you to write special code for the first or last item, to avoid drawing an extra border before or after that item.</li>
<li>Borders are tied to items, not to the layout the items are in. Imagine a flexbox layout with multiple wrapping lines. With a border, you wouldn’t be able to display a separator line that spans the entire horizontal space between the multiple wrapping flex lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to display separators is to use the <code>::before</code> or <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements. Each flex item would position a pseudo-element either before or after itself, such that it sits in between the items. One advantage here is that pseudo-elements support all the styling properties that normal elements do, allowing you to be very creative with your separator lines. However, this is still a workaround which also comes with drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special code is needed for the first or last item, as before.</li>
<li>Some complex absolute positioning code is needed to position the separator line, which requires you to know the size of the gaps between the items.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make things more complicated, imagine another example where a CSS grid container defines a few rows and columns, and where some grid items occupy one cell, while others span multiple cells:</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/complex-layout-example.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/complex-layout-example.png" alt="A more complex layout with 3 rows and 4 coloumns. Cells contain text and/or images. Some cells span multiple rows, others span multiple columns." width="1200" height="509"></a></p></figure>
<p>Using CSS borders or pseudo-elements to add separators between items of the grid can quickly get complicated. This is especially true if the grid is responsive and the items don’t always occupy the same position or span the same number of cells.</p>
<p>One workaround you can use in this case is to artificially draw separators by letting the grid container’s background color show through a grid gap, and making the grid items match the background color of the page.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="css">body {
  background: white;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: repeat(4, 1fr) / repeat(3, 1fr);
  /* Adding a 2px gap between cells. */
  gap: 2px;
  /* Setting the color of the gap by giving the container a background color. */
  background: black;
}

.item {
  /* Hiding the background of the container by giving items a background color. */
  background: white;
}</pre>
<p>This creates the illusion of separator lines between the grid cells. This technique addresses the issues that the previous methods faced because the <code>gap</code> CSS property handles the complicated logic of knowing where the space between the items is located. You no longer need to know where to place borders or pseudo-elements.</p>
<p>However, this is also just a workaround which falls short in some cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the length of the separator lines isn’t possible. The lines will always fill as much of the gap between the cells as they can.</li>
<li>If the grid contains one or more empty cells, the background color of the container will be visible in those cells, breaking the illusion of the separator lines.</li>
<li>If the grid items don’t stretch and fill their assigned cells (e.g. <code>place-self: center</code>), then the background color of the grid container will also be visible outside of the gap areas.</li>
<li>Finally, this technique doesn’t work if your page background isn’t a plain color.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more way to draw lines between sections of content in a layout is to use the <code>column-rule</code> CSS property, which works in multi-column layouts.</p>
<p>If your content can be laid out in columns and if you only need separators between those columns, then using multi-column layout is a great option.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/multi-column.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/multi-column.png" alt="A multi-column layout with text flowing through three vertical columns. The columns are visually separated by vertical lines." width="1200" height="250"></a></p></figure>
<p>However, this only work in multi-column layouts, which might not always be the right solution, depending on what you’re trying to achieve. For example, in a multi-column layout you can’t control where content goes in the inline direction, only in the block direction.</p>
<h2>The CSS gap decorations proposal</h2>
<p>We’re introducing a new solution to address the above shortcomings: <strong>CSS gap decorations</strong>.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, you can already use the <code>column-rule</code> CSS property (and corresponding <code>column-rule-*</code> longhand properties) to draw lines between columns in a multi-column layout. With CSS gap decorations, we’re proposing to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend the property to apply to other layout types, such as grid and flexbox.</li>
<li>Introduce the <code>row-rule</code> property to match with <code>column-rule</code>.</li>
<li>Expand the syntax of these properties to allow for different gap decorations in different parts of a container.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example demonstrating how the proposed <code>row-rule</code> property, and its new syntax, allows for multiple decorations to be defined:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="css">alternate-red-blue {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: repeat(auto-fill, 30px) / repeat(6, 100px);
  gap: 10px;
  row-rule: 1px solid;
  row-rule-color: red blue;
}</pre>
<p>The multiple color values in the <code>row-rule-color</code> property are used to alternate the color of the row gap decorations, as shown below:</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/alternating-decorations.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/alternating-decorations.png" alt="Grid layout with five columns and five rows. Each cell of the grid contains some text. The rows are separated visually by alternating red and blue horizontal bars." width="1200" height="529"></a></p></figure>
<p>A similar syntax could be used to define a thicker line on the first and last row of a grid, and a thinner one on the other rows:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="css">.varying-widths {
  dispay: grid;
  grid-template: repeat(auto-fill, 30px) / repeat(6, 100px);
  row-gap: 10px;
  row-rule: 5px solid black / repeat(auto, 1px solid #666) / 3px solid black;
}</pre>
<p>The proposal also makes it possible to fine-tune gap decorations using additional properties. The <code>*-rule-break</code> and <code>*-rule-outset</code> properties control where gap decorations start and end relative to items in the container, including spanning items.</p>
<p>For example, you can make your gap decorations extend as far as possible along the centerline of a given gap, or stop at intersections, and even fine-tune how much of an offset you want between the decoration and the intersection, and in a way that even works when there are spanning grid items.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/gap-intersection-fine-tuning.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/gap-intersection-fine-tuning.png" alt="Three variants of a 4 by 4 grid layout. Some of the cells span multiple columns, others span multiple rows. Rows are separated by red lines. Columns are separated by blue lines. The variants show that the lines can either extend to the entire track length, or stop at intersections, and that the offset at which they stop can be changed." width="1200" height="360"></a></p></figure>
<h2>Help us shape the proposal</h2>
<p>We’re excited about the CSS gap decorations proposal and want to make sure it matches your needs. Developer feedback as early as possible is crucial for building useful APIs and features.</p>
<p>To learn more about our proposal, <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/CSSGapDecorations/explainer.md">read the explainer</a>. If you have any feedback about it, please let us know by <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/issues/new?template=css-gap-decorations.md">opening an issue in our GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>One specific area where we would love more feedback is controlling the behavior of gap decorations at intersections. But we also welcome any other feedback on the proposal: suggestions for things we might be missing, scenarios that we might be overlooking, anecdotes of when you could’ve used this, or even just a general <em>“this sounds cool”</em> message.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.feldera.com/blog/the-pain-that-is-github-actions">https://www.feldera.com/blog/the-pain-that-is-github-actions</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43419701">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="04f7954960b1">For the past two weeks, I’ve been spending most of my time rewriting our CI scripts in GitHub Actions. This is the third time we’ve had to redo our CI setup—first GitHub Actions, then <a href="https://earthly.dev/">Earthly</a> (which we moved away from because it was discontinued), and now, reluctantly, back to GitHub Actions.</p><p id="07dc3a94dbeb">Our CI is complex: merge queues, multiple runners (self-hosted, <a href="https://blacksmith.sh/">blacksmith.sh</a>, GitHub-hosted), Rust builds, Docker images, and heavy integration tests. Every PR we merge burns through an hour of CI time, running across multiple parallel runners.</p><p id="8c6854fbbe43">There are a few things we'd like to have (which we deem as "good software practice") but it's nothing unheard of:</p><ol><li>Everything that goes into `main` must pass all tests.</li><li>Trivial mistakes (formatting, unused deps, lint issues) should be fixed automatically, not cause failures.</li><li>The artifacts we test with in CI should be the exact ones we release.</li><li>CI should complete quickly (to keep developers happy).</li></ol><p id="834216755732">GitHub Actions technically allows all of this—but setting it up is a frustrating mess, full of hidden gotchas, inconsistent behavior, and a debugging experience that makes me question my choices.</p><h3 id="56a4dbb8bf83">Strange Way to Enforce Status Checks with Merge Queue</h3><p id="fd16fccbbdb2">The key to enforcing a clean <code>main</code> branch is GitHub’s <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue">merge queue</a>, which rebases a PR onto <code>main</code> before running CI. Sounds great. But here’s the fun part:</p><ul><li>We need CI to run <em>before</em> entering the queue to auto-fix trivial issues.</li><li>We need CI to run <em>again</em> inside the queue to verify the final merge.</li><li>GitHub Actions makes it weirdly hard to require both runs to pass.</li></ul><p id="8e1619327bba">The solution? <strong>Name the jobs identically</strong> in both phases. That’s it. GitHub treats them as the same check, so they both need to succeed. Solved by reading this answer in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76655935/when-does-a-github-workflow-trigger-for-merge-group-and-is-it-restricted-by-bran/78030618#78030618">Stack Overflow post</a> after a few hours of debugging. Any other way you try to do this leads to either status checks being awaited before you put something in the queue (so it never starts the job) or worse, things just get merged even if the job you'd like to pass in the merge queue fails.</p><h3 id="d7687fc57c00">A security nightmare?</h3><p id="e118b355141b">A few days ago, someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43368870">compromised a popular GitHub Action</a>. The response? "Just pin your dependencies to a hash." Except as comments also pointed out, almost no one does.</p><p id="be904b86b98a">Even setting aside supply chain attacks, GitHub’s security model is a confusing maze to me: My point of view is that if I can't understand a security model easily it's probably doomed to fail or break at some point. Disclaimer: I'm writing this as a github actions user with only a vague understanding of it so I'd be delighted to hear that it is not just "things piled on top of things until it's safe", which is my current impression. I do understand very well that the problem of having secure CI for distributed source control is complicated.</p><p id="57fa6b17ef27">In github, there is a "default" token called <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. The way it works is that it gets initialized with some default permissions. You can set that default in the settings of your repository (under Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Workflow Permissions). Here is what the github documentation says about it:</p><blockquote><p>If the default permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN are restrictive, you may have to elevate the permissions to allow some actions and commands to run successfully. If the default permissions are permissive, you can edit the workflow file to remove some permissions from the GITHUB_TOKEN.</p><span>- Github Documenation</span></blockquote><p id="34005ba8540c">Removing permission that aren't necessary sounds nice (though I do think a better "default" would be to start with <strong>no privileges</strong> and require the user to add whatever is needed). Unfortunately, there are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions">many of them</a> and it's hardly clear for all of them what they are protecting if you're not a github expert.</p><p id="39fa8482d7a0">Your workflow permissions also don’t really depend on the action itself. Here is an example of such an instance, I'm using <code>softprops/action-gh-release</code> to automatically create a new release on github</p><div><pre><code><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name:</span><span> </span><span>Release</span><span> </span><span>on</span><span> </span><span>GitHub</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>if:</span><span> </span><span>env.version_exists</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>'false'</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>uses:</span><span> </span><span>softprops/action-gh-release@v2</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>with:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>tag_name:</span><span> </span><span>v${{</span><span> </span><span>env.CURRENT_VERSION</span><span> </span><span>}}</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>generate_release_notes:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>make_latest:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>token:</span><span> </span><span>${{</span><span> </span><span>secrets.CI_RELEASE</span><span> </span><span>}}</span></code></pre></div><p id="1acd29788f81">Why do I need a custom token? Because without it, the release completes, but doesn’t trigger our post-release workflow. The sad part is that you don't get any indication about it until you eventually <a href="https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/issues/59">find an issue</a> where someone had the same problem and that leads you in the right direction.</p><p id="cfe2d1a4c40f">You can also elevate permissions in your workflow yaml file. That seems like a strange thing to do inside the code you're trying to protect. At least there are some limitations according to the github docs:</p><p id="daddc3d76619">You can use the <code>permissions</code> key to add and remove read permissions for forked repositories, but typically you can't grant write access. The exception to this behavior is where an admin user has selected the <strong>Send write tokens to workflows from pull requests</strong> option in the GitHub Actions settings. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks">Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository</a>.</p><p id="678e558d777b">This is just one of many instances which I believe is the root of what makes the github actions security model so obscure: there are too many pitfalls accompanied by exceptions that you have to account for. Clearly the system is very powerful and allows you to do many things but it also expands the attack surface for breaking things.</p><p id="e00abccbfba2">As far as I can tell I'm not alone in this. Another instance of the same problem I ran into is when I read <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners">this paragraph</a> where they recommend that you don't use self-hosted runners in public repositories:</p><blockquote><p>We recommend that you only use self-hosted runners with private repositories. This is because forks of your public repository can potentially run dangerous code on your self-hosted runner machine by creating a pull request that executes the code in a workflow.</p><span>- Github Documentation</span></blockquote><p id="20e7090b06ce">However, github also has a setting for self-hosted runners where pull-requests from external collaborators need to be approved before running. A practical question that comes up for me is "are self-hosted runners in combination with this setting safe"? I do believe so, but github documentation doesn't say and there is no consensus in the rest of the internet about it. It's hard to be 100% confident given how much complexity there is. Even github documentation writers don't seem to understand their security model anymore.</p><h3 id="33b01436e240">Docker and Github Actions, an Unholy Combination</h3><p id="4ea29a97fd50">If you thought GitHub Actions was bad, try mixing in Docker.</p><p id="3cc29b3a3a20">GitHub lets you <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/running-jobs-in-a-container">run jobs inside a container</a>. This is great in theory—you can prepackage dependencies into a dev container instead of installing them every run. In practice:</p><ol><li>File permissions break constantly. A container builds files as one user, but GitHub runners may use another (different uid and gid) to run it. So it may be unable to either access the files in the container or in the github workspace and temporary host directories that get mounted.</li><li>The <code>$HOME</code> directory moves. Your dev container may install tools into <code>/home/ubuntu</code>, but inside GitHub Actions, it’s suddenly <code>/github/home</code>. Tools that rely on files in <code>$HOME</code> may no longer find them.</li><li>Any action that interacts with the host system might break now. For example, I use <a href="https://docs.blacksmith.sh/github-actions-runners/sticky-disks">blacksmith’s sticky disk action</a> to mount an NVMe drive for caching (since GitHub caches are limited to 10GB). It didn’t work inside a container until <a href="https://docs.blacksmith.sh/github-actions-runners/sticky-disks#using-sticky-disks-inside-a-container">they made a fix for me</a> (thanks to Aditya Jayaprakash from blacksmith.sh for the one day turn-around time on this!).</li></ol><p id="37c2cef1c9a2">Meanwhile, the <code>container</code> field itself has weird limitations. Want to override the entrypoint? Nope. Want to run <em>some</em> steps inside a container and others outside? Nope.</p><h3 id="15cb942fcdc2">Developing Workflows with YAML</h3><p id="8e060b2d72ac">All of this logic you end up writing in YAML can unfortunately get complicated pretty quickly and you're bound to make mistakes. I was using RustRover as my IDE when writing the YAML which had some linter checks for github YAML built-in and it helped a lot. I still found myself wishing for much better static checking for all of this. It doesn't help that you can't really try any of this locally (I know of <a href="https://github.com/nektos/act">act</a> but it only supports a small subset of the things you're trying to do in CI). I found that the best way to debug CI is to create an identical repo to the one you're trying to make changes for and do <code>git commit -a -m "wip" &amp;&amp; git push test-ci branch</code> until CI works as expected.</p><p id="d0bc10f501f0">Since I didn't want to run the whole CI pipeline every time I made a change, I tried to keep individual workflows small and have them push artifacts at the end of their steps, then subsequent workflows could download the artifacts and re-use them instead of rebuilding everything from scratch. This lets you test workflows in isolation because you can just download artifacts from a previous run until it works (of course when downloading from a previous run one needs to provide a token to the download-artifact action, but this can just be the default token. Why does it still need to be provided then is yet another unsolved mystery...).</p><p id="215acba7bd25">The main workflow file then becomes a chain of invoking other YAML files:</p><div><pre><code><span>jobs:</span><span>

                <!-- Course Introduction -->
                <h3>The Course</h3>
                <p>
                    “Deep Learning” systems, typified by deep neural networks, are increasingly taking over all the AI
                    tasks, ranging from language understanding, speech and image recognition, to machine translation,
                    planning, and even game playing and autonomous driving. As a result, expertise in deep learning is 
                    fast changing from an esoteric desirable to a mandatory prerequisite in many advanced academic 
                    settings, and a large advantage in the industrial job market.
                </p>
                <p> In this course we will learn about the basics of deep neural networks, and their applications to
                    various AI tasks. By the end of the course, it is expected that students will have significant 
                    familiarity with the subject, and be able to apply Deep Learning to a variety of tasks. They will 
                    also be positioned to understand much of the current literature on the topic and extend their 
                    knowledge through further study.

                <h3>Course Description from a Student's Perspective</h3>
                <p> 
                    The course is well rounded in terms of concepts. It helps us understand the fundamentals of Deep
                    Learning. The course starts off gradually with MLPs and it progresses into the more complicated
                    concepts
                    such as attention and sequence-to-sequence models. We get a complete hands on with PyTorch which is
                    very
                    important to implement Deep Learning models. As a student, you will learn the tools required for
                    building Deep Learning models. The homeworks usually have 2 components which is Autolab and Kaggle.
                    The
                    Kaggle components allow us to explore multiple architectures and understand how to fine-tune and
                    continuously improve models. The task for all the homeworks were similar and it was interesting to
                    learn
                    how the same task can be solved using multiple Deep Learning approaches. Overall, at the end of this
                    course you will be confident enough to build and tune Deep Learning models.
                </p>

                <!-- Prerequisites -->
                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>We will be using Numpy and PyTorch in this class, so you will need to be able to program in
                        python3.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will need familiarity with basic calculus (differentiation, chain rule), linear algebra, and
                        basic probability. </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Units</h3>
                <p>Courses 11-785 and 11-685 are equivalent 12-unit graduate courses, and have a final project and HW5
                    respectively. <br>
                    Course 11-485 is the undergraduate version worth 9 units, the only difference being that there is no
                    final project or HW5.
                </p>

                                                    will automatically lose 10% of subsequent marks they may get on the
                                                    homework. This is intended to encourage students to begin working on

                                            The Peer Review assignment is required of all students, 11-485/685/785. 
                                            The task is for all students to review and grade 4-6 of the videos. 
                                            It is to be completed over the last weekend, after classes finish (but before finals week). 
                                            We will tell you which projects you have been assigned to review; each review should take around 15~20 minutes. 
                                            Here is what we expect you to do for each review:
                                            </li><li> Watch the video carefully. As you watch the video, jot down some notes/concerns/questions that you might have.</li>
                                            <li>Reference the initial report to clear up any confusion.</li>
                                            <li>You must post at least one comment to the corresponding Piazza post of your reviewee. 
                                                This comment must be a meaningful question or concern that demonstrates you have understood the material.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Finally, fill out the project review form carefully. More details will be shared over Piazza.</li>

                <p>
                    We believe that effective collaboration can greatly enhance student learning.
                    Thus, this course employs study groups for both quizzes and homework ablations.
                    It is highly recommended that you join a study group; Check piazza for further updates.

                    the start of the semester. If not, please sign up <a href="https://www.piazza.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    Also, please follow the <ahref="etiquette.html">Piazza Etiquette when you use the piazza forum.</ahref="etiquette.html"></p>

                <h3>AutoLab: Software Engineering</h3>
                <p><b>AutoLab</b> is what we use to
                    test your understand of low-level concepts, such as engineering your own libraries, implementing
                    important algorithms, and developing optimization methods from scratch.</p>

                <h3>Kaggle: Data Science</h3>
                <p><a href="https://kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is where we test your understanding and ability to extend
                    neural network architectures discussed in lecture. Similar to how AutoLab shows scores, Kaggle also shows
                    scores, so don't feel intimidated -- we're here to help. We work on hot AI topics, like speech
                    recognition, face recognition, and neural machine translation.</p>

                <h3>MediaServices/YouTube: Lecture and Recitation Recordings</h3>
                <p> CMU students who are not in the live lectures should watch the uploaded lectures at <b><a href="https://mediaservices.cmu.edu/channel/11785-+Introduction+to+Deep+Learning/" target="_blank">MediaServices</a></b>
                    in order to get attendance credit. Links to individual videos will be

                <h3>Books and Other Resources</h3>
                <p>The course will not follow a specific book, but will draw from a number of sources. We list relevant
                    books at the end of this page. We will also put up links to relevant reading material for each
                    class. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the material before the class. The
                    readings will sometimes be arcane and difficult to understand; if so, do not worry, we will present
                    simpler explanations in class.</p>

                <p>You can also find a nice catalog of models that are current in the literature <a href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/concise-visual-summary-of-deep-learning-architectures" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    We expect that you will be in a position to interpret, if not fully understand many of the
                    architectures on the wiki and the catalog by the end of the course.</p>

<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument collaboration has publicly released the first 13 months of data from its main survey — a treasure trove that will help other researchers investigate big questions in astrophysics.</span></li>
<li><span>Although DESI’s Data Release 1 is only a fraction of what the experiment will capture, the 270-terabyte dataset holds a vast amount of information, including precise distances to millions of galaxies.</span></li>
<li><span>DESI’s data release contains more than twice as many unique objects outside our galaxy as in all previous 3D spectroscopic surveys combined.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (<a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DESI</span></a>) is mapping millions of celestial objects to better understand dark energy: the mysterious driver of our universe’s accelerating expansion. Today, the DESI collaboration released a new collection of data for anyone in the world to investigate. The dataset is the largest of its kind, with information on 18.7 million objects:&nbsp;roughly 4 million stars, 13.1 million galaxies, and 1.6 million quasars (extremely bright but distant objects powered by supermassive black holes at their cores).</p>
<p>While the experiment’s main mission is illuminating dark energy, <a href="https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DESI’s Data Release 1 (DR1)</span></a> could yield discoveries in other areas of astrophysics, such as the evolution of galaxies and black holes, the nature of dark matter, and the structure of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>“DR1 already gave the DESI collaboration hints that we might need to rethink our standard model of cosmology,” said Stephen Bailey, a scientist who leads data management for DESI and works at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). “But these world-class datasets are also valuable for the rest of the astronomy community to test a huge wealth of other ideas, and we’re excited to see the breadth of research that will come out.”</p>

    <p><span>DESI is an international experiment that brings together more than 900 researchers from over 70 institutions. The project is led by Berkeley Lab, and the instrument was constructed and is operated with funding from the DOE Office of Science. DESI is mounted on the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope at </span><a href="https://kpno.noirlab.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kitt Peak National Observatory</span></a><span> (a program of NSF NOIRLab) in Arizona.</span></p>
<p><span>DESI’s data release </span><a href="https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>is free and available to access</span></a><span> through the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (</span><a href="https://www.nersc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NERSC</span></a><span>), a facility at Berkeley Lab where DESI processes and stores data. Space fans can also explore some of DESI’s data through an interactive portal: the </span><a href="https://www.legacysurvey.org/viewer/desi-dr1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Legacy Survey Sky Browser.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The new dataset vastly expands </span><a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2023/06/13/desi-early-data-release-holds-nearly-two-million-objects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DESI’s Early Data Release</span></a><span> (EDR), containing roughly 10 times as much data and covering seven times the area of sky. DR1 includes information from the first year of the “main survey” collected between May 2021 and June 2022, as well as from the preceding five-month “survey validation” where researchers tested the experiment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Objects in DESI’s catalog range from nearby stars in our own Milky Way to galaxies billions of light-years away. Because of the time it takes light to travel to Earth, looking out in space is akin to looking back in time. DESI lets us see our universe at different ages, from the present day to 11 billion years ago.</span></p>

    <p><span>Although DR1 is just a fraction of what DESI will eventually produce, the 270-terabyte dataset represents a staggering amount of information, including precise distances to millions of galaxies. The release contains more than twice as many extragalactic objects (those found outside our galaxy) as have been collected in all previous 3D surveys combined.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Within its first year of operations, DESI became the single largest spectroscopic redshift survey ever conducted, sometimes capturing data on more than 1 million objects in a single month. For comparison, its predecessor, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), collected light from 9 million unique objects over roughly 25 years of operations. In 2024, DESI researchers used the data in DR1 to create </span><a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2024/04/04/desi-first-results-make-most-precise-measurement-of-expanding-universe/"><span>the largest 3D map of our universe</span></a><span> to date and make world-leading measurements of dark energy.</span></p>
<p><span>“The DESI project has maintained the pace of making 3D maps of the universe that are 10 times larger every decade,” said David Schlegel, one of the lead scientists at Berkeley Lab for both DESI and SDSS. “That’s our version of Moore’s Law for cosmology surveys. The rapid advance is powered by the clever combination of improved instrument designs, technologies, and analysis of ever-fainter galaxies.”</span></p>
<h2>Large-scale science for a large-scale audience</h2>
<p><span>DESI collects light from distant galaxies by using 5,000 fiber-optic “eyes.” Under clear observing conditions, the instrument can gather a new set of 5,000 objects roughly every 20 minutes, or more than 100,000 galaxies in one night. “DESI is unlike any other machine in terms of its ability to observe independent objects simultaneously,” said John Moustakas, a professor of physics at Siena College and co-lead of DR1.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The instrument separates the light from each galaxy into its spectrum of colors. This lets researchers determine how much the light has been “redshifted,” or stretched toward the red end of the spectrum by the universe’s expansion. Measuring the redshift of light from a distant object tells scientists how far away it is, meaning DESI can map the cosmos in three dimensions and reconstruct a detailed history of cosmic growth.</span></p>

    <p><span>Every night, the images taken by DESI are automatically transferred to supercomputers at NERSC. The facility analyzes the data and sends them back to the researchers — a process they’re proud to advertise as “redshifts before breakfast.” This data transfer takes place via </span><a href="https://www.es.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ESnet</span></a><span>, the DOE’s dedicated high-speed network for science. The approach represents a new way of doing research where experimental facilities and data analysis are tightly coupled. This ecosystem forms an integrated research infrastructure that drastically accelerates the pace of science.</span></p>
<p><span>“For this data release, we made it so DESI could run on our most advanced supercomputer, </span><i><span>Perlmutter</span></i><span>,” said Daniel Margala, a scientific data architect at NERSC and part of the team that supports the DESI data processing. The transition to </span><i><span>Perlmutter</span></i><span> lets researchers take advantage of the supercomputer’s powerful GPUs (graphics processing units), processing the data nearly 40 times faster than was possible on previous NERSC systems. “What would have taken months on Cori [a prior-generation supercomputer] takes only weeks on </span><i><span>Perlmutter</span></i><span>.”</span></p>
<p><span>Even though they analyze data every night, researchers are always making improvements to their code to get the most possible information out of the light they collect. Once they hit a milestone, like collecting data for one year, they reprocess the full dataset with the best version of the code. It took about a month to crunch the DR1 dataset on </span><i><span>Perlmutter</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>That speed will be important as DESI collects even more data. The project is currently in its fourth of five years of data collection and aims to record spectra for more than 50 million galaxies and quasars before it ends.</span></p>

                    <p>
                        Given one or more input images, we generate multi-view Splatter Images.
                        To do so, we first generate the scene appearance and geometry using a multi-view diffusion
                        model.
                        Then, Splatter Images are regressed using a Gaussian Head.
                        3D Gaussians from multiple Splatter Images are combined to form the 3D scene.

                            The key to generating high-quality 3D scenes with a latent diffusion model is our Geometry
                            VAE,
                            capable of compressing pointmaps with high accuracy.
                            We find empirically that our VAE with a transformer decoder is more appropriate for
                            autoencoding pointmaps
                            than a VAE with a convolutional decoder or a VAE pre-trained for autoencoding images.
                            Below we visualize colored point clouds using (1) Pointmaps from data, (2) Pointmaps
                            autoencoded with our VAE,
                            (3) Pointmaps autoencoded with a VAE with a convolutional decoder and (4) Pointmaps
                            autoencoded with a pre-trained Image VAE.

                        Our method gives feed-forward 3D reconstruction models generative capabilities,
                        and significantly reduces inference cost compared to optimization-based methods.

  Description: Look up more information on the web
  Parameters:
    - query (str): What to search for

[2] answer
  Description: Answer the question with current knowledge
  Parameters:
    - answer (str): Final answer to the question

## NEXT ACTION
Decide the next action based on the context and available actions.
Return your response in this format:

```yaml
thinking: |
    &lt;your step-by-step reasoning process&gt;
action: search OR answer
reason: &lt;why you chose this action&gt;
search_query: &lt;specific search query if action is search&gt;
```"""

        # Call the LLM to make a decision
        response = call_llm(prompt)

        # Pull out just the organized information part from the LLM's answer
        # (This is like finding just the recipe part of a cooking video)
        yaml_str = response.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
        decision = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)  # Convert the text into a format our program can use

        return decision</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>exec</code><span> method is where the actual "thinking" happens. Think of it like the chef cooking the ingredients. Here, we:</span></p><ol><li><p>Create a prompt that explains the current situation to the LLM</p></li><li><p>Ask the LLM to decide whether to search or answer</p></li><li><p>Parse the response to get a clear decision</p></li></ol><p>Finally, let's save the decision and tell the flow what to do next:</p><pre><code><code>    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):

        # Return which action to take - this tells our flow where to go next!
        return exec_res["action"]  # Will be either "search" or "answer"</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>post</code><span> method is where we save results and decide what happens next. Think of it like the chef serving the food and deciding what dish to prepare next. We save the search query if needed, and then return either "search" or "answer" to tell our flow which node to visit next.</span></p><p><span>The </span><strong>SearchWeb</strong><span> node is our "researcher." Its only job is to:</span></p><ol><li><p>Take a search query</p></li><li><p>Look it up (in this simple example, we'll fake the results)</p></li><li><p>Save what it finds</p></li><li><p>Tell the agent to decide what to do with this new information</p></li></ol><p>Let's build it:</p><pre><code><code>class SearchWeb(Node):

        # Simply get the search query we saved earlier
        return shared["search_query"]</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>prep</code><span> method here just grabs the search query that was saved by the DecideAction node.</span></p><pre><code><code>    def exec(self, search_query):
        # This is where we'd connect to Google to search the internet
        # Set up our connection to Google
        search_client = GoogleSearchAPI(api_key="GOOGLE_API_KEY")

        # Set search parameters

### CONTEXT
Based on the following information, answer the question.
Question: {question}
Research: {context}

## YOUR ANSWER:
Provide a comprehensive answer using the research results.
"""
        return call_llm(prompt)</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>exec</code><span> method asks the LLM to create a helpful answer based on our research.</span></p><pre><code><code>    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        # Save the answer in our shared whiteboard
        shared["answer"] = exec_res

        # We're done! No need to continue the flow.
        return "done"</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>post</code><span> method saves the final answer and returns "done" to indicate that our flow is complete.</span></p><p>Now for the fun part - we need to connect all our nodes together to create a working agent!</p><pre><code><code># First, create instances of each node
decide = DecideAction()
search = SearchWeb()
answer = AnswerQuestion()

# Now connect them together - this is where the magic happens!
# Each connection defines where to go based on the action returned by post()

# If DecideAction returns "search", go to SearchWeb
decide - "search" &gt;&gt; search

# If DecideAction returns "answer", go to AnswerQuestion
decide - "answer" &gt;&gt; answer

# After SearchWeb completes, go back to DecideAction
search - "decide" &gt;&gt; decide

# Create our flow, starting with the DecideAction node
flow = Flow(start=decide)</code></code></pre><p>That's it! We've connected our nodes into a complete flow that can:</p><ol><li><p>Start by deciding what to do</p></li><li><p>Search for information if needed</p></li><li><p>Loop back to decide if we need more information</p></li><li><p>Answer the question when we're ready</p></li></ol><p>Think of it like a flowchart where each box is a node, and the arrows show where to go next based on decisions made along the way.</p><p>Now let's see our agent in action:</p><pre><code><code># Create a shared whiteboard with just a question
shared = {"question": "What is the capital of France?"}

# Run our flow!
flow.run(shared)

# Print the final answer
print(shared["answer"])</code></code></pre><p>Here's what happens when our agent runs:</p><p>First, our agent thinks about the question:</p><pre><code><code>thinking: |
  The question is asking about the capital of France. I don't have any prior search results to work with.
  To answer this question accurately, I should search for information about France's capital.
action: search
reason: I need to look up information about the capital of France
search_query: capital of France</code></code></pre><p>Our agent decides it doesn't know enough yet, so it needs to search for information.</p><p>The SearchWeb node now searches for "capital of France" and gets these results:</p><pre><code><code>Results for: capital of France
- The capital of France is Paris
- Paris is known as the City of Light</code></code></pre><p>It saves these results to our shared context.</p><p>Our agent looks at the question again, but now it has some search results:</p><pre><code><code>thinking: |
  Now I have search results that clearly state "The capital of France is Paris".
  This directly answers the question, so I can provide a final answer.
action: answer
reason: I now have the information needed to answer the question</code></code></pre><p>This time, our agent decides it has enough information to answer!</p><p>Finally, the AnswerQuestion node generates a helpful response:</p><pre><code><code>The capital of France is Paris, which is also known as the City of Light.</code></code></pre><p>And we're done! Our agent has successfully:</p><ol><li><p>Realized it needed to search for information</p></li><li><p>Performed a search</p></li><li><p>Decided it had enough information</p></li><li><p>Generated a helpful answer</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg" width="800" height="552" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:552,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Whole Process Visualized&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="The Whole Process Visualized" title="The Whole Process Visualized" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>If you’re technically inclined and want to read or experiment with the complete code for this tutorial, you can find it </span><a href="https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow/tree/main/cookbook/pocketflow-agent" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a><span>!</span></p><p>You can also see how this same loop-and-branch pattern appears in larger frameworks by checking out these snippets:</p><ul><li><p><strong>OpenAI Agents</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/48ff99bb736249e99251eb2c7ecf00237488c17a/src/agents/run.py#L119" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">run.py#L119</a><span> for a workflow in graph.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Pydantic Agents</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/4c0f384a0626299382c22a8e3372638885e18286/pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/_agent_graph.py#L779" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">_agent_graph.py#L779</a><span> organizes steps in a graph.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Langchain</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/4d1d726e61ed58b39278903262d19bbe9f010772/libs/langchain/langchain/agents/agent_iterator.py#L174" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">agent_iterator.py#L174</a><span> demonstrates the loop structure.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>LangGraph</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/24f7d7c4399e2c19b634ed7af0d551ad327e25d7/libs/cli/examples/graphs/agent.py#L56" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">agent.py#L56</a><span> for a graph-based approach.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Now you know the secret -

The B580 and A770 both placed four Xe Cores in each Render Slice.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png" width="998" height="467" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:467,&quot;width&quot;:998,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:78663,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5bc369-fc83-4273-b672-cdccb9a93897_998x467.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Having enough bits to describe a certain configuration doesn’t mean Intel will ship something that big.

AMD and Nvidia’s SAs and GPCs all pack a lot more than four cores. For example, the RX 6900XT’s Shader Engines each have 10 WGPs. Nvidia’s RTX 4090 puts eight SMs in each GPC. GPUs have become more compute-heavy over time, as games use more complex shader programs. Intel seems to be following the same trend.</p><p>Xe Vector Engines (XVEs) execute shader programs on Intel GPUs. They use a combination of vector-level and thread-level parallelism to hide latency.</p><p>Xe3 XVEs can run 10 threads concurrently, up from eight in prior generations. Like SMT on a CPU, tracking multiple threads helps a XVE hide latency using thread level parallelism. If one thread stalls, the XVE can hopefully find an un-stalled thread to issue instructions from. Active thread count is also referred to as thread occupancy. 100% occupancy on a GPU would be analogous to 100% utilization in Windows Task Manager. Unlike CPU SMT implementations, GPU occupancy can be limited by register file capacity.</p><p><span>Prior Intel GPUs had two register allocation modes. Normally each thread gets 128 512-bit registers, for 8 KB of registers per thread. A “large GRF” mode gives each thread 256 registers, but drops occupancy to 4 threads because of register file capacity limits. Xe3 continues to use 64 KB register files per XVE, but flexibly allocates registers in 32 entry blocks</span><sup>2</sup><span>. That lets Xe3’s XVEs get 10 threads in flight as long as each thread uses 96 or fewer registers. If a shader program needs a lot of registers, occupancy degrades more gracefully than in prior generations.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png" width="984" height="516" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:516,&quot;width&quot;:984,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:21036,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Nvidia and AMD GPUs allocate registers at even finer granularity. AMD’s RDNA 2 for example allocates registers in blocks of 16. But Xe3 is still more flexible than prior Intel generations. With this change, simple shaders that only need a few registers will enjoy better latency tolerance from more thread-level parallelism. And more complex shaders can avoid dropping to the “large GRF” mode.</p><p>Xe3’s XVEs have more scoreboard tokens too. Like AMD and Nvidia, Intel uses compiler assisted scheduling for long latency instructions like memory accesses. A long latency instruction can set a scoreboard entry, and a dependent instruction can wait until that entry is cleared. Each Xe3 thread gets 32 scoreboard tokens regardless of occupancy, so a XVE has 320 scoreboard tokens in total. On Xe2, a thread gets 16 tokens if the XVE is running eight threads, or 32 in “large GRF” mode with four threads. Thus Xe2’s XVEs only have 128 scoreboard tokens in total. More tokens let thread have more outstanding long latency instructions. That very likely translates to more memory level parallelism per thread.</p><p><span>Intel’s GPU ISA has a vector register file (GRF, or General Register File) that stores much of a shader program’s data and feeds the vector execution units.

XVEs access memory and communicate with other shared using by sending messages over the Xe Core’s message fabric, using </span><code>send</code><span> instructions. Gather-send appears to let Xe3 gather non-contiguous values from the register file, and send them with a single </span><code>send</code><span> instruction.</span></p><p><span>Besides adding the Scalar Register, Xe3 extends the thread dependency register (TDR) to handle 10 threads. </span><code>sr0</code><span> gains an extra 32-bit doubleword for unknown reasons.</span></p><p>Xe3 supports a saturation modifier for FCVT, an instruction that converts between different floating point types (not between integer and floating point). FCVT was introduced with Ponte Vecchio, but the saturation modifier could ease conversion from higher to lower precision floating point formats. Xe3 also gains HF8 (half float 8-bit) format support, providing another 8-bit floating point format option next to the BF8 type already supported in Xe2.</p><p><span>For the XMX unit, Xe3 gains a </span><code>xdpas</code><span> instruction</span><sup>4</sup><span>. </span><code>sdpas</code><span> stands for sparse systolic dot product with accumulate</span><sup>5</sup><span>. Matrices with a lot of zero elements are known as sparse matrices. Operations on sparse matrices can be optimized because anything multiplied by zero is obviously zero. Nvidia and AMD GPUs have both implemented sparsity optimizations, and Intel is apparently looking to do the same.</span></p><p><span>Sub-Triangle Opacity Culling (STOC) subdivides triangles in BVH leaf nodes, and marks sub-triangles as transparent, opaque, or partially transparent. The primary motivation is to reduce wasted any-hit shader work when games use texture alpha channels to handle complex geometry. Intel’s paper calls out foliage as an example, noting that programmers may use low vertex counts to reduce “rendering, animation, and even simulation run times.”</span><sup>7</sup><span> BVH geometry from the API perspective can only be completely </span><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/Raytracing.html#d3d12_raytracing_geometry_flags" rel="">transparent or opaque</a><span>, so games mark all partially transparent primitives as transparent. Each ray intersection will fire an any-hit shader, which carries out alpha testing. If alpha testing indicates the ray intersected a transparent part of the primitive, the shader program doesn’t contribute a sample and the any-hit shader launch is basically wasted. STOC bits let the any-hit shader skip alpha testing if the ray intersects a completely transparent or completely opaque sub-triangle.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png" width="1082" height="311" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:311,&quot;width&quot;:1082,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:59897,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>From Intel's paper, showing examples of foliage textures</figcaption></figure></div><p>Storing each sub-triangle’s opacity information takes two bits, so STOC does require more storage compared to using a single opacity bit for the entire triangle.

STOC bits could let the RTA skip shader launches if the ray intersects a completely transparent sub-triangle.

This mode is named "STOC1" in code.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png" width="1311" height="1324" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1324,&quot;width&quot;:1311,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:97468,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87989e82-2c48-4f1a-9789-2af6ca5db6de_1311x1324.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Sketching out triangle (leaf) node formats for Xe/Xe2 and Xe3. Blue = STOC related, purple = non-STOC raytracing data structure changes</figcaption></figure></div><p>A “STOC3” structure takes things further by storing pointers to STOC bits rather than embedding them into the BVH. That allows more flexibility in how much storage the STOC bits can use. STOC3 also specifies recursion levels for STOC bits, possibly for recursively partitioning triangles. Subdividing further would reduce the number of partially transparent sub-triangles, which require alpha testing from the any-hit shader. Storing pointers for STOC3 brings leaf node size to 128 bytes, increasing BVH memory footprint.</p><p>Possible performance gains are exciting, but using STOC requires work from game developers or game engines. Intel suggests that STOC bits can be generated offline as part of game asset compilation. Artists will have to determine whether using STOC will provide a performance uplift for a particular scene. A scene with a lot of foliage might benefit massively from STOC. A chain link fence may be another story. STOC isn’t a part of the DirectX or Vulkan standards, which can be another obstacle to adoption. However, software-only STOC can still provide benefits. That could encourage developers to try it out. If they do implement it, STOC-aware Xe3 hardware stands to gain more than a software-only solution.</p><p>We’re still some time away from real Xe3 products. But software changes suggest Xe3 is another significant step forward for Intel’s graphics architecture. Xe2 was a solid step in Intel’s foray into discrete graphics, providing better performance than Xe with a nominally smaller GPU. Xe3 tweaks the architecture again and likely has similar goals. Higher occupancy and dynamic register allocation would make Xe Cores more latency tolerant, improving utilization. Those changes also bring Intel’s graphics architecture closer to AMD and Nvidia’s.</p><p>XVE changes show Intel is still busy evolving their core compute architecture. In contrast, Nvidia’s Streaming Multiprocessors haven’t seen significant changes from Ampere to Blackwell. Nvidia may have felt Ampere’s SM architecture was good enough, and turned their efforts to tuning features while scaling up the GPU to keep providing generational gains. Intel meanwhile seeks to get more out of each Xe Core (and Xe2 achieved higher performance than Xe with fewer Xe Cores).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg" width="810" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:810,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:166273,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Intel Arc logo on a product box</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a similarity with Nvidia, Intel is pushing hard on the features front and evidently has invested into research. GPUs often try to avoid doing wasted work. Just rasterization pipelines use early depth testing to avoid useless pixel shader invocations, STOC avoids spawning useless any-hit shaders. It’s too early to tell what kind of difference STOC or other Xe3 features will make. But anyone doubting Intel’s commitment to moving their GPU architecture forward should take a serious look at Mesa and Intel Graphics Compiler changes. There’s a lot going on, and I look forward to seeing Xe3 whenever it’s ready.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In a first for space cuisine, ESA project astronaut <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Astronauts/Slawosz_Uznanski-Wisniewski" target="_blank">Sławosz&nbsp;Uznański-Wiśniewski</a> will bring pierogi, the traditional Polish dumplings, to the International Space Station during the upcoming Axiom Mission 4.</p>

<p>Sławosz is bringing a taste of home to space with a special menu created together with a celebrity chef and a family-owned company in Poland. The food selection includes pierogi stuffed with cabbage and mushrooms, tomato soup with noodles, Polish “leczo” stew with buckwheat, and apple crumble for dessert.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>marimo is free and open source, available on
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo">GitHub</a>. This blog post is also
accompanied by a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuIWdeqMF0">YouTube video</a>.</em></p>
<p>In a previous post, on <a target="_blank" href="https://marimo.io/blog/lessons-learned">lessons learned redesigning the Python
notebook</a>, we wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of important work happens in notebooks — research, large scale
experimentation, data engineering, and more. <strong>But this kind of work should be
treated as Python software, and it shouldn’t be done in error-prone JSON
scratchpads.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that post we described design decisions that allowed us to create a new
kind of notebook (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo">marimo</a>), one that
blended the best parts of interactive computing with the maintainability,
reusability, and interoperability of software. Part of our solution was to
represent notebooks as Python programs — not just as flat scripts, but as
reusable modules.</p>
<p>In this post, we dive deep into our representation of notebooks as Python
files — showing how our file format makes notebooks versionable with Git,
importable as modules, testable with pytest, executable as scripts, and much,
more, while still being compatible with other languages like SQL and Markdown.
We also discussing how we design around tradeoffs, such as keeping a record of
visual outputs.</p>

<h2 id="the-status-quo-is-not-working"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#the-status-quo-is-not-working"><span></span></a>The status quo is not working</h2>
<p>AI developers, data engineers, data scientists, and researchers do <em>a lot</em> of
their work in Python notebooks like Jupyter. We know this from first-hand
experience; we’ve worked as engineers at Google Brain and
Palantir, and lived in notebooks, for better or worse, during PhDs at
Stanford and Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Traditional notebooks’ usefulness is severely limited by the JSON-based
<code>ipynb</code> file format (<a target="_blank" href="https://marimo.io/blog/slac-marimo">among other things</a>).
This file format combines code and outputs in what Pydantic creator Samuel
Colvin calls a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samuelcolvin/notbook">“horrid blob”</a>, and is
directly responsible for the following sad state of affairs:</p>
<ul>
<li>small edits to code yield enormous Git diffs;</li>
<li>code is copy-pasted across notebooks, instead of reused;</li>
<li>magic commands limit the portability of notebook code;</li>
<li>logic that would be useful as a script or library gets thrown away;</li>
<li>logic that should be tested almost never is.</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>What about Jupytext or Databricks source notebooks?</summary><p>While it’s true that you can get
cleaner diffs by using Jupytext (if you’re sufficiently motivated) or
Databricks source notebooks (if you’re a paying customer), naively storing
notebooks as flat Python scripts like these tools do won’t solve the other
problems enumerated above. In particular, importing a Jupytext-processed or
Databricks source-format notebook as a module will also run all its cells — a
potentially very expensive side-effect if all you wanted was to import a
function or class.</p></details>
<details><summary>What about nbdev?</summary><p>nbdev is a framework that lets developers “write, test, document, and distribute software packages and technical articles” using Jupyter notebooks, a goal that we
consider orthogonal to our goal of making a new kind of Python notebook that is
a simple software artifact, just like any other Python file. We are not interested
in replacing traditional software development with notebooks.</p></details>
<p>When working with Jupyter, too often you end up with
directories strewn with spaghetti-code notebooks, counting up to
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXGCKqo5cEY">Untitled12.ipynb</a> or higher. You
the notebook author don’t know what’s in these notebooks, you don’t understand
their Git history, you don’t know what packages were used in each notebook, you
haven’t tested anything because how do you even test notebooks, and you’re
unsure if you — let alone your colleagues — will be able to run them in the
future.</p>

<p>Despite these problems (and others — by one study, <a target="_blank" href="https://leomurta.github.io/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf">less than four
percent</a> of Jupyter
notebooks on GitHub are reproducible), people continue using traditional
notebooks for production tasks like pipelines (e.g., Databricks
workflows), as well as areas where reproducibility is paramount, like AI
development and science.</p>
<figure><a href="https://x.com/sh_reya/status/1738361345362555259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://marimo.io/images/blog/24/shreya_git.png"></a><figcaption>Small changes to Jupyter notebooks yield enormous, unintelligible Git diffs. </figcaption></figure>
<p>Why? Because, until recently, Jupyter notebooks were the only
programming environment that let you see your data <em>while</em> you worked on it.
Interactivity is so crucial to data work that hundreds of thousands of data
professionals decided the trade-offs were worth it.</p>
<p>Instead of accepting this sad state of affairs, or trying to work around it
with clunky extensions or complicated frameworks, we decided it was worth it to
reinvent notebooks as regular Python programs — we wanted to make something
that <em>just worked</em>. It was from this belief that the marimo notebook was born.</p>
<h2 id="python-not-json-a-new-plaintext-file-format"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#python-not-json-a-new-plaintext-file-format"><span></span></a>Python, not JSON: a new plaintext file format</h2>
<p>marimo stores notebooks as plaintext Python files (e.g. <code>notebook.py</code>) with the
following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Git-friendly: small code change =&gt; small diff</li>
<li>easy for both humans and computers to read</li>
<li>importable as a Python module, without executing notebook cells</li>
<li>executable as a Python script</li>
<li>editable with a text editor</li>
</ol>
<p>After <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/marimo-team/meps/blob/main/mep-0001.md">a <em>lot</em> of careful
consideration</a>, we landed
on files that look like this:</p>

<p>This file format encodes how data flows across the notebook: as we explained in
<a target="_blank" href="https://marimo.io/blog/lessons-learned">our previous post</a>, marimo represents
notebooks as dataflow graphs to improve reproducibility (eliminating hidden
state) and enable seamless interactivity with UI elements.</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-notebook-file"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#anatomy-of-a-notebook-file"><span></span></a>Anatomy of a notebook file</h3>
<p>marimo automatically generates notebook files on save from the marimo editor,
but developers can also create or edit these files in their text editor of
choice (ours are neovim and Cursor).</p>
<p><strong>Header.</strong> The notebook file starts with a header that imports marimo, notes
the version of marimo that created the file, and instantiates an <code>App</code> object
to which cells are added.</p>
<p><strong>Cells.</strong> Cells are stored in notebook presentation order. Each cell is
serialized as a function that accepts its variable references and return its
definitions; cells are added to the notebook via the <code>app.cell</code> decorator.
Users can optionally name their cells, which become the names of the decorated
functions.</p>
<p>This serialization strategy departs from Jupytext-style (or Databricks-style)
flat scripts, which demarcate cells with comments instead of wrapping them in
functions. Importing Jupytext or Databricks notebook files runs all their
cells, which is expensive and almost never what you want. In contrast, in our
file format, cells are not executed on import because they are wrapped in
functions.</p>
<p><strong>Functions and classes.</strong> <em>This part of our notebook specification is slated
for release in version 0.12.0.</em> Cells that define top-level functions or
classes are serialized directly in the file, so they can be reused by other
Python modules (<code>from my_notebook import my_function</code>). An optional top-level
setup cell, not shown here, can make symbols available to these functions, such
as imported modules and constants.</p>
<p><strong>Footer.</strong> An <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> guard protects a call to <code>app.run()</code>,
which executes the notebook’s cells in a topologically sorted order.</p>
<h3 id="examples"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#examples"><span></span></a>Examples</h3>
<p>Our simple file format makes it possible to treat notebooks like any other
Python program. Here are some examples of what our file format enables:</p>
<div><ul><li><a href="#version-with-git"><p>Version with Git</p></a></li><li><a href="#test-with-pytest"><p>Test with pytest</p></a></li><li><a href="#test-with-doctests"><p>Test with doctests</p></a></li><li><a href="#reuse-functions-and-classes-in-other-python-files"><p>Reuse functions and classes in other Python files</p></a></li><li><a href="#reuse-cells-and-notebooks-in-other-notebooks"><p>Reuse cells and notebooks in other notebooks</p></a></li><li><a href="#run-as-python-scripts"><p>Run as Python scripts</p></a></li><li><a href="#script-metadata-for-packaging-and-configuration"><p>Script metadata for packaging and configuration</p></a></li><li><a href="#embed-sql-and-markdown"><p>Embed SQL and Markdown</p></a></li><li><a href="#edit-as-plaintext-files"><p>Edit as plaintext files</p></a></li></ul></div>
<h4 id="version-with-git"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#version-with-git"><span></span></a>Version with Git</h4>
<p>Small changes to notebook code are guaranteed to make small localized changes
to the notebook file, yielding easy-to-read Git diffs. For example, consider
a <strong>one character change</strong>, modifying</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>plt.</span><span>plot</span><span>(x, x</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>to</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>plt.</span><span>plot</span><span>(x, x</span><span>**</span><span>3</span><span>).</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p><strong>marimo notebook diff.</strong> Here’s the Git diff for a marimo notebook file:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="diff" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="diff" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span> @app.cell</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> def _(plt, x):</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>-    plt.plot(x, x**2)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>+    plt.plot(x, x**3)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>     return</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>It corresponds exactly to the code change, with the notebook file changed in
just one place.</p>
<p><strong>Jupyter notebook diff.</strong> In contrast, because ipynb files stores
base64-encoded blobs of outputs, the diff for the equivalent Jupyter notebook
contains <strong>42,571 characters</strong>. Moreover, the notebook contains many changes
unrelated to the actual single character code change. Here is an abbreviated
version of the diff, with truncated blobs.</p>

<h4 id="test-with-pytest"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#test-with-pytest"><span></span></a>Test with pytest</h4>
<p>Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, they are interoperable
with other tools for Python — <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/testing/pytest/">including
pytest</a>. In contrast, there is
no standard way to test code in Jupyter notebooks, which is part of the reason
why so many traditional notebooks fall over from incorrectness.</p>
<p><strong>Testing cells.</strong> Any cell named as <code>test_*</code> is automatically discoverable
and testable by <code>pytest</code>. The same goes for any cell that contains only <code>test_</code>
functions and <code>Test</code> classes.</p>
<p>Importantly, because cells are wrapped in functions, running <code>pytest test_notebook.py</code>
doesn’t execute the entire notebook — just its tests.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Consider running <code>pytest</code> on the following code:</p>

<h4 id="test-with-doctests"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#test-with-doctests"><span></span></a>Test with doctests</h4>
<p>marimo also supports <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html">doctest</a>
out of the box: just call <code>doctest.testmod()</code> in your notebook, in a cell that
references the functions you’d like to test.</p>
<p>This can be especially helpful when defining and documenting functions in
marimo notebooks that will be used elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="reuse-functions-and-classes-in-other-python-files"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#reuse-functions-and-classes-in-other-python-files"><span></span></a>Reuse functions and classes in other Python files</h4>
<p><em>Coming soon, in version 0.12.0.</em></p>
<p>Our file format also makes it easy and natural to reuse functions and classes
defined in your notebook; just import them like you would from a regular notebook
file:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>from</span><span> my_notebook </span><span>import</span><span> my_function, my_class</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>This works for cells that have just a single function definition or class
definition. Additionally, the functions and classes must have no other
references other than imported modules or other symbols that you the notebook
author define in a special setup cell (functions and classes can also refer to
other top-level functions).</p>
<p>For example, the below notebook contains a setup cell that imports <code>numpy</code>, and
a cell that defines a function that uses <code>numpy</code>. Unlike other cells, the setup
cell’s body is at the top-level of the file (it’s not wrapped in a
function), so its variables are made available to the notebook’s functions.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>import</span><span> marimo</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>  return</span><span> np.</span><span>mean</span><span>(x)</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>You can define the setup cell by simply editing the notebook file in a text editor,
or through the marimo editor.</p>
<h4 id="reuse-cells-and-notebooks-in-other-notebooks"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#reuse-cells-and-notebooks-in-other-notebooks"><span></span></a>Reuse cells and notebooks in other notebooks</h4>
<p><strong>Cells.</strong> Named cells can be used in other notebooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import a cell with <code>from my_notebook import my_cell</code></li>
<li>Run it with <code>defs, output = my_cell.run()</code>, which runs the cell and its ancestors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <code>defs</code> is a dictionary containing the variables the cell defines, and <code>output</code>
the value of the cell’s last expression (i.e., its visual output).</p>
<p>By default, running a cell in this way will also run its ancestors. The <code>run</code>
method can be parametrized to override the values of its references and
prevent ancestor execution. (This API was inspired by Observable notebooks.)
See <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/api/cell/#marimo.Cell.run">our docs</a> for an
example.</p>
<p><strong>Notebooks.</strong> Entire notebooks can be embedded in other notebooks:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>from</span><span> my_notebook </span><span>import</span><span> app</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>

<span data-line=""><span>result.output</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>This lets you reuse the user interface of a marimo notebook as a component
(since marimo makes it easy for notebooks to be rendered as <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/interactivity/">interactive web
apps</a>). <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/api/app/#marimo.App.embed">Our
docs</a> include a usage
example.</p>
<h4 id="run-as-python-scripts"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#run-as-python-scripts"><span></span></a>Run as Python scripts</h4>
<p>Every marimo notebook can be <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/scripts/">run as a script</a>;</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="bash" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>python</span><span> my_notebook.py</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>This runs the notebook cells in a topologically sorted order. You can also
pass command-line arguments to your notebook, which can be read with the library
function <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/api/cli_args/"><code>marimo.cli_args()</code></a>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="bash" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>python</span><span> my_notebook.py -- -x=</span><span>1</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>Since marimo notebooks are just Python, you can also use <code>argparse</code>
to declare and parse arguments. And, since marimo does not support magic
commands (<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/coming_from/jupyter/#converting-jupyter-notebooks-to-marimo-notebooks">we don’t need
them</a>),
your notebook is guaranteed to work as as script.</p>
<h4 id="script-metadata-for-packaging-and-configuration"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#script-metadata-for-packaging-and-configuration"><span></span></a>Script metadata for packaging and configuration</h4>
<p>Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a>, there is now an
<a target="_blank" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata">agreed-upon Python
specification</a>
for storing metadata in single-file Python scripts. This metadata is similar to
a pyproject.toml and stored as a header comment, such as:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="bash" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span># /// script</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.11"</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span># dependencies = [</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>#   "requests&lt;3",</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>#   "rich",</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span># ]</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span># ///</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, we can use this spec to
communicate metadata to other tools in the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Package requirements.</strong> For reproducibility, marimo users can document their
notebook’s dependencies in script metadata. When given a notebook with inline
dependencies, marimo uses <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv"><code>uv</code></a> to run it in
an isolated virtual environment. marimo can even <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/package_reproducibility/">automatically
maintain</a> this
dependency list on the user’s behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration overrides.</strong> Users can use script metadata to easily <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/configuration/#script-metadata-configuration">override
marimo configuration</a> on a per-notebook basis.</p>
<h4 id="embed-sql-and-markdown"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#embed-sql-and-markdown"><span></span></a>Embed SQL and Markdown</h4>
<p>Even though marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python, other languages can be
used by embedding them in Python.</p>
<p>For example, marimo has native support for “<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/sql/">SQL
cells</a>”, powered by
DuckDB or other databases. Though the marimo editor renders these cells as SQL,
under the hood they are represented as</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>cell</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>def</span><span> _</span><span>():</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  _df </span><span>=</span><span> mo.</span><span>sql</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"SELECT * FROM my_table"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>The marimo parser even statically analyzes SQL code to build a dataflow graph
jointly across Python and SQL.</p>
<p>Markdown is embedded in marimo notebooks in a similar way:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="python" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>mo.</span><span>md</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"The result of your query is </span><span>{</span><span>mo.</span><span>as_html</span><span>(df)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>As you can see above, a benefit of embedding other languages in Python is that
it enables users to interpolate Python values into SQL and Markdown at runtime.</p>
<h4 id="edit-as-plaintext-files"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#edit-as-plaintext-files"><span></span></a>Edit as plaintext files</h4>
<p>As a final example, our plaintext format makes it easy to edit marimo notebooks
in a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/watching/">text editor of your
choice</a>; marimo will
pick up your changes and reflect them in the browser. The plaintext file format
also means you can lint and format notebook files using your preferred tools.</p>
<p>While you don’t need to maintain the cell arguments and returns, doing so can
help your IDE provide completions. We have changes queued up that will make
this feel like a first-class experience.</p>
<h3 id="output-storage"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#output-storage"><span></span></a>Output storage</h3>
<p>Our file format has tradeoffs — in particular, storing as a Python file means
that notebook outputs are no longer serialized in the notebook file. We
accommodate output persistence in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notebook outputs are cached in the <code>__marimo__</code> directory (similar to <code>__pycache__</code>);
on notebook startup, these outputs are matched with notebook cells, letting you
see where you left off.</li>
<li>Notebooks can be automatically snapshotted as IPython notebook files or HTML,
which are also saved to the <code>__marimo__</code> subdirectory.</li>
<li>An opt-in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/expensive_notebooks/#caching">caching mechanism</a> lets you pick up from where you left off (a topic large enough for a whole other blog post).</li>
<li>Lightweight notebooks can be opened in our WebAssembly playground using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/publishing/playground/#open-notebooks-hosted-on-github">our bookmarklet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="it-just-works"><a target="_blank" aria-label="Link to section" href="#it-just-works"><span></span></a>It just works</h2>
<p>We regularly get feedback from users telling us how much they appreciate
marimo’s embrace of pure Python.</p>
<p>For example, one user at a large company told
us how marimo’s Python-first design means his notebooks are, for the first
time, actually reusable and reproducible software artifacts:</p>

<p>My colleagues used to ask me what I did to reach certain conclusions … I would just send them my Jupyter notebook, but rarely did it ever actually run properly without issue, and it was always a mystery what specific order I ran the cells in to get them to work. <strong>I would end up just redoing a lot of the analysis in pure Python to replicate what was done, which was so inefficient. marimo has definitely solved that issue.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others tell us they came for marimo’s interactivity, but stayed for the ability
to run notebooks as scripts. Conversely, others tell us they came for
git-versioning, or for the tight integration with <code>uv</code>, and stayed for
reactive execution or rich dataframes. Here’s a quote from a user that
speaks to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven‘t touched Jupyter or Pandas for a while now and not regretting it.
My basic data stack is now uv, polars, marimo. <strong>One of my
favourite features is that the notebooks are pure Python files and integrate
uv script headers to make them out-of-the-box executable.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More generally, when we ask our users why they keep using marimo, we hear
quotes like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well it just works!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It just works</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Last year, hundreds of players inhabited a spaceship on the run, scrambling to keep one step ahead of the enemy. The sci-fi larp <a href="https://www.odysseuslarp.com/">Odysseus</a> was inspired by Battlestar Galactica’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_(Battlestar_Galactica)">33</a>“, but where that episode only lasted 45 minutes, Odysseus’ players worked, fought, ate, and slept in-game for fifty non-stop hours.</p>



<p>Odysseus is widely recognised as one of the most accomplished larps (live action role playing games) of all time and is the subject of an <a href="https://www.vapriikki.fi/en/exhibition/odysseus-the-story-of-a-larp/">exhibition</a> at the Finnish Museum of Games. Originally mounted in 2019 for three sold out runs, Odysseus returned in 2024 for another three runs. Over two hundred volunteers worked on the larp, using €190,000 to transform an elementary school into a sprawling spaceship complete with mess hall, bar, ops room, science and medical bays, jail, and hangar.</p>



<p>The gameplay and story design was equally ambitious. Custom open source software was written to power Odysseus’ combat and engineering hyperdrive jumps, RFID-scanners, internal message board, and livestreaming drone videos for away missions. Every player character was unique, supported by over 300 NPCs, their activities as doctors, criminals, soldiers, fighter pilots, terrorists, and politicians meshed in intricate “clockwork” gameplay. Where the <a href="https://mssv.net/2023/08/07/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser/">Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser’s</a> story was hopeful and life-affirming, Odysseus’ mixed grief with joy, anger with determination, and its plot raised the spectre of genocide. It was demanding and adult. Participants had to role-play specific characters with lengthy backstories and numerous relationships.</p>

<p>Though Odysseus’ tickets were €550 each, they barely covered its production budget. None of the volunteer’s 30,000 hours of work was compensated – but its success has its creators wondering what it would take to become a permanent, financially sustainable larp –&nbsp;one of the first of its kind.</p>



<p>When I met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-kr%C3%B6ger-a27856a7/">Laura Kröger</a>, Odysseus’ lead producer and narrative designer, it was for my upcoming book on the history and future of immersive art. I’d travelled to <a href="https://mssv.net/2025/03/16/a-few-notes-on-knutepunkt-2025/">Knutepunkt 2025</a>, the annual conference for Nordic Larp, to learn more about the field. Our conversation ended up being much more current than I’d imagined, so I’m publishing it today, less than a week after we spoke.</p>



<p>This is a story about ambition. Ambition in game design, character design, emotional design, production, SFX, and narrative. But it’s not individual ambition –&nbsp;it’s the collective ambition of two hundred people working at the top of their game, beyond what I’ve seen in all but the most expensive commercial experiences, all as volunteers.</p>



<p>During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed Odysseus’ experience design, organisational structure, production tools, decision-making processes, org charts, burnout, and just how many tickets per year they’d need to make it financially sustainable while paying everyone properly.</p>



<p><strong>For you, what defines a clockwork larp?</strong></p>



<p>When we had the idea for Odysseus, our very first inspiration was the Battlestar Galactica episode “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_(Battlestar_Galactica)">33</a>”, where they need to keep jumping in order to escape the enemy. There would be really strict time pressure for the players to keep doing their things, and the drama and the experience would be built around that dynamic. I don’t think that, when we started to do the design, we considered we were doing a clockwork larp. We were starting from an idea, what we wanted to create, what kind of feeling we wanted to evoke. Then it evolved into being probably one of the most successful clockwork larps ever created.</p>

<p><strong>What other clockwork larps are there?</strong></p>



<p>I have discussed this with Markus [Montola] a little bit, and I think he’s better to define it. But he wrote <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/2024/07/04/odysseus-in-search-of-a-clockwork-larp/">a piece about Odysseus</a> in <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Liminal_Encounters">last year’s KP book</a> [Nordic Larp’s <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Knutepunkt-books">annual journal</a>] and the examples were <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/The_Monitor_Celestra">Monitor Celestra</a> and basically any larp where there are tasks that the players need to do in a timely manner to keep the larp going forward. It’s not just that there is a schedule. It’s like clockwork, you have these interacting components. You have different players doing different tasks in sequence to each other that keep the play moving forward. It can even be a village preparing for battle.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nordiclarp.org/2024/07/04/odysseus-in-search-of-a-clockwork-larp/">Montola</a>: “Clockwork larp is a larp where characters work on diverse and sequential interdependent tasks that feed into each other, forming loops that progress the story and the dynamics of the larp.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>There’s direct interaction. It’s not like I do a task and then I tick a box off on a list. You can see what you do is being directly impacted by others.</strong></p>



<p>And everybody who is part of that machinery can see that their work contributes to the success of whatever is going to happen.</p>



<p><strong>You’ve said that the thing that you’re interested in doing in the future is more larps that have this idea of the loop.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>And so do you still feel that way? But also, what is it about the loop that appeals to you?</strong></p>



<p>In general, I enjoy a lot of things. I enjoy doing different kinds of larps. So, I’ve done very small larps and then I’ve done a couple of Odysseuses and other somewhat big larps as well. And I like challenges. I like challenging myself.</p>

<p><strong>As a designer or as a player?</strong></p>



<p>Specifically as a designer, I think I have pretty good skills in terms of plot design or emotional design. I also have a somewhat good sense of what are the implications of a design choice in a larp and how, when you have an idea of a design, you can make it work in a larp. Because I see larps where there are really good ideas, but the execution is not always… There has been a really good vision, but it doesn’t always relate to a good experience for players. There are so many steps from a good vision to a good experience for players. I’m really interested in what those steps are and how you can do them very efficiently.</p>



<p><strong>You’re interested in the execution of those ideas.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned plot design and emotional design. Those sound like different things to me.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, I think they are different things, but they can be the same thing. I come from a Finnish larp culture where the [majority] of larps aim towards very emotional play. Plot can be a love triangle, or a problematic marriage, or things where the main plot is the emotional impact you get from the interaction.</p>



<p><strong>So that’s a crucial outcome of the plot.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>If it’s not generating emotions, maybe it’s not successful.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. There are plots like, you need to go and find this piece of map so you can put the three pieces together and find a treasure. That’s also a plot, but that’s a kind of a plot I’m less interested in.</p>

<p><strong>How does that relate to your interest in loops?</strong></p>



<p>In the things I’ve done before Odysseus and some of the things I’ve done after Odysseus, I have focused a lot on creating emotional play for players, but I’ve also approached that with creating an abundance of content. Characters have so many plots they definitely aren’t going to get bored, and there’s going to be so many things they can do and interact with and have emotional contact with, that some of those things definitely work out. That’s the design philosophy. I’ve done quite a few of those kinds of larps, and in some ways Odysseus was very much that kind of larp, as well because there were a lot of things going on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I also feel, after playing some larps and after seeing how players react, that less is sometimes more. So the correct direction is not to just have an overflow of stuff to make sure that some of it works, but to do less and do it better so that it most likely works even without all the backups. And I think that in Odysseus we had different kinds of larps intertwined with each other because there was that emotional… We had pre-written characters with multiple connections, like family, siblings, parents, friends, colleagues, lovers, ex-lovers. Every character had probably around ten pre-written connections, and there was a lot of this personal play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then we had the layer of the clockwork so that these characters had their personal lives, then they had their jobs, which were all the things they needed to do all the time to keep the clockwork running. And then there were the events that happened during the larp, things they didn’t have any pre-knowledge of, be it the [enemy] boarding or some big announcement, which they then reacted to in relation to those connections they had and their jobs. So there’s three layers on top of each other.</p>



<p><strong>What you’re telling me is that there are loops in Odysseus, but the emotional experience is not looping.</strong></p>



<p>No, it’s contributing to it, but it’s not that.</p>



<p><strong>It’s not like your emotions are resetting every loop where it’s like, “Okay, now I have a new family.”</strong></p>



<p>No, it’s building with it. The point was that the most intense experiences probably came from the pre-written characters and the connections, but the clockwork element contributed, because if you only have a limited amount of time to play with your significant other, then that moment is more significant because you are both fearing that you might die in the next hour and the ship might blow up. That creates the emotional impact for those relations.</p>

<p><strong>So, a massive number of people were involved in making Odysseus.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>Can you tell me about the structure of that organization? Is it a non-profit? Is it a charity?</strong></p>



<p>It is non-profit. We have an association, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/illusia_ry/">Illusia Ry</a>, which I’ve been a part of for seven years. I’m one of the founders of that association and it was created in order to be able to do this kind of blockbuster larp. The finances go through that association so that it’s not any one of our personal investments.</p>



<p><strong>And that’s a Finnish organization.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, that’s a Finnish organization. Basically the biggest thing that the association has done is Odysseus, but there are other larps it’s been involved in.</p>



<p><strong>That’s fascinating. And so it’s facilitating?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, it is basically a facilitator. There’s little else that the association currently does due to a lack of volunteers. I think that most of the volunteers in Odysseus are not members of the association. They are just doing Odysseus, but officially Odysseus is a product of that association.</p>



<p><strong>It means it can have a bank account, get insurance and all of that.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, and then we can use the association for those.</p>



<p><strong>Can you tell me a bit about the internal communications and organisational structure? How did you work together?</strong></p>



<p>I was the lead producer and I had three assistant producers who were sharing my workload.&nbsp; We had a core team, about twenty people, which was formed mostly of the team leads of other teams. So we had, for example, a graphics team, we had a spatial team, which was responsible for designing and creating the spaces. We had a sound team, we had a light team, we had a software team. Many different teams, which all had their own team lead.</p>



<p>We had core team meetings with these team leads and the producers, where we discussed all the things that we wanted to decide together, like how we are going to distribute our tickets and stuff like that. The big decisions regarding the practicals were done in the core team. And then the team leads were responsible for their own teams and managing those teams. If they had any issues, then they would bring them to the core team and we would discuss together how we approach them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the teams worked very independently, and the team lead was doing most of the team leading and I was less involved. But then there were quite a bunch of teams in which I was also personally involved, like the story team, the team that was in charge of the design and character writing. I was also involved with marketing and communications.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How was decision making done? Did you try to get unanimous consent?</strong></p>



<p>It doesn’t need to be unanimous, but everybody needs to… Like, we had maybe twenty people in the core team. And not everybody was always present in the meetings. Earlier, we met maybe once a month or a little bit less often. And then towards the game, maybe every two weeks. Usually the meeting agenda was presented beforehand, and if you were passionate about something that was going to be discussed, then it was a good idea to be present in that meeting. But basically, we had very few differences, in a way that people were not feeling that decisions were made that they wouldn’t agree with. I think our style of creating and our artistic vision was pretty aligned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then there were individual teams making their individual decisions. So, for example, the lighting team was able to decide what kind of lights they wanted. They had a budget and they were told, “This is what we want you to do. And this is the budget we want you to do it with. And how you execute it, it’s up to you.”</p>



<p><strong>What kind of tools were you using? Slack, Discord?</strong></p>



<p>We had a Discord server for the [two year] pre-production phase where we had everybody who was involved, and then we had another Discord for the runtime [i.e. the three live games themselves]. We had maybe 80 people in the pre-production phase, and then when we started building, there were closer to 200 people contributing in either running the game or helping to build or dismantle.</p>



<p><strong>I’m interested in project management tools. Were you using Trello? Were you using…</strong></p>



<p>We were mainly just using Excel and Google Docs. We had a Google Drive and we had basically everything written down in there, then we had individual team lists. I had my own to-do lists and then the other people in some teams had their own to-do lists. But we didn’t have shared or whole production-wide project management tools because it was divided in different teams.</p>

<p><strong>Okay. People wanted to use different things. You mentioned marketing. <a href="https://chaosleague.org/eclipse-larp-en/">Eclipse</a> massively sold out. I read that twice, three times as many people were signed up as you had places, so there was a lottery.</strong></p>



<p>When we started the discussions whether we should do this again after the [first set of 2019] runs were over, our very unanimous response was that this is never going to happen again. &lt;laughs&gt;</p>



<p><strong>And yet you did!</strong></p>



<p>“Never” turned out to be a little bit less than two years! &lt;laughs&gt; But yeah, we were pretty sure that this was not something we wanted to do again. But then corona [the COVID-19 pandemic] happened and everybody was bored and we had a little bit of time to recover. And we started to discuss, I think, late in ’21, that… would we want to do this again? And then we made the decision in early ’22 and we announced it in May ’22 that this is going to happen in ’24. And we had, in a matter of a day, over a thousand people join the interest group.</p>



<p><strong>So you knew immediately you were going to sell every single ticket.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, before we said anything anywhere, we knew we were not going to be lacking players. I don’t think we really dared to make real estimates about how much interest there would be, but I think that around a thousand was something that we estimated beforehand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we were very cautious with our marketing towards larpers. Very early on, when we discussed what we wanted to achieve, we did not want to do marketing for larpers because there was no doubt we would oversell two or three times the amount. We wanted to promote it for the bigger audience. We wanted to tell what larping is about to everybody else who are not larpers.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think that worked?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, I think that worked. In 2019, we had really good coverage in Finnish media. And people who were actually working in the media and were part of our team were a little bit suspicious whether we would get a similar amount of coverage [for 2024], because it’s a rerun. It’s the same thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But actually we got more. Maria Pettersson did a lot of work to get us in a lot of places. I think that this is the first larp featured in primetime news in Finland. Not as ending comedy either, but as a serious piece. And that is super cool. Now we are featured in the Finnish Museum of Games in a rather large exhibition for almost a year. That’s huge. And I think that was the aim for our marketing from the very beginning.</p>

<p><strong>You’re using it as a kind of flagship project to promote larping in general.</strong></p>



<p>Because I think that in Finland people generally have started to recognise the word “larp”, but they have this kind of funny, goofy idea. It’s used mostly as a joke. Or it’s not a serious thing you’re doing. And I think that Odysseus is doing a huge favour in order to shift the general opinion of what larping is about.</p>



<p><strong>So the coverage is not just “look at this fun, spectacular thing”, it also touched on the emotional aspects and the serious aspects.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. Very much so.</p>



<p><strong>That’s cool.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been doing larp organizing for 23 years now. Regarding my professional skill set, I’m a project manager in IT. I have accumulated basically every single [piece of] knowledge I have, from larp organizing. And that’s like… if I have Odysseus in my CV, people have no idea what that means. There is zero idea for the employer to actually understand that [Odysseus] means way more than my actual day job, which I get paid pretty much.</p>



<p><strong>So if a commercial operation – which Odysseus was not – was getting at least three times the demand, it would raise prices. If you promoted it hard, you’d probably get ten times the demand. A commercial operation would be like, “We’re gonna raise prices as high as they can go, so we only <em>just</em> sell out.” And you didn’t do that, even though it’s still a comparatively expensive larp.</strong></p>



<p>It is, but there are much more expensive larps where you get subjectively “less” with that money.</p>



<p><strong>So, access was important. You wanted it to be accessible.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. In 2019, when we first did Odysseus, the ticket price was €200 for the standard ticket, and then we had a sponsor ticket which was €300. The international sponsored tickets sold out in eight seconds, because they guaranteed a spot in the larp [unlike the standard tickets, which were available in a lottery]. So, when we did the ’24 [run], we very early decided that we were not going to do the same thing, because we don’t want to have this sort of “pay to win”.</p>



<p><strong>Because rich people could guarantee they can win over others.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, and also we don’t want to have it sort of like an “F5” competition for who can refresh the webpage fastest, because it was…</p>

<p><strong>It’s not fair.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, it’s not fair, and I think that everybody who was interested in this larp would have paid the €200 or €300 extra, whatever the reasonable amount we would have put as an extra price for the sponsored tickets. Most of the people who signed up would have been competing for the guaranteed spots. So, we were like, “Yeah, there is no point in doing that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, we were unknown organizers. We were known names in Finnish larp, but internationally, we were absolutely nobodies. And so, we were like, “We need to put the ticket price in a ballpark where people can take the risk.” Because they have no idea what we will do. For them, it is basically a risk. We were very cautious about what we promised, but even the little things we dared to promise sounded like, “Yeah, this is insanity. Nobody can pull this off.” Which was pretty crazy, and then we ended up creating so much more.</p>



<p><strong>So, for 2024, there was only one ticket price?</strong></p>



<p>We actually had several. We had one ticket price which was €550, and then we had a sponsored ticket, which was either €600 or €650. That didn’t give the people who signed up for that any other benefits except a small token. We had these pins, which you could take. But it was like, if you want to support us, and if you want to allow us to distribute more discounted tickets, then you can choose to pay a little bit more. But it didn’t guarantee you a spot. It didn’t basically give you anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we had almost a third of the people who signed up say that they would pay the sponsored price, even though it didn’t have any benefit. And that allowed us to actually have a pretty decent amount of the discounted tickets, which I think was €280 or something like that. <em>[Note: the subsidised ticket was €250].</em></p>



<p><strong>I can imagine some organisations convincing themselves to raise the price and either pay the volunteers or put the money into subsidising other larps.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, when we announced the game and then when we announced some statistics of our signups, which was I think 968. And we had 312 spots. So, it was over three times the amount. And people were like, you could easily do this professionally. You could charge higher prices. And I think that people who are saying that don’t have any idea.</p>

<p><strong>I saw your Facebook posts. You’re saying that you would have to charge $3,000.</strong></p>



<p>Not necessarily. There would need to be changes in the structure. Permanent location, a lot of streamlining, a lot of automation and roughly €1000 tickets might be commercially sustainable. But it would need a lot of runs because you would need to cover the fixed costs of the venue for the rent. And you would have some number of people who would need to be paid month-to-month.</p>



<p><strong>You can’t just keep everyone freelance. So, from a commercial point of view, and I’m sure everyone’s thought about this a lot, it’s an issue of sustained demand.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, are there enough larpers? Since Odysseus [2024], we have been discussing with a lot of people about: would it be possible, how it would be possible, what it would require. Because for me personally, when I did the 2019 Odysseus, it was a matter of, like, “challenge accepted”. I’ve been doing pretty good larps in Finland, but does it scale? Can I do something that is in another league? And that was a personal challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we succeeded in 2019, and when I started to think “would I do it again?”, my main motivation was that there was a lot of luck involved in 2019. When we got the keys to the location, even I didn’t have an idea what we would end up creating. So when it all came together and it worked absolutely beautifully, like three times in a row, it was sort of, I can’t say it was a surprise, but there was a lot of luck involved as well.</p>



<p><strong>So 2024 is much more intentional.</strong></p>



<p>In ’24, we knew exactly what we needed to do and we knew exactly what it would take to get us there. For me personally, it was to prove that this was not luck, this was skill – that we would be able to replicate the success of the 2019 runs and even improve in several areas.</p>



<p><strong>So, I’m going to <a href="https://chaosleague.org/eclipse-larp-en/">Eclipse</a> in two months time, and I think they announced an eighth run later this year. That’s an expensive larp, and I assume they’re selling these spaces out.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, if they’re getting more runs, they probably sell out.</p>



<p><strong>Does it seem like there is starting to be more demand, more larpers, what do you think?</strong></p>



<p>I’m now contemplating for myself if I am willing to find out! &lt;laughs&gt;</p>



<p><strong>Do you want to believe?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, it would require something like 1000, 1500 interested people yearly to run something like Odysseus, and with a price tag of [around] €1000. That’s not much, but at the same time, it is.</p>

<p><strong>If you were doing it commercially, you could charge more, though.</strong></p>



<p>That is very much the discussion. Because I think that it is very important that, like you said, if it were done commercially, you would raise prices until you just sell out. But I think that for us, for the people who created Odysseus, it’s been very much a passion project from the very beginning. And for us, it wouldn’t be like, let’s just charge as much as people are willing to pay.</p>



<p><strong>$5000!</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, because the [Star Wars: Galactic] <a href="https://mssv.net/2023/08/07/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser/">Starcruiser</a> failed. I didn’t go there. I have read some articles and some stuff about it. But with very limited information, my personal take is that it cost too much. And the experience didn’t provide what people wanted.</p>



<p><strong>I’ve got a piece in the [KP] book about it. But I will say that more than 1200 people went to the Starcruiser.</strong> <em>[<a href="https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Anatomy_of_Larp_Thoughts:_a_breathing_corpus">Anatomy of Larp Thoughts</a>, p184, <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/w/images/3/34/KP25_PDF_-_small_single_pages.pdf">PDF</a>]</em></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>Like a lot more, probably 100,000 people went to the Starcruiser. </strong><em>[Note: <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/starcruiser-resurrected-could-disney-1-180000546.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9taWNrZXlibG9nLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACmqjy65tjnayxYH7KIaVz-uUY7T9xtKEuMbG1gE2UipNLFGyYMmq29gZPwsNuob_L-abQjumtGA2tlVxhdG2OnsEivOqpxFwu4RRCmDFFhC94j12LdRu7sCV7dBSv7OB3VHx9yBP8B9CW94-AgwoC2N6kkt7k5697OIGvSsFkRW">71,000</a>]</em></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>Now, it’s Star Wars and it’s Disney.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>But you know that 100,000 people are willing to spend…</strong></p>



<p>That much. But it’s also like, Finland is a shitty location to do anything, because that’s like the middle of nowhere.</p>



<p><strong>Well…</strong></p>



<p>That would be a limitation. It wouldn’t be a deal breaker. But it is easier to get 100,000 people to go to the US than get people to fly to Finland to do something.</p>



<p><strong>You don’t have to tell me this, but have you had any [interest from] investors? I mean, people must have approached you.</strong></p>



<p>Not investors, but I think that what we have done so far is not yet that appealing to any investors. But I think we are approaching a point where we need to decide if we want to try to test if it would be possible to do this differently.</p>



<p><strong>Because most investors will want a return. And then it becomes a commercial thing.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>Non-profits can run commercial operations, obviously, but then…</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, they can. And I think that that’s also been the discussion that… I’ve been doing Illusia for seven years now, and there are very few volunteers who are interested in contributing to the bureaucracy and running for it. If it were a company, then people would have ownership of that company and they would be more involved in it. So I think that in that sense, it would be more interesting for people to do things as a company. But also, if I would do something like that, I think that I would prefer to do it with some state/EU funding and then some crowdfunding way, because that would allow us to actually own the IP and not have investors putting pressure on us to do things in a way they want instead of us doing the things the way we want.</p>

<p><strong>That’s a good idea.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>You know, when I saw your Facebook posts and other writings and talks after the runs last year, I got the impression you were like, I think I want to do something else. And you sound a little bit different now. You sound like you’re exploring the possibility of…</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, I think I came to a conclusion already, before even the ’24 runs in the spring, that this is the last time I will do this as a volunteer. This is something that I [spent], I estimate, maybe 2000 hours on, 550 of those during the six weeks we were on site. I was doing that on top of my day job and I was like, this is something I’m not willing to do anymore. So, if I get paid, it would be next-level cool to do something like this for a living.</p>



<p><strong>It’s not like you are artistically burned out on the idea of doing it.</strong></p>



<p>No, because…</p>



<p><strong>You’re financially burned out.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. It’s more of, like, I’ve done larps for 23 years as a volunteer. I’ve done two Odysseuses as a volunteer. I have proved that I have the skills to sort of steer this kind of ship, this kind of structure. &lt;laughs&gt; And moving forward, whatever it would be, I would be interested in doing it in some shape or form professionally. I have a lot of core values related to… I want to do larps for larpers. I’m not interested in doing murder mystery dinners for companies. I want to do stuff that interests me because I was also a narrative designer of Odysseus and I’m extremely proud of the story we are telling. I think that it is really good. It is something I’m personally almost more proud of than the clockwork [mechanics] or how the larp looked or how we managed to do the practicals, and everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because I think that there are a lot of blockbuster larps in cool locations with decent practicals. They are well-organized. But in Finland, we have really, really long roots with pre-written characters, very, very design heavy larps, and a lot of thought put into that. And we were like, can we do a larp with working technology, cool location, good practicals, actually an intriguing and good story, and have everything click together?</p>



<p><strong>I’ve got a couple more questions. You said you want to automate or streamline more things if you were doing it commercially. What kind of things?</strong></p>



<p>We had 70 to 80 people working behind the scenes in each of the runs.</p>



<p><strong>And that’s for 100 players?</strong></p>



<p>That’s for 104 players. So obviously having as many crew as there are players is by no means sustainable in any commercial sense. But also, I think that a lot of those [crew] were there because they wanted to be there. People love Odysseus. Not only as players, but as the 200 people who’ve been involved in organising, this is their baby.</p>



<p><strong>It’s fun.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, it’s fun. The community is awesome. A lot of people were there helping out because they wanted to be part of that in any shape or form. So there are a lot of things that can be outsourced, like catering. You can have someone else doing all the food. We had people writing the [text-based] NPC characters talking to players. There were 17,000 messages in each run written between the characters with each other and with our NPC players and GMs.</p>

<p><strong>On the larp’s internal message board.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. There was an insane amount of this work, but you could train AI by putting all of our material in and then automating that, and take a burden off having people doing all that. You could automate <a href="https://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/">EmptyEpsilon</a> scenarios a lot more. Tech-wise, there is already really, really good infrastructure behind that, and there is still room to do a lot more automation so that it doesn’t need manual triggering. And then, of course, we had a huge crew of photographers. We had a huge crew of SFX, makeup. You could streamline those a lot. If there were 14 runs a year, you don’t need to have a photographer in each run. You could say, “Okay, we have two runs in a year where we have a professional photographer and others, we only take portraits,” or stuff like that. So it would streamline a lot of the people needed to be on site.</p>



<p><strong>At the Galactic Starcruiser, you could pay a lot of extra money to have a photographer take photos of you.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. There are a lot of larpers who are not that interested in having that because larp is not about photos.</p>



<p><strong>But some people do.</strong></p>



<p>But some people do! So there are a lot of opportunities to do that. And these are just the first thoughts which we had.</p>



<p><strong>Awesome. That’s very exciting. I can’t wait for you to talk to the <a href="https://mssv.net/2024/07/31/bridge-command/">Bridge Command</a> people. So the final question I have is about your <a href="https://www.vapriikki.fi/en/exhibition/odysseus-the-story-of-a-larp/">museum exhibition</a>, which is awesome. When did they approach you?</strong></p>



<p>We approached them. My husband bumped into a person attached to the museum at a conference, and I just sent an email that we had this larp, would you be interested in featuring it in the museum? The person replied and we had a meeting. I was there for two hours, telling them what we did, how we did it, why this was significant. And they were like, “Yeah, we want to do an exhibition.”</p>



<p><strong>Was this after the 2024 runs?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, this was after. It was in late August, early September. It was also really lucky because this temporary exhibition was ending in February. They had plans to have another exhibition, but they changed those plans because they wanted us there.</p>

<p><strong>Wow! So this is one of the first exhibitions – the first – about larps?</strong></p>



<p>In the same museum, there are a few larps in small displays. There is <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Halat_hisar">Halat Hisar</a> and then there is this Finnish tavern larp [<a href="https://rajakatsefantasia.fi/">Rajakatse</a>] which has been going on for 30 years. So [Odysseus] is not the first larp, but to have it in this scale, a major exhibition dedicated to a larp, that’s significant, because it’s the Finnish Museum of Games. It features all the games and [gamers] are very core target audiences for any larp.</p>



<p><strong>Are they going to add any of the objects to their collection?</strong></p>



<p>The objects are ours, so they are loaned. But we’re having preliminary discussions on whether we want to have the same exhibition go elsewhere, because all the items are ours and we will get all the graphics as well, which were created for the museum.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cool. Yeah, you should.</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we have some significant announcements about the future of the Fauna service as well as our core technology.</p><p>Fauna’s mission has been to make working with operational data productive, scalable and secure for every software development team. Over the years Fauna built a revolutionary new document-relational database that has delighted thousands of development teams across the globe and powered the businesses of hundreds of paying customers.
However, after careful consideration, we have made the hard decision to sunset the Fauna service over the next several months.</p><p>Driving broad based adoption of a new operational database that runs as a service globally is very capital intensive. In the current market environment, our board and investors have determined that it is not possible to raise the capital needed to achieve that goal independently.
While we will no longer be accepting new customers, existing Fauna customers will experience no immediate change. We will gradually transition customers off Fauna and are committed to ensuring a smooth process over the next several months.  For more specifics see the FAQ below.</p><h2><span id="a-commitment-to-open-sourcing-the-fauna-technology"></span>A commitment to open sourcing the Fauna technology</h2><p>With this change we are also committing to releasing an open source version of Fauna’s core database technology alongside our existing open source drivers and CLI tooling. This ensures that Fauna's unique capabilities—our transactional features, document-relational data model, and our database language (FQL)—will be available to the community. We hope this will serve as both a valuable reference for database practitioners and will provide ongoing value to the wider developer community.</p><p>We are profoundly grateful to our customers, partners, and investors who have been integral to the Fauna journey.  We would not have accomplished what we did without your support.  We understand that this is going to be a disruptive change to many and are fully committed to working with our existing customers to help them migrate off the service over the next several months.

      <article>
        

        





<p>Here in the northern hemisphere the vernal equinox just passed and the days are
quickly getting longer.  One of my colleagues lives in Stavanger, Norway.  Our
team’s semi-weekly standup is at 6:30pm his time, so I’ve been accustomed to
seeing the window in his background be pitch black for the past six months.
But from one meeting to the next, his window went from pitch black to bright.
This led me to think about a basic astronomy question I had never given much
thought to before — just how fast do the days get longer?  When Spring comes
and the days are getting longer, how many extra minutes of sunlight do we get
from one day to the next?  So I built a little interactive graph that shows how
the length of the day changes as a function of latitude, along with how it
changes from one day to the next:</p>





<p>The vertical dashed lines represent the various solstices and equinoxes.  As
expected, for northern latitudes the longest day is on the summer solstice and
the shortest on the winter solstice.  On the equinoxes the day is exactly 12
hours no matter what latitude you are at, and this is also when the length of
the day is changing the fastest — unless you are very close to the Arctic
circle (latitude 66.55°).</p>

<p>One of the more interesting features I hadn’t appreciated before is that when
you get close to the Arctic circle, the length of the days is essentially a
zigzag, straight up from the winter solstice all the way to the summer solstice
and back down again.</p>

<h2 id="the-math-behind-it">The math behind it</h2>

<p>So what calculations are going into producing these curves?</p>

<h3 id="how-long-is-the-sun-up-for">How long is the Sun up for?</h3>

<p>The first thing we need to know is how long the Sun is up for on a particular
day of the year.  Spherical astronomy has a useful quantity that lets us
determine this, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_angle">hour angle</a>.  The hour angle of an object is the
angle it makes with the meridian (the line across the sky going from north to
south).  Converting the hour angle into a unit of time (like hours) tells us
how long it will be before the object crosses the meridian (“transits” in the
astronomical parlance).  Since we want the time from rising to setting, the
length of daylight will be twice the amount of time it takes between rising and
transit:</p>

\[t_{\textrm{daylight}} = 2H \left( \frac{24 \, \textrm{hr}}{360^{\circ}} \right)
= \frac{2H}{15^{\circ}} \, \textrm{hr}.\]

<p>If we can figure out what the Sun’s hour angle is when it rises, we’ll have the
amount of daylight in a day.  To get this, we need to know two things: the
observer’s latitude, which we’ll call \(\lambda\); and the declination of the
Sun, \(\delta\), which is the angle of the Sun above the celestial equator.</p>

<p>A diagram (from <a href="http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~fv/webnotes/chapter7.htm">Prof. Fiona Vincent</a>) helps to illustrate the setup:</p>

<p><img src="https://joe-antognini.github.io/assets/posts/daylight/celestial-sphere.gif"></p>

<p>The position of the object we’re interested in is labeled with \(X\) in this
diagram, and it shows the general case where the object is at some arbitrary
altitude \(a\) above the horizon.  (Note that the latitude is labeled \(\phi\)
in this diagram.)</p>

<p>We know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle and want to find the
angle \(H\).  To do this we can turn to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines">spherical law of cosines</a>:</p>

\[\cos (90^{\circ} - a) = \cos (90^{\circ} - \lambda) \cos (90^{\circ} - \delta)
+ \sin(90^{\circ} - \lambda) \sin (90^{\circ} - \delta) \cos H.\]

<p>Since we want to know the hour angle of the Sun when it’s rising, we can set
the altitude, \(a\), to 0.  Solving for \(H\), this becomes</p>

\[H = \arccos (-\tan \lambda \tan \delta).\]

<p>This is the so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation">sunrise equation</a>.”</p>

<p>In order to make use of this equation we now need to find the declination of
the Sun.  The Sun just moves along a great circle on the sky called the
“ecliptic,” and to first order this motion is approximately constant.  So we
can model the Sun’s declination over the course of the year with a simple
sinusoid:</p>

\[\delta \simeq \epsilon \sin \left( \frac{T}{365 \, \textrm{d}} \right),\]

<p>where \(\epsilon\) is the tilt of the Earth’s rotation axis (the “obliquity of
the ecliptic” in the astronomical jargon), about \(23.45^{\circ}\), and \(T\)
is just the number of days since the vernal equinox.</p>

<p>Putting this all together, if you have a latitude and day of the year you can
calculate the length of daylight by using this formula:</p>

\[t_{\textrm{daylight}} \approx \frac{2}{15^{\circ}} \arccos \left(-\tan \lambda
\tan \left(23.45^{\circ} \times \sin \frac{2 \pi T}{365 \, \textrm{d}} \right)
\right) \, \textrm{hr}.\]

<h3 id="daylight-across-the-globe">Daylight across the globe</h3>

<p>There are a few interesting cases to consider in this equation.  First, let’s
suppose we are on the equator.  In that case, our latitude is zero, and the
equation just reduces to \(t_{\textrm{daylight}} = 2/15^{\circ} \arccos (0) \,
\textrm{hr} = 12 \, \textrm{hr}\).  <em>On the equator, every day of the year is
exactly 12 hours long.</em></p>

<p>Another case to consider is what happens on the vernal equinox.  Now we set
\(T\) to zero and once again the argument to the arccosine disappears, and we
get 12 hours.  (And because \(\cos (x + \pi) = \cos x\), this also happens on
the autumnal equinox.)  <em>On an equinox, the day is exactly 12 hours long,
independent of latitude.</em></p>

<p>The last thing to consider is that the arccosine function is only defined if
the argument is between \(-1\) and \(1\).  But the argument to the function is
the product of two tangents, and the tangent function is unbounded.  Let’s see
what happens on the summer solstice.  Here the \(\sin T\) term is exactly 1.
If the product \(\tan \lambda \tan 23.45^{\circ}\) exceeds 1, then the
arccosine function will be undefined.  This will happen when the latitude is
above \(90^{\circ} - 23.45^{\circ} = 66.55^{\circ}\).  This latitude defines
the Arctic circle, and at this latitude and above the length of daylight on the
summer solstice is undefined.  This is because at these latitudes the Sun
<em>doesn’t</em> set at this time of the year!  In the extreme limit of the north
pole, \(\tan 90^{\circ} = \infty\) and the length of day is undefined all year
long.  At the north pole, the Sun rises just once per year, on the vernal
equinox, and stays up until the autumnal equinox.</p>

<h2 id="the-derivative-of-daylight">The derivative of daylight</h2>

<p>Now that we have an equation for the length of daylight, seeing how much it
changes from day to day is fairly straightforward.  All we have to do is take
the derivative.  Converting to the more useful units of minutes / day, this
ends up being:</p>

\[\frac{dt_{\textrm{daylight}}}{dT} = \frac{576 \epsilon \cos 2\pi \widetilde{T}
\tan \lambda \sec^2 (\epsilon \sin 2\pi \widetilde{T})}{73\sqrt{1 - \tan^2
\lambda \tan^2 (\epsilon \sin 2\pi \widetilde{T})}} \,
\frac{\textrm{min}}{\textrm{day}},\]

<p>where to make the equation a little cleaner, I’ve used \(\widetilde{T}\) to
represent the fraction of the year since the vernal equinox.</p>

<h2 id="complications">Complications</h2>

<p>To get a relatively simple functional form, I made a few approximations in the
plots and equations above.  What would we have to change if we wanted a more
accurate calculation?</p>

<h3 id="atmospheric-refraction-and-the-solar-limb">Atmospheric refraction and the solar limb</h3>

<p>When calculating the length of day I assumed that the day began when the Sun is
right on the horizon.  But this isn’t quite when sunrise is in reality.  First,
the Sun has a finite width, about half a degree, so when its center is right on
the horizon, half of the disk is above the horizon, and we would still consider
it daytime.  So really we want to know when the <em>top</em> of the Sun reaches the
horizon.</p>

<p>The second complication is that at the moment we observe the Sun to rise, its
true position is still, in fact, beneath the horizon.  But due to the
refraction light by the atmosphere, the light from the Sun curves upward to
make the Sun appear higher on the sky than it really is.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://joe-antognini.github.io/assets/posts/daylight/atmospheric_refraction.png">

  </figure>

<p>To take into account atmospheric refraction, we would not want to calculate the
hour angle of the Sun when its altitude is zero, but when it is <em>slightly less</em>
than zero.  On the horizon, this effect turns out to be about twice as large as
the width of the Sun.</p>

<p>Taking into account both the width of the solar disk (the “solar limb” in the
jargon) and atmospheric refraction, the altitude of the Sun at sunrise or
sunset is on average about \(-50^{\prime}\). (Though the atmospheric refraction
varies quite a bit due to weather conditions very close to the horizon.)
Unfortunately this complicates the sunrise equation quite a bit since the
altitude term no longer drops out of the spherical law of cosines equation and
we get</p>

\[H = \arccos \left(-\tan \lambda \tan \delta - \frac{\sin a}{\cos \lambda \cos
\delta} \right).\]

<p>You can see how much extra daylight this effect gives you at different
latitudes with this plot:</p>





<p>A difference in altitude of \(50^{\prime}\) doesn’t sound like too much, but it
adds a non-negligible amount of daylight to the day.  At the latitude of Los
Angeles (\(34^{\circ}\)) it adds around eight extra minutes of daylight to the
day.  So strictly speaking the “equinox” is a bit of a misnomer — thanks to
the atmosphere the length of the day isn’t quite equal to the length of the
night.  Even at the equator where the effect is weakest there is 6 minutes and
40 seconds of extra daylight on the equinox, so the day is more than 13 minutes
longer than the night!  And at higher latitudes the impact of atmospheric
refraction becomes even more pronounced.  At those latitudes the ecliptic runs
almost parallel to the horizon, so the Sun has to move quite a ways
horizontally to make much progress in the vertical direction.  For my friend in
Stavanger this effect adds nearly 20 minutes to his day during the solstices.
But at least until you get very close to the Arctic circle, the change in the
amount of daylight from one day to the next due to this effect is relatively
small.</p>

<p>There is a second problem with the equation I used for the length of the day.
When I calculated the declination of the Sun I just modeled it as a simple
sinusoid:</p>

\[\delta \simeq \epsilon \sin \left( \frac{T}{365 \, \textrm{d}} \right).\]

<p>This is a reasonably good approximation, but it has two problems.  The first is
that it doesn’t properly take into account the spherical geometry.  You can
imagine that in the limit that the ecliptic were tilted at \(90^{\circ}\), the
Sun’s declination would simply increase linearly from \(0^{\circ}\) to
\(90^{\circ}\) and then back down again.  Really the correct equation is</p>

\[\delta = \arcsin \left(-\sin \epsilon \sin \left( \frac{T}{365 \, \textrm{d}}
\right) \right).\]

<p>We were effectively using the small angle approximation of \(\sin x \simeq x\),
along with its inverse, \(\arcsin x \simeq x\).  Since \(\epsilon\), the
obliquity of the ecliptic, is (sort of) small, the approximation
is only off from the true value by at most \(1.5^{\circ}\), and this ends up
having a fairly small impact on the change in the amount of daylight from one
day to the next.</p>

<p>The other way that the simple model for the Sun’s declination is wrong is that
it assumes that the Sun moves at a constant angular speed over the course of
the year.  But because the Earth’s orbit is elliptical, when the Earth is at
perihelion (which occurs in early January), the Sun will appear to move
somewhat faster than average and when the Earth is at aphelion (in early July),
the Sun will move slower than average.</p>

<p>To account for the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit you’d have to turn to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation">Kepler equation</a>:</p>

\[2 \pi \widetilde{T} = E - e \sin E,\]

<p>where \(E\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_anomaly">eccentric anomaly</a> and \(e\) is the eccentricity of the
Earth’s orbit.  After solving this transcendental equation you’d then have to
convert the eccentric anomaly into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_anomaly">true anomaly</a>:</p>

\[\nu = \arccos \left( \frac{\cos E - e}{1 - e \cos E} \right).\]

<p>This would then give you the ecliptic longitude of the true Sun rather than
the ecliptic longitude of the <em>mean</em> Sun.</p>

<p>The overall impact of the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit on the length of
the day is pretty minimal, however.  Over the course of the year the Sun drifts
from west to east with respect to the background stars.  Because of this drift,
the length of the <em>solar</em> day is about four minutes longer than the length of
the <em>sidereal</em> day (a complete \(360^{\circ}\) rotation of the Earth).  This
means that near perihelion, when the Sun is moving faster than average, the day
will be slightly longer than it would otherwise be.  And around aphelion the
day will be slightly shorter.  But even at these times when the effect is
maximal, the change in the length of the day is only on the order of 10
seconds (unless, as always, you’re in the Arctic circle or very close to it).</p>

<p>So those are few ways to find out how long the day is, some simpler and some
more accurate.  If you would like to see the code I used to generate the
figures you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/joe-antognini/joe-antognini.github.io/blob/master/assets/posts/daylight/Sunrise.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations/tree/main/skrifa">Skrifa</a>
is written in
Rust,
and created as a replacement for FreeType to make font processing in Chrome
secure for all our users.
Skifra takes advantage of Rust's memory safety,
and lets us iterate faster on font technology improvements in Chrome.
Moving from FreeType to Skrifa allows us to be both agile and fearless when
making changes to our font code. We now spend far less time fixing security bugs,
resulting in faster updates, and better code quality.</p>

<p>This post shares why Chrome has moved away from FreeType,
and some interesting technical details of the improvements this move has enabled.</p>

<h2 id="why_replace_freetype" data-text="Why replace FreeType?" tabindex="-1">Why replace FreeType?</h2>

<p>The web is unique in that it allows users to fetch untrusted resources from a
wide variety of untrusted sources with the expectation that things will just
work, and that they are safe in doing so. This assumption is generally correct,
but keeping that promise to users comes at a cost. For example, to use a web
font safely (a font delivered over the network) Chrome employs several security
mitigations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Font processing is
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/design/sandbox.md">sandboxed</a>
per the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md">rule of
two</a>:
they are untrustworthy and the consuming code is unsafe.</li>
<li>Fonts are passed through the <a href="https://github.com/khaledhosny/ots">OpenType
Sanitizer</a> prior to processing.</li>
<li>All the libraries involved in decompressing and processing fonts are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzz
tested</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chrome ships with FreeType and makes use of it as the primary font processing
library on Android, ChromeOS, and Linux. That means a <strong>lot</strong> of users are
exposed if there is a vulnerability in FreeType.</p>

<p>The FreeType library is used by Chrome to compute metrics and load hinted
outlines from fonts. Overall, use of FreeType has been a huge win for Google. It
does a complex job, and does it well, we rely on it extensively and contribute
back to it. However, it is written in unsafe code and has its origins in a time
when malicious inputs were less likely. Merely keeping up with the stream of
issues found by fuzzing costs Google at least 0.25 full time software
engineers. Worse, we observably don't find everything or find things only after
the code has shipped to users.</p>

<p>This pattern of problems is not unique to FreeType, we observe that other unsafe
libraries admit issues even when we use the best software engineers we can find,
code review every change, and require tests.</p>

<h3 id="why_issues_keep_sneaking_in" data-text="Why issues keep sneaking in" tabindex="-1">Why issues keep sneaking in</h3>

<p>When we evaluated FreeType's security, we observed three main classes of issue
to occur (non-exhaustive):</p>

<h4 id="dependency_issues" data-text="Dependency issues" tabindex="-1">Dependency issues</h4>

<p>Fuzzing has repeatedly identified issues in libraries FreeType depends on, such
as bzip2, libpng, and zlib. As an example, compare <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40055682">freetype_bdf_fuzzer:
Use-of-uninitialized-value in
inflate</a>.</p>

<h4 id="fuzzing_isnt_enough" data-text="Fuzzing isn't enough" tabindex="-1">Fuzzing isn't enough</h4>

<p>Fuzzing–automated testing with a wide range of inputs, including randomized
invalid ones–is meant to find many of the types of issues that get into the
stable release of Chrome. We fuzz FreeType as part of Google's
<a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz">oss-fuzz</a> project. It does find issues, but
fonts have proven somewhat resistant to fuzzing, for the following reasons.</p>

<p>Font files are complex, comparable to video files as they contain multiple
different types of information. Font files are a container format for multiple
tables, where each table serves a different purpose in processing text and fonts
together to produce a correctly positioned glyph on the screen. In a font file
you will find:</p>

<ul>
<li>Static metadata such as font names and parameters for variable fonts.</li>
<li>Mappings from Unicode characters to glyphs.</li>
<li>A complex ruleset and grammar for screen layout of glyphs.</li>
<li>Visual information: Glyph shapes and image information describing what the
glyphs placed on the screen look like.
<ul>
<li>The visual tables can in turn include TrueType hinting programs, which
are mini programs executed to change the glyph shape.</li>
<li>Char strings in the CFF or CFF2 tables which are imperative curve
drawing and hinting instructions executed in the CFF rendering engine.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There is complexity in font files equivalent to having its own programming
language and state machine processing, requiring specific virtual machines to
execute them.</p>

<p>Because of the complexity of the format, fuzzing has shortcomings in finding
issues in font files.</p>

<p>Good code coverage or fuzzer progress is difficult to achieve for the following
reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuzzing TrueType hinting programs, CFF char strings and OpenType layout
using simple bit-flipping/shift/insertion/deletion-style mutators struggles
to reach all combinations of states.</li>
<li>Fuzzing needs to at least produce partially valid structures. Random
mutation rarely does so, making good coverage hard to achieve, particularly
for deeper levels of code.</li>
<li>The current fuzzing efforts in ClusterFuzz and oss-fuzz are not yet using
structure-aware mutation. Use of grammar- or structure-aware mutators might
help avoid production of variants that are rejected early, at the cost of
taking more time to develop, and introducing chances which miss parts of the
search space.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data in multiple tables needs to be in sync for fuzzing to make progress:</p>

<ul>
<li>The usual mutation patterns of fuzzers don't produce partially valid data
so many iterations get rejected and progress becomes slow.</li>
<li>The glyph mapping, the OpenType layout tables and glyph drawing are
connected and depend on each other, forming a combinatorial space whose
corners are hard to reach with fuzzing.</li>
<li>For example, the high-severity <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/40055587">tt_face_get_paint
COLRv1</a> vulnerability took more than
10 months to find.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite our best efforts, font security issues have repeatedly reached end
users. Replacing FreeType with a Rust alternative will prevent multiple entire
classes of vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="skrifa_in_chrome" data-text="Skrifa in Chrome" tabindex="-1">Skrifa in Chrome</h2>

<p><a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a> is the graphics library used by Chrome. Skia relies on
FreeType to load metadata and letterforms from fonts.
<a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations/tree/main/skrifa">Skrifa</a> is a Rust
library, part of the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations">Fontations</a>
family of libraries, that provides a safe replacement for the parts of FreeType
used by Skia.</p>

<p>To transition FreeType to Skia the Chrome team developed a new Skia font backend
based on <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations/tree/main/skrifa">Skrifa</a>
and gradually rolled out the change to users:</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/6df58d58e667f19490acc1c51095aaf08842bea7">Chrome 128 (August 2024) we enabled
Fontations</a>
for use in less commonly used font formats, such as for color fonts and
CFF2, as a safe trial run.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/5717358869217280">Chrome 133 (February 2025) we enabled
Fontations</a> for all web
fonts usage on Linux, Android and ChromeOS, and for web fonts usage as
fallback on Windows and Mac—in cases where the system does not support a
font format but Chrome needs to display it.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the integration into Chrome, we rely on the smooth integration of Rust into
the codebase introduced by the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/supporting-use-of-rust-in-chromium.html">Chrome security
team</a>.</p>

<p>In the future we'll switch to Fontations for operating system fonts as well,
starting with Linux and ChromeOS, then on Android.</p>

<h3 id="safety_first_and_foremost" data-text="Safety, first and foremost" tabindex="-1">Safety, first and foremost</h3>

<p>Our primary goal is to reduce (or ideally, eliminate!) security vulnerabilities
that are caused by out of bounds access to memory. Rust provides this out of the
box as long as you avoid any <em>unsafe</em> code blocks.</p>

<p>Our performance goals require us to perform one operation that is currently
unsafe: reinterpretation of arbitrary bytes as a strongly typed data structure.
This allows us to read the data from a font file without performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy">unnecessary
copies</a> and is essential for producing
a fast font parser.</p>

<p>To avoid our own unsafe code, we've chosen to outsource this responsibility to
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/bytemuck">bytemuck</a> which is a Rust library designed
specifically for this purpose and is widely tested and used across the
ecosystem. Concentrating raw data reinterpretation in bytemuck ensures we have
this functionality in one place and audited, and avoid repeating unsafe code for
the purpose. The <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2835-project-safe-transmute.html">safe transmute
project</a> aims
to incorporate this functionality directly into the Rust compiler and we will
make the switch as soon as it is available.</p>

<h3 id="correctness_matters" data-text="Correctness matters" tabindex="-1">Correctness matters</h3>

<p>Skrifa is built out of independent components where most data structures are
designed to be immutable. This improves readability, maintainability and
multithreading. It also makes the code more amenable to unit testing. We've
taken advantage of this opportunity and have produced a suite of roughly 700
unit tests that cover our full stack from low level parsing routines to high
level hinting virtual machines.</p>

<p>Correctness also implies fidelity and FreeType is highly regarded for its
generation of high quality outlines. We must match this quality to be a suitable
replacement. To that end, we have built a bespoke tool called
<a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations/tree/main/fauntlet">fauntlet</a> that
compares the output of Skrifa and FreeType for batches of font files across a
wide range of configurations. This affords us some assurance that we can avoid
regressions in quality.</p>

<p>In addition, before the integration into Chromium, we ran a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/skia/gm/fontations_ft_compare.cpp">wide set of pixel
comparisons</a>
in Skia, comparing FreeType rendering to Skrifa and Skia rendering to ensure the
pixel differences are absolutely minimal, in all required rendering modes
(across different antialiasing and hinting modes).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzz testing</a> is an important tool for
determining how a piece of software will react to malformed and malicious
inputs. We've been continuously fuzzing our new code since June of 2024. This
covers the Rust libraries itself and the integration code. While the fuzzer has
found (as of this writing) 39 bugs, it's worth noting that <strong>none of these have
been security critical</strong>. They may cause undesired visual results or even
controlled crashes, but won't lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 id="onward" data-text="Onward!" tabindex="-1">Onward!</h2>

<p>We are very pleased with the results of our efforts to use Rust for text.
Delivering safer code to users <em>and</em> gaining developer productivity is a huge
win for us. We plan to continue to seek opportunities to use Rust in our text
stacks. If you'd like to know more,
<a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/oxidize">Oxidize</a> outlines some of Google Fonts
future plans.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h3><a id="user-content-building" aria-label="Permalink: Building" href="#building"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can find instructions for building Ikemen GO on our wiki. Instructions are available for <a href="https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Building,-Installing-and-Distributing#building-on-windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Building,-Installing-and-Distributing#building-on-macos">macOS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Building,-Installing-and-Distributing#building-on-linux">Linux</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debugging</h3><a id="user-content-debugging" aria-label="Permalink: Debugging" href="#debugging"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In order to run the compiled Ikemen GO executable, you will need to download the <a href="https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen_GO-Elecbyte-Screenpack">engine dependencies</a> and unpack them into the Ikemen-GO source directory. After that, you can use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" rel="nofollow">Goland</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> to debug.</p>

<p dir="auto">The easiest way to compile binaries for other platforms is with Docker.
You don't need the native development environment set to be able to build binaries if you decide to use Docker.<br>
The image downloaded has all the required tools to compile Ikemen GO for all three major platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto">Install <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" rel="nofollow">Docker for your platform</a>.<br>
For macOS, you can install Docker using Homebrew (<code>brew cask install docker</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Open a terminal, go to the Ikemen <code>build</code> directory folder and then run the script <code>build_docker.sh</code>. Look inside the script for details on how it works.</p>
