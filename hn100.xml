								<p>Kuten <a href="https://dawn.fi/uutiset/2023/10/12/suomi-csam-suuri-valiokunta">uutisoimme aiemmin t√§ll√§ viikolla</a>, Suomen eduskunnan oli tarkoitus ottaa t√§m√§n viikon perjantaina <i>(13.10.2023)</i> lopullisesti kantaa <strong>Euroopan Unionin</strong> niin kutsuttuun <strong>CSAM-asetukseen</strong>.</p><p>Kyseinen asetus toteutuessaan nykymuodossa k√§yt√§nn√∂ss√§ kielt√§isi vahvan, p√§√§st√§ p√§√§h√§n ulottuvan salauksen koko Euroopassa, kaikissa viestinn√§n muodoissa. Tavalliselle kuluttajalle kenties tunnetuin esimerkki vahvasta salauksesta ovat pikaviestimet, kuten <strong>WhatsApp</strong> ja <strong>Signal</strong>. Vahvasti salatut pikaviestimet ovat mahdottomia murtaa ja viestej√§ voi lukea vain viestin l√§hett√§j√§ sek√§ sen tarkoitettu vastaanottaja.</p><p>EU haluaa, ett√§ Euroopan viranomaiset p√§√§sisiv√§t murtamaan t√§m√§n v√§lin siten, ett√§ kaikkea viestint√§√§ voitaisiin seurata teko√§lyn avulla ja etsi√§ sielt√§ ep√§ilytt√§v√§√§ materiaalia, ilman erillist√§ oikeuden m√§√§r√§yst√§. Eli salaus pit√§isi murtaa - ja rakentaa kaikkea viestint√§√§ seuraava massavalvonta.</p><h2>Suomen kanta</h2><p>Suomessa asiaan otettiin kantaa perjantaina, kun eduskunnan <strong>Suuri valiokunta</strong> antoi asiasta p√§√§t√∂ksens√§. Suuren valiokunnan p√§√§t√∂s pohjautuu useilta eri tahoilta ker√§ttyihin asiantuntijalausuntoihin, mukana mm. IT-alan edustajat, perustuslakivaliokunta, jne.</p>
			<p>Suuren valiokunnan kanta sitoo Suomen hallitusta, kun hallitus alkaa neuvottelemaan asetuksesta EU:ssa, eli hallituksen on pakko noudattaa valiokunnan ohjeistusta.</p><p><a href="https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/vaski/Lausunto/Sivut/SuVL_7+2023.aspx" target="_blank">Suuren valiokunnan p√§√§t√∂s</a> saatiin perjantaina iltap√§iv√§ll√§ ja sen voisi tiivist√§√§ termiin "varovainen ei".</p><p>Valiokunta kehui CSAM-esityksen taustalla olevaa ideaa, eli lasten suojelua verkon vaaroilta:</p><blockquote>Suuri valiokunta katsoo, ett√§ asetusehdotuksella on eritt√§in painava tavoite tehokkaasti ennaltaehk√§ist√§ ja torjua lapsiin kohdistuvaa verkkov√§litteist√§ seksuaaliv√§kivaltaa EU-tason toimin. Valiokunta pit√§√§ t√§rke√§n√§, ett√§ EU-tasolla syntyy selke√§ ja sitova oikeudellinen kehys, jolla voidaan tehostaa hyv√§ksik√§yt√∂n havaitsemista, ilmoittamista ja poistamista. Valtioneuvoston tavoin suuri valiokunta painottaa lapsen edun merkityst√§, kun punnitaan ehdotuksen eri osien suhdetta perustuslakiin ja perus- ja ihmisoikeuksiin.</blockquote><p>Mutta siihen sitten asetuksen kanssa my√∂t√§ily pitk√§lti loppuukin, sill√§ valiokunta nosti esiin CSAM-esityksen lukuisia ongelmakohtia.</p>
			<p>Ensinn√§kin valiokunta on sit√§ mielt√§, ett√§ p√§√§st√§ p√§√§h√§n salausta ei saa murtaa, sill√§ se murentaisi tietoturvaa:</p><blockquote>Suuri valiokunta katsoo liikenne- ja viestint√§valiokunnan tavoin, ett√§ jatkoneuvotteluissa on erityisen t√§rke√§ varmistaa, etteiv√§t tunnistamism√§√§r√§ykset johda p√§√§st√§ p√§√§h√§n -salauksen tai muiden vastaavien tietoturvatoimenpiteiden yleiseen heikent√§miseen, purkamiseen tai k√§yt√∂n rajoittamiseen ja t√§t√§ kautta viestinn√§n sek√§ viestinn√§n palvelujen tietoturvan ja kyberturvallisuuden tason heikkenemiseen. </blockquote><p>Lis√§ksi valiokunta katsoo, ett√§ ehdotusta ei voida kannattaa sellaisessa muodossa, ett√§ se sallisi massavalvonnan. Valiokunnan mukaan valvontaa pit√§isi tehd√§ ainoastaan tunnistettuihin kohteisiin, eik√§ siis koko kansan tasolla. Eli valiokunta tyrm√§si ehdotuksen siit√§, ett√§ kaikkien ihmisten kaikkia viestej√§ aletaan skannaamaan, josko sielt√§ l√∂ytyisi jotain ep√§ilytt√§v√§√§.</p><p>Eli Suomi ei voi suuren valiokunnan lausunnon pohjalta hyv√§ksy√§ ehdotusta t√§llaisenaan. </p><h2>Miten asia etenee?</h2><p>EU-maat √§√§nest√§v√§t ehdotuksesta lokakuun lopulla. Tuolloin ehdotus menee l√§pi, mik√§li sit√§ ei vastusta sellainen m√§√§r√§ maita, jotka edustavat yhteens√§ v√§hint√§√§n 35 prosenttia EU-kansalaisista.</p>
			<center><blockquote><p lang="fi" dir="ltr">35% m√§√§r√§v√§hemmist√∂ edustetuista EU-kansalaisista. Neuvoston sivulla on n√§pp√§r√§ laskuri: <a href="https://t.co/JCZP43ThCX">https://t.co/JCZP43ThCX</a></p>-- Asko Metsola (@AskoMetsola) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskoMetsola/status/1712819824567484795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2023</a></blockquote> </center><p>Tiedossa on, ett√§ ainakin Saksa, It√§valta ja Viro vastustavat ehdotusta. Kannattajia on tiedossa selke√§sti enemm√§n, mm. Espanja, Tanska, Unkari ja Irlanti kannattavat komission ehdotusta.</p><p>P√§√§t√∂st√§ eiv√§t ole viel√§ tehneet l√§hesk√§√§n kaikki maat, sill√§ p√§√§t√∂st√§ odotetaan mm. Ranskan, Ruotsin, Belgian, Hollannin ja Portugalin osalta.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs an exciting time in the Lotus 1-2-3 enthusiast community ‚Äì that was a joke, there is no enthusiast community, it‚Äôs just me! üòÜ</p>
<p>It really is an exciting time though ‚Äì that part isn‚Äôt a joke!</p>
<p>There have been some major developments in the last few weeks, and I guess that‚Äôs pretty unusual for 30 year old abandonware.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll cut to the chase; through a combination of unlikely discoveries, crazy hacks and the 90s BBS warez scene I‚Äôve been able to port Lotus 1-2-3 natively to Linux ‚Äì an operating system that literally didn‚Äôt exist when 1-2-3 was released!<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>If you want to hear how a proprietary application could be ported to new operating systems 30 years after release, read on.</p>

<p>I really like Lotus 1-2-3, I even maintain a <a href="https://github.com/taviso/lotusdrv">driver</a> to make sure it works well on modern systems. I had to reverse engineer the driver api to make that happen, but it works beautifully.</p>
<p>Getting that driver working was quite an <a href="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/lotus123.html">adventure</a>, but there is still one piece of the puzzle missing: add-ins. 1-2-3 was designed to be extensible with plugins (or ‚Äúadd-ins‚Äù) ‚Äì in theory you could add support for modern spreadsheet functions or integrate with Google Finance or something!</p>
<p>The problem is add-ins had to be written in a special language called LPL, and unfortunately the compiler and SDK have been lost. This is not really surprising, this was a niche product and Lotus didn‚Äôt just give the SDK away ‚Äì they charged $395 for it. I can‚Äôt imagine many people have a copy just lying around.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_OEk1QOJYw0C&amp;lpg=PT115&amp;vq=toolkit&amp;pg=PT115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/pc-mag-toolkit.png" alt="Lotus Toolkit Review"></a></p>
<p>There were lots of commercial plugins available in the heyday, some were really <a href="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/files/pcmag-apr1991-perfect-spreadsheet.pdf">impressive</a>. I emailed a few developers who worked on some to see if they had any old backups, the answer was always the same ‚Äì 1-2-3 was the biggest name in software, nobody thought it was going anywhere, so why would they keep backups?</p>
<p>There were also two third-party books written about LPL, I managed to track them down from old libraries. I like the cover on this one, very serious business. It‚Äôs so frustating, I can see screenshots of the debugger, compiler output and sample add-ins - but just can‚Äôt do anything with it without the SDK!</p>

</figure>
<p>Fast forward a year or two, and I found someone who used to be a sysop in the ‚Äô90s BBS scene. Check out his <a href="https://scenelist.org/">website</a>, he still has a catalogue of NFOs and a telnet BBS online if you want to see some rad ANSI art!</p>
<p>He had kept tape backups from old BBS systems, and was able to recover a warez copy of the SDK ‚Äì unbelievable! It actually worked, I was able to build a few sample plugins!</p>

<p>You can download the ADK right <a href="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/files/123DADK.ZIP">here</a>, and here is a <a href="https://github.com/taviso/lotusdrv/blob/master/addin/modern.pl">sample</a> LPL program.</p>
<p>This would already have been enough to keep me entertained for a while, but it doesn‚Äôt stop there. It turns out that the BBS also had a warez copy of Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX. This was widely thought to be lost ‚Äì I‚Äôm told it couldn‚Äôt compete with a more popular UNIX office suite called SCO Professional, so there were not many copies sold.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt really have any use for it, but I‚Äôm definitely curious enough to poke around on the installation media to see what‚Äôs in it!</p>

<p>The warez release was a bunch of TD0 files, that‚Äôs a format I‚Äôve never seen before ‚Äì apparently it‚Äôs an old compressed disk image format from the 80s. I found <a href="https://www.worldofsam.org/products/teledisk">this page</a> which recommends using <a href="https://github.com/simonowen/samdisk">samdisk</a> to convert it to a raw disk image.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls

<p>That seemed promising, <code>samdisk</code> builds and seems to work! I‚Äôve uploaded the full <a href="https://archive.org/details/123-unix">images</a> onto the Internet Archive in case anyone else is curious enough to take a look.</p>

<p>I know that UNIX software was usually distributed as raw archives, and you were expected to insert the diskette and run something like <code>tar -C / -xvf /dev/fd0</code>, so these files look right. I think this is smart, why waste precious bytes on a filesystem?</p>

<h2>A Mystery File</h2>
<p>While poking around, this one directory caught my eye, what exactly is this?</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l
total 2.0M
-rw-r--r-- 1 taviso taviso 1.2M May 20 13:53 123.o.z_1
-rw-r--r-- 1 taviso taviso 717K May 20 13:53 123.o.z_2

-rw-r--r-- 1 taviso taviso 1.4K May 20 13:53 wyse50-lts123</code></pre>
<p>That <code>123.o</code> file is huge, even compressed it had to be split across two disks. Let‚Äôs take a closer look‚Ä¶</p>
<pre><code>$ cat 123.o.z_? | gzip -d &gt; 123.o
$ file 123.o
123.o: Intel 80386 COFF object file, not stripped, 5 sections, symbol offset=0x1efbdc, 19755 symbols, optional header size 28</code></pre>
<p>Yikes - it‚Äôs an original unstripped object file from 1-2-3. There are nearly 20,000 symbols including private symbols and debug information.</p>
<p>Why would Lotus ship this? It‚Äôs so big it must have required them to phyiscally ship an extra disk to every customer? Could it have been a mistake, accidentally left on the final release image?</p>
<p>I had so many questions, but I‚Äôm not old enough to have any experience with SysV, so I asked the greybeards on <a href="news:alt.folklore.computers">alt.folklore.computers</a> if they had seen this before and why this might have happened.</p>
<p>The answer was that this is probably deliberate - <code>dlopen()</code> was not widely available on UNIX in the early 90s, so there was no easy way to load native plugins or extensions. To solve this, vendors would ship a bunch of <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.38/ld/Options.html#:~:text=This%20is%20often%20called%20partial%20linking.">partially linked</a> object files with a script to relink them with your extensions ‚Äì Clever!</p>
<section id="hacking">
<h2>Hacking</h2>
<p>I can‚Äôt tell you how useful this discovery was ‚Äì the debug information answered so many questions I had about Lotus 1-2-3 internals! This was a direct source port from DOS, so it mostly worked the same way but now I had debugging data. For example, I really wanted to hook into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation">rasterizer</a> in my driver so that I could improve the appearance of graphs in the terminal‚Ä¶ but it was just too complex to understand without documentation.</p>
<p>I now know that the rasterizer dynamically generates little bytecode programs that that are interpreted by the graphics engine. Now that I know what the opcodes are I can <a href="https://github.com/taviso/lotusdrv/blob/master/raster.c#L62">disassemble</a> and change them in my driver to improve the output!</p>

<section id="gnu-objcopy">
<h2>GNU objcopy</h2>
<p>Okay‚Ä¶ but there is one more big question, I know that <code>objcopy</code> can convert COFF object files to ELF, the format used by Linux. It seems like a long shot, but is it possible I could link this into a native Linux program? üêß</p>
<pre><code>$ objcopy -I coff-i386 -O elf32-i386 123.o 123elf.o
$ file 123elf.o
123elf.o: ELF 32-bit LSB relocatable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped</code></pre>
<p>Hilariously, the first version of Linux hadn‚Äôt even been released when this object file was compiled ‚Äì but I think this is possible! If you want to hear about the technical challenges, read on!</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -p 123.o  | grep Date

<section id="porting-problems">
<h2>Porting Problems</h2>
<section id="system-calls">
<h2>System Calls</h2>
<p>The first problem is that Linux and UNIX do not use a compatible system call interface. UNIX uses the lcall7 interface, so we need to find those calls and fix them up. Here is how this object file calls <code>open()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -M intel --disassemble=open 123elf.o

123elf.o:     file format elf32-i386


Disassembly of section .text:

000e20d4 &lt;open&gt;:
   e20d4:   b8 05 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x5
   e20d9:   9a 00 00 00 00 07 00    call   0x7:0x0
   e20e0:   0f 82 c6 01 00 00       jb     e22ac &lt;_cerror&gt;
   e20e6:   c3                      ret    
   e20e7:   90                      nop</code></pre>
<p>That <code>call</code> instruction is what‚Äôs known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callgate">callgate</a>, which isn‚Äôt supported on Linux<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, it will just crash. I want to remove this and route all calls through glibc instead. My first thought was just to mark these symbols as undefined, and then let the linker fix that up by importing a replacement symbol from glibc.</p>
<section id="relocations">
<h3>Relocations</h3>
<p>Nothing is ever easy, it turns out that won‚Äôt work! If we try, <code>objcopy</code> will simply refuse:</p>
<pre><code>$ objcopy -I coff-i386 -O elf32-i386 --strip-symbol open 123.o 123elf.o
objcopy: not stripping symbol `open' because it is named in a relocation</code></pre>
<p>What is <code>objcopy</code> trying to tell us here?</p>
<p>This is a relocatable object file, which simply means it can be loaded at any address and still work. That‚Äôs possible because it contains all the necessary information ‚Äì the relocations ‚Äì to adjust it.</p>
<p>Relocations are really simple, the compiler just records the name of the symbol and the references to it. Now the linker can just walk through and patch each reference to point to the new location ‚Äì easy.</p>
<p>So <code>objcopy</code> is saying that you can‚Äôt remove this symbol, because the linker won‚Äôt know what to patch in when it moves it. Fair enough ‚Äì <strong>but</strong>, just because objcopy won‚Äôt do it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs impossible! We <em>could</em> just fix the relocations too, right?</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know of any tool that can do that, but COFF is not a <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/coff/">complicated format</a> ‚Äì I‚Äôll write one!</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="https://github.com/taviso/123elf/blob/main/coffsyrup.c">coffsyrup</a>, a tiny little tool that will remove those pesky COFF symbols even if objcopy refuses!</p>
<pre><code>$ coffsyrup 123.o 123new.o open
MATCH open
RELOC rel open @0x180fa ~0xc9ede
RELOC rel open @0x4c9a1 ~0x95637
RELOC rel open @0x4d348 ~0x94c90
RELOC rel open @0x4ec13 ~0x933c5

<section id="incompatible-functions">
<h3>Incompatible Functions</h3>
<p>Now that we can reroute functions, we have to worry about incompatible functions.</p>
<p>Lots of standard UNIX functions are <em>source</em> but not <em>binary</em> compatible, this is because nobody promises that structures are the same size or layout across UNIX versions. The obvious example is <code>struct stat</code>.</p>
<p>For example, this code is likely to work on any UNIX-like system you can compile it on:</p>

<p>However, the resulting object file is <em>not</em> likely to work on any other system. That‚Äôs because the size of <code>struct stat</code> and the offset of <code>st_size</code> will be different ‚Äì it will probably just corrupt your stack and crash!</p>
<p>Luckily there are not really that many functions like this in UNIX. In fact, the number is small enough that I can probably write wrappers to translate them. The important ones are <code>stat()</code>, <code>times()</code>, <code>uname()</code>, <code>fcntl()</code>, <code>ioctl()</code> and so on.</p>
<p>All I have to do is rename those symbols with <code>objcopy</code>, then mark them undefined with <code>coffsyrup</code>. Now I can write a little wrapper that translates a Linux <code>struct stat</code> to a UNIX <code>struct stat</code> and it should work!</p>

<section id="termios">
<h3>Termios</h3>
<p>Well‚Ä¶I said ‚Äúlittle‚Äù wrappers ‚Äì but there are some big incompatabilities in places. One big nightmare was <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming/termios">termios</a>. Go ahead and take a look at the <code>termios(3)</code> man page, pretty complex right? Well, everything here works differently in subtle, incompatible, and difficult to debug ways on every UNIX system.</p>

<p>I can see from breaking on <code>exit()</code> that there is an internal symbol called <code>lic_init()</code> responsible for checking for a valid license. I looked at the code in IDA, and figured out the logic.</p>
<p>It is simply looking for a file called <code>LICENSE.000</code>, which contains an expiry date, username and systemname. If that all matches what the system reports, the check passes! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it, Lotus 1-2-3 has been ported to a new operating system. There are a few kinks that need to be ironed out, and I need to port over my terminal driver, but it is 100% usable. At the moment, the DOS version running under emulation looks better - but this can be fixed!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/no-internet-300x169.jpg" alt="no internet" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/no-internet-300x169.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/no-internet.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20169'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/no-internet-300x169.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/no-internet.jpg 800w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/no-internet-300x169.jpg">Last year, a Texas federal jury found Grande Communications liable for willful contributory copyright infringement and ordered the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/record-labels-wins-47-million-piracy-liability-verdict-against-isp-grande-221104/">ISP to pay $47 million in damages</a> to a group of record labels.</p>
<p>The ISP was held liable for infringing 1,403 copyrighted songs, as it failed to terminate persistent pirates‚Äô internet access.</p>
<p>District Court Judge David Ezra confirmed the judgment in January. This prompted the ISP <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/isp-grande-wants-judge-to-overrule-jurys-47-million-piracy-liability-verdict-230304/">to request</a> a do-over but that motion was ultimately declined. As a result, Grande took the matter to the appeals court.</p>
<h2>Grande Appeals</h2>
<p>Last month, Grande filed its opening brief in which it again argued that the lower court reached the wrong conclusion. Internet providers shouldn‚Äôt be held liable for pirating customers based on third-party allegations, the company argues. </p>
<p>‚ÄúThis appeal presents important questions of first impression in this Circuit about whether, and in what circumstances, an internet service provider may be held secondarily liable for the conduct of users of its service,‚Äù the ISP writes. </p>
<p>The ISP believes that it shouldn‚Äôt have to terminate Internet access this easily. This view is bolstered by a recent Supreme Court decision in favor of Twitter and other social media platforms, which held that they‚Äôre not liable for terrorist messages. </p>
<p>Grande is not alone in this appeal. The company is supported by several telecoms organizations, through a joint amicus curiae brief submitted by broadband association <a href="https://www.ustelecom.org/">USTelecom</a> and the <a href="https://www.ctia.org/">the CTIA</a>, which represents wireless providers.</p>
<h2>Terminating Internet Access a Basic Measure?</h2>
<p>According to Grande, the District Court went too far when it informed the jury that a provider can be found liable for contributory infringement if it didn‚Äôt take ‚Äúbasic measures‚Äù to terminate accounts of repeat infringers. According to Grande, this strong language lacks nuance.</p>
<p>The ISP notes that the ‚Äòbasic measures‚Äô theory first emerged more than two decades ago in the Napster lawsuit. In that case, however, Napster failed to remove pirated tracks from its servers, while ISPs only pass on bits and bytes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe ‚Äòsimple measures‚Äô or ‚Äòbasic measures‚Äô theory has its roots in the Labels‚Äô case against Napster. [‚Ä¶] Before filing suit, the Labels notified Napster of specific infringing files available on Napster‚Äôs service, but Napster declined to remove them.‚Äù</p>
<p>The common feature of these cases is that the ‚Äòsimple measures‚Äô standard has only been applied to defendants who directly control online content. That is because those defendants can readily remove or disable access to specific infringing content.</p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster.jpg" alt="napster" width="600" height="345" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster.jpg 1173w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster-300x173.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20345'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster.jpg 1173w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster-300x173.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/napster.jpg"></center>
<p>The amici support this argument while going into more detail on how Internet terminations can affect the public. They believe that Internet terminations should not be taken lightly. </p>
<h2>‚ÄòDrastic and Overbroad‚Äô</h2>
<p>USTelecom and CTIA point out that terminating Internet access can have a negative impact beyond the alleged wrongdoers. It could impact entire households, coffee shops, offices, schools, libraries, or hospitals. That doesn‚Äôt qualify as a ‚Äúbasic measure‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTermination thus prevents everyone ‚Äî in a household, coffee shop, office, school, library, or hospital ‚Äî who relies on a shared internet connection from using the internet for any purpose, whether remote work, accessing educational or health resources, seeking news or other information, or for entertainment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is instead a drastic and overbroad remedy, with severe consequences for non-infringers. Yet the district court‚Äôs approach could compel internet service providers to engage in wide-scale terminations to avoid facing crippling damages, like the $1 billion judgment entered against Cox Communications,‚Äù the amici add. </p>
<p>These terminations take place with no judicial oversight and run contrary to the initiatives of lawmakers, who freed up billions of dollars to invest in American broadband infrastructure.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt would also create massive disincentives for providers to invest in the new broadband networks that Congress recognizes are needed to close the digital divide,‚Äù the telecoms groups note. </p>
<h2>Supreme Court‚Äôs Terrorist Ruling</h2>
<p>Grande‚Äôs appeal also draws heavily on the aforementioned Twitter vs. Taamneh ruling, in which the U.S. Supreme Court recently held that the social media platforms aren‚Äôt liable for ISIS terrorists, who used their services to recruit and raise funds.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court rejected the claim that Twitter and others aided and abetted terrorist activity, because it didn‚Äôt ‚Äúconsciously and culpably‚Äù participate in the illegal activity. According to Grande, Internet providers are even further distanced from any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe pleaded allegations in Twitter are illuminating. There, the plaintiffs alleged that Twitter, Facebook, and Google allowed ISIS to upload videos and messages for public display, and that they actively delivered ISIS‚Äôs posts to other users based on those users‚Äô information and use history. </p>
<p>‚ÄúThe social media companies failed to remove known ISIS accounts, instead letting ISIS benefit from the companies‚Äô recommendation algorithms‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the social media companies didn‚Äôt engage in purposeful, culpable conduct. Instead, they simply offered their ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù to the parties. In addition, the Supreme Court suggested that ISPs are even further removed. </p>
<p>‚Äú[W]e generally do not think that internet or cell service providers incur culpability merely for providing their services to the public writ large,‚Äù the Supreme Court wrote. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-settles.jpg" alt="twitter" width="600" height="357" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-settles.jpg 1182w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-settles-300x178.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-settles-220x130.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20357'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-settles.jpg 1182w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-settles-300x178.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-settles-220x130.jpg 220w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-settles.jpg"></center>
<p>The telecoms groups bring up the same case and stress that the Supreme Court ruling suggests that it was an error by the court to hold Grande liable for pirating subscribers. As such, the appeal court should overturn it. </p>
<p>Needless to say, the music companies will have a different take on the matter. They also made this clear when <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/music-pirates-are-not-terrorists-record-labels-argue-in-court-230602/">Cox brought up the Twitter ruling</a> a few weeks ago and will likely do the same here. </p>

You also can‚Äôt really construct a study where you ask one cohort to not study for a couple decades to see if they do worse, because that has ethical concerns. So we‚Äôre left with self-reported flossing activity retrospectives.

My theory is that the gums can regenerate and regain attachment loss but only in the right conditions -&gt; in practice that would mean that they are not inflamed, and clean underneath the gum line (you can do that by flossing and getting a deep cleaning at a dentist if you need one), as well as doing your best to eliminate harmful bacteria that turn into calculus, and having a healthy diet.</p><p>The trickiest part is probably selectively eliminating the bad bacteria while retaining the good ones The mouth is full of both  and mouthwashes like Listarine, or any Alcohol based ones are sledgehammers. Some washes are too harsh on the tissue itself too which I imagine impairs healing of any kind.

  <p>This website is my answer to the question: ‚ÄúIf I were an English speaker trying to get an idea of how Italian poetry sounds, what tool would I like to have?‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, I would like first of all to hear the poems recited out loud. Then I‚Äôd like an easy way to go back and forth between English and Italian without opening a dictionary. Also useful: some context on the choice of vocabulary, and maybe a guide to the most salient technical aspects of the Italian language.<br>
Please check the <a href="https://italianpoetry.it/guide/">guide</a> to see how all this is implemented.</p>
<p>There will be no literary criticism, for the most part, nor structured lessons in the history of Italian Literature besides some nuggets now and then. One can certainly find several resources that are better than whatever I could possibly write.</p>
<p>You may profit from <a href="https://italianpoetry.it/italian/">some information about the Italian
language</a>. In any case, feel free to read up on <a href="https://italianpoetry.it/about/">the rationale
and disclaimer</a>.</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 08:55:12 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/10/cloudflare-sippy-migrate-s3/">https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/10/cloudflare-sippy-migrate-s3/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37888135">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Cloudflare recently announced the<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sippy-incremental-migration-s3-r2/"> open beta of Sippy</a>, an incremental data migration service that copies data from Amazon S3 to Cloudflare R2 only the first time the data is requested. Sippy is designed to minimize migration-specific egress fees by leveraging requests within existing application flows while simultaneously copying objects to R2.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Cloudflare announced <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/11/cloudflare-r2-super-slurper/">Super Slurper</a>, a data migration tool to copy large amounts of data from other object storage providers to Cloudflare R2. The new option targets scenarios where developers want to move only accessed data. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillipdjones/">Phillip Jones</a>, senior product manager at Cloudflare, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlad-krasnov-2a00a666/">Vlad Krasnov</a>, principal system engineer at Cloudflare, explain the benefits of Sippy over the existing Super Slurper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Super Slurper is perfect for cases where you want to move all of your data to R2 at once, there are scenarios where you may want to migrate your data incrementally over time. Maybe you want to avoid the one-time upfront AWS data transfer bill? Or perhaps you have legacy data that may never be accessed, and you only want to migrate what‚Äôs required?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new option acts as a middle layer between the client and the source object storage: when an object is requested from Workers, S3 API, or a public bucket, it is served from <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2">Cloudflare R2</a> if it is found. If not, the object will be returned from the source S3 bucket and copied simultaneously to R2. All other operations on R2, including put and delete, continue to work. Jones and Krasnov add:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of addressing vendor lock-in, Sippy makes stressful, time-consuming migrations a thing of the past. All you need to do is replace the S3 endpoint in your application or attach your domain to your new R2 bucket and data will start getting copied over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-migration/sippy/">documentation</a> shows how to enable Sippy for an existing R2 bucket with <em>cURL</em>:</p>

<pre><code>curl -X PUT https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/r2/buckets/{bucket_name}/sippy \
--header "Authorization: Bearer &lt;API_TOKEN&gt;" \
--data '{"provider": "AWS", "bucket": "&lt;AWS_BUCKET_NAME&gt;", "zone": "&lt;AWS_REGION&gt;","key_id": "&lt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&gt;", "access_key":"&lt;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&gt;", "r2_key_id": "&lt;R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID&gt;", "r2_access_key": "&lt;R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&gt;"}'</code></pre>

<p>Cloudflare plans on making incremental migration configurable from the dashboard and providing analytics showing the progress of the migration and how much has been saved on egress fees for objects that have been copied over.</p>

<p>Sippy is currently in open beta and supports only Amazon S3 as a migration source. During the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/birthday-week-2023-wrap-up/">Birthday Week</a>, the connectivity company made other announcements that target migrations from what Cloudflare calls "legacy cloud providers": <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/amazon-2bn-ipv4-tax-how-avoid-paying/">how to avoid paying Amazon‚Äôs IPv4 tax</a>, the general availability of <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/10/cloudflare-turnstile-ga-free/">Turnstile</a>, a reCAPTCHA alternative, and <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/10/cloudflare-hyperdrive-postgres/">Hyperdrive</a>, a service that accelerates SQL queries reducing the load and cost on cloud-managed databases.<br>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/14/nvidia-skips-return-to-office-sticks-to-remote-work-among-hottest-tech-companies/">https://fortune.com/2023/10/14/nvidia-skips-return-to-office-sticks-to-remote-work-among-hottest-tech-companies/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37887570">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Few if any companies have been hotter this year than <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="">Nvidia</a>. Amid the boom in artificial intelligence, its high-powered chips are clamored over by the likes of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Amazon</a>, Meta, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" rel="">Google</a>.</p><div>



<p>Yet while those companies and many others have issued return-to-office mandates, Nvidia, which has about 26,000 employees worldwide and a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-stock-market-cap-trillion-dollars/" target="_self" rel="">valuation of over $1 trillion</a>, is bucking the trend and putting no pressure on remote workers to commute to cubicles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2020, Huang said he had ‚Äúno trouble with‚Äù letting employees work out of the their home indefinitely. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question we‚Äôre going to do this,‚Äù he <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-the-metaverse-working-from-home-permanently-and-raises-for-workers/" target="_self" rel="">told</a> VentureBeat at the time.</p>



<p>Today the California-based company is sticking with the policy while also offering employees luxurious office spaces (see below) in which to gather and collaborate. Nvidia leaves it up to workers whether they work at home, in a cafe, or in the office. It views the arrangement ‚Äúas a way for employees to balance their personal and work obligations, while preparing for the future, so they can focus on doing their life‚Äôs work,‚Äù Beau Davidson, vice president of employee experience, <a href="https://commercialobserver.com/2023/10/nvidia-ai-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">told</a> <em>Commercial Observer.</em>&nbsp;</p>


<div><p><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=320&amp;q=75 320w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=480&amp;q=75 480w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=576&amp;q=75 576w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=768&amp;q=75 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=75 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=1280&amp;q=75 1280w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=75 1440w" src="https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=75" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption>Employees inside the Voyager building at Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California, US, on Monday, June 5, 2023. </figcaption><p>Marlena Sloss/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></div>



<p>In contrast, other companies have grown increasingly strident about employees working more in the office. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/" target="_self" rel="">warned employees</a> that ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably not going to work out for you‚Äù if they continued to ignore a return-to-office mandate. That followed an earlier <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/04/amazon-unfazed-remote-workers-protest-return-to-office-mandate/" target="_self" rel="">employee walkout</a> protesting the policy, where one worker leading the charge insisted, ‚ÄúWe can be productive, customer obsessed, we can do our good work, we can make a difference, and it does not have to be in an office building.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nvidia‚Äôs Huang would seem to agree with that sentiment. However employees prefer to mix their work settings, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm perfectly comfortable with all that,‚Äù he told VentureBeat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike other CEOs, however, he‚Äôs sticking with the policy. A few years ago, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg boasted, ‚ÄúWe are going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale, with a thoughtful and responsible plan for how to do this.‚Äù He estimated that about half of the company‚Äôs employees would be working remotely within the next five to 10 years. Fast-forward to today and his employees must be back in the office three days a week, with their presence tracked by card keys and other tools. Those failing to comply risk being fired or taking a hit on performance reviews.</p>



<p>Yet Meta workers returning to the office have reportedly struggled to book conference rooms or even find a desk that they can use for a full day. Adam Mosseri, head of Meta‚Äôs <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/" target="_blank" rel="">Instagram</a>, wrote on Threads, ‚ÄúWe have not yet figured out hybrid work.‚Äù Meanwhile Zuckerberg<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/30/meta-return-to-office-mess-remote-work-crackdown-hybrid-work/" target="_self" rel=""> touted cutting-edge metaverse</a> headsets, saying on the <em>Lex Fridman Podcast</em>, ‚ÄúI think this gets us a lot closer to being able to work physically in different places‚Ä¶I think we‚Äôre not there today with just video conferencing and the basic technologies that we have.‚Äù</p>



<p>Other firms are resorting to preferential treatment to get employees back in the office. Of more than 400 U.S. CEOs surveyed by <a href="https://fortune.com/company/kpmg/" target="_blank" rel="">KPMG</a>, 90% said they <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/06/ceos-return-office-bribe-raises-promotions/" target="_self" rel="">would reward those</a> who work in person with favorable assignments, raises, and promotions.</p>



<p>But Rob Sadow, CEO of Scoop Technologies, maker of a hybrid-office productivity app, believes many company leaders are clinging to the past. ‚ÄúSometimes that desire to return to office comes more out of fear and desire to repeat past experience than it is around optimizing for what the future is going to look like,‚Äù he told the <em>Observer</em>.</p>



<p>Another company bucking the return-to-office trend <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/12/atlassian-rto-hybrid-work-real-estate-office/" target="_self" rel="">is the software giant Atlassian</a>, which makes collaboration tools such as Jira.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe expect people to be able to work from home, from a caf√©, from an office, but we don‚Äôt really care where they do their work‚Äîwhat we care about is the output that they produce,‚Äù co-CEO Scott Farquhar <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/atlassian-ceo-scott-farquhar-office-once-a-quarter-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">told</a> Australia‚Äôs <em>60 Minutes</em> program in August, adding, ‚ÄúI might come into the office about once a quarter.‚Äù</p>



<p>The company still has ambitious plans for new offices, including in Seattle and Sydney, where it‚Äôs broken ground on a 40-story <a href="https://www.shoparc.com/projects/atlassian-hq/" target="_self" rel="">headquarters</a> featuring lush interiors and spaces designed with employee gatherings in mind. It now evaluates its real estate strategy not by card swipes, but with metrics such as cost per visit and the degree to which employees utilize an office and engage within it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Nvidia‚Äôs latest headquarters addition, an airy, jaw-dropping 750,000-square-foot structure dubbed <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/nvidias-massive-techno-palace-may-have-you-questioning-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">Voyager</a> (see above), rejects boxy structures, emphasizing instead communal spaces and views for everyone.</p>



<p>Sadow believes that by letting workers choose between working remotely or collaborating in cutting-edge office space, Nvidia gains a ‚Äúpretty meaningful talent advantage.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed that advantage could help it attract employees alienated by harsh return-to-office mandates elsewhere. In a recent survey by <a href="https://fortune.com/company/deloitte/" target="_blank" rel="">Deloitte</a> and Workplace Intelligence, two-third of executives said they‚Äôd likely quit if forced back to the office five days a week. The report warned that companies forcing employees back to cubicles ‚Äúrun the risk of losing their pipeline of leaders and have difficulty recruiting fresh talent.‚Äù</p>



<p>That‚Äôs one risk Nvidia, it would appear, doesn‚Äôt need to worry about too much.</p></div><p><em>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the biggest headlines in business. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=ceo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</em></p></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-test="article-body-text">
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    <p>Google has plunged the internet into a ‚Äúspiral of decline‚Äù, the co-founder of the company‚Äôs artificial intelligence (AI) lab has claimed.</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/06/deepminds-founder-leaves-britains-brightest-ai-lab-really-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mustafa Suleyman</a>, the British entrepreneur who co-founded DeepMind, said: ‚ÄúThe business model that Google had broke the internet.‚Äù</p><p>He said search results had become plagued with ‚Äúclickbait‚Äù to keep people ‚Äúaddicted and absorbed on the page as long as possible‚Äù.</p><p>Information online is ‚Äúburied at the bottom of a lot of verbiage and guff‚Äù, Mr Suleyman argued, so websites can ‚Äúsell more adverts‚Äù, fuelled by Google‚Äôs technology.</p><p>Mr Suleyman was one of three people who set up pioneering AI lab DeepMind in London 2010. The company was bought by Google for ¬£400m and it has become the cornerstone of the search giant‚Äôs AI operations.</p><p>Mr Suleyman, 39, quit Google 18 months ago and has since set up a rival venture, Inflection AI. The company is developing a conversational chatbot, similar to ChatGPT, amid a race by AI companies to usurp Google‚Äôs dominance of the web.</p><p>The entrepreneur has developed a chatbot called Pi, which he says can act as a kind of AI confidante or coach. He has raised more than $1.5bn for the new technology.</p><p>The criticism of his former employer came as Mr Suleyman told the Telegraph about plans for a new international body to monitor AI threats.</p><p>Mr Suleyman, along with billionaire former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, plan to present proposals for an International Panel on AI Safety at Prime Minister <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/23/artificial-intelligence-safety-summit-sunak-ai-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rishi Sunak‚Äôs global summit</a> on the technology next month.&nbsp;</p><p>The DeepMind co-founder said the panel could be ‚Äúmodelled on the IPCC‚Äù ‚Äì the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ‚Äì to ‚Äúestablish the scientific consensus around the current capabilities‚Äù of AI.</p><p>Mr Suleyman said the IPCC, which was first set up in 1988, was a ‚Äúgood inspiration‚Äù for establishing a ‚Äúrigorous body‚Äù for making predictions about AI risks. Other backers of the plan include Reid Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn founder, and Florentino Cu√©llar, president of the Carnegie think tank.</p><p>The AI panel would provide governments with regular assessments on the level of danger posed by the technology.</p><p>The UK‚Äôs AI Safety Summit is due to take place at Bletchley Park and is expected to gather world leaders and tech entrepreneurs to address the challenges of ‚Äúfrontier AI‚Äù that might cause ‚Äúsignificant harm, including the loss of life‚Äù.</p><p>The two-day summit on Nov 1 and 2 is expected to be attended by top lobbyists from the likes of Meta and Google. Kamala Harris, the US vice president, is expected to attend, while a Chinese delegation has been invited.&nbsp;</p><p>The leaders will try to find common ground on tackling AI risks. Officials are also understood to be considering setting up an international institute for AI safety.</p>

    <p>Michelle Donelan, the technology secretary, told the Telegraph the&nbsp;conference would ‚Äúconsider the biggest risks and biggest opportunities that come from frontier AI‚Äù, bringing together ‚Äúcompanies, countries and also experts‚Äù.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/23/chatgpt-sam-altman-ai-regulation-risk-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concern about the technology</a> has been sparked by the overnight success of ChatGPT, which was seen as a wake-up call for world leaders about the speed at which the technology was being developed.&nbsp;</p><p>A new wave of chatbots, built on so-called ‚Äúlarge language models‚Äù, can answer questions and have online conversations in an almost uncannily human way. They can write emails, essays, poetry or music, prompting concerns they could create upheaval in the jobs market.</p><p>Writing in his recent book, The Coming Wave, Mr Suleyman called for a ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù of high-risk AI advances, so governments can get ahead of developments that may threaten jobs, elections and human life.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Suleyman said chatbots could ‚Äútake on Google‚Äù by providing more accurate information than internet search.</p><p>However, despite recent advances, many chatbots suffer from errors and in some cases may make up false information, creating a hurdle to taking on search engines.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/02/13/google-microsofts-ai-bots-will-pollute-internet-digital-effluence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google is also developing</a> a rival AI chatbot project, called Bard.&nbsp;</p><p>Google was approached for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile on Saturday, the Government confirmed 100 winners of ¬£5m in grant funding for AI start-ups, including a business tackling clothing waste and a company finding a use for the technology in vineyards.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Donelan also announced a further ¬£32m in grant funding for high-growth businesses using AI, to be confirmed after the UK summit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">

                                                                                                
                
<p><span><span>I</span> have a dirty secret. When some of our friends at church nod in approval upon hearing that we haven‚Äôt got a proper television, I am happy to let them think that this is largely because we want to protect our children from all the woke nonsense in cartoons. We go to one of those scary parishes where the old Latin Mass is said twice on Sundays, and I must say the sexual proclivities of </span><i><span>Dora the Explorer </span></i><span>are a major topic of concern.</span></p>
<p><span>Our friends have a point. There is a lot of this stuff going around, and you have to wonder whether even the most progressive parents really believe their kids need to learn whether in addition to being blue and wearing a diaper, Gonzo in </span><i><span>Muppet Babies</span></i><span> is gender-queer. (Do Muppets in fact have sex? Inquiring minds don‚Äôt in fact want to know.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But in our case the objections are aesthetic as much as anything else. I have always admired the artistry of traditional hand-drawn animation, and the CGI you see on TV (usually farmed out to digital sweatshops in Asia) is even uglier than the top-shelf Disney/Pixar version. The color palette is unimaginably garish, a lot of neon fuschias, turquoises, and oranges, plus a distinct shade of cyan that looks like radioactive Mountain Dew. (Thank goodness the backgrounds are always empty.)</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>In a typical episode the Paw Patrol send an entire fleet of vehicles to an attempted misdemeanor</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Then there is the sheer inanity of the dialogue, characters, and situations. When I was a child, Doug Funny was subjected to various ethical dilemmas, and even the Ninja Turtles of blessed memory had quarrels and existential crises ‚Äî I recall Michaelangelo once seeking hypnotherapy for his pizza addiction ‚Äî in between fighting some genuinely frightening baddies. These days we have </span><i><span>Super Truck</span></i><span>. Have you heard of </span><i><span>Super Truck</span></i><span>? It‚Äôs a quite popular show about a truck. Our three-year-old, quite perceptively, calls it ‚ÄúStupid Truck.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Despite my best efforts, the kids have managed to see a lot of these shows, mostly at grandparents‚Äô houses. The worst one, worse than </span><i><span>Daniel Tiger</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>PJ Masks</span></i><span> or even </span><i><span>My Little Pony</span></i><span> (which is the subject of a pedophile cult in these United States) is </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>. This program centers around a group of talking dogs who work for various emergency services: Chase is the cop, Marshall the fireman (or rather firepup), Skye the helicopter pilot, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, emergency services seem to be the only thing going on in this horrifying world. Every episode revolves around some poor citizen finding himself on the wrong side of the law or the victim of an alleged natural disaster or public health crisis. In a typical episode, the Paw Patrol send an entire fleet of vehicles ‚Äî cars, trucks, boats, aeroplanes, submarines, and even, insanely, a recycling van ‚Äî to respond to an attempted misdemeanor or a minor traffic accident.</span></p>
<p><span>All of this activity is carried out under the aegis of one Mayor Goodway. She is very much a ruler in the Nero fiddling or Elagabalus line, a deranged eccentric who collects chickens (curiously enough, they cannot speak in this universe otherwise full of anthropomorphic animals) and seems totally uninterested in the actual well-being of her subjects, much less the material and other costs of maintaining a rather large police force. (I say ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù because as far as I can tell, there is no evidence of elections ever being carried out.)</span></p>
<p><i><span>Paw Patrol </span></i><span>is Giorgio Agamben‚Äôs nightmare, a country in which a permanent state of emergency exists, under which governments have limitless power to rule unilaterally. There is no society or even commerce in </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>, only the relentless unthinking force of the police state, ostensibly responding to a never-ending crisis. It is the most influential work of fascist art since Ezra Pound.</span></p>
<p><span>Worse still than the omnidirectional sense of faux-crisis is the depiction of the offenders on the receiving end of the Paw Patrol‚Äôs mob justice. The Ruff-Ruff Pack, collar-less and dirty, are clearly working class dogs; no attempt is ever made to reform or otherwise induce them to behave better. It‚Äôs as if they exist to be brutalised. (One thinks of those lines of Auden: ‚ÄúSomebody chose their pain, / What needn‚Äôt have happened did.‚Äù)</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>I like to imagine that somewhere in Adventure Bay there is some sort of resistance movement</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>But perhaps the oddest thing of all is the fact that apart from the pups, the dictator Goodway, and the handful of people whom they routinely assault, the island seems somewhat sparsely populated. I like to imagine that somewhere in Adventure Bay there is some sort of resistance movement, a faction of poets and religious types opposed to the mayor‚Äôs tyrannical regime. Which is when it occurs to me: </span><i><span>they‚Äôre all freaking dead, aren‚Äôt they? Or maybe we are talking about a gulag situation. Where else is all the production happening? There are no visible factories, but someone has to build all the machines and tools and perform the necessary agricultural work to keep the mayor‚Äôs chickens fed.</span></i></p>
<p><span>All of this no doubt is taking a bunch of magenta pixels too seriously. Maybe. I can‚Äôt help but think that in addition to their deleterious effect on children‚Äôs imaginations, shows like </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span> are a serious political threat. I hate to go all Frankfurt School in a light column like this one, but it is always worrying when citizens of a democratic society are taught to worship the police, to accept so-called ‚Äústates of exception‚Äù without question, and to delight in the machinery of punishment. This is the reason that, growing up in the 1990s, I always hated</span><i><span> Cops</span></i><span>, my love of moustaches and aviator sunglasses notwithstanding. Somehow I always wanted the guy in the wife beater shirt (invariably removed during the course of the episode for reasons that were always mysterious) with the 40 ounce bottle of malt liquor and the cigarette to get away. Like the supposed villains in </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>, he never did.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Meta-Note: I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs been so long between articles; for better or worse writing here is something that I do for fun, and sometimes work and family get in the way. In this case, I was spending a lot of time trying to learn SQL; you will be pleased to note I am now able to pad my resume with ‚ÄúIntermediate Database Language Skills‚Äù with the best of them.</strong></p><p>A few years back, my wife was at a baby shower hosted by a friend by a mutual acquaintance. In a conversation with the hostess, my wife learned they were in a tough financial position - they were always broke, and no amount of budgeting seemed to help them get ahead; they had cut every cost they could and things were just getting worse and worse. She admitted to my wife that she just felt like she was sinking further and further underwater, and didn‚Äôt see any way out for her or her family.</p><p>Note: The hostess and her husband were both doctors. They had a combined income somewhere upwards of $200,000 a year, and as the conversation developed my wife learned that their problems started and stopped with the hostess not being able to save quite as much as she‚Äôd like once the payments on their very nice house and current-year cars were made. At the time she leaned on my wife for emotional support over finances, our family of four‚Äôs income was less than $30,000 a year.</p><p>You should know the hostess wasn‚Äôt mean-spirited in the least, and we liked her then and continue to do so. But she did have a kind of tunnel vision I‚Äôve since noticed is increasingly common: If you came from a family that did pretty well financially, went to college and then immediately started to do pretty well yourself, it‚Äôs hard to get any kind of context for what life is like at lower income levels. This isn‚Äôt a matter of the relatively-wealthy being dumb or insensitive; it‚Äôs just legitimately difficult to get a handle on what it‚Äôs like in a life you‚Äôve never lived, and often being legitimately confused as to why anyone would opt to make less money instead of improving their lot with training and education.</p><p>In that spirit, I‚Äôd like to offer my services as a sort of has-been-poor guide, to fill you in on what it‚Äôs like on the other side of the tracks. In this role, I‚Äôm qualified in two ways. The first is common - we‚Äôve never done exceptionally well financially. Things have been better in recent years as I‚Äôve finally clawed towards the upper-end of lower-class, but Covid has reminded us how short-lived that kind of qualified success can be. We‚Äôve had to economize in dozens of interesting ways, make hard choices here and there and sometimes/often do entirely without. It hasn‚Äôt been easy.</p><p><span>At the same time, I‚Äôm mostly </span><em>happy.</em><span> I have a wonderful wife who is very satisfying to be near, two kids who are about as custom-fit to my personality as possible, and dozens of friends online and off who would take a bullet for me, and vice versa. This is important because I want you to know I‚Äôm not trying to make you feel bad - I know and understand that everyone has a different set of problems, and that I‚Äôm not unique in living in an imperfect world. I‚Äôm not trying to exaggerate problems for political points or to try to get legislation passed. Take no guilt from this article - It‚Äôs informational, not a call to arms.</span></p><p>One of the bigger disconnects I run into in talking to people at or above living wage levels of income is that it‚Äôs usually assumed that the quality of things has a pretty linear association to the price. This is true at most price points, from ‚Äúdoing OK‚Äù all the way up to ‚ÄúJeff Bezos‚Äù - if you pay a little more, you get a little more. If you pay a little less, you get a little less.</p><p><span>Because this relationship is what you‚Äôd expect, you get a lot of reasonable-sounding advice that, while not exactly wrong, fails to capture the nuance of poor-people-price-mechanics very well. According to this randomly selected article, </span><a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/how-much-should-i-spend-on-rent#:~:text=While%20everyone's%20circumstances%20are%20unique,30%25%20of%20your%20household%20income." rel="">I should really make sure not to spend more than 30% of my income on rent</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>While everyone‚Äôs circumstances are unique, many experts&nbsp;say it‚Äôs best to spend no more than 30% of your monthly gross income on housing-related expenses, including rent and utilities. Under that rule, it‚Äôs best to make sure that the amount you spend on rent is well below 30% of your household income. In other words, if you‚Äôre making $3,000 a month, it‚Äôs a good idea to pay no&nbsp;more than $900 for rent and other housing costs.  </p></blockquote><p>The general thinking here is that if I spend more than 30%, I‚Äôm making myself vulnerable in all other aspects of my budget; why burden yourself with more than you can handle, when I could take a slightly worse place and be that much closer to financial health? From the perspective of the 50k a year and up crowd, this makes sense - $1250, after all, will rent a reasonable house or apartment in a lot of markets.

And while the first apartment I showed you was in a relatively nice, livable part of town this one is in a more gun-fire prone area ominously referred to by locals as ‚Äúthe triangle‚Äù. Phoenix‚Äôs mostly gravel-and-concrete landscaping style cleans up nice (note the still-wet recently hosed concrete), but make no mistake: this isn‚Äôt the kind of apartment complex where hypodermic needles are exclusively owned by diabetics.</p><p>That‚Äôs the drop-off you experience at the lower price levels - there‚Äôs nothing between ‚ÄúThis is a tiny but acceptable apartment‚Äù and ‚ÄúSlum apartments in stab-ville‚Äù. </p><p>None of this is to discount the budget advice above completely - this is absolutely the kind of apartment I should be living in right now, if I was making perfect budgetary decisions. But consider that this is a choice I have to make - do I spend 50% more on an apartment and stress my budget to death, or make my wife and kids in a place where I have 5 front doors within 15 feet of ours in the murder-iest part of town? Neither choice is great, but the lack of intermediate choices forces you to do one or the other. </p><p>Whichever you choose, a person of less-than-intermediate income has to be prepared to stick with the rental long-term, should things not go well. This is because apartments at both of these levels quite accurately assume that you can‚Äôt afford a lawyer - while it‚Äôs normal to put down a month or two worth of rent as a security deposit, it‚Äôs much less normal to get it back; the apartment complex has no reason to give back thousands of dollars they can simply keep. This means every time you move, you pay something like a third to a month‚Äôs wages for the privilege. Since breaking a lease often means you lose your privilege to live anywhere non-hellish, this means if you don‚Äôt have cash reserves (more on these later*) at the exact right time of year, you might end up in the same place for another full year whether you like it or not.</p><p><strong>Note: It‚Äôs been pointed out to me that I completely forgot to talk about cash reserves and how they effect this kind of thing. It‚Äôs also been pointed out that these numbers only ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù in particular markets - i.e. it‚Äôs cheaper or more expensive to live other places, so the exact figures here don‚Äôt translate well for everyone. I‚Äôll write a follow up post incorporating some of this kind of feedback soon to make up for it.</strong></p><p><span>I am always consistently shocked by how little people living at a decent-to-great income level fear their cars; it seems like they hardly lie awake at night thinking about their iffy alternator much, if at all. Scott Alexander does a pretty good job of explaining the obverse experience </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/" rel="">here</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>When I first started working with poor patients, I was shocked how many of the problems in their lives were car-related. For well-off people like me, having a car is background noise; you buy or lease it for a reasonable price, then never worry about it again. Poor people can‚Äôt afford to buy and don‚Äôt always have good enough credit to lease. They tend to get older, sketchier cars that constantly break down. A constant complaint I heard: ‚ÄúMy car broke, I can‚Äôt afford repairs, and I‚Äôm going to get fired if I can‚Äôt make it to my job‚Äù. Some of them can‚Äôt afford insurance and take their chances without it. Others have had various incidents with the police that cost them their license, but they can‚Äôt just not show up to work, so they drive anyway and hope they don‚Äôt get arrested.  </p></blockquote><p>This is actually pretty close to the experience. It‚Äôs telling that Scott thinks the problem with a lease comes only from credit issues - a pretty bottom-barrel ford leases for 300-400 a month. For a person who makes 30,000-40000k a year, that‚Äôs something like 10-15% of their income, before we talk about insurance; couple that with the fact that you can‚Äôt squeak by on liability-only insurance in most leases, and we are already into a prohibitively expensive range.</p><p>But there‚Äôs other things - liability insurance, as mentioned above, is often your only option that makes sense - if your car costs $2000, paying an extra $50-100 per month for high-deductible doesn‚Äôt add up; you are still $1000 out of pocket to cover the deductible in the event you need to use it. But since you can‚Äôt afford it in the first place, you don‚Äôt think about that; you just start driving insanely carefully at all times and pray any accidents you get in aren‚Äôt your fault. One slip-up and you either can‚Äôt get to work at all, or you spend a lot more time doing it. Remember: Uber isn‚Äôt an option here; the ~$400 a month it would cost would bankrupt you.</p><p>You are also more or less forced to learn to do mechanic work. I‚Äôm an administrator by trade - I usually work in the kind of jobs that have ‚Äúassistant‚Äù appended to them. One of my greatest prides is typing speed, and when people ask me my hobby I tell them ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù. If you were judging me by my interests and natural skillset, you wouldn‚Äôt expect me to be able to change my own tires. But over the years necessity has forced me to get pretty decent at car work - I‚Äôve done clutch rebuilds and head gasket jobs and a bunch of other miserable (for me) work that I would have rather avoided. But this was often the only option I had - it was either figuring out how to replace an alternator or do a full brake job over the weekend or lose my ability to get to the grocery store in under an hour. Keep in mind the money saved here is just the labor - parts still have a cost that‚Äôs unavoidable. </p><p>The practical upshot of this is whenever I drive, it‚Äôs very slowly, very carefully, and listening in terror to any small noise the car makes. It‚Äôs a constant stress, and it‚Äôs limiting; we don‚Äôt go on long road trips often, and when we do my joke with my wife is usually something like ‚ÄúWell, if the car breaks down somewhere else, we‚Äôll just start living there‚Äù.</p><p>It‚Äôs reasonable to ask ‚ÄúIf cars are so terrible, why not use public transport?‚Äù. I live in a city, and this is in fact an option that would solve many of my problems: I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about repairs, my gasoline and insurance bills would disappear and anything that happened to the bus is the city‚Äôs problem, not mine. Especially in an emergency public transit would be a godsend and might be the difference between keeping and losing my job.</p><p>But there‚Äôs other things to consider on this, as well. My commute isn‚Äôt short, and isn‚Äôt bus-friendly; it would go from about 30 minutes each way to just under 4 hours roundtrip. And when your commute starts and ends in a bad area, which is typical of a low-income family in a low-paying job, this means those four hours a day are spent surrounded by people who range from normal commuters at best to visibly mentally imbalanced and trying to speak to you the whole ride. I understand from talking to friends in ‚Äúour mass transit is great!‚Äù towns that this isn‚Äôt the case everywhere but this is something that on average gets worse the poorer you get. I could make the commute shorter by taking a worse job (Maybe - the job market isn‚Äôt great right now), but that comes with career-limiting downsides of it‚Äôs own.</p><p>When I‚Äôm trying to explain to my sons how a company decides what to pay someone, it usually goes something like this: A company is looking to pay a person as little as they can and keep them, so a person‚Äôs pay is determined by how rare their skills are and how much demand there is for those skills. The value of their work doesn‚Äôt factor in as much - An administrative assistant might touch every department in the company every day and facilitate a massive amount of work, but they still don‚Äôt get paid much - it‚Äôs hard to justify when you could hire and train up someone to do the same thing nearly as well with very little difficulty.</p><p>I think this is a fairly accurate way to look at pay, but it applies to other aspects of the job. If you got sick more often than usual this year and used up your legally mandated sick days, would your company fire you for getting sick again, or demand you work sick? If the company decides it needs to cut wages, is your position the cheap-to-hire-for job the company didn‚Äôt spend a lot of money and time filling? If you don‚Äôt have rare skills, management is aware that they can ask for you to work extra hours, avoid letting you use paid time off and change your list of job duties on a whim - both they and you know that if you won‚Äôt do it, they can find somebody who will tomorrow. Not every company is bad in these ways - good people do exist - but every company is aware they could, and that tends to color every aspect of the job whether they intend it to or not. </p><p>The worst treatment you tend to get is, perhaps counterintuitively, in jobs that approach living wage despite your low value and replaceability as a worker. These jobs tend towards needing someone who can put in a lot of hours for customer interactions that require a single point of contact; they reward intense focus over long periods of time in unpleasant situations. Another way to say this is that these are high-stress jobs with a lot of mandatory overtime and very fast pacing - they pay a lot because they can‚Äôt get people to do them otherwise. Turnover in these jobs is absurd despite the pay - some people can keep up with them but it isn‚Äôt typical. In my first (and hopefully last) claims adjuster job, two people had heart attacks in my office in a six month period.</p><p>The obvious solution for the worker here would seem to be to train themselves in such a way as to be more valuable, but this is often a bit harder or less plausible than it sounds. Some of this can be personal reasons (if you are barely holding things together, it‚Äôs hard to find the time and energy to get a bachelors degree from scratch) or financial (It‚Äôs nice to think you could learn a new skill and start a new career, but if you are barely keeping your family fed as it is, you might not actually be able to take the pay cut dropping back to entry level would require. </p><p>To give you an example of how this looks, 2020 started with me in my second month at a sustainable job with a salary around 50k, the most I had ever made. When the job was disrupted by Covid, I was the first to go - I had little tenure and no rare specialty absolutely required by the company, so my responsibilities could at least theoretically be divided among the retained employees. I then took one of those high-stress high-intensity jobs in the mortgage industry, made kind of a lot of money (for me, on pace to do about 60k in a year) but eventually had a minor nervous breakdown; the company informed me I couldn‚Äôt use my paid time off without a month‚Äôs notice to handle it, and that they‚Äôd simply let my workload pile up while I was gone, leaving me in a worse place. I managed to switch to another company, but found out once I started that the job duties, pay, and hours were all misrepresented in the interview process - I‚Äôm free to leave if I don‚Äôt like it, since the job will be easy to fill. </p><p>In the meantime, I‚Äôve added a few skills to my resume associated with better jobs and lifestyles, and I‚Äôm hopeful things get better. But ‚Äújust the skill without an associated degree‚Äù means this is a slog - I‚Äôve applied for about 100 jobs in the past month, but haven‚Äôt had a single response; there‚Äôs simply better qualified candidates at the kind of pay I can support my family with, and the kind of extremely junior positions I might have a better shot at would leave us unable to pay bills within a few months. </p><p>This isn‚Äôt evil on anyone‚Äôs part, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about it - I‚Äôve made a lot of choices in my life that led to this point and I have a lot of responsibility in terms of where I find myself. But understand that even if you are willing to sacrifice the labor and time it takes to work towards an uncertain goal, there‚Äôs still a fair amount of luck involved. And some people are at my level or below it because they simply lack the capability to do better - not everyone can or should learn to code, or would be able to successfully go back to school. </p><p>The summary here is that low-paying jobs are often uniquely bad for reasons beyond the pay itself. The people who work them aren‚Äôt unwilling to change this, but often they are unable to, either because the means to change their circumstance is outside of their control or because their attempts to do so fail. Some are lazy and unmotivated, but not all.</p><p><span>When someone is telling me they are or have been poor and I‚Äôm trying to determine </span><em>how poor exactly</em><span> they were, there‚Äôs one evergreen question I ask that has never failed to give me a good idea of what kind of situation I‚Äôm dealing with. That question is: ‚ÄúHow many times have they turned off your water?‚Äù.</span></p><p>The reason this question works is because it lets me know whether the person I‚Äôm talking to has ‚Äúfelt‚Äù broke - I.E. been in a situation where they felt resource strapped for some reason or another - or has ‚Äúbeen broke‚Äù, actually factually unable to pay for basic services they needed to survive at a minimally decent human level. </p><p>A person who feels broke might not have a lot of money, or might not have any liquid dollars in their wallet at all. But just being out of money doesn‚Äôt make you broke in the sense that they turn off your water - that takes time. Usually you can be over a month late before the water company actually goes to the trouble of sending someone out to turn off your water. Even if someone feels broke and can‚Äôt immediately pay their bills (this is rare for people who feel broke, by the way; they usually have a few hundred dollars they can get at somewhere, some space on a credit card, etc.) this only means they need to cut their spending somewhat the next month and catch up; they might not be King Midas after watching their budget for 30 days, but they won‚Äôt turn the tap some morning and finds nothing comes out.</p><p>Obviously being broke is the opposite; you are legitimately out of funds you need to cover a bill. It‚Äôs not a matter of watching your budget closer, either - you‚Äôve cut the fat from every possible place and you still just don‚Äôt have enough to make everything work. Sometimes this is because you lost a job and your income dried up (more common these Covid days) and sometimes it‚Äôs because a surprise bill caused your budget to get behind in a way you couldn‚Äôt recover from. But as opposed to someone who simply overspent, being broke implies you have some structural problem with your income and finances that you can‚Äôt fix - all it took was a small bump of some kind to upset your apple cart, and now you‚Äôve moved from ‚Äúhanging on‚Äù to ‚Äúasking your neighbor to use their hose to fill up a bucket so you can flush your toilet‚Äù.</p><p>It also implies there‚Äôs no place left to cut - you don‚Äôt have a car payment, and your insurance is minimal if it hasn‚Äôt lapsed already. You don‚Äôt have cable. You are eating a lot of rice. There‚Äôs simply nothing ‚Äúextra‚Äù left to cut, and now you are choosing between things like power and internet (which you need to work and find work, these days) and water (which you need to survive).  Often you‚Äôve already even prioritized those things, because as I‚Äôve said they don‚Äôt turn off your water for a while; you‚Äôve been juggling things like power and water, now with late fees, for a while. And one day your wife calls you and tells you the water is off, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do; maybe some family member can help you out, or maybe you live without utilities for a week or so until you get paid and start the next pay cycle that much more behind. </p><p>The best case scenario is you get helped, and you try to accept that graciously and thankfully, but consider the shame of this - you can‚Äôt support your family, and you‚Äôve been forced to go to someone who can, implicitly admit you can‚Äôt fulfil your basic purpose as a human, and ask them to take away from their family to do what you can‚Äôt. And often they do - family and friends are a wonderful thing. I‚Äôm thankful more than I can say for mine; I‚Äôm blessed by them. But it‚Äôs exhausting; you understand going through it why so many people give up on trying to make things better, because you‚Äôve already reached this point where you and everyone around you understands that you just can‚Äôt function to minimum levels as a father and husband; it‚Äôs hard to wake up the next day and go ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs all in the past - let‚Äôs learn Java!‚Äù.</p><p>If you are broke enough, you get what in some ways is very good health insurance: zero deductible, all prescriptions paid for, and no coverage limits. The reason you get this is because everyone else in the country pays for it for you - it‚Äôs government insurance, given to those at income levels so low it‚Äôs clear they have no chance at all of covering their own bills. It‚Äôs not without downsides (the doctors suck, for the most part, and referrals for anything beyond basic family care are time-consuming to get) but you  know that if your children or wife got seriously hurt or sick, there would be some level of care available that wouldn‚Äôt instantly bankrupt you.</p><p>There‚Äôs a point at which you are making too much money to get government insurance, though. As of today this number is &nbsp;$36,156, or ~138% of the federal poverty limit. This creates an interesting situation - if you were making 35k at a job and offered a job at 40k with healthcare benefits, taking the job would actually leave you in a worse place than before in most cases; insurance is expensive, and the government offers exactly zero help if you A. make more than a certain amount of money and B. work for a place with benefits. So where you had insurance and made 35k before, now you have insurance and make 32k; your step forward put you further in the hole.</p><p>This is what‚Äôs usually referred to as a perverse incentive - it‚Äôs a situation that ‚Äúpays‚Äù you for doing the wrong thing. In this case, the wrong thing is rejecting jobs that pay more and offer more advancement out of fear that someone will get sick and you either won‚Äôt be able to get them care or will bankrupt yourself doing so. If you are smart, you probably take this risk - after all, you might eventually make 70k and be in a place where insurance is merely expensive rather than a complete budget disaster. But it‚Äôs a real risk you have to take as you climb towards financial security, and not everyone chooses to take it.</p><p>Dental insurance is worse. There‚Äôs an internet meme that says that teeth are ‚Äúluxury bones‚Äù that insurance doesn‚Äôt cover, and this is more or less true - even with dental insurance, you are still out of pocket significant amounts of money for even basic dental care. I haven‚Äôt been to a dentist since I was 11 years old for reasons related to this. I often consider the fact that I‚Äôm in a bit of a race against time with my own teeth - at some point they will go from ‚Äúmerely crooked‚Äù to ‚Äúvisibly rotting‚Äù, and very few people will hire a person with visibly rotten teeth for work. </p><p>Note for other people of limited income: Take the time to check and see if there‚Äôs a dental school in your town. The care dental school clinics give isn‚Äôt free, but it‚Äôs significantly cheaper and in my experience pretty good. One of my children has significant dental care needs, and he regularly goes to the dentist at a clinic of this sort - they treat him well and do good work. I can‚Äôt compare it to a ‚Äúreal dentist‚Äù, but it‚Äôs infinitely better than nothing.</p><p>I mentioned this before, but I can work on cars, and I‚Äôm able to do anything less complex than a full engine or transmission rebuild. This is an example of what I refer to with friends as ‚Äúpoor people skills‚Äù, or capabilities you develop beyond the norm because it‚Äôs necessary to survive.</p><p>The most fun poor person skill by far is buying things off of Craigslist. It‚Äôs by no means rocket science, but having little money means you end up buying all but the very cheapest of durable goods used, and repeated practice at this makes you skilled at finding deals other people might miss.</p><p>It‚Äôs been decades since I bought new furniture besides IKEA; most of that comes from Craigslist. Cars come from Craigslist - you can buy used cars at dealerships and it‚Äôs less risky, but comes with a 25-50% markup for the safety that a lot of people can‚Äôt afford. Durable cookware, like pots and pans? Craigslist, if you want anything kind of nice; the stuff you can afford at target starts flaking teflon into your eggs a week in.</p><p>Rich person tip: Unless you really, really need everything in your house to clearly be part of a unified set, you are a sucker if you buy furniture new; this is especially true for non-upholstered wooden furniture. Antique furniture is prettier, studier, has more street cred and can be had for a song compared to retail store prices; let other people pay those and look average while you put in a minimum effort, save money, and get cooler older furniture that makes you look like a person of taste rather than an every day jive-turkey retail sucker.</p><p>Poor people tip: Stop buying spatulas on Craigslist. Just work some more overtime. Yes, I know it‚Äôs a lot of overtime already but spatulas cost $5 new - a $2 spatula is not a deal and the savings don‚Äôt pay for even minimum-wage time spent driving to talk to a guy named ‚ÄúPastor Dave‚Äù about used discount cookware in a Circle K parking lot.</p><p>That last tip to poor people seems like a joke, but at some point it‚Äôs something you have to look out for - you get so used to thinking of money as an extremely finite resource that any amount of absolute savings in purchase price looks necessary to you. But once you conquer that, it‚Äôs like a superpower; you can save hundreds or thousands of dollars furnishing a room; you can buy a box of books with the one book you want in it for less than the price of that individual book from a bookstore. </p><p>The only downside to your new found x-man discount used goods status is the possibility of getting stabbed; it‚Äôs a good idea to look at the approximate area of the guy selling you a hamster cage before you find yourself in the more murder-prone parts of town at night, conspicuously button-down and muggable hoping nobody notices you. Get that one little bit down, though, and it‚Äôs like the skies open up and the heavens beam savings down; all the discount archery sets and knock-off kitchen knives of the world are suddenly at your fingertips.</p><p>That‚Äôs it! We made it through. As I said before, none of this was meant to make you feel guilty and I hope and pray I managed not to sound like I was whining - I really want to emphasize that outside of everything I‚Äôve talked about here, I‚Äôm absurdly wealthy in terms of the people who choose to spend their lives in my vicinity. I‚Äôm mostly a happy guy, and anymore one who can often pay his bills on time. I can really honestly confirm that money isn‚Äôt the operative thing that makes you happy; it really is  more about having good people around to talk to, take care of and to be taken care of by.</p><p>And if you do better than I do - say, if you are a person who completed college on time and went on to your deserved place in the upper-middle class -  I hereby command you not to feel bad about it. It‚Äôs OK to do well, and I have an idea of the kind of work you‚Äôve put in to get to where you are; there‚Äôs a great chance you deserve to have the things you have. I hope this was instructive for you, and I wish you continued success.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Playing General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, and nuclear physicist Niels Bohr respectively, the two A-listers herald the arrival of the Danish scientist at Los Alamos. This is the secret facility established in New Mexico in 1943 to build the first <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/why-vertical-smoke-trails-are-seen-during-nuclear-explosions">atom bomb</a> and recreated 80 years later by Christopher Nolan to film his epic hit movie, <em>Oppenheimer</em>.</p><p>‚ÄúThe British pilots put me in the bomb bay,‚Äù Branagh as Bohr laughingly recounts in his best Danish accent, they ‚Äúshowed me the oxygen ‚Äî of course, I messed it up.

While researching my new book, <em>Mosquito</em>, about the U.K. Royal Air Force <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peoplesmosquito.org.uk/2013/12/06/operation-carthage-the-shell-house-raid-21st-march-1945/">raid on the Gestapo headquarters</a> in Copenhagen, I discovered the fascinating truth about both.</p><p>At the time he joined the Manhattan Project, Niels Bohr was perhaps the most famous scientist in the world after Albert Einstein. His Danish homeland had been under German occupation since April 1940.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Kenneth Branagh as nuclear physicist Niels Bohr, and the man himself, known to the British Special Operations Executive as the ‚ÄòGreat Dane.‚Äô <em>via the author</em> </span></figure><p>On the day of the invasion, the professor was in the lab in Copenhagen that he had set up, attempting to dissolve a pair of Nobel medals in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid. Bohr was trying to stop the Nazis from getting their hands on two 23-karat-gold Nobels he‚Äôd been given for safekeeping by two Jewish German physicists fleeing the antisemitism of Hitler‚Äôs Germany. He‚Äôd auctioned off his <em>own</em> Nobel medal in 1940 to raise money for victims of Finland‚Äôs ‚ÄòWinter War‚Äô with the Soviet Union. That he‚Äôd allowed the institute in Copenhagen that carried his name to provide sanctuary for those German exiles also spoke to his altruism. But it was also personal. By virtue of his Jewish mother, Niels Bohr was Jewish by heritage, if not through religious belief.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">German troops patrol the streets of Copenhagen, during the Nazi occupation of Denmark. <em>Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>Britain‚Äôs Special Operations Executive (SOE), set up in 1940 with instructions from Winston Churchill to ‚Äúset Europe ablaze‚Äù through sedition and sabotage, had first tried to prompt Bohr‚Äôs departure from Denmark in 1943 by sending a secret agent to the scientist‚Äôs home. Bohr‚Äôs polite rejection of London‚Äôs invitation was hidden beneath the stamps stuck to three separate postcards. Next time, SOE sent a written message, along with detailed instructions:</p><p><em>‚ÄúA small hole to a depth of 4mm has been bored in the two keys. The holes were plugged up and concealed after the message was inserted. Professor Bohr should gently file the keys at the point indicated until the hole appears. The message can then be syringed or floated out onto a micro-slide.‚Äù</em></p><p>The message inside from Bohr‚Äôs friend Professor James Chadwick of Liverpool University was the size of a grain of sand and contained in a hole the width of a pinhead and had to be deciphered using a 600-power lens microscope. Chadwick urged him to leave Denmark for the United Kingdom, alluding to ‚Äúa particular problem in which your assistance would be of the greatest help.‚Äù</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">James Chadwick, photographed circa 1945. <em>Los Alamos National Laboratory</em> </span></figure><p>Chadwick, his fellow Nobel Laureate for his discovery of the neutron, was leading Britain‚Äôs research into the atomic bomb.</p><p>Again, Bohr politely declined, feeling he could do more good in occupied Denmark, but he was in no doubt about the nature of the ‚Äúparticular problem‚Äù his friend alluded to. He just didn‚Äôt believe that given the current state of the art, an atomic bomb was feasible.</p><p>Two months later Bohr reported to Chadwick that new information had convinced him that Germany had established the means to develop a nuclear reactor using uranium and heavy water. But as the British scientist prepared to take on a new role as head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, it still wasn‚Äôt enough to persuade the ‚ÄòGreat Dane,‚Äô as he was known to SOE, to leave Copenhagen.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Supervised by the U.S. Army, the German experimental nuclear reactor is dismantled at Haigerloch, southwest Germany, in April 1945. <em>U.S. Army</em><br><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving"></a> </span></figure><p>It wasn‚Äôt until a Danish woman working for the Gestapo saw an order for Bohr‚Äôs arrest and tipped off Bohr‚Äôs brother, Harald, that the physicist finally accepted that he had to go. Evidence of imminent action by the Nazis against Denmark‚Äôs Jewish community and the threat to him specifically was now impossible to ignore. Senior SS personnel poured into Copenhagen. A large German ship, the <em>Wartheland</em>, was alongside harbor, ready to carry as many of the country‚Äôs 7,000 Jews as could be packed in.</p><p>Bohr and his wife, Margarethe, left their home at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/11/28/for-winning-the-nobel-prize-niels-bohr-got-a-house-with-free-beer/">the Carlsberg brewery estate</a> within hours of the tip-off from Harald. As they slipped out of the back of their house a Nazi snatch squad was already on its way. When the couple later crawled on all-fours from a beach hut to a waiting boat, the most famous man in Denmark had with him a single bag, a beer bottle full of heavy water retrieved from the lab, and a sketch purporting to be of the Nazi‚Äôs reactor design. There had been no time to gather any more possessions before being smuggled across the strait to Sweden.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A German general decorating with the Iron Cross some soldiers of the Expeditionary Force and two soldiers of the SS, in Denmark, April 1940. <em>Photo by Mondadori via Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>Niels and Margarethe Bohr may have thought that, with their arrival in Malm√∏, they were safe from the clutches of the Nazis, but that was neither how the Gestapo nor Danish Army intelligence saw the situation.</p><p>Like Madrid, Lisbon, or Casablanca, the capital of neutral Sweden was a hotbed of wartime intrigue, with spies from intelligence agencies from around the world operating side-by-side all competing for advantage. Secrets, lies, treachery, and deception were all common currency in Stockholm, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutout_(espionage)">cutouts</a>, agents, safe houses, dead drops, surveillance, and ciphers were the means by which they were traded. And with the arrival of the world‚Äôs most celebrated nuclear physicist, they had a prize worth playing for. </p><p>At first, the Swedish authorities were reluctant to acknowledge that Bohr was at risk of abduction or assassination, telling the Danish Army captain charged with his protection, ‚ÄúThis is Stockholm, not Chicago.‚Äù</p><p>When it came to ruthlessness and brutality, the officer replied, there was no gangster that could compare to the Gestapo, and that ‚Äúif anything happens to the professor it will be a disgrace to your country.‚Äù The captain never left Bohr‚Äôs side while he was in Sweden. But from now on, he was also joined by three armed Swedish secret police. Arriving in Stockholm, Bohr was bundled from a taxi into a house owned by Swedish intelligence, led through the attics to the other side of the building, and met by a second taxi, which took him to a safe house.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">The Danish scientist Niels Bohr in his laboratory in the 1940s. <em>Photo by Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>Three days later, the Nazis moved against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yadvashem.org/articles/academic/denmark-and-the-holocaust.html">Denmark‚Äôs Jews</a> as planned, but it was already too late. Alerted, like Bohr, to the imminent danger, they were taken in, hidden, and, over time, evacuated by their countrymen. Sweden, after lobbying from Bohr himself, agreed to take them all in. Of Denmark‚Äôs 7,000 or so Jews, just 284 of the weakest and most vulnerable had been arrested.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt even enough, remarked a crestfallen Nazi official ‚Äúto justify the dispatch of a train to the concentration camp.‚Äù</p><p>For Bohr himself to reach ultimate safety, he would now be relying on the ‚ÄòStockholm Express.‚Äô And, despite the name, it was not a train, but one of a small fleet of unarmed de Havilland Mosquito aircraft that, operated by British Airways‚Äô precursor, BOAC ‚Äî the British Overseas Airways Corporation ‚Äî ran the gauntlet of Luftwaffe night-fighters to carry VIP passengers between RAF Leuchars in Scotland and Sweden‚Äôs Bromma Airport. Those passengers rode in the claustrophobic confines of the Masquitos' felt-lined bomb bays. The flight nearly killed Bohr. And for that, the Mosquito‚Äôs peerless performance was to blame. That bundling a VIP into the belly of a warplane was even an option was all down to ball bearings.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">BOAC Mosquitos carried a single passenger in the felt-lined bomb bay. They were given oxygen, a reading light, a blanket, and a flask of coffee for the two-and-a-half-hour flight. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>For 35 years, the Swedish company SKF had led the world in the production of quality ball bearings, opening factories in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the United States. But with the advent of World War II, their plant in Luton, England, despite working day and night, couldn‚Äôt keep up with demand.</p><p>Each <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/35474/the-british-had-a-plan-to-drop-anthrax-laced-cattle-feed-over-germany-in-1942">Avro Lancaster bomber</a> for the RAF required over 175 pounds of quality ball bearings and these aircraft were rolling off the production line at a rate of around 25 a week. But there were also Spitfires, Hurricanes, and plenty more besides. Britain had a huge variety of aircraft types in production, powered by a wide variety of different engines, and <em>all</em> required ball bearings of their own. Nor was it just aircraft. Tanks, armored cars, warships, and anti-aircraft guns all needed ball bearings. In fact, there were very few pieces of complex military machinery that <em>didn‚Äôt</em>. And that, of course, included the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/21198/listen-to-a-p-82-twin-mustang-pur-a-glorious-sound-not-heard-in-over-30-years">Merlin-engined</a> Mosquito itself.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A scene from an SKF ball-bearing plant, photographed soon after World War II. <em>Photo by Walter Nurnberg/SSPL/Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>SOE ships carrying Swedish ball bearings first successfully ran the German blockade of the Skagerrak ‚Äî the strait providing access between the North Sea and Sweden ‚Äî in 1941. Since June 1942, though, BOAC had been running semi-regular courier flights along the 500-mile route between RAF Leuchars and Stockholm. The airbridge, so critical to both British intelligence and war industry, crossed some of the most hostile and heavily defended skies in the world, yet BOAC had struggled to find an aircraft to serve its needs.</p><p>To begin with, the airline was given cast-off <a target="_blank" href="https://www.baesystems.com/en/heritage/armstrong-whitworth-aw38-whitley">Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys</a>. Slow and vulnerable, the obsolete RAF bombers were soon dispensed with in favor of new types acquired from the United States, small Lockheed Lodestars and Hudsons and a one-off, <em>St. Louis</em>, the first prototype of the new Curtiss C-46 Commando transport. The C-46 was capable of carrying heavy loads but remained vulnerable to the Luftwaffe. So too were the Douglas DC-3s that replaced it in the spring of 1943.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">The BOAC-operated Curtiss CW-20A (the prototype of the C-46), G-AGDI, named <em>St. Louis</em>, is refueled at Gibraltar, in 1941 or 1942. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>At Leuchars, BOAC was very firmly of the view that ‚Äúthe Skagerrak is no place for a Dak‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to the vulnerability of the Dakota, as the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/39236/theres-one-place-in-the-world-where-ac-47-spooky-gunships-still-fly">DC-3/C-47</a> was known in British service. But in the spring of 1943, the pressure to keep up the flights only intensified with a telegram from the British Minister in Stockholm, Sir Victor Mallett:</p><p><em>‚ÄúSince the need for at least 100 tons of bearings is desperate I recommend that risks should be taken as in any other wartime operation and that freight aircraft without passengers should fly regardless of bright nights throughout the summer months. If the Germans take to shooting them down the position can be reconsidered and at the worst, we will have lost one or two Dakotas and crews.‚Äù</em></p><p>BOAC disagreed and, after trialing an alternative route to Sweden, concluded in a report that what was required was ‚Äúan aircraft with great performance ‚Äî speed, higher ceiling, and more endurance.‚Äù</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">No. 105 Squadron Mosquito B.IVs. The B.IV was the first Mosquito to enter service with BOAC and remained popular with crews after the introduction of the&nbsp;subsequent FB.VI&nbsp;because it was a few miles per hour faster. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>When, in 1938, as the prospect of war loomed over Europe, Geoffrey de Havilland first suggested the idea of a lightweight twin-engine bomber to the U.K. Air Ministry he was met with little enthusiasm. Undeterred, he decided that his company would build it anyway. And, if the new machine was built from wood, he knew he would not only be able to get it into production much more quickly than a metal design but would also avoid making any demand on vital supplies of the aluminum required to build every other military aircraft. In top secret, on the grounds of a moated stately home near St. Albans, north of London, his team got to work on a prototype.</p><p>They were fortunate that despite the Air Ministry‚Äôs skepticism their efforts enjoyed determined and far-sighted support from Air Marshal Wilfred Freeman, the man responsible for research, development, and production of new aircraft for the RAF. Impressed as a young pilot in the Royal Flying Corps (the RAF‚Äôs immediate successor) by the performance of an earlier de Havilland bomber design, Freeman circumvented the objections of Bomber Command to the notion of an unarmed bomber by ordering 50 of de Havilland‚Äôs sleek new Mosquitos to fulfill a separate RAF requirement for high-flying spyplanes.</p><p>Powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, the Mosquito was capable of flying to Berlin and back with the same 4,000-pound bombload as Boeing‚Äôs <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41454/the-b-17-bombers-combat-debut-80-years-ago-today-was-a-fiasco">B-17 Flying Fortress</a> yet flown by a crew of two instead of 10.</p><div data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/embed"><p itemprop="associatedMedia"><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTsnMKzmdWs?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>Following a remarkable flying display laid on for Gen. Hap Arnold, the head of the United States Army Air Corps, in April 1941, he rated it ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù and insisted on taking a set of the blueprints home with him. Three months later, in the same week that it entered frontline service, a Mosquito recorded a top speed of 433 miles per hour at a time when the RAF‚Äôs top fighter, the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/39633/yes-the-u-s-navy-also-took-the-spitfire-into-battle-during-world-war-ii">Spitfire Mk V</a>, topped out at 370 miles per hour. Suddenly everyone wanted the Mosquito and because of its unique wood and glue construction, furniture factories, cabinetmakers, and musical instrument manufacturers around Britain were able to put their carpentry-skilled workforces to work helping keep up with demand.</p><p>After first entering RAF service with a photo-reconnaissance unit in the summer of 1941, the first Mosquito bomber squadron formed a few months later. No. 105 Squadron‚Äôs operations remained classified for nearly a year until, in September 1942, after a low-level raid on a Gestapo HQ in Oslo, the Mosquito‚Äôs existence was revealed to the public in enthusiastic reports that noted its ability to ‚Äúoutpace the latest Focke-Wulf [Fw 190].‚Äù</p><p>And that was exactly what BOAC needed.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190 at its airbase.

Although not immune to the attentions of the German fighter squadrons that pincered the route, the Mosquitos, their camouflaged wings overpainted top and bottom with their civilian registration in huge letters and the airline‚Äôs iconic <a target="_blank" href="https://londonairtravel.com/2019/08/11/british-airways-100-years-theyre-lee-elliotts-speedbird/">‚Äòspeedbird‚Äô logo</a> on the nose, at least loaded the odds in favor of the airline pilots.</p><p>A single Mosquito could carry a load of 1,400 pounds of Swedish ball bearings packed in cases and stowed in the bomb bay, but its speed meant it could complete two or even three runs between Leuchars and Stockholm in a single night. In June of 1943, the airline‚Äôs Mosquito fleet completed 30 round trips to help chip away at Britain‚Äôs ball-bearing deficit, but their greater contribution was made through a single, game-changing flight at the end of the month.</p><p>Henry Waring and Ville Siberg had been kicking their heels in St. Andrews, on Scotland‚Äôs east coast, for nearly a week. Waring, a representative of the British Iron and Steel Corps, and his colleague, who ran SKF‚Äôs Luton factory, knew valuable time was being wasted. Ball bearings from neutral Sweden were supplied on a first-come, first-served basis and it was understood in London that the Germans, after Allied bombing of their own ball-bearing factories, were on the verge of placing a large order. Twice Waring phoned London urging action but was told that long, hot summer days and a complete lack of cloud cover meant attempting the flight in the waiting Lockheed 14 would be suicide.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A BOAC Mosquito FB.VI G-AGGD prepares to land. <em>Crown Copyright </em> </span></figure><p>Waring was sunbathing by the swimming pool when, on June 24, an RAF driver pulled up at the hotel. Still in his swimming trunks, Waring was taken to Leuchars and informed that he and Siberg would be traveling to Sweden that night in a pair of hastily adapted BOAC Mosquitos.</p><p>Each fortified by a stiff whisky before departure, the two businessmen reached Bromma just hours before the German negotiating team to secure SKF‚Äôs ball bearings for the Allies, and, as well as catering for British requirements, also deliberately placed&nbsp;orders for gauges they believed were in short supply in the Reich. Their safe delivery was recorded on the freight manifest as ‚Äúone package Waring, one package Siberg.‚Äù</p><p>Geoffrey de Havilland once wrote that ‚Äúif the size is right, the aeroplane becomes very versatile.‚Äù But the Mosquito had a sort of Goldilocks quality to it. It could do anything. Doctrine has it that there are four roles of air power: control of the air; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; attack; and mobility. Broadly speaking, an air force requires fighters, spyplanes, bombers, and transport aircraft to perform these tasks, each usually requiring very different characteristics in an airframe. Prior to 1943, though, the Mosquito had already made its mark as an exceptional example of the first three.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A BOAC Mosquito pilot climbing aboard an FB.VI. Note the four sealed 20mm cannon gun ports in the nose. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>In going on to drop a total of nearly 27,000 tons of bombs on the enemy, Mosquitos suffered fewer losses per thousand sorties than any other aircraft in Bomber Command. And so accurate were they that, after the campaign to destroy <a target="_blank" href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/v-1-cruise-missile/nasm_A19600341000">V-1 flying-bomb</a> launch sites in the autumn of 1942, records showed that Mosquito crews required less than a quarter of the tonnage of bombs to destroy each target than the next most effective bomber. There were single nights on either side of D-Day when Mosquito fighter-bombers would destroy nearly a thousand separate pieces of German motor transport.</p><p>As heavily armed eight-gun fighters ‚Äî especially as radar-equipped night-fighters ‚Äî Mosquitos shot down over 800 enemy aircraft. Such was the fear that they induced within the Luftwaffe in the latter stages of the war as they loitered around German airfields after dark, ready to pounce on anything coming in or out, that the term <em>Moskitopanik</em> was coined.</p><p>Flying photo-reconnaissance missions, Mosquitos crisscrossed Europe with near impunity gathering critical photographic intelligence that, among other things, helped delay the threat from Hitler‚Äôs <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/the-v-2-rocket-changing-the-trajectory-of-warfare">V-2 ballistic missile</a>. In assuming the mantle of airliner/transport for BOAC between Leuchars and Stockholm, the Mosquito became perhaps the only machine in history to successfully combine all four of these essential roles.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">BOAC crew with an RAF Flying Control officer at RAF Leuchars before departing for Stockholm. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>In the six months that followed Waring and Viberg‚Äôs flight, Mosquitos flew another 129 round trips to Sweden and hauled back over 100 tons of ball bearings. But it was the human cargoes they carried to and from Scandinavia that really distinguished the British and Norwegian civilian pilots and radio operators employed by BOAC. As well as maintaining the flow of intelligence and personnel to and from Sweden, and by extension, Denmark, they were also responsible for repatriating downed Allied aircrews, many of whom had been spirited out of Denmark to Sweden by local resistance groups.</p><p>A little before 6:30 a.m. at Bromma Airport on October 6, 1943, the crew of BOAC Mosquito FB.VI G-AGGG installed Niels Bohr in the bomb bay and briefed him on how to use the intercom and oxygen system. They said they would tell him when he was required to switch it on. He was given flares and a parachute in case they had to abandon the aircraft, then sealed into the claustrophobically compact space for the duration of the two-and-a-half-hour flight.</p><p>Climbing west through 15,000 feet towards the thin air of what mountaineers call the death zone near 25,000 feet, the BOAC crew was confident that, behind them, Bohr would follow his instructions. Unknown to them, the leather flying helmet that contained his intercom didn‚Äôt fit easily over the scientist‚Äôs large head, so he couldn‚Äôt hear them. Nor did Bohr, who could be remarkably unworldly, properly understand how to use the oxygen.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A BOAC Mosquito lines up for takeoff from RAF Leuchars in Scotland. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>When the radio operator asked how he was getting on there was no answer from the bomb bay. He feared that Bohr had passed out through oxygen starvation. But until G-AGGG had swept through the jaws of the German air defenses ranged to the north and south, they had to stay high.</p><p>Two and half hours after taking off from Bromma, after completing the final leg of the journey low over the North Sea, the Mosquito FB.VI landed at RAF Leuchars and taxied towards an anxious crowd waiting by the terminal. Where, to their great relief, the Great Dane, weak but alive, was liberated from the belly of the aircraft. </p><p>The following month Bohr sailed for America, arriving at Los Alamos to join the Manhattan Project in the new year. Here, as historian Alex Wellerstein&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/05/11/bohr-at-los-alamos/">writes</a>, Bohr‚Äôs contribution to building the first functional nuclear devices was highly significant, although subsequently underplayed.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Capt.

<p>The Busemann-Petty problem (posed in 1956) has an interesting history. It asks the following question: if $K$ and $L$ are two origin-symmetric convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the volume of each central hyperplane section of $K$ is less than the volume of the corresponding section of $L$:
$$\operatorname{Vol}_{n-1}(K\cap \xi^\perp)\le \operatorname{Vol}_{n-1}(L\cap \xi^\perp)\qquad\text{for all } \xi\in S^{n-1},$$
does it follow that the volume of $K$ is less than the volume of $L$: $\operatorname{Vol}_n(K)\le \operatorname{Vol}_n(L)?$</p>

<p>Many mathematician's gut reaction to the question is that the answer must be yes and Minkowski's uniqueness theorem provides some mathematical justification for such a belief---Minkwoski's uniqueness theorem implies that an origin-symmetric star body in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is completely determined by the volumes of its central hyperplane sections, so these volumes of central hyperplane sections <em>do</em> contain a vast amount of information about the bodies. It was widely believed that the answer to the Busemann-Problem must be true, even though it was still a largely unopened conjecture.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in 1975 everyone was caught off-guard when Larman and Rogers produced a counter-example showing that the assertion is false in $n \ge 12$ dimensions. Their counter-example was quite complicated, but in 1986, Keith Ball proved that the maximum hyperplane section of the unit cube is $\sqrt{2}$ regardless of the dimension, and a consequence of this is that the centered unit cube and a centered ball of suitable radius provide a counter-example when $n \ge 10$. Some time later Giannopoulos and Bourgain (independently) gave counter-examples for $n\ge 7$, and then Papadimitrakis and Gardner (independently) gave counter-examples for $n=5,6$.</p>

<p>By 1992 only the three and four dimensional cases of the Busemann-Petty problem remained unsolved, since the problem is trivially true in two dimensions and by that point counter-examples had been found for all $n\ge 5$. 
Around this time theory had been developed connecting the problem with the notion of an "intersection body". Lutwak proved that if the body with smaller sections is an intersection body then the conclusion of the Busemann-Petty problem follows. Later work by Grinberg, Rivin, Gardner, and Zhang strengthened the connection and established that the Busemann-Petty problem has an affirmative answer in $\mathbb{R}^n$ iff every origin-symmetric convex body in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an intersection body. But the question of whether a body is an intersection body is closely related to the positivity of the inverse spherical Radon transform. In 1994, Richard Gardner used geometric methods to invert the spherical Radon transform in three dimensions in such a way to prove that the problem has an <em>affirmative</em> answer in three dimensions (which was surprising since all of the results up to that point had been <em>negative</em>). Then in 1994, Gaoyong Zhang published a paper (in the Annals of Mathematics) which claimed to prove that the unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is not an intersection body and as a consequence that the problem has a negative answer in $n=4$.</p>

<p>For three years everyone believed the problem had been solved, but in 1997 Alexander Koldobsky (who was working on completely different problems) provided a new Fourier analytic approach to convex bodies and in particular established a very convenient Fourier analytic characterization of intersection bodies. Using his new characterization he showed that the unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^4$ <em>is</em> an intersection body, contradicting Zhang's earlier claim. It turned out that Zhang's paper was incorrect and this re-opened the Busemann-Petty problem again.</p>

<p>After learning that Koldobsky's results contradicted his claims, Zhang quickly proved that in fact every origin-symmetric convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$ <em>is</em> an intersection body and hence that the Busemann-Petty problem has an affirmative answer in $\mathbb{R}^4$---the opposite of what he had previously claimed. This later paper was also published in the Annals, and so Zhang may be perhaps the only person to have published in such a prestigious journal both that $P$ and that $\neg P$!</p>
