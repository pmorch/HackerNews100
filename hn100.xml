<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The simple version: the newt is in an arms race with the common garter snake, <em>Thamnophis sirtalis</em>.&nbsp; The garter snake is a small-to-medium sized snake that is common all over North America.&nbsp; It’s a slim, elegant little creature that is usually found in or near water.&nbsp; And while it will eat pretty much anything it can catch, the garter snake particularly likes amphibians: small frogs, salamanders and newts.&nbsp; And in the Pacific Northwest, it <em>really</em> likes snacking on the Rough-Skinned Newt.</p><p>So the garter snakes of the Pacific Northwest have been evolving resistance to tetrodotoxin.&nbsp; (As you may recall, tetrodotoxin is the stuff that <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2025/03/14/occasional-paper-the-interesting-home-life-of-the-blue-ringed-octopus/">makes the blue-ringed octopus so deadly</a>.&nbsp; It’s produced by symbiotic bacteria that live in the newt’s body, mostly on its skin.)&nbsp; And as the garter snakes evolve resistance, the newts have to evolve ever greater toxicity.&nbsp; And as the newts get more toxic… right.&nbsp; Feedback loop!&nbsp; That’s the simple version.</p><p>Except this is biology, so of course it’s not that simple.</p><div><p>One thing to keep in mind is that nothing in nature is free. The newt’s toxicity comes with a cost: the metabolic load of supporting all those bacteria.&nbsp; More toxicity means more bacteria means more load.&nbsp; A very toxic newt has to consume more calories than its less-toxic cousin.</p><p>Meanwhile, evolving resistance also comes at a cost.&nbsp; We don’t know that directly, but we can infer it pretty well.&nbsp; If resistance to tetrodotoxin were cheap and easy, everything would evolve it.&nbsp; </p><p>There have actually been attempts to measure the effect on the snakes!&nbsp; They haven’t found them, but keep in mind that tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxin.&nbsp; To resist it, you have to make changes to the biochemistry of your nervous system.&nbsp; Even a small snake has a very very complex nervous system, where those changes might show up in ways that are hard to measure.&nbsp; Like, if the resistant snakes were clumsier or had slower reflexes, sure, we could see that.&nbsp; But maybe they’re suffering from much more subtle neurological effects, like being prone to insomnia or hallucinations or sexual dysfunction.&nbsp; Or maybe they’re just a bit dim.&nbsp; </p><p>We don’t know, but we’re pretty sure there must be something.&nbsp; &nbsp;We know that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-024-01517-7?fromPaywallRec=true">garter snakes outside of the Pacific Northwest are much less resistant to tetrodotoxin</a>.&nbsp; They’ll drop dead from doses that their Oregon cousins simply ignore.&nbsp; So evolving the resistance must have some cost or drawback.</p><p>(Note that this means the newt is double-whammied:&nbsp; not only does it suffer the metabolic load of carrying around all those bacteria, but it also has to evolve resistance to tetrodotoxin, accepting whatever negative effects that brings.&nbsp; And things are only going to get worse.)</p><p>Now: when the snakes eat Rough-Skinned Newts, they may sometimes show signs of discomfort. The snake may visibly gag.&nbsp; It may writhe in obvious unease.&nbsp; In some cases, it may go into respiratory distress.&nbsp; Eating the newt looks pretty unpleasant.&nbsp; Yet the snakes persist.</p><p>Okay then — if evolving toxin resistance carries a cost, and if&nbsp;<em>even with resistance</em> eating the newts is unpleasant, then why then do garter snakes insist on eating newts?&nbsp; They cheerfully eat frogs, fish, and other non-toxic prey items.&nbsp; Why don’t they just eat those, and leave the poor newts alone?</p><p>Turns out there is an answer:&nbsp; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JOEC.0000045585.77875.09">the garter snakes sequester the tetrodotoxin</a>, storing it in their livers.&nbsp; This makes them toxic to their own predators.&nbsp; (Of which there are plenty.&nbsp; They’re not large snakes, so they’re hunted by everything from raccoons to ravens.)&nbsp; But they don’t harbor the bacteria, so they don’t produce tetrodotoxin of their own. So eventually, the toxin that they’ve ingested breaks down.&nbsp; And then they need to eat another newt to refresh their defense.</p><p>(If you are That Guy:&nbsp; now you can name a snake that is poisonous without being venomous.)</p><p>So this explains why the snakes go after the newts particularly, preferring them to less toxic prey.&nbsp; They <em>want</em> to eat toxic newts.&nbsp; And it explains why the newts keep evolving to be more toxic: the snake may want to eat newts generally, but if an individual newt packs enough of a wallop, the snake <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00049-010-0057-z">may just retch it up and go after a different one</a>.&nbsp; Newts with weaker poison?&nbsp; They get eaten.&nbsp; Snakes with less resistance?&nbsp; Have trouble finding newts they can choke down, and don’t get to steal their poison.&nbsp; So the arms race continues.</p><p>This also explains why the newts, despite being very toxic to anything that’s not a garter snake, haven’t evolved aposematic coloring or signals.&nbsp; “Aposematic” is just a fancy word for “warning”, meaning something — usually color — that tells the world Do Not Mess With Me:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Frainforest-cruises%2Fimages%2Fc_fill%2Cg_auto%2Ff_auto%2Cq_auto%2Fw_2560%2Ch_1861%2Fv1627055916%2FPoison-Dart-Frogs-Facts-rana-de-dardo-envenenada-amarillenta%2FPoison-Dart-Frogs-Facts-rana-de-dardo-envenenada-amarillenta.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=08b23ddaf5aa7edcd44506b627b0819a1169f932e06f09d41f146f6d24d69d9c" alt="13 Interesting Poison Dart Frogs Facts - Rainforest Cruises" width="237" height="172"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fguloinnature.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F08%2F8-1-e1664541955412.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=7a5788815878ecb746369fb7609cbab7d9ef55e63314cba4ceef46de08284727" alt="What is aposematic coloration? | Gulo in Nature" width="273" height="174"></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.color-meanings.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F06%2Fstriped-lionfish-close-up-blue-background-14878-768x491.jpeg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=d517fafecdfbd90d6e7acca301a9ab884dc3355231a4a71a2e0461e46de29459" alt="Aposematic Coloration: Nature's Brightly Colored Warning Signs | Color ..." width="361" height="231"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://newbeautifulera.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gary-larsen.png?w=500" alt="Gary Larsen" width="181" height="232"><br>[The Far Side by Gary Larsen, copyright 1984]</p><p>The Rough-Skinned Newt, like many newts, has a brightly colored underside that it can flash when threatened.&nbsp; But the rest of it is a dull mottled grey, camouflage.&nbsp; Presumably that’s because if the newt ever tried to evolve full-body colors like an Amazonian poison dart frog, it would just be a big “come eat me” sign to garter snakes.&nbsp; Probably a certain number of newts get eaten by birds or fish or whatever anyway because they’re not aposematic enough.&nbsp; The bird or fish may not survive the experience, but that’s not much comfort to the newt.</p><p>In sum: the unfortunate newt is not once, not twice, but three times screwed over here.&nbsp; They have to be extra-toxic, carrying that metabolic load, just to <em>maybe</em> make the garter snakes think twice about eating them.&nbsp; Then they have to evolve defenses against their own toxin.&nbsp; But they can’t evolve aposematic coloring, because that’ll just lead to the snakes gobbling them all up.&nbsp; And finally, they can’t go back to being not-very-toxic, because the snakes will just eat more of them to gain the same amount of tetrodotoxin.&nbsp; They can’t win, they can’t break even, and they can’t leave the game.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcaliforniaherps.com%2Fsalamanders%2Fimages%2Ftgranulosaventmend.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=3790a4834b4a97caa8b5adfb847fac5f6910139893a2e6b08515baa8fbceb8fd" alt="Rough-skinned Newt - Taricha granulosa" width="351" height="234"><br>[Copyright Gary Nafis, 2019]</p><p>There is even more going on here.&nbsp; There are literally dozens of papers about this snake-newt interaction.&nbsp; And we still haven’t reached the end of it!&nbsp; Just a few examples:</p><p>— The newts that live in the northern end of their range, up in Alaska, don’t have garter snakes around.&nbsp; As expected, they mostly aren’t very toxic.&nbsp; But only mostly!&nbsp; One paper found <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.2068">odd little pockets of unexpectedly toxic newts</a> up there.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; We don’t know.</p><p>— Meanwhile, the newts of Vancouver Island, offshore, also aren’t very toxic.&nbsp; Because there are no snakes there?&nbsp; Ha ha, no.&nbsp; There are three different species of garter snake on Vancouver.&nbsp; But&nbsp; for some reason, the newts and snakes there seem to be living in harmony.&nbsp; Well, relative harmony.&nbsp; The snakes of Vancouver do eat newts.&nbsp; But so far, the snakes and newts don’t seem to have started an arms race like they have on the mainland.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; We don’t know.</p><p>— A question that occurred, digging through these papers:&nbsp; if the garter snakes are becoming toxic from eating newts, might the <em>snake</em>&nbsp; begin to evolve aposematic coloring?&nbsp; And sure enough, when I look at photos of Oregon garter snakes, a lot of them seem to have bright orange markings that look a bit aposematic:</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://2img.net/h/stevenbolgartersnakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Thamnophis-sirtalis-concinnus-11.jpg" width="423" height="282"><br>[copyright Stephen Bol, 2023]</p><p>But on the other hand garter snake markings vary wildly.&nbsp; Lots of garter snakes outside the Pacific Northwest have orange spots or stripes, and lots of snakes within the region don’t.&nbsp; And as far as I can tell, nobody has even tried to research this yet.</p><p>— A thing to keep in mind: the Pacific Northwest, where all this is playing out, is a very young ecosystem in geological terms.&nbsp; Just 20,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age, the Pacific coast of Washington and Oregon looked a lot like Greenland today: a thin coastal strip of cold tundra,&nbsp; everything else covered by an ice cap.&nbsp; The newts and the snakes are relatively recent colonists.&nbsp; So we may be catching a snapshot of a relationship that is still evolving, and that may not be long-term stable.</p><p>— And finally, I have oversimplified this whole thing, because there are other species of newt in the genus <em>Taricha&nbsp;</em>that are pretty toxic — not as crazy deadly as their Rough-Skinned cousins, but still more toxic than normal newts — while the garter snake genus <em>Thamnophis </em>is just a taxonomic mess.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, we’ve learned a lot, but mysteries still abound.&nbsp;</p><p>And that is probably enough about newts for now.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html">https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44191591">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Edit: Twitter could improve this significantly with very few changes - I wrote about that <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71933.html">here</a>. It's unclear why they'd launch without doing that, since it entirely defeats the point of using HSMs)</p><p>When Twitter[1] launched encrypted DMs a couple <br>of years ago, it was the worst kind of end-to-end <br>encrypted - <em>technically</em> e2ee, but in a way that made it relatively easy for Twitter to inject new encryption keys and get everyone's messages anyway. It was also lacking a whole bunch of features such as "sending pictures", so the entire thing was largely a waste of time. But a couple of days ago, Elon <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1929238157872312773">announced</a> the arrival of "XChat", a new encrypted message platform <q>built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture</q>. Maybe this time they've got it right?</p><p>tl;dr - no. Use Signal. Twitter can probably obtain your private keys, and admit that they can MITM you and have full access to your metadata.</p><p>The new approach is pretty similar to the old one in that it's based on pretty straightforward and well tested cryptographic primitives, but merely using good cryptography doesn't mean you end up with a good solution. This time they've pivoted away from using the underlying cryptographic primitives directly and into higher level abstractions, which is probably a good thing. They're using <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes">Libsodium's boxes</a> for message encryption, which is, well, fine? It doesn't offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">forward secrecy</a> (if someone's private key is leaked then all existing messages can be decrypted) so it's a long way from the state of the art for a messaging client (Signal's had forward secrecy for over a decade!), but it's not inherently broken or anything. It is, however, written in C, not Rust[2].</p><p>That's about the extent of the good news. Twitter's old implementation involved clients generating keypairs and pushing the public key to Twitter. Each client (a physical device or a browser instance) had its own private key, and messages were simply encrypted to every public key associated with an account. This meant that new devices couldn't decrypt old messages, and also meant there was a maximum number of supported devices and terrible scaling issues and it was pretty bad. The new approach generates a keypair and then stores the private key using the <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/assets/whitepapers/juiceboxprotocol_revision7_20230807.pdf">Juicebox</a> protocol. Other devices can then retrieve the private key. </p><p>Doesn't this mean Twitter has the private key? Well, no. There's a PIN involved, and the PIN is used to generate an encryption key. The stored copy of the private key is encrypted with that key, so if you don't know the PIN you can't decrypt the key. So we brute force the PIN, right? Juicebox actually protects against that - before the backend will hand over the encrypted key, you have to prove knowledge of the PIN to it (this is done in a clever way that doesn't directly reveal the PIN to the backend). If you ask for the key too many times while providing the wrong PIN, access is locked down.</p><p>But this is true only if the Juicebox backend is trustworthy. If the backend is controlled by someone untrustworthy[3] then they're going to be able to obtain the encrypted key material (even if it's in an HSM, they can simply watch what comes out of the HSM when the user authenticates if there's no validation of the HSM's keys). And now all they need is the PIN. Turning the PIN into an encryption key is done using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2id</a> key derivation function, using 32 iterations and a memory cost of 16MB (the Juicebox white paper says 16KB, but (a) that's laughably small and (b) the <a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/juicebox-sdk/blob/main/rust/sdk/src/pin.rs#L54">code</a> says 16 * 1024 in an argument that takes kilobytes), which makes it computationally and moderately memory expensive to generate the encryption key used to decrypt the private key. How expensive? Well, on my (not very fast) laptop, that takes less than 0.2 seconds. How many attempts to I need to crack the PIN? Twitter's chosen to fix that to 4 digits, so a maximum of 10,000. You aren't going to need many machines running in parallel to bring this down to a very small amount of time, at which point private keys can, to a first approximation, be extracted at will.</p><p>Juicebox attempts to defend against this by supporting sharding your key over multiple backends, and only requiring a subset of those to recover the original. </p><s>I can't find any evidence that Twitter's does seem to be making use of this,</s><p>Twitter uses three backends and requires data from at least two, but all the backends used are under x.com so are presumably under Twitter's direct control. Trusting the keystore without needing to trust whoever's hosting it requires a trustworthy communications mechanism between the client and the keystore. If the device you're talking to can prove that it's an HSM that implements the attempt limiting protocol and has no other mechanism to export the data, this can be made to work. Signal makes use of something along these lines using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">Intel SGX</a> for contact list and settings storage and recovery, and <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/10/SecurityofPasskeysintheGooglePasswordManager.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102651">Apple</a> also have documentation about how they handle this in ways that make it difficult for them to obtain backed up key material. Twitter has no documentation of this, and as far as I can tell does nothing to prove that the backend is in any way trustworthy. (Edit to add: The Juicebox API does support authenticated communication between the client and the HSM, but that relies on you having some way to prove that the public key you're presented with corresponds to a private key that only exists in the HSM. Twitter gives you the public key whenever you communicate with them, so even if they've implemented this properly you can't prove they haven't made up a new key and MITMed you the next time you retrieve your key)</p><p>On the plus side, Juicebox <em>is</em> written in Rust, so Elon's not 100% wrong. Just mostly wrong.</p><p>But ok, at least you've got viable end-to-end encryption even if someone can put in some (not all that much, really) effort to obtain your private key and render it all pointless? Actually no, since you're still relying on the Twitter server to give you the public key of the other party and there's no out of band mechanism to do that or verify the authenticity of that public key at present. Twitter can simply give you a public key where they control the private key, decrypt the message, and then reencrypt it with the intended recipient's key and pass it on. The <a href="https://help.x.com/en/using-x/encrypted-direct-messages">support page</a> makes it clear that this is a known shortcoming and that it'll be fixed at some point, but they said that about the original encrypted DM support and it never was, so that's probably dependent on whether Elon gets distracted by something else again. And the server knows who and when you're messaging even if they haven't bothered to break your private key, so there's a lot of metadata leakage.</p><p>Signal doesn't have these shortcomings. Use Signal.</p><p>[1] I'll respect their name change once Elon respects his daughter</p><p>[2] There are implementations written in Rust, but Twitter's using the C one with <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium">these</a> JNI bindings </p><p>[3] Or someone nominally trustworthy but who's been compelled to act against your interests - even if Elon were absolutely committed to protecting all his users, his overarching goals for Twitter require him to have legal presence in multiple jurisdictions that are not necessarily above placing employees in physical danger if there's a perception that they could obtain someone's encryption keys</p></div></div>]]></description>

<dd>
<p>Marcus Mendes, in a piece at 9to5Mac with multiple spoilers for next week’s keynote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is working on supporting the ability to export notes in
Markdown from Apple Notes, which is something third-party apps
have supported for years. Granted, this is a niche feature, but as
a fierce participant in the niche, I can confirm: this is huge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this story first started spreading this morning, it was getting repeated as Notes “gaining Markdown support”, which implied something like <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, where you can type Markdown syntax characters while editing, and perhaps optionally see the Markdown syntax in your notes. “Markdown notes app” is really like a class of notes apps unto itself.</p>

<p>Some people find this surprising, but I personally don’t want to use a Markdown notes app. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive_into_markdown">I created Markdown two decades ago</a> and have used it ever since for one thing and one thing only: writing for the web at Daring Fireball. My <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">original description</a> of what it is still stands: “Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.” Perhaps an even better description of Markdown is Matthew Butterick’s, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/quick-tour.html#%28part._.Markdown_mode%29">from the documentation for Pollen</a>: “Markdown is a simplified notation system for HTML.”</p>

<p>The other great use case for Markdown is in a context where you either <em>need</em> or just <em>want</em> to be saving to a plain text file or database field. That’s not what Apple Notes is or should be. I can see why many technically-minded people want to use Markdown “everywhere”. It’s quite gratifying that Markdown has not only become so popular, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown">after 21 years</a>, seemingly continues to grow in popularity, to the point now where there clearly are a lot of people who seemingly enjoy writing in Markdown more than even I do. But I think it would be a huge mistake for Apple to make Apple Notes a “Markdown editor”, even as an option. It’s trivial to create malformed Markdown syntax; it shouldn’t be possible to have a malformed note in Apple Notes. I <em>craft</em> posts for Daring Fireball; I dash off notes in Apple Notes.</p>

<p>Apple Notes offers a great WYSIWYG rich text editing interface that works great on an iPhone and even better on a Mac, which I think is exactly appropriate. Particularly clever are the limited formatting options, where you don’t pick a font per se, but rather only from a set of predefined styles, like headings, lists, and block quote. It’s not nerdy at all. That’s the Macintosh way. (But that’s why I think Apple Notes’s use of hashtags, rather than real tokenized tags <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/tag-files-and-folders-mchlp15236/mac">like in the Finder</a>, was an enormous mistake on Apple’s part. Real tokenized tags can contain spaces (so a multi-word tag can just be “Words Written Naturally” not “#WordsCrammedTogether”) and don’t need to be prefixed with an ugly, nerdy-looking <code>#</code> character. Notes using hashtags is like if the Finder disallowed spaces and uppercase letters in filenames.)</p>

<p>But Markdown <em>export</em> from Notes? That sounds awesome. Frankly, perhaps the biggest problem with Apple Notes is that its export functionality is rather crude — <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/export-or-print-notes-iphdf551cfa2/ios">PDF and, of all formats, Pages</a>. Exporting and/or copying the selected text as Markdown would be pretty cool. Very curious to see how they handle images though, if this rumor is true.</p>

Coming from C, Python, and JavaScript, I never looked back. Two Rust-based startups and 500k lines of Rust later, here are some reflections on the milestone.</p><h2>The early days were painful</h2><p>Version compatibility was poor—both between crates and with the compiler itself. A bug-fix update could force a compiler bump, which in turn dragged in unstable crates like <a href="https://github.com/serde-deprecated/syntex/tree/master" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>syntex</code></a> (<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/02/02/Rust-1.15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once</a> a key <code>serde</code> dependency) and their dependents. In practice we “updated the world” and temporally pinned when a critical bug fix or feature demanded it—early on this was as often as every 6-week compiler release cycle. An awful lot of time was wasted binary-searching for compatible version combinations.</p><p>“Fighting the borrow checker” was real for me. Traits came naturally given background in C++, Java and Objective-C, but lifetimes and the idea of “proofs” that (<a href="https://aturon.github.io/blog/2017/07/08/lifetime-dispatch/#cant-we-just-rule-out-bad-specializations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">*mostly</a>) don’t affect codegen took a while to grok. Patient friends and colleagues made this easier!</p><p>After a couple years of our codebase and team growing, compile times became painful. Large types were a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recurring</a> issue (and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/140944" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still are</a>, occasionally), requiring diagnosis and mitigation. Investments brought it down for us, but iteration cycles still took a hit and rapid prototyping generally required effort to set up.</p><h2>The people were and are exceptional</h2><p>The Rust ecosystem has an impressive amount of programming “taste”, manifesting in dependencies with relatively simple builds, elegant implementations, and fast and robust performance. Reaching for TypeScript or Python is a relative exercise in frustration. There’s a reason Rust has taken the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#admired-and-desired" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“most loved/admired language”</a> title for nine years now!</p><p>“What went right” is an essay in itself, but the evolving cadre of dedicated, opinionated and earnest volunteers, with strong mores around saying “no” and “not yet”, are I think the crux of it.</p><p>I reaped the benefits as an employer. We’ve been fortunate to be one of few Rust opportunities in London, with a pipeline of talented engineers keen to work in their favourite language. That your average Rust programmer is better than your average &lt;most other languages&gt; programmer has been a bonus.</p><h2>Rust has become a safe bet (in some domains)</h2><p>The early days necessitated a lot of <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/388092/what-exactly-is-yak-shaving/388236#388236" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">yak shaving</a>. Omissions in <code>std</code>, for example, led to our evolving a library of workarounds, hacks and extensions: code that simplified or optimised our application code but wasn’t ready or wasn’t justifiable to merge upstream. Over time the rate of additions to it has slowed, and we regularly find ourselves now removing from it. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.extract_if" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Our</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u64.html#method.midpoint" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">custom</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/struct.Builder.html#method.spawn_unchecked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">implementations</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/133125" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">begone</a>! Nowadays being able to rely upon <code>std</code>’s primitives having even relatively <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html#method.rotate_left" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uncommon</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128261" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abstract</a> implementations, and them be well-optimised, is a joy.</p><p>This reliability now extends to much of the Rust experience. Building and upgrading is wildly more predictable, with fewer non-Rust dependencies, ~no surprise compiletime/codegen/inlining blowups, less ecosystem reliance on nightly features and greater respecting of semver. <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018/#non-lexical-lifetimes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inference</a> <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/10/21/Rust-1.56.0/#disjoint-capture-in-closures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">improvements</a> have made the borrow checker friendlier to newcomers. And far fewer ICEs on nightly! We used to see new ICEs or link errors almost weekly, now it’s quarterly at most.</p><p>The crate ecosystem is more predictable too: newer crates like <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>jiff</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>polars</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>tauri</code></a> build on the hard-won lessons of earlier projects, while stalwarts like <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>tokio</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>hyper</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>regex</code></a> have earned robustness through years of heavy production use.</p><p>Ten years ago choosing Rust for production opted you into reinventing wheels and working around known and unknown issues. While still the case for some domains—namely Rust in the browser for us—for general systems and backend engineering that is a thing of the past. Rust empowers us to focus on business logic while producing remarkably fast and robust applications.</p><h2>Rust today feels like what programming should be</h2><p>More than a safe bet, Rust has a degree of programmer empathy that is unprecedented in large software projects: simple and robust builds, the best <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2025/05/16/evolution-of-rustc-errors.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">error messages</a> and linting around, great docs and IDE integration, and strong <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/07/30/optimizing-rust-ci-2023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CI</a> and <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/tests/crater.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regression testing</a>. Rust feels like a passion project, a labour of love by and for programmers.</p><p>10 years ago could we have predicted this? Well, I think some did. Pained by the status quo, some saw the potential of a language, an ecosystem, designed <i>well</i> by people like them. They volunteered their time and made Rust what it is. As Graydon Hoare, one of Rust’s original authors, <a href="https://rustfoundation.org/media/10-years-of-stable-rust-an-infrastructure-story/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Rust today is the result of significant investments made by forward-looking institutions and the efforts of thousands of individuals who shared a belief in the long-term payoff of what they were building.</p></blockquote><p>I bet my time and (my investors’) money on Rust 10 years ago because I believed in this payoff. The enthusiasm was infections, the potential palpable, and smart minds were converging. I’m so glad that has only grown, and so grateful to <a href="https://github.com/topics/rust" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everyone</a> who’s <a href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/all-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contributed</a> to it.</p><h2>What I’m looking forward to over the next 10 years</h2><h3>Simpler and faster builds</h3><p>With growing engineering and testing bandwidth we can continue to replace battle-tested but complex or slow dependencies with simpler and faster ones. I’ve directly or indirectly benefitted from this with <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/17/enabling-rust-lld-on-linux/#benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">linking</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95035#issuecomment-1073966631" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">locks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73441" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backtraces</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35437" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">platform-optimised routines</a>, <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/rustls-server-perf/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TLS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3790" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTTP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11813" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">git</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/15417" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">compression</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37817" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">building</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">switching</a> toolchains, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9992" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">build automation</a>. A few I’m particularly looking forward to gaining more attention are a <a href="https://github.com/sunfishcode/eyra" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pure-Rust</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-cargo-std-aware" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">less special</a> <code>std</code>, reduced reliance on system <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/140525" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">linkers</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#link-self-contained" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">libs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ctz/graviola" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pure-Rust crypto</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/cberner/redb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">durable BTreeMap</a>, and a Rust <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">game engine</a>. The latter not for me to use but because game devs bring some of the most <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lcsek8/any_thoughts_on_panic_unreachable_unchecked/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aggressive optimisation</a> I’ve seen and I’d love to benefit from it.</p><hr data-tably-img="fwAoAAAAaHR0cHM6Ly90YWJseS5jb20vc3RhdGljL2xwbkFraUxJRGl1LnBuZwEmCYQC"><p><a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?query=How%20to%20speed%20up%20the%20Rust%20compiler" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Significant expertise and effort</a> is going into performance work. In the last few months Tably saw a 60% compile time improvement across frontend and backend. Many of the biggest wins have come from meta changes that aren’t visible on this chart, including <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/45320#issuecomment-337957101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ThinLTO and backend parallelism</a>, <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/09/08/incremental/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incremental</a>, <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/evaluating-pipelined-rustc-compilation/10199" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">metadata pipelining</a>, <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">front-end parallelism</a>. Meta changes that might bear further fruit are: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_cranelift" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rust-oriented codegen</a>, incremental <a href="https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">linkers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/127634#issuecomment-2224274508" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dead-code elimination</a>, <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/12/04/trait-system-refactor-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new solver</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10673" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>cargo test</code> caching results</a>.</p><h3>Improved portability and less <code>#[cfg()]</code></h3><p>Testing the power set of valid <code>#[cfg()]</code> options, targets and features on CI is generally prohibitive. This creates untested code paths and potential compile failures, alongside annoyances like fragmented and incomplete documentation, impaired IDE functionality and <code>unused_imports</code> warnings.</p><p>A <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1868-portability-lint.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lint</a> was proposed to mitigate this. A mooted better approach is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41619#issuecomment-2056902943" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moving <code>#[cfg()]</code> into the trait system</a> (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lkgoyk/comment/gnjufff/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cc</a>) with bounds like <code>where Platform: Unix</code> and <code>where Platform: Avx2</code>. With this the compiler naturally guarantees compilation under all supported options, targets and features. Specializing items with OS-specific or architecture-specific implementations can be done via, appropriately, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialization</a>. Metadata can be shared between dev/test/release, different feature combination and different platform builds, resulting in less recompilation, faster CI, and bringing a crates.io MIR <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5hav0q/towards_a_worldwide_precompiled_crate_cache_for/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cache</a> closer to reality.</p><h3>Everything being <code>const</code></h3><p>Constant evaluation reduces dependence on macros and build scripts, and brings forward run-time work and panics to compile-time. Currently we only scratch the surface of this as only a small subset of Rust code is supported (no traits, no allocation), and that which is supported runs <a href="https://docs.rs/hex-literal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">too slowly</a> for nontrivial use cases.</p><p>Assuming portability all code can be evaluated during compilation (<a href="https://docs.rs/crabtime/latest/crabtime/#-one-shot-evaluation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cc</a>). Unportable code like FFI or assembly without a generic fallback is getting less common. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/const-eval/issues/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Various</a> effects-inspired attempts to enable ubiquitous <code>const</code> have been <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67792" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/110395" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reverted</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3762" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attempted again</a>. I hope we dodge this extra language complexity with the simple assumption that “everything can be executed in a <code>const</code> context”. There are <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/const-eval/issues/20#issuecomment-464124376" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tricky</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/522" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issues</a> to overcome but the language simplicity will be worth it.</p><h3>Simpler concurrency</h3><p><code>async</code> has a relatively high complexity cost for us due to the <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio-util/0.7.15/tokio_util/task/struct.LocalPoolHandle.html#method.spawn_pinned" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>'static</code> bound</a> (<a href="https://maciej.codes/2022-06-09-local-async.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cc</a>), <a href="https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency/async-pitfalls/cancellation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancellation-safety</a>, and <a href="https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency/async-pitfalls/async-traits.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restrictions</a> relating to <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits/#is-it-okay-to-use-async-fn-in-traits-what-are-the-limitations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traits</a> and <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits/#dynamic-dispatch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>dyn</code></a>.

Bifurcation between <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sync</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/prelude/stream/trait.StreamExt.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">async</a> primitives and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2109#issuecomment-608413396" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ecosystem</a> <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/1529#issuecomment-2149262072" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">idiosyncrasies</a> further increase <a href="https://eta.st/2021/03/08/async-rust-2.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://trouble.mataroa.blog/blog/asyncawait-is-real-and-can-hurt-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">async</a> <a href="https://bitbashing.io/async-rust.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tax</a>. <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/extending-rusts-effect-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Effects-inspired</a> solutions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/119y8ex/comment/j9pt1h3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seem unpromising</a>.</p><p>Pre-1.0 Rust had a solution: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29791031/what-happened-to-libgreen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>libgreen</code></a>. It achieved concurrency in user-space without this bifurcation, but at <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0230-remove-runtime.md#the-problems" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">significant performance, portability and maintenance cost</a> and so was <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/18967" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed</a>. With increased engineering bandwidth this may be worth revisiting. Again the language simplicity would be worth it. (One day I’ll create a PoC of zero-cost wrapping of <code>std::{fs, net}</code> plus <code>fiber::{spawn, select}</code> using <a href="https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/generator-rs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>generator</code></a>!)</p><h3>Excelling in more domains</h3><p>Rust in the browser feels under-explored: we bump into issues that suggest there <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/2388" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aren’t</a> <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/2392" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/2598" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">others</a> <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/3899" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">using</a> <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/3801" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it</a> <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/3687#issuecomment-1806486879" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seriously</a>. Table stakes like <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/3687" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">avoiding UB</a> and getting stack traces <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/9968" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cross-browser</a> took our time and effort. <a href="https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>leptos</code></a>—the web framework behind this site—has come a long way (much like our previous choice <a href="https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>sycamore</code></a>), yet rough edges remain.</p><p>Some domains like rapid prototyping and <a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/is-rust-a-good-fit-for-business-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">business logic</a> may remain outside of Rust’s reach due to deliberate design decisions that trade off iteration speed. For most domains though I think it’s a matter of time. Adoption hurdles remain for GUIs, machine learning, and <a href="https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">game development</a> due to entrenched ecosystems, high switching costs, cultural inertia, and established tooling. But those barriers aren’t permanent. Rust continues to mature and steadily break into these domains, thanks to relentless community efforts and innovation.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Looking forward the trajectory is clear and exciting. The positive feedback loop of adoption boosting engineering and testing bandwidth, which then fuels further adoption, is accelerating. The upcoming decade promises further refinement, faster compile times, broader domain adoption, and an increasingly seamless developer experience. At Tably, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with Rust, excited to witness—and contribute to—the language’s next chapter.

We’ve been fortunate to be one of few Rust opportunities in London, with a pipeline of talented engineers keen to work in their favourite language. That your average Rust programmer is better than your average &lt;most other languages&gt; programmer has been a bonus.<br></p><h2><span></span><span></span>Rust has become a safe bet (in some domains)<br></h2><p><span></span><span></span>The early days necessitated a lot of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/388092/what-exactly-is-yak-shaving/388236#388236">yak shaving</a>. Omissions in <code>std</code>, for example, led to our evolving a library of workarounds, hacks and extensions: code that simplified or optimised our application code but wasn’t ready or wasn’t justifiable to merge upstream. Over time the rate of additions to it has slowed, and we regularly find ourselves now removing from it. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.extract_if">Our</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u64.html#method.midpoint">custom</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/struct.Builder.html#method.spawn_unchecked">implementations</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/133125">begone</a>! Nowadays being able to rely upon <code>std</code>’s primitives having even relatively <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html#method.rotate_left">uncommon</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128261">abstract</a> implementations, and them be well-optimised, is a joy.<br></p><p><span></span><span></span>This reliability now extends to much of the Rust experience. Building and upgrading is wildly more predictable, with fewer non-Rust dependencies, ~no surprise compiletime/codegen/inlining blowups, less ecosystem reliance on nightly features and greater respecting of semver. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018/#non-lexical-lifetimes">Inference</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/10/21/Rust-1.56.0/#disjoint-capture-in-closures">improvements</a> have made the borrow checker friendlier to newcomers. And far fewer ICEs on nightly! We used to see new ICEs or link errors almost weekly, now it’s quarterly at most.<br></p><p><span></span><span></span>The crate ecosystem is more predictable too: newer crates like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff"><code>jiff</code></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars"><code>polars</code></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri"><code>tauri</code></a> build on the hard-won lessons of earlier projects, while stalwarts like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio"><code>tokio</code></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper"><code>hyper</code></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex"><code>regex</code></a> have earned robustness through years of heavy production use.<br></p><p><span></span><span></span>Ten years ago choosing Rust for production opted you into reinventing wheels and working around known and unknown issues. While still the case for some domains—namely Rust in the browser for us—for general systems and backend engineering that is a thing of the past. Rust empowers us to focus on business logic while producing remarkably fast and robust applications.<br></p><h2><span></span><span></span>Rust today feels like what programming should be<br></h2><p><span></span><span></span>More than a safe bet, Rust has a degree of programmer empathy that is unprecedented in large software projects: simple and robust builds, the best <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2025/05/16/evolution-of-rustc-errors.html">error messages</a> and linting around, great docs and IDE integration, and strong <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/07/30/optimizing-rust-ci-2023.html">CI</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/tests/crater.html">regression testing</a>. Rust feels like a passion project, a labour of love by and for programmers.<br></p><p><span></span><span></span>10 years ago could we have predicted this? Well, I think some did. Pained by the status quo, some saw the potential of a language, an ecosystem, designed <i>well</i> by people like them. They volunteered their time and made Rust what it is. As Graydon Hoare, one of Rust’s original authors, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rustfoundation.org/media/10-years-of-stable-rust-an-infrastructure-story/">puts it</a>:<br></p><blockquote><p>Rust today is the result of significant investments made by forward-looking institutions and the efforts of thousands of individuals who shared a belief in the long-term payoff of what they were building.<br></p><span></span><span></span></blockquote><p><span></span><span></span>I bet my time and (my investors’) money on Rust 10 years ago because I believed in this payoff. The enthusiasm was infections, the potential palpable, and smart minds were converging.

You also can’t combine affine transformation matrices together to create this shape.</figcaption></figure></div><p>How can we approximate the transform? Here are some ideas I mulled over that could achieve a good result:</p><ul><li><p>Redraw the image with the distortion. This is potentially expensive and means that we can’t use SVGs as the images without converting them to bitmaps. It also means that things might look “fuzzy”</p></li><li><p>Ray trace everything! By projecting a ray to compute each pixel for the image, I could get a very conventional 3d renderer. This doesn’t achieve my goal of lightweight SVGs though</p></li><li><p>Subdivide the image and project each subdivision in the most locally-correct affine transformation. Use projected polygon clip paths to cut off the edges of regions.</p></li></ul><p>I was really curious how the last bullet point could work, and I could think of no other ideas that didn’t require rasterization. So with OpenAI O3’s help I implemented it into the vanilla Typescript 3D renderer. To test it, we’re going to project a checkerboard pattern onto a cube.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

These bodies are faint and not directly observed, but their existence is inferred from observations of long-period comets (LPCs; J. H. Oort <a href="#apjadbf9bbib28" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib28">1950</a>). The so-called new LPCs, which are observed during their first perihelion passage through the inner solar system, often have the semimajor axes between 20,000 and 100,000 au.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn1">5</a></sup>
 They are thought to have relatively recently evolved, due to the effects of the Galactic tide (J. Heisler &amp; S. Tremaine <a href="#apjadbf9bbib13" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib13">1986</a>; Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs3">3</a> here), onto high-eccentricity/low-perihelion orbits. The new LPCs have a nearly isotropic distribution of orbital inclinations, suggesting that the outer Oort cloud at <em>r</em> &gt; 10,000 au is roughly spherical (see L. Dones et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib7" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib7">2015</a> for a review).</p><p>Oort cloud formation dates back to early stages of the solar system some 4.6 Gyr ago (M. Duncan et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib9" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib9">1987</a>; L. Dones et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib8" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib8">2004</a>; D. Vokrouhlický et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>). First, as the outer planets cleared their orbital neighborhood, small bodies were scattered onto very eccentric orbits with perihelion distances <em>q</em> ≲ 30 au and semimajor axes <em>a</em> ≳ 1​​​​​000 au (orbital eccentricities <em>e</em> ≳ 0.97). Second, the Galactic tide raised the perihelion distances of these bodies, effectively decoupling them from planetary perturbations, and tilted their orbits. Third, encounters of the Sun with stars in the Galactic neighborhood thoroughly mixed the orbits in the outer Oort cloud, producing a relatively homogeneous and isotropic source for LPCs.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn2">6</a></sup>

</p><p>Dynamical simulations reveal formation of the inner Oort cloud at 1000 &lt; <em>r</em> &lt; 10,000 au (M. Duncan et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib9" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib9">1987</a>; H. F. Levison et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib21" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib21">2001</a>; D. Vokrouhlický et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>).<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn3">7</a></sup>
 The inner Oort cloud forms in much the same way as the outer Oort cloud, except that the timescale on which the Galactic tide changes orbits at 1000 &lt; <em>r</em> &lt; 10,000 au is long, comparable to the age of the solar system. This explains why the inner Oort cloud is not a dominant source of LPCs (D. Vokrouhlický et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>): bodies from this region evolve too slowly and are ejected by planets before they can reach <em>q</em> ≲ 3 au, heat up, and become active comets (J. G. Hills <a href="#apjadbf9bbib16" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib16">1981</a>, but see N. A. Kaib &amp; T. Quinn <a href="#apjadbf9bbib17" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib17">2009</a>).<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn4">8</a></sup>
 In addition, the orbits with 1​​​​000 &lt; <em>a</em> &lt; 10,000 au, which are more strongly bound to the Sun, are less affected by stellar encounters. The inner Oort cloud is therefore often portrayed as a relatively flat disk, roughly aligned with the ecliptic (H. F. Levison et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib21" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib21">2001</a>), that retained memory of its initial conditions (e.g., M. Fouchard et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib10" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib10">2018</a>).</p><p>In the inner Oort cloud at 1​​​​000 &lt; <em>r</em> &lt; 10,000 au, structures in the spatial distribution of bodies can form and "freeze" over timescales comparable to the age of the solar system. This raises the question of how the inner Oort cloud would look to a distant observer and/or whether there are any diagnostic features that would facilitate its detection. Here we show that the inner Oort cloud is a slightly warped disk, roughly 15,000 au across, inclined <em>i</em> ∼ 30° to the ecliptic (nearly polar in the Galactic reference system; Galactic inclination <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> ∼ 90°). The disk, when viewed from a distance, would appear as a spiral structure with two twisted arms. The spiral structure was first identified by examining the simulation in the Hayden Planetarium in preparation for a new space show that describes and visualizes the Oort cloud.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn5">9</a></sup>
 In Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs2">2</a>, we discuss the results of dynamical simulations—described in the <a href="#apjadbf9bapp1">Appendix</a>—to illustrate the inner Oort cloud structure. The analytic model of S. Breiter &amp; R. Ratajczak (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib5" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib5">2005</a>; also see A. Higuchi et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib15" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib15">2007</a>) is employed to interpret these results (Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs3">3</a>).

To show things clearly, here we isolated the inner Oort cloud from the more spherical outer Oort cloud by plotting bodies, 34,000 in total, with <em>a</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;5000 au. If the outer Oort cloud were plotted in the figure, it would appear as a large, roughly spherical envelope of the spiral.

Nesvorný et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib27" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib27">2017</a>, <a href="#apjadbf9bbib23" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib23">2023</a>; D. Vokrouhlický et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>). The spiral is long-lived: it emerges in the first hundreds of megayears after the formation of the solar system and persists over billions of years. The same spiral structure appears in simulations with different sequences of stellar encounters, indicating that the spiral is not related to stellar encounters. Instead, as we establish below, the spiral is a consequence of the Galactic tide. To simulate the Galactic tide, the Galaxy simulation in D. Nesvorný et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib23" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib23">2023</a>) adopted the mass density of 0.15 <em>M</em><sub>Sun</sub> pc<sup>−3</sup> in the solar neighborhood. By comparing the results of simulations with different mass densities, we found that the spiral becomes smaller (larger) for higher (lower) stellar densities in the solar neighborhood. This suggests a direct involvement of the Galactic tide.</p><p>We studied formation of the Oort spiral by inspecting orbital histories of bodies contributing to the spiral. They were first scattered to 1000 &lt; <em>a</em> &lt; 10,000 au by migrating planets (Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn). The scattered orbits had relatively low orbital inclinations with respect to the ecliptic (<em>i</em> ≲ 30°), low perihelion distances (<em>q</em> ≲ 30 au), and high eccentricities (<em>e</em> ≳ 0.97). The initial nodal longitude and initial perihelion argument of orbits in the ecliptic frame were chosen to be uniformly random. Consequently, the population of scattered bodies initially appeared as a relatively thin disk near the ecliptic, and this—when looked at by an observer in the ecliptic node<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn6">10</a></sup>
—formed the main axis of the Oort spiral in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a>.</p><p>The Galactic tide is important for orbits with <em>a </em>&gt; 1000 au.

Kozai <a href="#apjadbf9bbib19" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib19">1962</a>; we discuss the Kozai cycles in detail in Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs3">3</a>). The Kozai cycles produce anticorrelated oscillations of <em>e</em> and <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> that are accompanied by a slow evolution of perihelion argument <em>ω</em><sub>G</sub> (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf2">2</a>). The fate of an orbit then depends on the initial value of <em>ω</em><sub>G</sub>. If 0° &lt; <em>ω</em><sub>G</sub> &lt; 90° or 180° &lt; <em>ω</em><sub>G</sub> &lt; 270°, the orbital eccentricity increases, the perihelion distance drops, and the body tends to be scattered by planets away from the 1​​​​000 &lt; <em>a</em> &lt; 10,000 au region (often to interstellar space).</p><figure xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="apjadbf9bf2" tabindex="-1" role="group" data-toolbar-type="figure" data-toolbar-link="apjadbf9bf2" data-toolbar-img="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bf2_lr.jpg" data-toolbar-title="Figure 2."><figure><div><p><img alt="Figure 2.

These orbits can be stable over long timescales. They stay in the inner Oort cloud and continue to evolve by Kozai cycles. As <em>e</em> decreases in a Kozai cycle, <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> increases from the initial value of <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> ∼ 60°, and the orbit becomes nearly polar in the Galactic frame. This is when the orbital changes due to Galactic tide become exceedingly slow and orbits freeze (Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs3">3</a>). This explains the twisted arms of the Oort spiral in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a> that reach away from the ecliptic plane toward the Galactic poles.</p><p>The ascending node of the ecliptic on the Galactic plane is located near the Galactic longitude <em>l</em> = 186° (and, by definition, at the Galactic latitude <em>b</em> = 0). In the Galaxy simulation, we observe that orbits in the inner Oort cloud (1000 &lt; <em>a</em> &lt; 10,000 au) start with the nodal longitude Ω<sub>G</sub> ≃ 186°. Subsequently, if <em>ω</em><sub>G</sub> has the right value (see above) and the orbit decouples from planetary perturbations, Ω<sub>G</sub> slowly rotates in the retrograde sense (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>). Thus, over time, orbits move away from the ecliptic plane, and their initially nearly perfect alignment is (slightly) smeared. The observer looking at the structure along the ecliptic node will then not see the disk exactly edge on, which is the situation shown in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a>. For example, for <em>a</em> ∼ 3000 au, the characteristic rotation of Ω<sub>G</sub> over 4.6 Gyr is broadly centered at ∼30° (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>).</p><figure xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="apjadbf9bf3" tabindex="-1" role="group" data-toolbar-type="figure" data-toolbar-link="apjadbf9bf3" data-toolbar-img="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bf3_lr.jpg" data-toolbar-title="Figure 3."><figure><div><p><img alt="Figure 3.

At the same time, as <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> of the orbit increases (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf5">5</a>), the orbit becomes nearly polar and practically freezes (red dots in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf5">5</a>). This is a consequence of Equation (<a href="#apjadbf9beqn2">2</a>), where <em>C</em> → 0 when <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> → 90°, and the orbit evolution becomes exceedingly slow. Two examples of this are shown in Figure 3 in A. Higuchi et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib15" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib15">2007</a>). The analytic model therefore explains why orbits in the Oort spiral often have <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> = 75°–90° (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>). The slow retrograde circulation of Ω<sub>G</sub> that starts near Ω<sub>G</sub> = 186° and stalls when <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> ≃ 90° complements the picture. It explains why orbits in the inner Oort cloud often have Ω<sub>G</sub> = 120°–180° (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>).<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn8">12</a></sup>

We infer that the orbit of 541132 Leleākūhonua must have had a more complex history than simple planet scattering plus Kozai cycles. This is because 541132 Leleākūhonua does not have nearly as polar an orbit in the Galactic frame as the bulk of inner Oort cloud objects in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>. M. Saillenfest et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib31" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib31">2019</a>) already showed that objects with <em>a</em> ∼ 1000 au are in a transition region where the effects of Galactic and planetary potentials combine to produce dynamical chaos.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn9">13</a></sup>

</p><p>It may have been scattered away from the ecliptic such that the initial inclination was <em>i</em><sub>G</sub> &lt; 50°. The Kozai cycles would then plausibly produce the current orbit by decreasing <em>e</em> and increasing <em>i</em><sub>G</sub>. Complicating factors include the effects of stellar encounters, stellar cluster, and the possible planet 9 (S. S. Sheppard et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib32" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib32">2019</a>). In any case, the Oort spiral is mainly contributed by bodies with large perihelion distances and <em>a</em> &gt; 2000 au. The telescopic observations would therefore need to detect objects on even more extreme orbits than 541132 Leleākūhonua, and obtain sufficient statistics for these bodies, to be able to piece together their spatial distribution. This task will have to wait for the next generation of telescopic surveys (e.g., the Vera C.

					</a></span></figcaption></figure></figure><p>Detecting thermal emission from small dust particles in the inner Oort cloud is similarly difficult. For shorter wavelengths, <em>λ</em> ≲ 100 <em>μ</em>m, the large-scale thermal emission is dominated by the zodiacal light (e.g., D. Nesvorný et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib24" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib24">2010</a>; Planck Collaboration et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib29" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib29">2014</a>). For longer wavelengths, <em>λ</em> ≳ 500 <em>μ</em>m, the thermal emission is dominated by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Galactic sources (e.g., Planck Collaboration et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib30" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib30">2020</a>). The CMB shows an anomalous quadrupole term that is somewhat smaller than the expectations from the best-fit cosmological model (D. N. Spergel et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib33" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib33">2003</a>; Planck Collaboration et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib30" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib30">2020</a>). The quadrupole moment expected from the inner Oort cloud emission has nearly the opposite orientation on the sky (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf7">7</a>) to that of the CMB quadrupole and would therefore—at least in principle—act to decrease the CMB quadrupole. In practice, however, we estimate that the amplitude of the inner Oort quadrupole should be some 3 orders below that of the CMB quadrupole (∼10 Jy sr<sup>−1</sup> for Oort versus​​​​​ ∼10 kJy sr<sup>−1</sup> for CMB at frequencies <em>ν</em> ∼ 160 GHz) and therefore negligible.<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn10">14</a></sup>

</p><p>The best chances to detect thermal emission from the inner Oort cloud are near wavelengths ∼300–400 <em>μ</em>m (E. J. Baxter et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib1" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib1">2018</a>). This is where the spectral radiance of both the zodiacal and CMB emissions is reduced by a factor of ≳10<sup>3</sup> from their peak values. The small particles in the inner Oort cloud, ∼10–100 <em>μ</em>m, would have temperatures <em>T</em> ∼ 10 K and efficiently emit at these wavelengths. To isolate this component from the zodiacal cloud, one would have to search for an anomalous quadrupole signature corresponding to a distribution that is not completely smooth in the ecliptic longitude and peaks near the expected directions (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf7">7</a>). To separate it from the CMB, one would have to demonstrate that the amplitude of the CMB quadrupole moment decreases—relative to lower and higher multipole moments—for these intermediate wavelengths.</p><p>The high-frequency instrument on board the Planck satellite observed at 857 GHz, which translates to <em>λ</em> ≃ 350 <em>μ</em>m. A careful analysis of these observations could perhaps unveil some interesting features. But even here the prospects of the inner Oort cloud detection are feeble. A complication arises because the thermal signal from the inner Oort particles scales with 1/<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> and temperature <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bieqn13.gif" alt="$T\simeq 280/\sqrt{r}$"></span></span></span>. Thus, even though these particles spend more time near aphelion, where they contribute to the Oort spiral, they are much more easily detectable when they approach the terrestrial observer during their perihelion passage. This creates a strong bias in detectability of particles with small perihelion distances; these particles have high eccentricities and a different distribution on the sky than the one shown in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf7">7</a>. Unfortunately, we do not have enough statistics in the Galaxy simulation to accurately predict the expected signature from this population.</p><p>Finally, we briefly comment on E. J. Baxter et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib1" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib1">2018</a>), who used the high-frequency Planck detector (545 and 857 GHz) to search for signatures of exo-Oort clouds around nearby (hot) stars. They found several candidates but pointed out that the rate of false positives in these observations is expected to be relatively high. They argued that future CMB surveys and targeted observations with far-infrared and millimeter wavelength telescopes have the potential to detect exo-Oort clouds or other extended sources of thermal emission beyond ∼1000 au from the parent stars. Here we point out that resolving a spiral-like signature such as the one shown in Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a> or Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf9">9</a> would potentially represent more definitive evidence for the existence of the (inner) exo-Oort cloud around a nearby star. For the exo-Oort spiral to form, there needs to be a planetary system capable of ejecting small bodies to ∼1000–10,000 au from its host star, and the orbital plane of the ejected bodies needs to be significantly inclined to the Galactic plane for the Kozai cycles to happen.</p><figure xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="apjadbf9bf9" tabindex="-1" role="group" data-toolbar-type="figure" data-toolbar-link="apjadbf9bf9" data-toolbar-img="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0004-637X/983/1/74/revision1/apjadbf9bf9_lr.jpg" data-toolbar-title="Figure 9."><figure><div><p><img alt="Figure 9.

					</a></span></figcaption></figure></figure></div><div data-mobile-collapse=""><p>We used numerical simulations and analytical methods to demonstrate that the inner Oort cloud is a warped disk with a spiral structure roughly 15,000 au in length (Figures <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf1">1</a> and <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf9">9</a>). The spiral forms when small bodies are scattered by planets to 1000–10,000 au and orbitally evolve by the Galactic tide. At 1000–10,000 au, where the dynamical timescales are comparable to the age of the solar system, the Galactic tide acts to (a) raise perihelion distances and decouple bodies from planetary perturbations, (b) rotate orbital planes such that they evolve to become nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane (and Ω<sub>G</sub> = 120°–180°; Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf3">3</a>), and (c) favor long-term stability of orbits with 90° &lt; <em>ω</em><sub>G</sub> &lt; 180° and 270° &lt; <em>ω</em><sub>G</sub> &lt; 360°. Item (b) implies that the inner Oort cloud would look like a disk to a distant observer. Item (c) implies two preferred directions for orbits distributed in the disk. As the preferred directions depend on the period of Kozai oscillations (Section <a href="#apjadbf9bs3">3</a> and A. Higuchi et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib15" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib15">2007</a>), which in turn depends on the semimajor axis, the inner Oort cloud bodies appear to be concentrated in two spiral arms (Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#apjadbf9bf9">9</a>).</p><p>In retrospect, the existence of the Oort cloud spiral could have been inferred from Figure 3 in M. Fouchard et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib10" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib10">2018</a>), where the nonuniformity of orbital angles corresponds to the spiral structure reported here. The structure was not present in Figure 1 of M. Fouchard et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib10" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib10">2018</a>), which corresponds to an initially isotropic Oort cloud, showing that the spiral structure is indeed linked to the initial state of the Oort cloud (i.e., orbital scattering of bodies from the outer planet region along the ecliptic). Additionally, M. Fouchard et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib10" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib10">2018</a>, <a href="#apjadbf9bbib11" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib11">2023</a>) identified a related group of LPCs (B3) with properties that would reflect the structure of the inner Oort cloud—the so-called "empty ecliptic" feature; this feature was identified in LPC catalogs (M. Fouchard et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib11" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib11">2023</a>). In this sense, the Oort cloud spiral has (indirectly) been detected.</p><p>Direct observational detection of the Oort spiral is difficult. Either (i) this structure can be pieced together from detection of a large number of objects with <em>a</em> &gt; 1000 au and <em>q</em> &gt; 30 au, or (ii) the thermal emission from small particles in the Oort spiral will be separated from various foreground and background sources. As for (ii), perhaps the best chance is to scrutinize emission at intermediate wavelengths (<em>λ</em> ∼ 100–500 <em>μ</em>m; e.g., Planck's 857 GHz detector) and demonstrate excess emission that is not fully continuous in ecliptic longitude (i.e., not from the zodiacal cloud) and deviates in some significant way from the low-degree multipoles observed at longer wavelengths (i.e., not a CMB quadrupole). Observational detection of Oort spirals around Milky Way stars is similarly challenging (E. J. Baxter et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib1" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib1">2018</a>).</p></div><p>The Galaxy simulation was performed on the NASA Pleiades Supercomputer.

(<a href="#apjadbf9bbib23" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib23">2023</a>). To start with, we disregard their cases with the stellar cluster and focus on the simulation called Galaxy. This simulation included the (1) migration model for the outer planets, (2) effects of planet scattering on disk planetesimals, and (3) Galactic potential and stellar encounters. The model results were calibrated on Dark Energy Survey (DES) detections of objects in the trans-Neptunian region (P. H. Bernardinelli et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib3" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib3">2022</a>). Here is a brief description of these components:</p><p>(1)<em> Migration model.</em> The numerical simulations consisted of tracking the orbits of the four giant planets (Jupiter to Neptune) and a large number of planetesimals. Uranus and Neptune were initially placed inside of their current orbits and were migrated outward. The <tt>swift_rmvs4</tt> code, part of the Swift <em>N</em>-body integration package (H. F. Levison &amp; M. J. Duncan <a href="#apjadbf9bbib22" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib22">1994</a>), was used to follow all orbits. The code was modified to include artificial forces that mimic the radial migration and damping of planetary orbits. The migration history of planets was informed by the best models of planetary migration/instability. Specifically, they adopted the migration model s10/30j from D. Nesvorný et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib26" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib26">2020</a>) that worked well to satisfy many constraints. See that work for a detailed description of the migration parameters (e.g., migration <em>e</em>-fold timescale <em>τ</em> = 10 Myr for <em>t</em> &lt; 10 Myr and instability at <em>t</em> = 10 Myr). The migration model also accounted for the jitter that Neptune's orbit experienced due to close encounters with massive bodies (D. Nesvorný &amp; D. Vokrouhlický <a href="#apjadbf9bbib25" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib25">2016</a>).</p><p>(2)<em> Planetesimal Disk.</em> The simulations included one million disk planetesimals distributed from 4 au to beyond 30 au. Such a high resolution was needed to obtain good statistics for the Oort cloud. The initial surface density of disk planetesimals was assumed to follow the truncated power-law profile from D. Nesvorný et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib26" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib26">2020</a>; also see R. S. Gomes et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib12" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib12">2004</a>). The step in the surface density at 30 au was parameterized by the contrast parameter <em>c</em> ∼ 10<sup>3</sup>, which is simply the ratio of surface densities on either side of 30 au (the planetesimals with initial <em>a</em> &gt; 30 au are not an important source for the Oort cloud). The initial eccentricities and inclinations of orbits were set according to the Rayleigh distribution with scale parameters <em>σ</em><sub><em>e</em></sub> = 0.1 and <em>σ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = 0.05. The disk bodies were assumed to be massless such that their gravity did not interfere with the migration/damping routines.</p><p>(3)<em> Galactic potential and stellar encounters.</em> The Galaxy was assumed to be axisymmetric, and the Sun followed a circular orbit in the Galactic midplane (the Sun's migration in the Galaxy was not included; N. A. Kaib et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib18" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib18">2011</a>). The Galactic tidal acceleration was taken from J. Heisler &amp; S. Tremaine (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib13" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib13">1986</a>; see also P. Wiegert &amp; S. Tremaine <a href="#apjadbf9bbib35" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib35">1999</a>; H. F. Levison et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib21" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib21">2001</a>). The stellar mass density in the solar neighborhood was set to <em>ρ</em><sub>0</sub> = 0.15 <em>M</em><sub>⊙</sub> pc<sup>−3</sup>. The simulations accounted for the effect of stellar encounters. The stellar mass and number density of different stellar species were computed from J. Heisler et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib14" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib14">1987</a>). The stars were released and removed at the heliocentric distance of 1 pc (206,000 au). For each species, the velocity distribution was approximated by the isotropic Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The dynamical effect of passing molecular clouds was ignored.</p><p>(4)<em> Calibration on observations.</em> The Galaxy simulation was run over 4.6 Gyr, at which point the orbital distribution of bodies in the trans-Neptunian region was compared with DES observations (P. H. Bernardinelli et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib3" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib3">2022</a>). DES covered a contiguous 5000 deg<sup>2</sup> of the southern sky between 2013 and 2019, with the majority of the imaged area being at high ecliptic latitudes. The search for outer solar system objects yielded 812 KBOs with well-characterized discovery biases, including over 200 SDOs with <em>a</em> &gt; 50 au. The DES survey simulator<sup><a href="#apjadbf9bfn11">15</a></sup>
 (P. H. Bernardinelli et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib3" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib3">2022</a>) was used to bias the model in the same way as the data. D. Nesvorný et al. (<a href="#apjadbf9bbib23" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib23">2023</a>) made use of DES observations to calibrate the magnitude distribution of trans-Neptunian objects and establish that the dynamical model results were consistent with DES observations. The model fidelity was previously tested from observations of short-period comets (D. Nesvorný et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib27" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib27">2017</a>) and LPCs (D. Vokrouhlický et al. <a href="#apjadbf9bbib34" id="fnref-apjadbf9bbib34">2019</a>).</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

their training set, then they’ll fade into irrelevance anyway. So let’s extend this line of thinking out. If you think (like we probably all do) that your soup du jour is better than the other guy’s, then guess what? Either the LLMs will get “smart” enough to </span><strong>realize it too</strong><span>, or you’ll </span><strong>eat all the vibe coder’s lunch because they never figure it out.</strong></p><p><span>Yes and no. I know there are a lot of people who will hate what I’m about to say. People I respect, and whose opinions I value despite how incorrect they are on this front. “AI” is going to significantly change what it looks like to build software. I’m not worried about how I’m going to stack up against the “</span><strong>Giving into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that code even exists</strong><span>” folks, but I </span><strong>am</strong><span> aware that there are significant new tools &amp; variables at play here. Not factoring them in is how you become a dinosaur. Which, for what it's worth, is fully your prerogative. </span></p><p>With that in mind, if we want our tools to succeed in this space, we need to invest in it as well. Not exclusively, maybe even not significantly. But being relevant here is non-optional IMHO.</p><p><span>I’m the author of an application framework for Elixir called </span><a href="https://ash-hq.org/" rel="">Ash Framework</a><span>. This article is not about Ash, but my work on it and the support that I provide for it have given me some potentially unique insights. Over the last few months I’ve observed:</span></p><ul><li><p>a new item on the rubric for tools: the quality of answers from Claude &amp; ChatGPT about it</p></li><li><p>a huge increase in fully off the wall and weird questions driven by LLM hallucinations</p></li><li><p>methodologies for working with LLM agents that are making me wish *more* of my users used them, not *less*</p></li></ul><p>People are finding that the magic word smusher gives surprisingly good results for things like Typescript &amp; Rust. All of a sudden, they have a new thing to factor in when making their decisions. FOMO is a powerful thing, so I think this plays a bigger factor than we’d like. Folks are worrying even more than ever about the future-proofing of their knowledge in the context of a major industry shift. If I invest my time to learn something that “AI” can’t help me with, will I be left behind? It’s a very real and important question, and I think to succeed these days, you have to alleviate the concern in some way.</p><p>Fairly often these days I get questions about code that no one would ever have had a reason to think should work. These cases are clearly coming from folks asking LLMs how to do something, or using an agentic assistant. The first knee-jerk response here is to tell people that we don’t answer questions about “AI” generated code. And in some cases, if it’s clear that the person asking the question did zero research on their own, they’ll get a response like that. But what if there was another way?</p><p><span>Ultimately you should not be relying on an LLM as a source of “knowledge”. This is true effectively </span><strong>always</strong><span>, even for popular tools, because LLMs won’t “know” about recent changes, but is magnified when asking questions about things that are more esoteric. </span></p><p>The key to succeeding with LLMs is to treat them as if they are only capable of doing things like summarization and pattern transformation.

Think of it as giving your LLM a direct hotline to your running code - not just static documentation, but your actual living application.</p><p>Here's what this looks like in practice. Instead of asking Claude "How do I create a user in this app?" and getting a generic answer that might be outdated, Tidewave lets the LLM use tools like:</p><ul><li><p><code>project_eval</code><span> - runs code snippets directly in your application context</span></p></li><li><p><code>run_sql_query</code><span> - executes database queries using your app's actual schema and tooling</span></p></li><li><p><code>search_hex_docs</code><span> - searches the documentation of your specific package versions</span></p></li></ul><p>This means your agent might do things like search the hex docs of your dependencies to see how Ash works, use the `project_eval` tool to poke around in your running app, try creating a user using your app to see if it works, and then run a SQL query after the fact to make sure the user exists in the database. Wildly powerful stuff.</p><p>This one is easy, and you can try it on your own apps today. Often when you end up building new features, they bear resemblance to one or more of the other things in your application. LLMs are very good at synthesis, summary, and categorization. So put them to work at it! A really excellent prompt to kick off an agent’s task often looks like this:</p><pre><code>I'd like to make a feature to track user activity. Let's start with "last_login_at" and "last_seen_at". To start, we'll need a new plug in our router, kind of like @/path/to/similar/plug.ex, except instead of X it does Y. For the fields, take a look at `last_updated` for an example of the kind of field we want, except this one should be accepted as input when updating a user.</code></pre><p><span>I'm trying to push a new pattern for Elixir packages that I think could be game-changing. The concept is simple: any library can include a </span><code>usage-rules.md</code><span> file - essentially very terse documentation designed specifically for LLM context windows, explaining what to and what not to do when using the library.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png" width="598" height="257.51785714285717" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:627,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:598,&quot;bytes&quot;:64317,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.zachdaniel.dev/i/164927613?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ab20e2c-906b-483c-9c9f-cd7452e8ced4_2080x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We've done this for the main Ash packages, and the transformation is remarkable. We went from LLM agents being practically useless for Ash development to being able to generate idiomatic, production-ready code. The dichotomy of "meet my standards" versus "let the LLM do it" simply disappeared.</p><p>This isn't just about Ash or even Elixir. This is a template for how any technology community can turn LLMs from a threat into their most effective growth tool.</p><p>We can go even further. Instead of just helping LLMs use Elixir better, we can help train them to be better at Elixir in the first place. This is something we discussed at the contributors summit, so it is the product of many minds, not just mine.</p><p>The Elixir community could build evaluation datasets that test real-world scenarios: GenServer supervision trees, OTP fault tolerance patterns, Phoenix LiveView reactivity, writing Ecto queries, building applications with Ash. When companies like Anthropic and OpenAI train their models, they need diverse, high-quality benchmarks - and right now, they're mostly testing on Python and JavaScript.</p><p><span>If we get these evaluations to a degree of quality and scale, we get a bunch of benefits. We can determine which models are the best at writing Elixir. If done well enough, companies like OpenAI and Anthropic may even opt to use it to train their private models (something we should encourage in this scenario). You can find collections of benchmarks in various places, like: </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/" rel="">Hugging Face</a><span> and </span><a href="https://github.com/leobeeson/llm_benchmarks" rel="">GitHub</a><span>. I see plenty of python stuff there, but not no Elixir 🤔.</span></p><p>Here's the kicker: Elixir's runtime makes it perfect for performance-based evals.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/asgeirtj/system_prompts_leaks/blob/main/Anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.txt">Claude 4’s system prompt</a> is <em>very</em> similar to the <a href="https://github.com/asgeirtj/system_prompts_leaks/blob/main/Anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet-w-tools.xml">3.7 prompt</a> we <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/05/07/claude-s-system-prompt-chatbots-are-more-than-just-models.html">analyzed last month</a>. They’re nearly identical, but the changes scattered throughout reveal much about how Anthropic is using system prompts to define their applications (specifically their UX) and how the prompts fit into their development cycle.</p>

<p>Let’s step through the notable changes.</p>

<h3 id="old-hotfixes-are-gone-new-hotfixes-begin">Old Hotfixes Are Gone, New Hotfixes Begin</h3>

<p>We theorized that many random instructions, targeting common LLM “gotchas”, were <em>hot-fixes</em>: short instructions to address undesired behavior prior to a more robust fix. Claude 4.0’s system prompt validates this hypothesis - all the 3.7 hot-fixes have been removed. However, if we prompt Claude with one of the “gotchas” (“How many R’s are in Strawberry?”, for example) it doesn’t fall for the trick. The 3.7 hot-fix behaviors are almost certainly being addressed during 4.0’s post-training, through reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>When the new model is trained to avoid “hackneyed imagery” in its poetry and think step-by-step when counting words or letters, there’s no need for a system prompt fix.</p>

<p>Once 4.0’s training is done, new issues will emerge that must be addressed by the system prompt. For example, here’s a brand new instruction in Sonnet 4.0’s system prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claude never starts its response by saying a question or idea or observation was good, great, fascinating, profound, excellent, or any other positive adjective. It skips the flattery and responds directly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This hot-fix is clearly inspired by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661422/openai-chatgpt-sycophancy-update-what-went-wrong">OpenAI’s ‘sychophant-y’ GPT-4o flub</a>. This misstep occurred about a month ago, too late for the Anthropic team to conduct new training targeting this behavior. So into the system prompt it goes!</p>

<h3 id="search-is-now-encouraged">Search is Now Encouraged</h3>

<p>Way back in 2023, it was common for chatbots to flail about when asked about topics that occurred after its cut-off date. Early adopters learned LLMs are frozen in time, but casual users were frequently tripped up by hallucinations and errors when asking about recent news. Perplexity was exceptional for its ability to replace Google for many users, but today that edge is gone.</p>

<p>In 2025, Search is a first-class component of both ChatGPT and Claude. This system prompt shows Anthropic is leaning in to match OpenAI.</p>

<p>Here’s how Claude 3.7 was instructed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claude answers from its own extensive knowledge first for most queries. When a query MIGHT benefit from search but it is not extremely obvious, simply OFFER to search instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old Claude asked users for permission to search. New Claude doesn’t hesitate. Here’s the updated instruction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claude answers from its own extensive knowledge first for stable information. For time-sensitive topics or when users explicitly need current information, search immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This language is updated throughout the prompt. Search is no longer done only with user approval, it’s encouraged on the first shot if necessary.</p>

<p>This change suggests two changes. First, Anthropic is perhaps more confident in its search tool and how its models employ it. Not only is Claude encouraged to search, but the company has broken out this feature into <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search-api">a dedicated search API</a>. Two, Anthropic is observing users increasingly turning to Claude for search tasks. If I had to guess, it’s the latter of these that’s the main driver for this change, and a strong sign that chatbots are increasingly stealing searches from Google.</p>

<h3 id="users-want-more-types-of-structured-documents">Users Want More Types of Structured Documents</h3>

<p>Here’s another example of system prompts reflecting the user behaviors Anthropic is observing. In a bulleted list detailing when to use <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them">Claude artifacts</a> (the separate window outside the thread Claude populates with longer form content), Anthropic adds a bit of nuance to a use case.</p>

<p>From Claude 3.7’s system prompt, “You must use artifacts for:”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Structured documents with multiple sections that would benefit from dedicated formatting”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Claude 4.0’s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Structured content that users will reference, save, or follow (such as meal plans, workout routines, schedules, study guides, or any organized information meant to be used as a reference).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great example of how Anthropic uses system prompts to evolve its chatbot behavior based on observed usage. System prompts are <em>programming</em> how Claude works, albeit in natural language.</p>

<h3 id="anthropic-is-dealing-with-context-issues">Anthropic Is Dealing With Context Issues</h3>

<p>There are a few changes in the prompt that suggest context limit issues are starting to hit users, especially those using Claude for programming:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For code artifacts: Use concise variable names (e.g., <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> for indices, <code>e</code> for event, <code>el</code> for element) to maximize content within context limits while maintaining readability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone with strong opinions about clearly defined variables, this makes me cringe, but I get it. The only disappointment I noticed around the Claude 4 launch was its context limit: only 200,000 tokens compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro’s and ChatGPT 4.1’s 1 million limit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ksw3w2/claude_4_and_still_200k_context_size/">People were disappointed</a></p>

<p>Anthropic could be limiting context limits for efficiency reasons (while leaning on their excellent <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/token-saving-updates">token caching</a>) or may just be unable to deliver the results Google and ChatGPT are achieving. However, there have been several recent explorations showing model performance isn’t consistent across longer and longer context lengths. Here’s a plot from a team at DataBricks, <a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/long-context-rag-performance-llms">from research published last August</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dbreunig.com/img/context_length_performance.png" alt="For many models, performance declines as you use more of the context window."></p>

<p>I’ve been in situations where less scrupulous competitors focused on publishing headline figures, even if it led to worse results (for example in the geospatial world, many will tout the total count of all the elements in their dataset, even if many have very low confidence). I’m inclined to believe a bit of that is occurring here, in the hypercompetitive, benchmark-driven AI marketplace.</p>

<p>Either way: I think we’ll see all coding tools build in shortcuts like these to conserve context. Shorter function names, less verbose comments… it’s all on the table.</p>

<h3 id="cybercrime-is-a-new-guardrail">Cybercrime is a New Guardrail</h3>

<p>Claude 3.7 was instructed to not help you build bioweapons or nuclear bombs. Claude 4.0 adds malicious code to this list of no’s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claude steers away from malicious or harmful use cases for cyber. Claude refuses to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code Claude MUST refuse. If the code seems malicious, Claude refuses to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code). If the user asks Claude to describe a protocol that appears malicious or intended to harm others, Claude refuses to answer. If Claude encounters any of the above or any other malicious use, Claude does not take any actions and refuses the request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understandably, that’s a lot of caveats and conditions. It must be delicate work to refuse this sort of aid while not interfering with general coding assistance.</p>

<hr>

<p>Reviewing the changes above (and honestly, that’s the bulk of them from 3.7 to 4.0), we get a sense for how system prompts program chatbot applications. When we think about the design of chatbots, we think about the tools and UI that surround and wrap the bare LLM. But in reality, the bulk of the UX is defined here, in the system prompt.</p>

<p>And we get a sense of the development cycle for Claude: a classic user-driven process, where observed behaviors are understood and then addressed. First with system prompt hot-fixes, then with post-training when building the next model.</p>

<p>The ~23,000 tokens in the system prompt – taking up over 11% of the available context window –&nbsp;define the terms and tools that make up Claude, and reveal the priorities at Anthropic.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Sparks flew, a wing bent, and the landing gear snapped off as the silver Lockheed Electra 10-E plane smashed into the runway at Luke Field, outside Honolulu. The pilot’s only stroke of luck was that the aircraft, which contained nearly a thousand gallons of fuel, didn’t explode.</p><p>The thirty-nine-year-old Amelia Earhart and her crew of two navigators, Fred Noonan and Harry Manning, crawled out of the wreckage, unsettled but otherwise unhurt. They had meant to depart on the second leg of a gruelling voyage: a round-the-world flight that had begun in Oakland, California, and would continue westward, with two dozen or so stops, before ending up back in Oakland. People close to Earhart knew that she wasn’t fully ready for a challenge of this magnitude, and so a work-around had been devised. An extra crew member with extensive flight experience, Paul Mantz, had joined the flight to Hawaii. On the runway in Oakland, he switched places with Earhart and assumed the throttles during takeoff. She then piloted most of the way to Oahu, but Mantz often took over.</p><p>As they approached Luke Field, Mantz sensed that Earhart had “pilot fatigue.” He asked her, “Do you want to land it?”</p><p>“No, you land it,” Earhart said.</p><p>He did so, then said farewell. Earhart had been able to observe Mantz’s handling of the plane over the Pacific, and from now on she would be the only pilot onboard. Flying the Electra solo wouldn’t be easy. Although the plane had state-of-the-art technology for its time, piloting it demanded constant coördination among the throttle, the rudder, and the control column—especially during takeoff and landing. While taking off on the second leg, Earhart ignored advice that Mantz had given her not to “jockey the throttles”—change the speed to maintain direction and balance—and the plane veered into a violent spin across the runway. The press had assembled to watch Earhart soar, and instead witnessed an embarrassment.</p><p>The stakes were huge. Men had been flying around the world since 1924, when a team of eight military officers completed a twenty-seven-thousand-mile journey in a hundred and seventy-five days (with seventy-four stops). Only one pilot had done a solo circumnavigation: a Texan named Wiley Post. In 1933, Post completed a fifteen-thousand-mile journey, traversing Germany, the Soviet Union, Alaska, and Canada. Four years later, a round-the-world flight remained daunting. Earhart planned to have human navigators on board with her, but she’d be the first female pilot to accomplish the feat.</p><p>Earhart had become instantly famous in 1928, as the first woman to cross the Atlantic in a plane. But, though she’d been photographed wearing a flight suit and a leather helmet, she was merely a passenger; the plane had actually been piloted by two men, Wilmer Stultz and Louis Gordon. She had since been working on establishing her command of the cockpit. There were plenty of accomplished female pilots who could’ve taken command of a transatlantic flight themselves, and some of these women considered Earhart’s notoriety unearned. In 1932, after logging more flight miles—but not as many as other top female pilots—she flew solo across the Atlantic in a cramped red Vega, a single-engine plane barely insulated against storms and cold temperatures. She fought exhaustion, iced wings, and a broken altimeter. Her intention was to land in Paris, but she ended up in a cow field in Ireland. Earhart approached the experience with an easy, almost reckless, confidence. She’d always been this way; as a girl growing up in the Kansas City area, she jury-rigged a “roller coaster” with steep ramps, then barrelled down it and fell off, only to exult, “This is just like flying!”</p><p>A globe-circling flight would be Earhart’s lengthiest journey by far, twenty-nine thousand miles hugging the equator. This wasn’t mere hopping among landmasses, as with Post’s route. Her path had been ambitiously charted to include a refuelling stop on Howland Island, a speck between Hawaii and Australia. A pilot making such a journey needed to be in excellent shape, with sufficient strength and stamina to manage the controls in turbulence, particularly during long hours in a cockpit with no autopilot. The dangers were extraordinary: enormous stretches over open ocean, unpredictable weather, extended isolation, intense psychological pressure. Yet the rewards promised to be substantial, from marketing opportunities to media attention. NBC and CBS were fighting over the rights to exclusive broadcasts.</p><p>Noonan and Manning had agreed to accompany Earhart nearly the whole way. They were excited to be associated with her glamour, but they also considered the job a risk. Rather than spending time practicing in the powerful Electra, Earhart had been crisscrossing the country, giving lectures, making sponsorship appearances, and attending promotional events. For a while, she had a gig as the aviation editor at <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, in which she published a column about flying; she also launched a line of pilot-inspired women’s clothing. Seen from today’s perspective, Earhart was at once a pioneering aviator and a proto-influencer. Her goal, in both roles, was to keep topping herself—and to keep the public captivated.</p><p>After the crash in Hawaii, Earhart faced reporters with a brittle smile, promising that she would mount another circumnavigation soon. Her husband of half a dozen years, George Palmer Putnam—six feet of restless energy in a tailored suit—publicly blamed a blown tire, skirting any mention of pilot error. An heir to the Putnam publishing empire, he was more than Earhart’s husband; he was her manager, dealmaker, and publicist. Some found him dashing, but others thought of him as a hustler. He’d launched Earhart into fame with that Atlantic crossing in 1928—arranging the flight entirely with the intention of publishing a quickie memoir from Earhart about the stunt. (The book, “20 Hrs. 40 Min.,” was allegedly ghostwritten; Earhart wrote to a friend, “I should like to have made it better but time was short and I done as good as I could.”) He’d chosen her over other female aviators in no small part because of her gamine beauty—and he soon began pursuing her romantically, even though he was married.</p><p>Every stage of her round-the-world attempt was being overseen by Putnam, all coördinated to maximize publicity. He had once been an executive at his family’s publishing house, focussing on memoirs of adventure and exploration, but he’d left after a merger, and as the Great Depression dragged on Earhart’s fame became one of the couple’s few reliable assets. Her paid appearances kept them afloat, and Putnam feverishly worked to line up side deals, including film rights. A Christmas-season release date for another memoir was already pencilled in. Putnam’s career had been bumpy, but he repeatedly succeeded in giving Earhart’s exploits a romantic aura—one that has lingered to this day.</p><p>The wrecked Electra had to be shipped back to California for costly repairs. Putnam fretted: <em>Who will pay for the damage</em>? <em>Can we afford a second attempt</em>? Other difficulties had arisen well before the Hawaii crash. Putnam asked Bradford Washburn, a skilled explorer, mapper, and pilot, to accompany Earhart. (When Putnam was at his family’s publishing house, he’d worked with a teen-age Washburn as one of the authors on a series about boy explorers.) Putnam invited him to their estate in Rye, New York, and Earhart showed him her planned route on a world map, highlighting how the westward leg from Hawaii to New Guinea necessitated the refuelling stop at Howland Island. Washburn pronounced it a dangerous folly. When he asked about her navigational plan, Earhart responded, “Dead reckoning”—estimating a plane’s position based on speed, time, and direction from a known point. Washburn was appalled. “I didn’t feel that she had anywhere nearly adequate equipment and preparation for a long overseas hop to Howland Island,” he later reflected. Earhart, however, was certain that she’d hit her tiny target with the gear already on board. Washburn said that she should at least place a radio on the island which would allow the Electra to home in on its position. Putnam dismissively told Washburn, “If you go to all that trouble, the book will not be out for Christmas sales.” As Washburn recalled it, “G.P. was just as confident in Earhart and her judgment as A.E. was herself, and this made a very difficult combination to argue with.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22131&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22131" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by Jason Adam Katzenstein</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Earhart and Putnam stopped trying to win Washburn over. They soon announced that Harry Manning—a marine officer who’d become a national hero after saving the crew of a sinking Italian vessel—would be Earhart’s navigator. Although Manning had a pilot’s license and knew Morse code well, some of Earhart’s friends doubted that he had the experience required for a round-the-world flight. Manning brushed off the skepticism, but after the humiliating crash in Hawaii he grew uneasy—not just about becoming an object of mockery but about risking his life.</p><p>From Honolulu, Earhart and her crew booked berths on a ship headed to California. By the time they disembarked, Manning had made it clear to Earhart that he was quitting. As always, Earhart and Putnam were undeterred. Fred Noonan—who’d been hired, shortly before the first attempt, to handle Pacific navigation—was still up for a second attempt. A lanky six-footer with auburn hair, Noonan was a Pan Am veteran who’d helped pioneer transpacific routes. His capability as a navigator was beyond question. But so was his fondness for drinking.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In an off-the-record exchange, Earhart told James Bassett, Jr., the Los Angeles <em>Times’</em> aviation editor, that she’d seen Noonan inebriated, and that she didn’t trust him. But Putnam had apparently insisted on using Noonan; for one thing, he was an inexpensive hire. Noonan, Bassett later recalled, had sworn to Earhart that he’d remain sober during the trip. But the danger was obvious.</p><p>When Manning learned that Earhart was planning a second attempt with just Noonan, he was deeply concerned. In his view, they were both dangerously casual about radio discipline: Earhart had never bothered to master Morse code, and Noonan relied heavily on celestial navigation. Together, they preferred voice communication, even though ships in the Pacific depended on continuous wave transmissions, which could travel farther and cut through static. In an interview, Earhart acknowledged, “Both Fred Noonan and I know Morse code but we’re rank amateurs and probably never would be able to send and receive more than 10 words a minute.” In a life-or-death emergency, voice signals might fade or be unintelligible; Morse code could punch through static and bad weather.</p><p>Earhart was content to stick with voice communication, though. It was just easier.</p><p>Earhart knew that Putnam would be frustrated by the wasted expenditures and the repair bills caused by her crashing the Electra. She told a friend, “I’ve just got to get away for a couple of days by myself, before it drives me crazy.” Upon returning to California, she fled to a tranquil desert ranch near Palm Springs owned by close friends: Jacqueline Cochran, a fiery aviator, and her husband, Floyd Odlum, a financial titan known as the Wizard of Wall Street.</p><p>Cochran had bluntly warned Earhart against attempting a round-the-world voyage that included Howland Island. “You just don’t have sufficient navigation communication,” she said. “I don’t think you’ll ever hit it.” But Earhart wouldn’t abandon the idea. Cochran and Odlum adored her, and they had financially supported her flying career. Their feelings toward Putnam, however, were less charitable. “We didn’t like or dislike him at the start,” Odlum later said. “But we came to dislike him because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we thought he was taking advantage of Amelia.” He added, “She was his meal ticket.”</p><p>Some top female aviators also had their doubts about Earhart’s latest project. Elinor Smith, who had been flying since she was a child and who, at sixteen, became the youngest licensed pilot in the U.S., felt that Earhart was courageous and determined. But in 1929, in New Castle, Delaware, Smith had an eye-opening experience with her during an evaluation flight of a plane designed by the aircraft manufacturer Giuseppe Bellanca. A Bellanca test pilot, George Haldeman, handled takeoff, with Earhart in the co-pilot seat and Smith observing from the rear. At about a thousand feet, Earhart took over, and the plane immediately began lurching and wobbling. Embarrassed, she signalled for Haldeman to take over. “She knew the basics, I guess, but she didn’t have that much practice,” Smith recalled in a memoir. “As sure as God is my judge, she could not keep her nose on the horizon.”</p><p>In Smith’s view, Putnam was a grifter who kept pushing Earhart’s celebrity ahead of her skills. Getting her into a Bellanca cockpit before she was ready, Smith thought, was typical of his approach: “Knowing full well she was too inexperienced to fly it, he would simply sideline the plane in a hangar until the day when she could. He would meanwhile line up backing for a future flight.”</p><p>In March, 1929, in the lead-up to the Powder Puff Derby—a headline-making race from Santa Monica to Cleveland in which Earhart finished third—the <em>Times</em> reported that Earhart had earned a transport license, the highest civilian aviation rating issued by the government. Just a few American women held one at the time. But stamps on the license go back only as far as 1930. It’s not clear why the <em>Times</em> reported otherwise, but Putnam was known to feed stories to the papers.</p><p>Such airbrushing probably seemed harmless, even apt, for a rogue like Earhart. To become aviators, women had to aggressively scramble for resources, whereas men could receive pilot training in the military. Yet Putnam sometimes tried to push Earhart’s career forward with unscrupulous methods. Smith’s memoir recounts that, before the derby, Putnam offered her a peculiar job: “What would you think of a guaranteed seventy-five-dollar weekly income for a two-year period—as a starting figure, that is? You would be Amelia’s pilot and mechanic during the derby.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You would do all the difficult cross-country flying—A.E. is not physically sturdy, you know—but of course, she must appear to be doing it. When pictures are taken at various stopovers, you will see to it that you stand to her left, so her name will always come first in the captions. You will, of course, do no writing or public speaking for another two years at least. It’s all spelled out in this contract.” Smith refused the offer.</p><p>The ruse, Smith suggested in her memoir, was employed successfully on at least one occasion. At an airfield on Long Island, the press celebrated Earhart’s “perfect landing” of a single-engine Fokker Universal plane. But Earhart had actually stepped out of the <em>rear</em> of the aircraft, and a man whom Putnam had identified to the press as her mechanic could be seen sitting in the cockpit. Nobody, Smith wrote, had bothered to question how Earhart “had disembarked perfectly coiffed, immaculate from head to toe, and wearing a dress in a plane that couldn’t be flown in one!”</p><p>Earhart needed thousands of dollars to repair the Electra. In New York, she met with Harry Bruno, an aviation publicist who had worked for Charles Lindbergh, whose piloting feats in the Spirit of St. Louis had made him an international hero. Bruno agreed to help her raise funds. At his behest, Admiral Richard Byrd contributed fifteen hundred dollars, repaying a kindness from 1928, when Earhart had directed her earnings from Lucky Strike cigarette ads to support his expedition to Antarctica; the financier Bernard Baruch added another twenty-five hundred dollars. Earhart and Putnam scraped together enough cash to repair the Electra within two months. They also revised her flight plan: this time, Earhart would launch from Miami and head east, from Puerto Rico to Brazil to West Africa and onward. This would allow her to pass through India before the height of the summer monsoon season.</p><p>Throughout the spring, Earhart and Putnam crisscrossed the country for more appearances and meetings. Quaker Oats executives promised Earhart that, after she’d completed the flight, they would give her five thousand dollars to star in a series of ads as the brand’s “World Reporter.” Meanwhile, Putnam secured a book contract with Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. for Earhart’s next memoir, to be titled “World Flight.” The text would be based on in-transit dispatches that she would wire to Putnam. A deal was also struck with Gimbels department store to sell “commemorative covers”—decorated envelopes bearing buyers’ home addresses that would be packed into the Electra’s nose and postmarked at stops along the route, as proof that Earhart was completing her itinerary.</p><p>In May, 1937, while Putnam was working to keep his wife in the spotlight, the Hindenburg exploded at an airfield in New Jersey, killing thirty-six people. Earhart’s aerial exploits no longer seemed headline-worthy. Putnam, desperate for funds, mortgaged a house that he and his first wife had owned in Rye. To save costs, modifications recommended for the Electra after the Hawaii crash—stronger radios, better direction-finding gear, upgrades to the emergency equipment—were scaled back or scrapped.</p><p>In mid-May, the Electra, housed at Lockheed’s Burbank facility, was deemed ready to fly again. Within days, Earhart took off for Miami from Burbank’s Union Air Terminal, with Putnam, Noonan, and her mechanic, Ruckins (Bo) McKneely, Jr. C. B. Allen, of the New York <em>Herald Tribune,</em> was dispatched to Florida, having been tipped off by Putnam about the imminent start of Earhart’s second attempt to circumnavigate the Earth.</p><figure><p><span>Earhart, in a hangar in California, with the Lockheed Electra 10-E plane that she piloted in her two round-the-world attempts.</span><span>Photograph by Bettmann / Getty</span></p></figure><p>Paul Mantz, who’d remained Earhart’s technical adviser, was at an aviation competition in St. Louis, oblivious to her latest plans. Earhart and Putnam had decided to move ahead without informing him. When Mantz eventually heard the news, he was livid.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>On the way from Burbank to Miami, Earhart made a refuelling stop in Tucson. But one of her plane’s engines caught fire, which occasioned an unplanned overnight stay (and the purchase of a new fire extinguisher). The next day, she dodged a sandstorm in El Paso and arrived in New Orleans, where she reconnected with the pilot Edna Gardner, who ran the New Orleans Air College. That night, Gardner, Earhart, Putnam, and Noonan went out to dinner. Gardner, never a fan of Putnam, found herself cringing throughout the evening. “He was so domineering and so pushy,” she later said. Earhart mentioned something about the plane’s radio, and Putnam snapped, “You had a chance to change. It’s too late now.” When Earhart looked downcast, he said, “Stop your snivelling!” Gardner subsequently recalled, “I wondered if she wouldn’t relish being off and away on the greatest adventure of her life.” She also said, “We all loved her and disliked seeing what he was doing to her.”</p><p>At the same time, Gardner worried that continuing the flight was dangerous. She calculated that, without better preparation and equipment, Earhart had slim odds of survival.</p><p>After a night in New Orleans, the Electra headed to Miami. Noonan guided them into the municipal airport, but Earhart’s landing was rough and bumpy, and it was witnessed by Jane Wood, a Miami <em>Herald</em> reporter. Wood gasped, but Earhart climbed out of the cockpit laughing. “I certainly smacked it down hard that time,” she joked, dusting herself off.</p><p>Earhart confirmed to Wood that she was going to try again to circumnavigate the Earth, though she didn’t specify when. “Just what of scientific value do you expect to get out of your trip?” Wood asked.</p><p>“Not much,” Earhart said. “I am going for the trip. I am going for fun. Can you think of any better reason?”</p><p>Earhart was more candid with Allen, of the <em>Herald Tribune</em>. “I’m getting old and want to make way for the younger generation before I’m feeble,” she said. “I have a feeling that there is just one more good flight left in my system, and I’m hoping this trip is it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As far as I know, I’ve only got one obsession—a small and probably typical feminine fear of growing old—so I won’t feel completely cheated if I fail to come back.” Allen, recognizing the news value of these words, wanted to publish a story about the interview, but Earhart asked him to hold off until after the journey.</p><p>Meanwhile, Allen did some investigative reporting, running through equipment checklists from Earhart’s California-Hawaii flight to see how carefully the Electra had been refurbished since the crash. He noticed a glaring omission: the Electra’s marine-frequency radio, which would help the plane send out a distress call to ships, had been removed. He asked Earhart for comment, and she shrugged it off. “Dead weight,” she said. She reminded him that she and Noonan barely knew Morse code. Better to leave the device behind.</p><p>Hangar space was secured for the Electra. Before the big takeoff, Putnam needed to sort out some logistics and publicity operations. He and Earhart didn’t want to reveal the plan yet, and she stuck to the script. She fibbed to the Miami <em>Daily News</em>, “We’re just out on a shakedown trip”—a practice flight.</p><p>Earhart, Putnam, and her crew stayed at the Columbus Hotel, overlooking Biscayne Bay. Putnam was thrilled that the Miami papers were hailing their arrival and speculating about what was next. Even better, Earhart was added to the guest list of a gala honoring the aviators Dick Merrill and Jack Lambie. There, she ran into her old friend Phoebe Omlie, a trailblazer who’d won the light-aircraft crown at the 1929 Women’s Air Derby. Earhart soon told her that she was about to make another world-flight attempt. Like Gardner, Omlie was skeptical. She asked about the Pacific leg and expressed concern about the risks. Earhart assured her that all contingencies had been considered.</p><p>Meanwhile, Putnam asked Bo McKneely, the mechanic, to join Earhart and Noonan for the round-the-world flight. McKneely seriously considered the offer—Putnam promised to arrange everything, fast—but his father had a heart condition, and the thought of being unreachable for weeks weighed too heavily on him. His decision to stay behind, he later said, haunted him for the rest of his life.</p><p>Putnam, for his part, expressed nothing but optimism about the journey. “We are going to make enough money out of this flight to buy a little place in California,” he told an assistant. “Then we’re going to settle down and enjoy life together. I’m going to write some books.” During the Florida interlude, Putnam noticed that Earhart had developed an obsession with eating pompano, a local fish. He and the crew began referring to her as Madame Pompano.</p><p>One of Putnam’s two sons from his first marriage, David, was living in Florida, and he came to Miami to wish his stepmother luck. The day before the first leg of the second attempt, Earhart scribbled a letter to her mother on hotel stationery: “Hope to take off tomorrow <em>a.m</em>. to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Here is three hundred bucks.”</p><p>The next day, McKneely was at the hangar before dawn, soldering a part that had broken off inside the Electra. Years later, he recalled the tension of that morning—Lockheed officials were reportedly whispering about weight and balance, and about the eleven hundred and fifty-one gallons of fuel sloshing in the plane’s tanks, each gallon weighing six pounds. The Electra was so heavy that just getting it aloft would be no simple feat.</p><p>Noonan squeezed uncomfortably inside the fuselage, wedged amid fuel tanks and gear. At 5:40 <em>a.m.</em>, Earhart was ready to go. Putnam later recalled seeing her off in the hangar: “There in the dim chill we perched briefly on cold concrete steps, and the feel of her hands in mine told more than the words we did not speak could have told.” The Electra’s twin engines roared, and Earhart taxied toward departure. McKneely chased after the plane with several fire extinguishers, in case of another runway accident.</p><p>The Electra lifted into the air. Putnam watched his wife soar until the plane disappeared among the clouds.</p><p>At thirty-five hundred feet, the Electra settled into its first real rhythm. Earhart and Noonan, now alone, cruised at about a hundred and fifty miles per hour.</p><p>Seven hours and thirty-four minutes later, they touched down at Isla Grande Airport, in San Juan. Waiting for them was Clara Livingston, an old friend of Earhart’s who was also an accomplished pilot—she’d been one of the first women to fly a helicopter. Livingston now ran a grapefruit-and-coconut plantation on the island. She escorted Earhart and Noonan to the property and let them rest undisturbed, shielding them even from Putnam’s calls.</p><p>That night, Putnam called to speak with his wife. Livingston said that she was sleeping, and would wake her only if the matter was urgent. Putnam was irritated, but Livingston didn’t particularly care; like many in Earhart’s circle, she found him obnoxious.</p><p>From San Juan, Earhart and Noonan traced the northeastern curve of South America, flying more than six hundred miles to Caripito, Venezuela. It was Earhart’s first real view of the jungle—from the air—and she was transfixed. They landed amid oil tanks and refuelled at a Standard Oil hangar. Executives served her and Noonan steak, grape juice, and fruitcake.</p><p>By June 3rd, Earhart and Noonan had reached Paramaribo, the capital of Dutch Guiana (now Suriname). Earhart gawked at markets where soft-shelled-turtle eggs were sold alongside string beans. She jotted impressions in a notebook. Especially intriguing to her were the Saramaka people, the descendants of enslaved Africans who had fought for, and won, their freedom.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24242&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24242" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“I see you got on well with the radiologist.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Paul Noth</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Next came a nine-hour flight to Fortaleza, Brazil. Crossing the equator, Earhart was spellbound by the sprawling Amazon River below. The airport, situated outside the city, was antiquated, but their hotel, the Excelsior, was all Art Deco glamour and gleaming chandeliers. Earhart and Noonan had a laugh when they learned that the hotel had assigned them to one room. (They slept separately.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>From Fortaleza, they made a shorter flight to Natal, Brazil, a picturesque coastal city. Ahead of them loomed their most ambitious stretch yet: a nineteen-hundred–mile leap across the South Atlantic to Senegal. The leg would take twelve hours over open water—a brutal endurance test. The engine was thunderous, and to communicate Earhart relayed notes to Noonan that she attached to a bamboo fishing pole.</p><p>Over the Atlantic, they battled winds and rain for hours. Eventually, as they neared Africa, the weather broke. They touched down in Saint-Louis, Senegal—more than a hundred miles northeast of their intended target, Dakar. In Saint-Louis, Earhart attended a reception at the governorgeneral’s mansion, then wired some impressions back to Putnam, who commissioned a colorful column that appeared in the <em>Herald Tribune</em>. (“I explained that I had only slacks and shirts in which to meet kings and beggars.”)</p><p>Readers were rooting for Earhart back home. “All day I have been thinking of Amelia Earhart somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean and hoping she will make her flight safely,” Eleanor Roosevelt wrote in her syndicated column. “She is one of the most fascinating people I know, because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she never seems to think that any of the things she does require any courage.”</p><p>Earhart and Noonan now had to traverse Africa, on far less established routes. They followed a section of the Niger River, flew a thousand miles across the Sahara, and, after spotting a herd of hippos below them, landed in what is now N’Djamena, the capital of Chad. On June 14th, after a five-hundred-mile flight from El Fasher, Sudan, to Khartoum, Earhart wrote, “It is really very hot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but the nights have been genuinely comfortable. Twice I have been able to sleep out under the stars. I should like to make this a habit.”</p><p>After arriving in Assab, Eritrea, Earhart did something unprecedented: she flew nearly eighteen hundred miles to Karachi (then part of British India, now in Pakistan). It was the first time that anyone had flown non-stop from the Red Sea to India. Putnam proudly pointed out the milestone to Earhart over the phone. “I’ll cable tomorrow an estimate of when we should get to Howland,” she told him breezily. “Goodbye! See you in Oakland!”</p><p>In Karachi, Earhart sent along more light dispatches, including a story about a morning camel ride, which his office polished up for the <em>Herald Tribune</em>. “I climbed into the saddle and swung between his two humps,” the article noted. “It was a startling takeoff as we rose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Camels should have shock absorbers.”</p><p>From Karachi, Earhart sent Putnam a private letter, tender in its simplicity: “I wish you were here. So many things you would enjoy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps someday we can fly together to some of the remote places of the world—just for fun.” They no longer had the passion of a secret liaison, but she admired his mind and appreciated his championing of her career. Their partnership was equally personal and professional.</p><p>Around the time of the Electra’s flight around the Arabian coast, rumors were swirling of a romance between Earhart and Noonan, and of a plane crash. Noonan wrote his wife a reassuring letter: “We have had no trouble whatsoever. Earhart is a grand person for such a trip.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She can take hardship as well as a man—and work like one.”</p><p>During this period, Putnam gave a jovial interview to a reporter from the London <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. He described the Electra’s cockpit, which was crammed with more than a hundred instruments, and shared details about his wife’s piloting habits. She had an alarm clock that she used to monitor fuel tanks, and kept emergency rations in case of a crash landing. “She lives on tomato juice,” he revealed. “She carries cans in which she knocks a hole, and then inserts a straw.”</p><p>The next leg of the flight took Earhart and Noonan some thirteen hundred miles across India. Navigating by following the spiderweb of railway lines below, they had a tense moment when a cluster of black eagles came dangerously close to their propellers. Their flight path skirted Agra, the location of the Taj Mahal, and Earhart felt a little remiss, joking, “It would be like a European sightseer dropping in on Buffalo and not viewing Niagara Falls.”</p><p>As they crossed the Thar Desert on the way to Calcutta, strong southerly winds whipped sand into blinding waves. “A great barren stretch,” Earhart called it, in a dispatch. “The ridges grew into mountains and poked their dark backs like sharks through a yellow sea.”</p><p>They spent a night in Calcutta, and Noonan got extremely drunk at a bar. Earhart placed a call to Putnam, who was entertaining some guests at the Hotel Seymour, in Manhattan. She said that her faith in Noonan was faltering. Putnam, alarmed, urged her to call off the entire attempt, but she wouldn’t hear of it. There was only one real “bad hop” left.</p><p>On June 18th, Earhart and Noonan lifted off from Calcutta’s Dum Dum Airport, even though certain equipment issues, such as a nonfunctioning radio direction finder, hadn’t been fixed. On the plane’s way to a refuelling stop in Akyab, Burma (now Sittwe, Myanmar), farmers waved at them from rice fields. The eastward hops continued, among them Rangoon, Bangkok, and Singapore. After landing in a part of the Dutch East Indies that is now Indonesia, Earhart got dysentery—a dangerous infection in an era before antibiotics. A photograph taken at the time shows Earhart smiling, but she was drained and frail, and could barely eat.</p><p>By the time Earhart and Noonan had reached Port Darwin, Australia, a few days later, she still felt unwell. Nevertheless, she maintained a calm front. She politely asked for a bath before meeting the press. At the Victoria Hotel, she enjoyed a ritzy meal, telling a reporter, “We eat very little while in the air, but we make up for it at landing places.”</p><p>An official at Port Darwin’s airport, Stan Rose, inspected the Electra and determined that a blown fuse had rendered the radio direction finder inoperable. Without it, Earhart had no way of establishing real-time contact with ships or stations below—and no reliable way to fix her position over the open ocean. When Rose pressed her about this, she sheepishly admitted that the device had been dead since she and Noonan left the Americas. Rose was startled by how little Earhart and Noonan understood about basic equipment maintenance. He gave her some spare fuses and taught her how to replace them. He also offered her some special assistance for her next leg: after she took off, he would give her “back bearings”—radioed directional readings—every fifteen minutes, to help her keep course. Earhart gratefully accepted. Rose ended up offering her precise bearings for an hour, until the Electra flew out of range.</p><p>Earhart and Noonan touched down in Lae, New Guinea, on June 29, 1937. Crouched between the mountains and the sea, Lae was an infernally hot gold-mining outpost. Locals gathered at the grass airstrip to welcome them as the gleaming Electra rolled to a stop.</p><p>Earhart was sleep-deprived, and she was worn thin from the still persistent dysentery and the long stretches without meals. Wire images showed her face to be bloated and pale, and her frame looked almost skeletal. Earhart and Noonan’s accommodations were the nicest Lae could offer: the Hotel Cecil. That night, Noonan caroused at the hotel bar with James Collopy, the district superintendent of the civil-aviation board. Eric Chater, Guinea Airways’ handsome general manager, had invited Earhart to dinner, and Noonan, several Scotches in, groused to Collopy that the “skinny bitch” hadn’t invited him along.</p><p>After Collopy helped Noonan stagger back to his hotel room, Noonan toppled into the mosquito netting around his bed and crashed to the floor. Earhart, in a neighboring room, barked through the walls, “Is that you, Fred?” When Collopy answered instead, she wasn’t amused. It didn’t sound like they would be departing the next day, as they’d planned.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This proved correct. Some minor repairs were needed on the Electra, and Earhart—now concerned about her navigator’s sobriety—delayed departure by a day. She sent a terse cable to Putnam: “Radio misunderstanding and personnel unfitness. Probably will hold one day.”</p><p>The next day, Earhart, determined to keep Noonan occupied (and sober), borrowed a truck, and they drove out to a village, Butibum, where they encountered pigs that had been trained as watchdogs. That night, a local official and postal workers stamped some of the thousands of commemorative covers crammed into the Electra’s nose. Earhart’s flight remained at heart a money-making venture.</p><p>On July 1st, Earhart oversaw final preparations at the airstrip. Mechanics tuned the Electra and filled it with eleven hundred gallons of gasoline and sixty-four gallons of oil. Earhart off-loaded “unessential” items, to reduce weight. Some essential items, however, were left behind. The smoke bombs meant to facilitate a sea rescue? Noonan had apparently left them under his hotel bed.</p><p>Earhart, perhaps feeling some anxiety, asked Chater, the Guinea Airways head, to let Harry Balfour, the company’s radio operator, come along with her to Hawaii. Chater said that he couldn’t spare Balfour.</p><p>Earhart reflected, “Not much more than a month ago I was on the other shore of the Pacific, looking westward. This evening, I looked eastward over the Pacific. In those fast-moving days which have intervened, the whole width of the world has passed behind us—except this broad ocean. I shall be glad when we have the hazards of its navigation behind us.” In newsreel footage at the Lae airfield, Earhart looks collected but serious. Noonan, clean-shaven and steady on his feet, gives a smile to the camera.</p><p>At 10 <em>a.m.</em>, the overburdened Electra roared down the grass strip. For a terrifying second, it seemed to disappear over a bluff at the end of the runway—but then it reappeared, skimming the ocean waves and bouncing lightly until it ascended into the sky.</p><p>Balfour, listening for Earhart’s radio communications from the ground, marvelled at her nerve. The plane was at least five thousand pounds over its normal gross weight, but Earhart had coaxed the Electra into the air with her usual casual daring. For all the messy planning and makeshift repairs, she was a woman who had always won a bet when it really mattered.</p><p>Earhart radioed Balfour. She was heading east with heavy clouds ahead. “Goodbye, Lae,” she said. “I’m turning over to night frequency.”</p><p>Roughly twenty hours after the Electra took off, it went down somewhere in the Pacific. The location is still unknown. The ocean has kept its secret.&nbsp;♦</p><p><em>This is drawn from “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Aviator-Showman-Earhart-Marriage-American/dp/0593295900" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Aviator-Showman-Earhart-Marriage-American/dp/0593295900&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Aviator-Showman-Earhart-Marriage-American/dp/0593295900" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Aviator and the Showman</a>.”</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

                Beating human pilots
            </h3>
        



            
        



            



        
    

    




        
        

    <p>For the first time, a drone has beaten human pilots in an international drone racing competition, marking a new milestone in the development of artificial intelligence. On Saturday April 14, 2025, two drone racing events took place simultaneously: The Falcon Cup Finals for human pilots and the A2RL Drone Championship for AI-powered, autonomous drones. As a climax, the best AI drones also competed against the best human pilots. The AI drone developed by TU Delft first won the A2RL Grand Challenge. It then went on to win the knockout tournament against human pilots, beating three former DCL world champions and reaching flight speeds up to 95.8 km/h on the very winding track.</p>
<p>The team of scientists and students from TU Delft achieved this by developing an efficient and robust AI system, capable of split-second, high-performance control. Whereas earlier breakthroughs, like AI defeating world champions at chess or Go, have taken place in virtual settings, this achievement happened in the real world. Two years ago, the Robotics and Perception Group at the University of Zürich was the first to beat human drone racing champions with an autonomous drone. However, that impressive achievement occurred in a flight lab environment, where conditions, hardware, and the track were still controlled by the researchers – a very different situation from this world championship, where the hardware and track were fully designed and managed by the competition organisers.</p>

    <p>The goal of the 2025 A2RL Drone Championship in Abu Dhabi was to push the frontier of physical AI, by stimulating research on robotic AI under extreme time pressure and with very limited computational and sensory resources. The drone had access to just one forward-looking camera, a major difference from previous autonomous drone races. This is more similar to how human FPV pilots fly, and leads to additional perception challenges for the AI.</p>
<p>The AI that won against the three former DCL world champions was developed by a team of scientists and students from the MAVLab at TU Delft’s Faculty of Aerospace Engineering. Team lead Christophe De Wagter is both exhausted and exhilarated.</p>

                AI that directly commands the motors

    <p>One of the core new elements of the drone’s AI is the use of a deep neural network that doesn’t send control commands to a traditional human controller, but directly to the motors. These networks were originally developed by the Advanced Concepts Team at the European Space Agency (ESA) under the name of “Guidance and Control Nets”. Traditional, human-engineered algorithms for optimal control were computationally so expensive that they would never be able to run onboard resource-constrained systems such as drones or satellites. ESA found that deep neural networks were able to mimick the outcomes of traditional algorithms, while requiring orders of magnitude less processing time. As it was hard to test whether the networks would perform well on real hardware in space, a collaboration was formed with the MAVLab at TU Delft.</p>
<p>“We now train the deep neural networks with reinforcement learning, a form of learning by trial and error. ”, says Christophe De Wagter. “This allows the drone to more closely approach the physical limits of the system. To get there, though, we had to redesign not only the training procedure for the control, but also how we can learn about the drone’s dynamics from its own onboard sensory data.”</p>

    <p>The highly efficient AI developed for robust perception and optimal control are not only vital to autonomous racing drones but will extend to other robots. Christophe De Wagter: “Robot AI is limited by the required computational and energy resources. Autonomous drone racing is an ideal test case for developing and demonstrating highly-efficient, robust AI. Flying drones faster will be important for many economic and societal applications, ranging from delivering blood samples and defibrillators in time to finding people in natural disaster scenarios. Moreover, we can use the developed methods to strive not for optimal time but for other criteria such as optimal energy or safety. This will have an impact on many other applications, from vacuum robots to self-driving cars”.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure></figure><p>In the spring and summer of 2008, when <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> was still a registered Democrat, an anonymous blogger known as Mencius Moldbug posted a serial manifesto under the heading “An Open Letter to Open-Minded Progressives.” Written with the sneering disaffection of an ex-believer, the hundred-and-twenty-thousand-word letter argued that egalitarianism, far from improving the world, was actually responsible for most of its ills. That his bien-pensant readers thought otherwise, Moldbug contended, was due to the influence of the media and the academy, which worked together, however unwittingly, to perpetuate a left-liberal consensus. To this nefarious alliance he gave the name the Cathedral. Moldbug called for nothing less than its destruction and a total “reboot” of the social order. He proposed “the liquidation of democracy, the Constitution, and the rule of law,” and the eventual transfer of power to a C.E.O.-in-chief (someone like Steve Jobs or Marc Andreessen, he suggested), who would transform the government into “a heavily-armed, ultra-profitable corporation.” This new regime would sell off public schools, destroy universities, abolish the press, and imprison “decivilized populations.” It would also fire civil servants en masse (a policy Moldbug later called <em>RAGE</em>—Retire All Government Employees) and discontinue international relations, including “security guarantees, foreign aid, and mass immigration.”</p><p>Moldbug acknowledged that his vision depended on the sanity of his chief executive: “Clearly, if he or she turns out to be Hitler or Stalin, we have just recreated Nazism or Stalinism.” Yet he dismissed the failures of twentieth-century dictators, whom he saw as too reliant on popular support. For Moldbug, any system that sought legitimacy in the passions of the mob was doomed to instability. Though critics labelled him a techno-fascist, he preferred to call himself a royalist or a Jacobite—a nod to partisans of James II and his descendants, who, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, opposed Britain’s parliamentary system and upheld the divine right of kings. Never mind the French Revolution, the bête noire of reactionary thinkers: Moldbug believed that the English and American Revolutions had gone too far.</p><p>If Moldbug’s “Open Letter” showed little affection for the masses, it intimated that they might still have a use. “Communism was not overthrown by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/fifty-years-later-andrei-sakharovs-most-famous-essay-is-a-powerful-model-of-writing-for-social-change">Andrei Sakharov</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/02/12/perfect-pitch-2">Joseph Brodsky</a>, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/vaclav-havels-lessons-on-how-to-create-a-parallel-polis">Václav Havel</a>,” he wrote. “What was needed was the combination of philosopher and crowd.” The best place to recruit this crowd, he said, was on the internet—a shrewd intuition. Before long, links to Moldbug’s blog, “Unqualified Reservations,” were being passed around by libertarian techies, disgruntled bureaucrats, and self-styled rationalists—many of whom formed the shock troops of an online intellectual movement that came to be known as neo-reaction, or the Dark Enlightenment. While few turned into outright monarchists, their contempt for Obama-era uplift seemed to find voice in Moldbug’s heresies. In his most influential coinage, which quickly gained currency among the nascent alt-right, Moldbug urged his readers to rouse themselves from their ideological slumber by taking the “red pill,” like Keanu Reeves’s character in “The Matrix,” who chooses daunting truth over contented ignorance.</p><p>In 2013, an article on the news site <em>TechCrunch</em>, titled “Geeks for Monarchy,” revealed that Mencius Moldbug was the cyber alias of a forty-year-old programmer in San Francisco named Curtis Yarvin. At the same time that he was trying to redesign the U.S. government, Yarvin was also dreaming up a new computer operating system that he hoped would serve as a “digital republic.” He founded a company that he named Tlon, for the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1970/09/19/jorge-luis-borges-profile-autobiographical-notes">Borges</a> story “Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,” in which a secret society describes an elaborate parallel world that begins to overtake reality. As he raised money for his startup, Yarvin became a kind of Machiavelli to his big-tech benefactors, who shared his view that the world would be better off if they were in charge. Tlon’s investors included the venture-capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund, the latter of which was started by the billionaire <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/what-is-it-about-peter-thiel">Peter Thiel</a>. Both Thiel and Balaji Srinivasan, then a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, had become friends with Yarvin after reading his blog, though e-mails shared with me revealed that neither was thrilled to be publicly associated with him at the time. “How dangerous is it that we are being linked?” Thiel wrote to Yarvin in 2014. “One reassuring thought: one of our hidden advantages is that these people”—social-justice warriors—“wouldn’t believe in a conspiracy if it hit them over the head (this is perhaps the best measure of the decline of the Left). Linkages make them sound really crazy, and they kinda know it.”</p><p>A decade on, with the Trumpian right embracing strongman rule, Yarvin’s links to élites in Silicon Valley and Washington are no longer a secret. In a 2021 appearance on a far-right podcast, Vice-President J.&nbsp;D. Vance, a former employee of one of Thiel’s venture-capital firms, cited Yarvin when suggesting that a future Trump Administration “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people,” and ignore the courts if they objected. Marc Andreessen, one of the heads of Andreessen Horowitz and an informal adviser to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (<em>DOGE</em>), has started quoting his “good friend” Yarvin about the need for a founder-like figure to take charge of our “out of control” bureaucracy. Andrew Kloster, the new general counsel at the government’s Office of Personnel Management, has said that replacing civil servants with loyalists could help Trump defeat “the Cathedral.”</p><p>“There are figures who channel a Zeitgeist—Nietzsche calls them timely men—and Curtis is definitely a timely man,” a State Department official who has been reading Yarvin since the Moldbug era told me. Back in 2011, Yarvin said that Trump was one of two figures who seemed “biologically suited” to be an American monarch. (The other was Chris Christie.) In 2022, he recommended that Trump, if reëlected, appoint Elon Musk to run the executive branch. On a podcast with his friend Michael Anton, now the director of policy planning at the State Department, Yarvin argued that the institutions of civil society, such as Harvard, would need to be shut down. “The idea that you’re going to be a Caesar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with someone else’s Department of Reality in operation is just manifestly&nbsp;absurd,” he said.</p><p>In another timeline, Yarvin might have remained an obscure and ineffectual internet crank, a digital de Maistre. Instead, he has become one of America’s most influential illiberal thinkers, an engineer of the intellectual source code for the second Trump Administration. “Yarvin has pushed the Overton window,” Nikhil Pal Singh, a history professor at N.Y.U., told me. His work has revived ideas that once seemed outside the bounds of polite society, Singh said, and created a road map for the dismantling of “the administrative state and the global postwar order.”</p><p>As his ideas have been surrealized in <em>DOGE</em> and Trump has taken to self-identifying as a king, one might expect to find Yarvin in an exultant mood. In fact, he has spent the past few months fretting that the moment will go to waste. “If you have a Trump boner right now, enjoy it,” he wrote two days after the election. “It’s as hard as you’ll ever get.” What many see as the most dangerous assault on American democracy in the nation’s history Yarvin dismisses as woefully insufficient—a “vibes coup.” Without a full-blown autocratic takeover, he believes, a backlash is sure to follow. When I spoke to him recently, he quoted the words of Louis de Saint-Just, the French philosopher who championed the Reign of Terror: “He who makes half a revolution digs his own grave.”</p><p>Earlier this year, Yarvin and I had lunch in Washington, D.C., where he had come to celebrate the regime change. He was in his usual getup: bluejeans, Chelsea boots, a rumpled dress shirt under a motorcycle jacket. After taking a few bites of a cheeseburger topped with crispy onions, he pushed his plate away. Last year, he explained, he’d decided to start taking an Ozempic-like drug after a debate with the right-wing commentator Richard Hanania about the relative merits of monarchy and democracy. “I destroyed him in almost every way,” Yarvin said, nudging a tomato with his fork. “But he had one huge advantage, which was that I was fat and he was not.”</p><p>The injections seemed to be working. As I ate, Yarvin’s phone filled with messages, some of them complimenting his glow-up. That morning, the <em>Times Magazine</em> had published an interview with him, accompanied by a moody black-and-white portrait. Until recently, Yarvin, with his frazzled curtain of shoulder-length hair and ill-fitting wardrobe, had seemed indifferent to his appearance. Now, wearing his leather jacket, he glared out at the reader through stylishly tousled hair. His friend Steve Sailer, a writer for white-nationalist websites, said he looked like “the fifth Ramone.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a61101&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a61101" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“How can a hunter-gatherer and a rock designer afford such a nice cave?”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Enrico Pinto</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>In person, as in print, Yarvin expresses himself with imperious self-assurance. He is nearly impossible to interrupt. “When the rabbi is speaking, you let the rabbi speak,” Razib Khan, a right-wing science blogger and a close friend of Yarvin’s, told me. Even his friends and family, however, acknowledge that he has room to grow as a communicator. He talks in a halting monotone, rarely answers questions directly, and is prone to disorienting asides. In the middle of saying one thing, he is always getting distracted by something else he could be saying, like a G.P.S. that keeps suggesting faster routes.</p><p>Yarvin, for his part, was relieved at how the interview with the <em>Times</em> had gone. “My main goal was, how do I not damage any of my relationships?” he said. For years, Yarvin was best known, to the extent that he was known at all, as the court philosopher of the Thiel-verse, the network of heterodox entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and hangers-on surrounding the tech mogul. He mentioned that a businessman he knew had once complained to a journalist that Thiel had not invested enough money in his company. “That’s one strike and you’re out, and he was out,” Yarvin said, sighing theatrically. His second goal, he said, was to reach the <em>Times</em> audience. This seemed surprising: he has called for the government to shut down the paper. “I tend to be more interested in outreach to people who share my own cultural background,” Yarvin explained.</p><p>He likes to tell the story of his paternal grandparents, Jewish Communists from Brooklyn who met at a leftist gathering in the thirties. (He has less to say about his maternal grandparents, Tarrytown Wasps with a cottage on Nantucket.) “The vibe of American communism was ‘We’ve got thirty I.Q. points on these people, and we’re going to win,’&nbsp;” he said. “It’s like, what if all the gifted kids formed a political party and tried to take over the world?” Yarvin’s parents met at Brown, where his father, Herbert, was pursuing a Ph.D. in philosophy. After finishing school and failing to get tenure (“too arrogant,” Yarvin said), Herbert tried his hand at writing the Great American Novel, then joined the Foreign Service as a diplomat. In the following years, the family lived in the Dominican Republic and Cyprus. Herbert was cynical about working for the government, and Yarvin seems to have inherited his disdain: he has repeatedly proposed closing America’s embassies, a prospect the State Department is now considering in parts of Europe and Africa.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Yarvin is reticent on the subject of his childhood, but friends and family suggested to me that his father could be harsh, domineering, and impossible to please. “He controlled their life with an iron fist,” someone with close knowledge of the family told me. “It was absolutely his domain.” (Yarvin vehemently rejected this view, saying that people who are controlling tend to be insecure, “and that is very much <em>not</em> the way of my father.” Better words to describe him, he said, would be “stubborn,” “intense,” and “formidable”—like “a good manager.”)</p><p>Growing up, Yarvin was sometimes homeschooled by his mother, and skipped three grades. (His older brother, Norman, skipped four.) The family eventually moved to Columbia, Maryland, where Yarvin entered high school as a twelve-year-old sophomore. “When you’re much younger than your classmates, you’re either an adorable mascot or a weird, threatening, disturbing alien,” Yarvin said, adding that he was the latter. Yarvin was selected to participate in a Johns Hopkins study of math prodigies. He attended the university’s Center for Talented Youth, a summer camp for gifted children, and was a Baltimore-area champion on “It’s Academic,” a television trivia show. Andrew Cone, a software engineer who currently lives in a spare room in Yarvin’s home, told me that Yarvin’s childhood seems to have left him with a lifelong feeling of inadequacy. “I think he has this sense of being not good enough, that he’s seen as ridiculous or small, and that the only way out is to perform,” Cone said.</p><p>Yarvin went to Brown, graduated at eighteen, and then entered a Ph.D. program in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Former peers told me that he wore a bicycle helmet in class and seemed eager to show off his knowledge to the professor. “Oh, you mean helmet-head?” one said when I asked about Yarvin. The joke among some of his classmates was that the helmet prevented new ideas from penetrating his mind. He found more of a community on Usenet, a precursor to today’s online forums. But even in groups like talk.bizarre, where intellectual peacocking was the norm, he stood out for his desire to dominate. Along with posting jokes, advice, light verse, and “flames” (blistering takedowns of other users), he maintained a “kill file,” a list of members he had blocked because he found their posts uninteresting. “He wanted to be viewed as the smart guy—that was really, really important to him,” his first girlfriend, Meredith Tanner, told me. She was drawn to Yarvin after reading one of his virtuosic flames, and the pair dated for a few years. “Don’t get involved with someone just because you’re impressed by how creatively they insult people,” she warned. “They will turn that skill on you.”</p><p>Friends from Yarvin’s twenties described him as a reflexive contrarian who revelled in provocation. “He wasn’t a sweet kid, and he could sometimes be nasty,&nbsp;but he wasn’t Moldbug,” one said. Politically and culturally, Yarvin was a liberal—“a big old hippie,” as Tanner put it. He had a ponytail, wore a silver hoop earring, dropped acid at raves, and wrote poetry. Tanner recalled that when she once questioned the value of affirmative action in college admissions, it was Yarvin who convinced her of its necessity.</p><p>After a year and a half of doctoral work, Yarvin left academia to seek his fortune in the tech industry. He helped design an early version of a mobile web browser for a company that came to be known as Phone.com. In 2001, he began dating Jennifer Kollmer, a playwright he met on Craigslist, whom he later married and had two children with. Phone.com had gone public, leaving him with a windfall of a million dollars. He used some of the money to buy a condo near the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco and the rest to fund a self-directed study of computer science and political theory. “I was used to getting pats on the head for being smart,” he said of his decision to leave the <em>cursus honorum</em> of the gifted child. “Diverging from the pat-on-the-head economy was a strange and scary choice.”</p><p>Out in the wilderness, Yarvin delved into recondite history and economics texts, many of them newly accessible through Google Books. He read Thomas Carlyle, James Burnham, and Albert Jay Nock, alongside an early-aughts profusion of political blogs. Yarvin traces his own red-pill moment to the Presidential election of 2004. As many of his peers were being driven to the left by lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Yarvin was pulled in the opposite direction by fabrications of a different sort: the Swift Boat conspiracy theory pushed by veterans allied with the George&nbsp;W. Bush campaign, who claimed that the Democratic candidate, John Kerry, had lied about his service in Vietnam. It seemed obvious to Yarvin, who believed the accusations, that once the truth emerged Kerry would be forced to drop out of the race. When that didn’t happen, he began to question what else he’d naïvely taken on trust. Facts no longer felt stable. How could he be confident in what he’d been told about Joseph McCarthy, the Civil War, or global warming? What about democracy itself? After years of energetic debates in the comments sections of other people’s blogs, he decided to start his own. It did not lack for ambition. The first post began, “The other day I was tinkering around in my garage and I decided to build a new ideology.”</p><p>The German academic Hans-Hermann Hoppe is sometimes described as an intellectual gateway to the far right. A retired economics professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Hoppe argues that universal suffrage has supplanted rule by a “natural élite”; advocates for breaking nations into smaller, homogenous communities; and calls for communists, homosexuals, and others who oppose this rigid social order to be “physically removed.” (Some white nationalists have made memes pairing Hoppe’s face with a helicopter—an allusion to the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s practice of executing opponents by throwing them from aircraft.) Though Hoppe favors a minimal state, he believes that freedom is better preserved by monarchy than by democracy.</p><p>Yarvin nearly ended up a libertarian. As a Bay Area coder and a devotee of Austrian-school economists in his late twenties, he exhibited all the risk factors. Then he discovered Hoppe’s book “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Economics-Politics-Perspectives-Democratic/dp/0765808684" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Economics-Politics-Perspectives-Democratic/dp/0765808684&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Economics-Politics-Perspectives-Democratic/dp/0765808684" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Democracy: The God That Failed</a>” (2001) and changed his mind. Yarvin soon adopted Hoppe’s imago of a benevolent strongman—someone who would govern efficiently, avoid senseless wars, and prioritize the well-being of his subjects. “It’s not copy-and-pasted, but it is such a direct influence that it’s kind of obscene,” Julian Waller, a scholar of authoritarianism at George Washington University, said. (Over e-mail, Hoppe recalled that he met Yarvin once at an exclusive gathering at Peter Thiel’s home, where Hoppe had been invited to speak. He acknowledged his influence on Yarvin, but added, “For my taste his writing has always been a bit too flowery and rambling.”) Hoppe argues that, unlike democratically elected officials, a monarch has a long-term incentive to safeguard his subjects and the state, because both belong to him. Anyone familiar with the history of dictatorships might find this idea disingenuous. Not Yarvin.</p><p>“You don’t ransack your own house,” he told me one afternoon, at an open-air café in Venice Beach. I’d asked him what would stop his C.E.O.-monarch from plundering the country—or enslaving his people—for personal gain. “For Louis XIV, when he says, ‘<em>L’état, c’est moi</em>,’ ransacking the state holds no meaning because it’s all his anyway.” Following Hoppe, Yarvin proposes that nations should eventually be broken up into a “patchwork” of statelets, like Singapore or Dubai, each with its own sovereign ruler. The eternal political problems of legitimacy, accountability, and succession would be solved by a secret board with the power to select and recall the otherwise all-powerful C.E.O. of each sovereign corporation, or SovCorp. (How the board itself would be selected is unclear, but Yarvin has suggested that airline pilots—“a fraternity of intelligent, practical, and careful people who are already trusted on a regular basis with the lives of others. What’s not to like?”—could manage the transition between regimes.) To prevent a C.E.O. from staging a military coup, the board members would have access to cryptographic keys that would allow them to disarm all government weapons, from nuclear missiles down to small arms, with the push of a button.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Mass political participation would cease, and the only way that people could vote would be with their feet, by moving from one SovCorp to another if they became dissatisfied with the terms of service, like switching from X to Bluesky. The irony that dissenters like Yarvin would probably be repressed in such a state appears not to concern him. In his imagined polity, he insists, there would still be freedom of speech. “You can think, say, or write whatever you want,” he has promised. “Because the state has no reason to care.”</p><p>Yarvin’s congenital cynicism about governance disappears as soon as he starts talking about dictatorial regimes. He has kind words for El Salvador’s strongman, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/12/the-rise-of-nayib-bukele-el-salvadors-authoritarian-president">Nayib Bukele</a>, and has encouraged Trump to let Putin end the liberal order “not just in Russian-speaking territories—but all the way to the English Channel.” Picking at a plate of fried calamari, Yarvin praised China and Rwanda (neither of which he has visited) for having strong governments that insured both public safety and personal liberty. In China, he told me, “you can think and pretty much say whatever you want.” He may have sensed my skepticism, given the country’s record of imprisoning critics and detaining ethnic minorities in concentration camps. “If you want to organize against the government, you’re gonna have problems,” he admitted. Then he returned to his airbrush: “Not Stalin problems. You’ll just, like, be cancelled.”</p><p>For certain people, like meth addicts or four-year-olds, Yarvin said, too much freedom could be deadly. Then, gesturing to the homeless population camped in the neighborhood, he suddenly began to cry. “The idea that this represents success, or this represents the ‘worst of all systems, except for all the others’&nbsp;”—he was referencing Churchill’s famous comment about democracy, which I’d paraphrased earlier—“is highly delusional,” he said, wiping away the tears. (A few weeks later, on a trip to London, I watched him break down while giving a similar speech to a member of the House of Lords. It was less affecting the second time around.)</p><p>Presumably, Yarvin’s monarch would act decisively to safeguard his wards. At the Venice café, Yarvin lauded the Delancey Street Foundation, a nonprofit rehab organization, whose strict program he has characterized as exerting “fascist-parent-level control.” Some of his own proposals go further. On his blog, he once joked about converting San Francisco’s underclasses into biodiesel to power the city’s buses. Then he suggested another idea: putting them in solitary confinement, hooked up to a virtual-reality interface. Whatever the exact solution, he has written, it is crucial to find “a humane alternative to genocide,” an outcome that “achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society) but without any of the moral stigma.”</p><p>Yarvin’s call for an American strongman is often treated as an eccentric provocation. In fact, he considers it the only answer to a world in which most people are unfit for democracy. An “African country today,” he told me, has “enough smart people in the country to run it—you just don’t have enough smart people to have a democratic election in which everyone is smart.” Because of such remarks, Yarvin is sometimes identified as a white nationalist, a label he delicately resists. In a 2007 blog post titled “Why I Am Not a White Nationalist,” he explained that, though he is “not exactly allergic to the stuff,” he finds both whiteness and nationalism to be unhelpful political concepts. During lunch, he told me that he feels a rueful sympathy for the bigots of the past, who had some of the right intuitions but lacked the proper science. Neo-reactionaries tend to subscribe to what they call “human biodiversity,” a set of fringe beliefs which holds, among other things, that not all racial or population groups are equally intelligent. As Yarvin came to see it from his online research, these genetic differences contributed to (and, conveniently, helped explain away) demographic differences in poverty, crime, and educational attainment. “In this house, we believe in science—<em>race</em> science,” he wrote last year.</p><p>For several hours, Yarvin shuffled through his pitches for strongman rule, like an auctioneer desperate to clinch a sale. I listened patiently, though I was often puzzled by his factual distortions and peculiar asides. “What is the right policy in a completely new-from-scratch regime for African Americans?” he wondered aloud at one point. At first, this seemed like a non sequitur: I’d been pressing him on how he would define success in the second Trump Administration. Answering himself, he said that the “obvious solution” to problems of inner-city drug abuse and poverty would be to “put the church Blacks in charge of the ghetto Blacks.” Yarvin, who is an atheist, is not particularly interested in theocratic rule, but he advocates creating different legal codes to govern different populations. (He has cited the Ottoman <em>millet</em> system, which granted religious communities a measure of autonomy.) To keep the “ghetto Blacks” in line, he went on, they should be forced to live in a “traditional way,” like Orthodox Jews or the Amish. “The approach that the twentieth century took is, if we could just make the schools good enough, they would all turn into Unitarians,” he said. “If you’ve seen ‘The Wire’ and lived in Baltimore, both of which I have, that does not seem to work at all.” It wasn’t until he reached the end of his speech, ten minutes later, that I realized he was, in his own way, addressing my initial question. “Unless we can totally reëngineer DNA to change what a human being is, there are many people who should not live in a modern way but in a traditional way,” he concluded. “And <em>that</em> is a level of revolution that is so far beyond anything the Trump-Vance regime is doing.”</p><p>Yarvin is not known for his discretion. He has a habit of sharing private correspondence, as I discovered when he started sending me unsolicited screenshots of text messages and e-mails he’d exchanged with his wife, his friends, a fact checker at the <em>Times Magazine</em>, and someone nominated to the new Administration. He seemed troubled by the thought that the wit and wisdom they contained might be lost to posterity. He was more guarded about his friendship with Thiel, but he did mention a conversation they’d privately filmed together last year and boasted about a fortieth-birthday gift he’d received from the billionaire: Francis Neilson’s “The Tragedy of Europe,” a contemporaneous commentary on the Second World War, though not the first edition that Yarvin had been hoping for.</p><p>Thiel has always had a prophetic touch. He co-founded PayPal, became the first outside investor in Facebook, and created Palantir, a data-mining firm that has just received a new contract to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers carry out deportations. Thiel supported Trump back when doing so still made one a pariah in Silicon Valley. In 2022, he donated fifteen million dollars to J.&nbsp;D. Vance’s Senate campaign, the largest amount given to a single candidate in congressional history. A longtime libertarian, Thiel appears to have taken a Yarvinian turn around 2009, when, in a widely quoted essay published online by the Cato Institute, he wrote, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” Yarvin linked to it approvingly in a blog post titled “Democraphobia Goes (Slightly) Viral.” They soon met for the first time, at Thiel’s house in San Francisco, and, according to private messages I reviewed, struck up a confiding correspondence. Yarvin’s e-mails were long and homiletic, full of precepts gleaned from pickup-artist blogs; Thiel’s were straightforward and concise. Both men seemed to take for granted that America was a communist country, that journalists acted like the Stasi, and that tech C.E.O.s were their prey.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the fall of 2014, Thiel published “Zero to One,” a best-selling treatise on startups, with Blake Masters, his employee and a longtime Moldbug fan. Before the book tour, Thiel asked Yarvin for advice on fielding questions he might get on how to steer more women into tech. The premise appeared to strike them both as misguided, since women, in their view, were less likely to have men’s aptitude for computer science. As Yarvin put it in one e-mail, “There’s simply no way short of becoming a farce for Google, YC”—Y Combinator, the startup accelerator—“etc, etc, to ‘look like America.’&nbsp;” Yarvin suggested that Thiel deploy a pickup-artist tactic called “agree and amplify”—that is, ask a journalist, who probably had no solution in mind, what she would do to tackle the problem. “The purpose here is not to get the interlocutor to sleep with you, but to get her to fear this issue and run away from it—and ditto for future interviewers,” he wrote. Once, at a dinner, Thiel quizzed Yarvin on how one might go about taking down <em>Gawker</em>. (As it turned out, Thiel had already decided to secretly bankroll Hulk Hogan’s defamation lawsuit against the online publication, which eventually bankrupted it, in 2016.) In e-mails obtained by <em>BuzzFeed</em>, Yarvin bragged to Milo Yiannopoulos, the <em>Breitbart</em> editor, that he’d watched Trump’s first election at Thiel’s house and had been “coaching” him. “Peter needs guidance on politics for sure,” Yiannopoulos replied. Yarvin wrote back, “Less than you might think!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He’s fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60750&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60750" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Slowest to hit Skip has to watch the whole ad.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Juan Astasio and Colin Mills</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>When I recently visited Yarvin’s Craftsman home, in Berkeley, I noticed a painting that Thiel had given him: a portrait of Yarvin in the style of a role-playing-game character card, bearing the legend “Philosopher.” As I sipped tea from a novelty mug featuring an image of Yarvin with a cartoon crown, he told me that it would be “cringe” for him to broadcast his relationship with Thiel—or with Vance, for that matter, whom he met through Thiel around 2015. “Does a normal Ohio voter read&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mencius Moldbug? No,” Vance reportedly said one night at a bar during the 2021 National Conservatism Conference. “But do they agree with the broad thrust of where we think American public policy should go? Absolutely.” “He’s a really cool guy,” Yarvin said of the Vice-President, who followed him on X earlier this year. (The White House did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>Although Yarvin tried to be discreet, he mentioned that Thiel has a bit of a “weirdo edge” and described Andreessen, the venture capitalist, as someone who, “apart from the bizarre and possibly even nonhuman shape of his head, would seem much more normal than Peter.” After Andreessen invested in Yarvin’s startup, Tlon, the two got to know each other; they texted and went to brunch long before Andreessen came out as a Trump supporter, last year. Andreessen has been known to urge his associates to read Yarvin’s blog. “Tech people are not interested in appeals to virtue or beauty or tradition, like most conservatives,” the State Department official said. “They are more like right-wing progressives, and for a long time Moldbug was the only person speaking to them this way.” (Andreessen and Thiel declined to comment.) Apropos of his relationships with powerful men, Yarvin paraphrased to me “a wonderful piece of advice for courtiers” that he’d picked up from Lord Chesterfield’s “Letters to His Son,” an eighteenth-century etiquette manual addressed to the author’s illegitimate child: “Never bug them. And never let them forget you exist.”</p><p>Yarvin has had more success as a courtier to startup founders than as a founder himself. He launched Tlon in 2013, with a twentysomething former Thiel fellow. Yarvin approached computer science the same way he approached the U.S. government—with, as he put it, “utopian megalomania.” Yarvin’s visionary goal was to build a peer-to-peer computer network, named Urbit, that would allow users to control their own data, free from scolds, spies, and monopolies. Each user on the Urbit network is identified with an N.F.T. that acts like a digital passport. Even though Urbit promotes decentralization, the system is designed around a hierarchical model of virtual real estate, with users owning “planets,” “stars,” or “galaxies.”</p><p>In an early sketch of the system, Yarvin named himself its “prince,” but he struggled to attract subjects to his imaginary kingdom. Like Yarvin’s political theory, his programming language, which he wrote himself, was daring, abstruse, and sometimes mistaken for a hoax. Ever the contrarian, he reversed the meaning of zeros and ones. After decades of work and an estimated thirty million dollars of investment, Urbit seems to function less like a feudal society and more like the Usenet forums of Yarvin’s youth. (The trade publication <em>CoinDesk</em> has called it “a slower version of AOL Instant Messenger.”) “It doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to,” a former Urbit employee told me, describing Yarvin as “the world’s first computer-science crank.” Yarvin left the company in 2019.</p><p>No longer needing to worry about spooking investors, Yarvin threw himself into the life style of a self-described “rogue intellectual.” Under his own name, he launched a Substack newsletter, “Gray Mirror of the Nihilist Prince.” (Today, it is the platform’s third most popular “history” publication.) He became a fixture on the right-wing podcast circuit and seemed never to turn down an invitation to party. On his travels, he often hosted “office hours”—informal, freewheeling discussions with readers, many of them thoughtful young men, alienated by liberal guilt and groupthink. What wins Yarvin converts is less the soundness of his arguments than the transgressive energy they exude: he makes his listeners feel that he is granting them access to forbidden knowledge—about racial hierarchy, historical conspiracies, and the perfidy of democratic rule—that progressive culture is at pains to suppress. His approach seizes on the reality that most Americans have never learned how to defend democracy; they were simply brought up to believe in it.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Yarvin advises his followers to avoid culture-war battles over issues like D.E.I. and abortion. It is wiser, he argues, to let the democratic system collapse on its own. In the meantime, dissidents should focus on becoming “fashionable” by building a reactionary subculture—a counter-Cathedral. Sam Kriss, a left-wing writer who has debated Yarvin, said of his work, “It flatters people who believe they can change the world simply by having weird ideas on the Internet and decadent parties in Manhattan.”</p><p>Such people have come to be known as the “dissident right,” a loose constellation of artists and strivers clustered around the Bay Area, Miami, and the Lower East Side micro-neighborhood Dimes Square. The milieu was drawn together by a frustration with electoral politics, <em>Covid</em> lockdowns, and the strictures of “wokeness.” Vice signalling has been central to the scene’s countercultural allure: instead of sharing pronouns and employing the approved nomenclature (“unhoused,” “Latinx,” “justice-involved person”), its members have revived insults like “gay” and “retarded.” Dasha Nekrasova and Anna Khachiyan, the hosts of the “Red Scare” podcast, are among the most prominent avatars of the scene. In 2021, Thiel helped to fund an anti-woke film festival in New York, and Yarvin read his poetry at one of its packed events. Urbit now hosts a literary magazine designed to look like <em>The New York Review of Books</em>. “If you are an intelligent Jewish-American urbanite who wants to play around with certain Nietzschean and eugenic themes, you aren’t going to join tiki-torch-bearing marchers chanting that ‘the Jews will not replace us,’&nbsp;” the conservative commentator Sohrab Ahmari observed in an essay last year. “No, you turn to the dissident right.”</p><p>Yarvin has emerged as a veteran edgelord of this crowd, which he compared to San Francisco’s gay subculture in the seventies and to the Lost Generation of literary modernists—tight-knit communities whose members bonded over their sense of being outsiders. James Joyce, he said, sold few copies of “Ulysses,” but his friends, like Ezra Pound and T.&nbsp;S. Eliot, “knew that what he was doing was good.” So it was with the creatives of the dissident right, whose endeavors, he felt, had been overlooked by the intolerant Cathedral. This past April, Yarvin pitched Darren Beattie, the acting Under-Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy, on a plan for “dissident-right art hos” to take over the American pavilion at the Venice Biennale.</p><p>Lately, Yarvin has been trying to flip some of his newly acquired cultural capital into the real thing. Last year, he returned to Urbit as a “wartime C.E.O.,” after which several top employees resigned, and in February he raised more money from Andreessen Horowitz. According to a draft of an unpublished Substack post, his newest plan is to promote Urbit as an élite private club whose members, he believes, are destined to become “the stars of the new public sphere—a new Usenet, a new digital Athens built to last forever.”</p><p>The night before Trump’s Inauguration, I drove Yarvin to a black-tie “Coronation Ball” at the Watergate Hotel, in Washington, D.C. The event was organized by a neo-reactionary publishing house, Passage Press, which recently released Yarvin’s book “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Gray-Mirror-Fascicle-I-Disturbance-ebook/dp/B0DV36SK5P" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gray-Mirror-Fascicle-I-Disturbance-ebook/dp/B0DV36SK5P&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Gray-Mirror-Fascicle-I-Disturbance-ebook/dp/B0DV36SK5P" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gray Mirror, Fascicle I: Disturbance</a>,” the first of a planned four-part cycle outlining his vision for a new political regime. Its endnotes predominantly consist of QR-code links to Wikipedia pages: “Denazification,” “L’État, c’est moi,” “Presentism (historical analysis).” As I negotiated the icy streets, Yarvin explained that during the Elizabethan era the finest minds in the arts and sciences were to be found at court. When I asked if he saw a parallel with Trump’s inner circle, he burst out laughing. “Oh, no,” he said. “My God.”</p><p>Like most journalists, I had been denied entry to the ball, so I ordered a drink at a bar in the lobby. Standing next to me was a man wearing a cowboy hat and a burgundy velour suit—a Yarvin enthusiast, it turned out, named Alex Maxa. He ran a party-bus company in San Francisco, and in his free time he made memes featuring Yarvin’s likeness. He said that he was drawn to Yarvin’s work because “it makes me feel like I’ve got something that people in Washington who think they’re really smart can’t actually make a compelling argument against.” He’d wanted to go to the ball but tickets, whose price had surged to twenty thousand dollars, were now sold out. Not long afterward, I met two of Yarvin’s friends, who encouraged me, and another journalist I was with, to confidently walk into the party with them. Maxa was already inside, having taken a similar approach. “Lol I just waltzed right in by asking where the coat check was,” he texted.</p><p>Passage Press had billed the event as “<em>MAGA</em> meets the Tech Right.” It was not false advertising. In a banquet hall awash in pink and purple light, Anton, from the State Department, Laura Loomer, a Trump whisperer known for her anti-Muslim bigotry, and Jack Posobiec, who popularized the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, mingled with venture capitalists, crypto accelerationists, and Substack all-stars. Earlier that evening, as guests dined on seared scallops and filet mignon, Steve Bannon, the ball’s keynote speaker, called for mass deportations, the “Götterdämmerung” of the administrative state, and Mark Zuckerberg’s imprisonment.</p><p>Eight years ago, Mike Cernovich, a first-gen alt-right influencer, had co-hosted an inaugural party known as the DeploraBall, a winking reference to Hillary Clinton’s unfortunate crack about half of Trump’s supporters belonging in a “basket of deplorables.” It was, by all accounts, a shambolic affair, plagued by journalists and protesters. One of Cernovich’s co-organizers, Tim Gionet, who goes by the online pseudonym Baked Alaska, was removed from his role after posting antisemitic content on Twitter. Now, at the Coronation Ball, Baked Alaska was served for dessert—a nod, it seemed, to Gionet, who was then on probation for participating in the January 6th insurrection. (He was pardoned by Trump the next day.) Cernovich pushed a baby around in a stroller and marvelled, like a proud father, at how&nbsp;far the movement had come. “I was one of the oldest guys in the place!” he tweeted the following afternoon. “Real right wing. High energy and high IQ.” In 2008, Yarvin, in his “Open Letter,” had called for a reactionary vanguard to form an underground political party. The Coronation Ball made it clear that this was no longer necessary. His web-addled counter-élite was now the establishment.</p><p>Yarvin was dressed in the same tuxedo, including a bright-red cummerbund, that he’d worn to a party at Thiel’s house in D.C. the night before, where, as <em>Politico</em> reported, Vance had amiably greeted him with “You reactionary fascist!” He’d also worn the tux to his wedding last year. Yarvin’s first wife died in 2021, from a hereditary heart disease, at the age of fifty. At the ball, he was accompanied by his second wife, Kristine Militello. A former Bernie Sanders supporter and an aspiring novelist, Kristine described herself as having been “red-pilled” during the pandemic, after losing her customer-service job at an online wine retailer. She first encountered Yarvin on YouTube, where she watched a video of him arguing against the legitimacy of the American Revolution, and proceeded to read everything he’d written. She sent him an admiring e-mail in 2022, seeking advice on how to break into New York’s dissident-right literary scene, and they met for drinks a few weeks later.</p><p>Recently, Yarvin has taken to describing himself as a “dark elf” whose role is to seduce “high elves”—blue-state élites—by planting “acorns of dark doubt in their high golden minds.” (In this Tolkien-inspired metaphor, red-state conservatives are “hobbits” who should submit to the “absolute power” of a new ruling class made up, unsurprisingly, of dark elves.) He didn’t always express himself so quaintly. In 2011, the day after the far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik killed sixty-nine people, many of them teen-agers, at a summer camp in Norway, Yarvin wrote, “If you’re going to change Norway into something new, you need the present ruling class of Norway to <em>join</em> and <em>follow</em> you. Or at least, you’ll need their children.” He praised Breivik for targeting the right group (“communists, not Muslims”), but condemned his methods: “Rape is beta. Seduction is alpha. Don’t slaughter the youth camp—<em>recruit</em> the youth camp.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Yarvin’s own recruitment efforts seemed to be working. Near the open bar, I spoke to Stevie Miller, a sprightly sophomore at Carnegie Mellon who has been reading Yarvin since the seventh grade. (Yarvin told me that he’d encountered several gifted Zoomers who’d read him as preteens because his “high-I.Q. style” served as a “high-I.Q. magnet.”) Two years ago, Miller hung out with Yarvin at Vibecamp, a gathering for nerds and techies in rural Maryland. Yarvin, who left early, asked Miller to help him throw his own party in D.C., which came to be known as Vibekampf. Afterward, Miller became Yarvin’s first personal intern. “My parents, New York Jewish liberals who I love, were totally mystified,” he said.</p><p>After half an hour, I was escorted out of the party, as were other reporters throughout the evening. Security mistook Maxa, my friend from the lobby, for one of our kind, and he was ejected, too, though not before pressing through the crowd to get his photo taken with the dark elf.</p><p>Even Trump’s most pessimistic critics have been startled by the speed with which the President, in his second term, has moved to impose autocracy on America, concentrating power in the executive branch—and often enough in the hands of the richest men on earth. Elon Musk, an unelected citizen, has led a squadron of twentysomethings on a spree through the federal government, laying off tens of thousands of civil servants, shuttering the U.S. Agency for International Development, and seizing control of the Treasury Department’s payment system. Meanwhile, the Administration has launched an assault on civil society, revoking funding at Harvard and other universities that it claims are bastions of ideological indoctrination and punishing law firms that have represented Trump’s opponents. It has expanded the machinery of immigration enforcement, deporting three U.S.-born children to Honduras, a group of Asian and Latin American immigrants to Africa, and more than two hundred Venezuelan migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where they may remain until the end of their lives. U.S. citizens now find themselves with a government that claims the right to disappear them without due process: as Trump told Bukele, the President of El Salvador, during an Oval Office meeting, “Homegrowns are next.” Without a vigorous system of checks and balances, one man’s crank ideas—like starting an incoherent trade war that upends the global economy—don’t get filtered out. They become policies that enrich his family and his allies.</p><p>Since January, a cottage industry has arisen online to trace links between the government’s chaotic blitz of actions and Yarvin’s writings. Yarvin is hardly the Rasputin-like figure with Oval Office access that certain Bluesky users imagine him to be, but it isn’t difficult to see why some people may have come to this view. Last month, an anonymous <em>DOGE</em> adviser told the Washington <em>Post</em> that it was “an open secret that everyone in policymaking roles has read Yarvin.” Stephen Miller, the President’s deputy chief of staff, recently quote-tweeted him. Vance has called for the U.S. to retrench from Europe, a longtime Yarvin desideratum. Last spring, Yarvin proposed expelling all Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and turning it into a luxury resort. “Did I hear someone say ‘beachfront?’&nbsp;” he wrote on Substack. “The new Gaza—developed, of course, by Jared Kushner—is the LA of the Mediterranean, an entirely new charter city on humanity’s oldest ocean, sublime real estate with an absolutely perfect, Apple-quality government.” This February, during a joint press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, Trump surprised his advisers when he made a nearly identical proposal, describing his redeveloped Gaza as “the Riviera of the Middle East.”</p><p>Whenever I asked Yarvin about resonances between his writing and real-world events, his response was nonchalant. He seemed to see himself as a conduit for pure reason—the only mystery, to him, was why it had taken others so long to catch up. “You can invent a lie, but you can only discover the truth,” he told me. We were in London, where he was attending the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, a conservative conference co-founded by the psychologist Jordan Peterson. (Yarvin described Peterson to me as “a dandy” with “a weird narcissistic energy coming off of him.”) Accompanying Yarvin on his travels were Eduardo Giralt Brun and Alonso Esquinca Díaz, two millennial filmmakers who were shooting a documentary about his life. Their goal was to make a naturalistic character study in the style of “Grey Gardens,” in which, as Brun put it, “the camera just happens to be around.” It wasn’t going to plan. Yarvin kept repeating the same monologues, which meant that much of the footage was the same. The filmmakers worried that his racist remarks would turn viewers off. One afternoon in London, Díaz had filmed Yarvin getting his portrait painted with Lord Maurice Glasman, a post-liberal political theorist who has been called “Labour’s <em>MAGA</em> Lord,” for his support of Brexit and his ongoing dialogue with figures like Steve Bannon. At one point in their discussion, Yarvin had pulled out his iPhone to show Glasman that he’d hacked the chatbot Claude to get it to call him by the N-word.</p><p>Some thinkers would envy the attention Yarvin is receiving. But he dismissed his influence as a “fraudulent currency” since it has yet to cash out in the revolution he desires. He poured scorn on <em>DOGE</em> (“so much libertarian DNA”) and Trump’s tariff plan (not mercantilist enough). In a recent essay on Substack, he criticized the decision to dispatch plainclothes <em>ICE</em> officers to jail college students and professors for political speech—not on moral grounds, but because the thuggish optics were likely to provoke resistance. Yarvin’s oracular pronouncements and bottomless disdain for actually existing politics have inspired a viral post: his face under the words “Your anti-regime actions work well in practice. But do they work in theory?” The conservative activist Christopher Rufo has compared Yarvin to “a sullen teenager who insists that everything is pointless.” I came to think of him as a reactionary Goldilocks who would be satisfied with nothing less than the inch-perfect autocracy that he’d constructed in his mind.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a61050&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a61050" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by Vi-An Nguyen</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>This apparent desire for control also shows up in some of his relationships. Not long ago, I visited Lydia Laurenson, Yarvin’s ex-fiancée, in Berkeley. The two began dating in September, 2021, after Yarvin posted a personal ad on Substack, explaining that he’d recently lost his “widower virginity” and was looking to meet someone of “childbearing age.” Laurenson, a freelance writer and editor, replied the same day: “I have historically been a liberal but my IQ is really high, I want kids, and I’m incredibly curious to talk to you.” Yarvin went on Zoom dates with other women who answered the post—among them, Caroline Ellison, the ex-girlfriend of the now imprisoned crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried—but he and Laurenson soon found themselves in an all-consuming romance. She told me that the ethos of her relationship with Yarvin was “&nbsp;‘We’re going to be geniuses together and have genius babies.’ I’m making fun of it a little bit, but that really was it.”</p><p>Like Yarvin, Laurenson had been a precocious child who went to college early. She’d also maintained a blog with a cult following, where, under the pseudonym Clarisse Thorn, she wrote about sex-positive feminism, B.D.S.M., and pickup artistry. She and Yarvin fought often, sometimes about politics. Laurenson had moved away from the left, but she hadn’t fully embraced neo-reaction. When I asked her if she’d ever changed Yarvin’s mind about anything, she said she’d gotten him to stop using the N-word, at least around her. (He later told this magazine that he was not using the word in the spirit of “a Southern plantation owner.”)</p><p>The bigger source of tension, according to Laurenson, was Yarvin’s autocratic attachment style. When they fought, Laurenson said, he insisted that she provide a rational justification for ending hostilities. She felt that Yarvin’s slippery personal attacks resembled his manner in public debates. “He makes up explanations that seem reasonable, but are actually false; he attacks the character of the person who is trying to point out what he’s doing; it’s like a DDOS attack of the soul,” she told me in an e-mail, referencing the cyberattack strategy of overwhelming a server with traffic from multiple sources. James Dama, a friend of Laurenson’s who had his own falling out with Yarvin, recalled, “He would make a coarse joke about Lydia’s weight or looks, not get a laugh, and then get angry at Lydia for being too stuck up.” (Tanner, Yarvin’s first girlfriend, described a similar pattern of insults and demands.)</p><p>Laurenson and Yarvin broke up in the summer of 2022, while Laurenson was pregnant. He told me that his desire for closeness might have struck Laurenson as “overbearing and stifling,” and that he had a bad habit of making “a joke that’s sort of a barb,” but he denied that he was ever purposefully cruel during the relationship. (He added that, after the relationship ended, “my natural instinct was, I’m going to cut her down to size every time I can”—something, he noted, he was “very good at.”) A few weeks after their son was born, that December, Yarvin sued for partial custody, which he received. An ongoing family-court case remains acrimonious. “The parents are in disagreement about nearly every issue,” their mediator observed last year.</p><p>Now that they share a toddler, Laurenson spends a lot of time thinking about Yarvin’s own childhood. “He has this class-clown thing going on, where he very much craves attention,” she said. To her, it seemed that his embrace of a provocative ideology was a kind of “repetition compulsion,” a psychological defense that allowed him to reframe the ostracization he experienced growing up. As America’s most famous living monarchist, he could tell himself that people were rejecting him for his outré ideas, not for his personality. She wondered if he’d first adopted “the monarchist thing” as a kind of intellectual sport, a bit from Usenet, and then, like the parallel world in the Borges story, it had slowly taken on a reality of its own. “Is it just like you found this place where people admire you and allow you to troll as much as you want, and then you just live in that world?” she asked.</p><p>In the past decade, liberalism has taken a beating from both sides of the political spectrum. Its critics to the left view its measured gradualism as incommensurate to the present’s multiple emergencies: climate change, inequality, the rise of an ethno-nationalist right. Conservatives, by contrast, paint liberalism as a cultural leviathan that has trampled traditional values underfoot. In “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Liberalism-Failed-Politics-Culture/dp/0300223447" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Why-Liberalism-Failed-Politics-Culture/dp/0300223447&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Liberalism-Failed-Politics-Culture/dp/0300223447" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Why Liberalism Failed</a>” (2018), the Notre Dame political scientist Patrick Deneen argues that the contemporary American emphasis on individual freedom has come at the expense of family, faith, and community, turning us into “increasingly separate, autonomous, non-relational selves replete with rights and defined by our liberty, but insecure, powerless, afraid, and alone.” Other post-liberal theorists, including Adrian Vermeule, have proposed that the state curtail certain rights in the service of an explicitly Catholic “common good.”</p><p>Yarvin is calling for something simpler and more libidinally satisfying: to burn it all down and start again from scratch. Since the advent of neoliberalism in the late seventies, political leaders have increasingly treated governance like corporate management, turning citizens into customers and privatizing services. The result has been greater inequality, a weakened social safety net, and the widespread perception that democracy itself is to blame for these ills, creating an appetite for exactly the kind of autocratic efficiency Yarvin now extolls. “A Yarvin program might seem seductive during a period of neoliberal rule, where efforts to change things, whether it is global warming or the war machine, feel futile,” the historian Suzanne Schneider told me. “You can sit back, not give a fuck, and let someone else run the show.” Yarvin has little to say on the question of human flourishing, or about humans in general, who appear in his work as sheep to be herded, idiots to be corrected, or marionettes controlled by leftist puppeteers.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Whatever gift Yarvin has for attracting attention, his work does not survive scrutiny. It is full of spurious syllogisms and arguments retconned to match his jaundiced intuitions. He has read widely, but he uses his knowledge merely as grist for the same reactionary fairy tale: once upon a time, people knew their place and lived in harmony; then along came the Enlightenment, with its “noble lie” of egalitarianism, plunging the world into disorder. Yarvin often criticizes academics for treating history like a Marvel movie, with oversimplified heroes and villains, but it’s unclear what he adds to the picture by calling Napoleon a “startup guy.” (He has favored the revisionist theories that Shakespeare’s plays were really written by the seventeenth Earl of Oxford and that the American Civil War, which he calls the War of Secession, worsened living conditions for Black Americans.) “The neat thing about primary sources is that often, it takes only one to prove your point,” he has proclaimed, which would come as news to historians.</p><p>Some of his most thoroughgoing critics are on the right. Rufo, the conservative activist, has written that Yarvin is a “sophist” whose debating style consists of “childish insults, bouts of paranoia, heavy italics, pointless digressions, competitive bibliography, and allusions to cartoons.” He added, “When one tries to locate what it is that you actually think, he cannot help but discover that there really isn’t much substance there.” The most generous engagement with Yarvin’s ideas has come from bloggers associated with the rationalist movement, which prides itself on weighing evidence for even seemingly far-fetched claims. Their formidable patience, however, has also worn thin. “He never addressed me as an equal, only as a brainwashed person,” Scott Aaronson, an eminent computer scientist, said of their conversations. “He seemed to think that if he just gave me one more reading assignment about happy slaves singing or one more monologue about F.D.R., I’d finally see the light.”</p><p>Intellectual seriousness may not be the point. Yarvin’s polemics have proved useful for those on the right in search of a rationale for nerd ressentiment and plutocratic will to power. “The guy does not have a coherent theory of the case,” the Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, told me. “He just happens to be saying something out loud that a lot of Republicans are eager to hear.”</p><p>It is not difficult to anticipate the totalitarian endgame of a world view that marries power worship with a contempt for human dignity—fascism, as some might call it. Like his ideological nemeses the Bolsheviks, Yarvin seems to believe that the only thing standing in the way of Utopia is an unwillingness to use every means possible to achieve it. He claims that the transition to his regime will be peaceful, even joyous, but fantasies of violence flicker throughout his work. “Unless the monarch is ready to actually <em>genocide</em> the nobility or the masses, he has to capture their loyalty,” he wrote in a Substack post in March. “You’re not going to <em>foam</em> these people, like turkeys with bird flu. Right?”</p><p>Yarvin’s strong opinions on how the world ought to work extended to this profile. Some of his suggestions were intriguing: he floated the idea of staging a debate with one of his ex-girlfriends, and invited me to follow him to Doha for a meeting with Omar bin Laden, one of Osama’s sons. Others were officious. At one point, he sent me nine texts objecting to my use of the word “extreme”—“a hostile pejorative,” he explained, which my article would be better off without. (He’d previously boasted several times in our taped conversations that he was more “extreme” than anyone in the current Administration.) A few days after the Coronation Ball at the Watergate Hotel, he wrote to <em>The New Yorker</em> to complain that I’d walked in without his publisher’s permission; he said that he hoped the incident would not turn into “Watergate 2,” and referred to himself as “certainly the most media-friendly person in the scene!” (Jonathan Keeperman, his publisher at Passage Press and the host of the ball, once suggested that the Republican Party should “lamppost”—that is, lynch—“the journos,” so this was not a particularly high bar to clear.)</p><p>One morning this winter, I woke up to twenty-eight texts from Yarvin expressing concerns about my reporting technique. “The problem is that your process is slack and I can feel it generating low-quality content—because it’s not adversarial enough,” he wrote. “When the process is not adversarial, I don’t know what I am contending against.” He briefly considered whether I was “too dumb to understand the ideas,” or whether I’d succumbed to the mental self-censorship that Orwell called “crimestop.” He urged me to watch “The Lives of Others,” an Oscar-winning film that depicts the relationship between an East German playwright and a Stasi agent who is tasked with surveilling him. The Stasi agent, he wrote, “can actually write up the ideas of the playwright, *without even thinking them* It is not even that he is ‘opposed’ to the dissident ideas. It is that he does not even let them touch his brain.” In the film, the Stasi agent eventually “cracks,” after he comes to sympathize with the playwright’s views. Yarvin, presumably, was the playwright.</p><p>He said that he was coming to see me, on the other hand, as an “NPC,” or non-player character. He proposed giving me a Voight-Kampff test, the fictional exam in “Blade Runner” used to distinguish androids from humans. His version would involve the two of us debating “the ‘blank slate theory’ versus ‘racism’&nbsp;” and recording the conversation. (“By ‘racism’ I mean of course human biodiversity,” he elaborated.) When I explained that my reporting process did not include submitting to on-demand tests, Yarvin sent me a screenshot of “August 1968,” W.&nbsp;H. Auden’s poem about the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia to suppress the Prague Spring:</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>The Ogre does what ogres can<br>Deeds quite impossible for Man,<br>But one prize is beyond his reach,<br>The Ogre cannot master Speech</p></blockquote><p>He went on to say that although he’d agreed to participate in this story because “no publicity is bad publicity,” he would now try to kill it if he could.</p><p>I was struck by the contrast between his messages and the coolheaded tone he’d recommended that Thiel and other friends deploy when handling the media. After the 2013 <em>TechCrunch</em> article identifying Yarvin came out, Balaji Srinivasan, the entrepreneur, proposed in an e-mail “to sic the Dark Enlightenment audience on a single vulnerable hostile reporter to dox them.” Yarvin dissuaded him. “What would Heartiste say?” Yarvin asked, referring to the white-nationalist pickup-artist blog “Chateau Heartiste.” “Almost always, the right alpha answer is ‘nothing.’ Say nothing. Do nothing.”</p><p>On a balmy afternoon in late February, Yarvin and his wife, Kristine, were driving down a country road in the South of France. They were accompanied by the documentarians, Brun and Díaz. “Where are we going, Kristine?” Brun asked from the passenger seat, turning the camera around to film her in the back beside me.</p><p>She said that she had only the vaguest notion. “Honestly, he just tells me everything last minute,” she explained. “It’s kind of like being a dog. You just know that you’re going in the car, and you don’t know if you’re gonna go to the dog park, or you’re gonna go to the vet, and you’ll find out when you get there.”</p><p>“Spontaneity,” Yarvin chimed in.</p><p>“That’s a word for it,” Kristine teased.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22211&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22211" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by John O’Brien</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>We were on our way to meet Renaud Camus, a seventy-eight-year-old novelist and pamphleteer, who, in 2011, published “The Great Replacement,” an incendiary manifesto that argued that liberal élites were behind a conspiracy to replace white Europeans with migrants from Africa and the Middle East. The title phrase has since become a rallying cry for white nationalists around the world, from Charlottesville, Virginia, where, in 2017, marchers chanted, “You will not replace us,” to Christchurch, New Zealand, where, two years later, a man who’d published a manifesto with the same title as Camus’s killed fifty-one Muslims.</p><p>As we crested a hill, the walls of Camus’s castle, Château de Plieux, loomed into view. “Does anyone know if he’s related to Albert Camus?” Yarvin asked. “I think he’s not related to Albert, but he’s a lovely, old, gay, literary Frenchman.”</p><p>Brun, who is Venezuelan, wondered what he would do if Camus “has a sign that says ‘No Foreigners Allowed.’&nbsp;”</p><p>“Well, are you here to replace us?” Kristine joked. Nobody replied.</p><p>Yarvin rang an impressive metal bell beside the door, and we were soon ushered inside by Pierre Jolibert, Camus’s partner. Upstairs, Camus was waiting for us with a bottle of champagne. With his manicured white beard and brown corduroy jacket, complete with a bow tie and gold pocket-watch chain, he looked like a nineteenth-century man of letters. Speaking perfect English, with an English accent, he made it sound as though he’d had no choice but to buy the castle, which dated from the early thirteen-hundreds, after his library grew too large for his small Parisian flat. That was thirty-five years ago. Now, acknowledging the stacks of books that were overtaking his cavernous study, he said that he was running into the same problem here.</p><p>Over several glasses of champagne, Yarvin fired a series of questions at Camus, though he rarely waited long enough for his host to give a full answer. What did Camus think of Philippe Pétain? Charles de Gaulle? Napoleon III? Napoleon I? Ernst Jünger? Ernst von Salomon? Ezra Pound? Basil Bunting? More than an interaction, Yarvin, the former trivia champion, seemed to want a pat on the head for his display of learning.</p><p>After we headed downstairs for lunch—strips of sizzling duck, a quiche Lorraine, red wine—Yarvin resumed his cross-examination. Did Camus rate Thomas Carlyle? Michel Houellebecq? Louis XIV? What would he say to Charles Maurras if he were alive today? What would Dostoyevsky have thought about the <em>Covid</em> lab-leak theory?</p><p>Camus let out a high-pitched giggle whenever Yarvin asked a particularly odd question, but he was baffled by his guest’s repeated inquiries about Brigitte Macron, the French First Lady, who Yarvin suspected was actually a man. “We are dealing with the most important thing in the history of the Continent,” Camus exclaimed, referring to the rise of nonwhite immigration to Europe. “What does it matter if Mrs. Macron is a man or woman?”</p><p>Brun asked the men to move to a window so that he could shoot them from outside. As Yarvin gazed at the patchwork of neatly tended fields below, he spoke about the Great Replacement as “one of the greatest crimes” in history. “Is it greater than the Holocaust? I don’t know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We haven’t seen it play out yet.” He’d been drinking since his arrival and seemed to be in an emotional state. “I have three children,” he told Camus. “Will they be basically lined up and marched into mass graves?” They had been discussing Jean Raspail’s apocalyptic novel, “The Camp of the Saints” (1973), which depicts an invasion of Indian migrants destroying European nations. Sobbing now, he continued, “I want my children to die in the twenty-second century. I don’t want them to experience some kind of insane post-colonial Holocaust.”</p><p>After dessert, coffee, and a rum from Guadeloupe, it was time for an evening stroll. Carrying a wooden cane, Camus led Yarvin through the small town of Plieux. Spring had arrived early: a cherry tree was blossoming with little flowers. As they passed the local church, Yarvin took out his phone to show Camus a photo of the toddler he shares with Laurenson. “The mother of that child was not my wife,” he said confidingly. A moment later, he was reading a poem by C.&nbsp;P. Cavafy, in tears once again.</p><p>When Yarvin and Camus went on ahead, the filmmakers paused to assess the day’s shoot. Brun said that Yarvin reminded him of the long-winded character in “Airplane!” who talks so incessantly that it drives his seatmates to kill themselves. We wondered what Camus was making of the afternoon. It wasn’t long before we found out. “If intellectual exchanges were commercial exchanges—which they are, to a certain extent—the amount of my exports would not reach one per cent of that of my imports,” Camus wrote in his diary, which he posted online the following day. “The visitor spoke without interruption from his arrival to his departure, for five hours, very quickly and very loudly, interrupting himself only for curious fits of tears, when he spoke of his deceased wife, but also, more strangely, certain political situations.”</p><p>It was dark by the time we all returned to the château. “Thank you so much for your hospitality and your duck and your castle,” Yarvin said, looking around. “How much money did you spend on it?”</p><p>Lovingly squeezing Yarvin’s arm, Kristine said, “You can’t just ask people that!”</p><p>Camus gave Yarvin some of his books as souvenirs, but Yarvin’s mind already seemed elsewhere. Tomorrow, he would fly to Paris to meet with a group of red-pilled Zoomers and Éric Zemmour, a far-right polemicist who once ran to be the President of France.</p><p>As we headed to the car, Yarvin was buzzing with boyish excitement about his performance. He turned to me and the filmmakers. “Was that good?” he asked. “Was that good?”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Currently public websites can probe a user's local network, perform CSRF attacks against vulnerable local devices, and generally abuse the user's browser as a "confused deputy" that has access inside the user's local network or software on their local machine. For example, if you visit <code>evil.com</code> it can use your browser as a springboard to attack your printer (given an HTTP accessible printer exploit).</p>
<p dir="auto">Local Network Access aims to prevent these undesired requests to insecure devices on the local network. This is achieved by deprecating direct access to private IP addresses from public websites, and instead requiring that the user grants permission to the initiating website to make connections to their local network.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Note:</em> This proposal builds on top of Chrome's previously paused <a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/blob/main/explainer.md">Private Network Access (PNA) work</a>, but differs by gating access on a permission rather than via preflight requests. This increases the level of user control (at the expense of new permissions that have to be explained to the user) but removes the explicit "device opt-in" that the preflight design achieved. We believe this simpler design will be easier to ship, in order to mitigate the real risks of local network access today. Unlike the previous Private Network Access proposal, which required changes to devices on local networks, this approach should only require changes to sites that need to access the local network. Sites are much easier to update than devices, and so this approach should be much more straightforward to roll out.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goals</h2><a id="user-content-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Goals" href="#goals"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Stop exploitation of vulnerable devices and servers from the drive-by web.</strong></li>
<li>Allow public websites to communicate to private network devices when the user expects it and explicitly allows it.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">An adjacent goal is that we want a path for browsers to be good stewards of OS-level local network access permissions. These OS-level permissions are increasingly common (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3179-understanding-local-network-privacy" rel="nofollow">on iOS, and more recently on macOS</a>) -- simply because the <em>browser</em> has been granted the permission (for legitimate browser functionality the user may want to use, like mirroring the contents of a tab on a local device) should not expose users' local devices to the risks of the open web.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Non-goals</h2><a id="user-content-non-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Non-goals" href="#non-goals"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Break existing workflows and services that rely on a public web frontend that can control local network devices.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>As long as there is <em>some</em> path forward we should be okay with breaking some use cases (e.g., iframe and HTML subresources that aren't explicitly sourced from local hostnames), but overall we want to minimize breakage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solve the local network HTTPS problem.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>As stated in the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/blob/main/explainer.md#non-goals">original Private Network Access explainer</a>: <em>Provide a secure mechanism for initiating HTTPS connections to services running on the local network or the user's machine. This piece is missing to allow secure public websites to embed non-public resources without running into mixed content violations, with the exception of <a href="http://localhost/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost</a> which is embeddable. While a useful goal, and maybe even a necessary one in order to deploy Private Network Access more widely, it is out of scope of this specification.</em></li>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use case 1</h3><a id="user-content-use-case-1" aria-label="Permalink: Use case 1" href="#use-case-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The most common case is for users who don't have any services or devices on their local network that expect connections from websites. Today, browsers freely allow JavaScript and subresource requests to these devices without any indication to the end user. Unless this behavior is expected by the user, users should not be exposed to this risk by default.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use case 2</h3><a id="user-content-use-case-2" aria-label="Permalink: Use case 2" href="#use-case-2"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Public web frontend for controlling or setting up local devices (such as an IoT device, home router, etc.).</p>
<p dir="auto">Device manufacturers want to be able to give users an easy process for setting up a new device, and one method that is used is to have a page hosted on the manufacturer's public website which then communicates with the device via the user's browser, explicitly relying on the browser's vantage point inside the user's network.</p>
<p dir="auto">This also reduces the complexity needed on the device itself -- for example, a smart toothbrush does not need to support a full webserver. Additionally, by being a public webpage under the control of the manufacturer, the setup page is always up to date.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Proposed Solution</h2><a id="user-content-proposed-solution" aria-label="Permalink: Proposed Solution" href="#proposed-solution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We propose gating the ability for a site to make requests to the users' local network behind a new "local network access" permission. Any origin that has not been granted this permission would be blocked from making such requests.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Address spaces</h3><a id="user-content-address-spaces" aria-label="Permalink: Address spaces" href="#address-spaces"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As defined in the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/blob/main/explainer.md#address-spaces">original Private Network Access proposal</a>, we organize an IP network into three layers from the point of view of a node, from most to least private:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Localhost: accessible only to the node itself, by default</li>
<li>Private IP addresses: accessible only to the members of the local network (e.g. RFC1918)</li>
<li>Public IP addresses: accessible to anyone</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We call these layers <strong>address spaces</strong>: <code>loopback</code>, <code>local</code>, and <code>public</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>(Note: The original PNA proposal called these <code>local</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>public</code>. Changing this was considered in <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1459537487" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/91" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/WICG/private-network-access/issues/91/hovercard" href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/91">WICG/private-network-access#91</a> but reverted due to already using the "private network access" name and values in headers implemented by sites and device manufacturers.)</em></p>
<p dir="auto">We note that <code>local</code> includes <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918" rel="nofollow">RFC 1918</a>/<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4193" rel="nofollow">RFC 4193</a> private/local IP addresses and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762" rel="nofollow">RFC 6762</a> link-local names (<code>.local</code> hostnames). (See <a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/4" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/WICG/private-network-access/issues/4/hovercard">discussion on the original PNA proposal repository</a>.)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Local network requests</h3><a id="user-content-local-network-requests" aria-label="Permalink: Local network requests" href="#local-network-requests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We define a <strong>local network request</strong> as a request crossing an address space boundary to a more-private address space. That is, any of the following are considered to be local network requests:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>public</code> -&gt; <code>local</code></li>
<li><code>public</code> -&gt; <code>loopback</code></li>
<li><code>local</code> -&gt; <code>loopback</code></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Note that <code>local</code> -&gt; <code>local</code> is not a local network request, as well as <code>loopback</code> -&gt; anything. (See "cross-origin requests" below for a discussion on potentially expanding this definition in the future.)</p>
<p dir="auto">A request is considered to be going to a <code>local</code> space if:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The hostname is a private IP address literal (per RFC 1918 etc.), or</li>
<li>The hostname is a <code>.local</code> domain (per RFC 6762), or</li>
<li>The <code>fetch()</code> call is annotated with <code>targetAddressSpace="local"</code> (see "Integration with Fetch" below).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In these cases we know <em>a priori</em> that the request is <code>local</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Similarly, if a request is to a loopback IP literal (e.g., 127.0.0.1), <code>localhost</code>, or the <code>fetch()</code> call is annotated with <code>targetAddressSpace="loopback"</code>, then the request is <code>loopback</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Separately, a request may eventually end up being considered a local network request if the request's hostname resolves to a private or loopback IP address. (We do not know this a priori however, and so cannot exempt these requests from mixed content blocking -- see "Mixed Content" below.)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Permission prompts</h3><a id="user-content-permission-prompts" aria-label="Permalink: Permission prompts" href="#permission-prompts"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When a site makes a local network request, the UA should check if the origin has already been granted the "local network access" permission. If not, the request should be blocked while the UA displays a prompt to the user asking whether they want to allow the origin to make requests to their local network. If the user denies the permission prompt, the request fails. If the user accepts the permission prompt, the request continues.</p>
<p dir="auto">To reduce breakage (due to the lack of local network HTTPS), the permission also exempts requests that are known to be <code>local</code> or <code>loopback</code> from mixed content blocking (see "Mixed Content" below.)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How this solution would solve the use cases</h3><a id="user-content-how-this-solution-would-solve-the-use-cases" aria-label="Permalink: How this solution would solve the use cases" href="#how-this-solution-would-solve-the-use-cases"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">For a user who is not expecting a site to connect to their local network, when <code>example.com</code> tries to call <code>fetch("http://192.168.0.1/routerstatus")</code>, the user's browser will ask whether or not to allow <code>example.com</code> to make connections to the local network. Since the user is not expecting this behavior, they can deny the permission request, and <code>example.com</code> is blocked from making these connections.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use case 2: controlling local devices</h4><a id="user-content-use-case-2-controlling-local-devices" aria-label="Permalink: Use case 2: controlling local devices" href="#use-case-2-controlling-local-devices"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">An existing site run by a device manufacturer that talks to a local device by making <code>fetch()</code> requests would potentially make minor modifications (for example, ensuring that they either use a private IP address or <code>.local</code> name when referring to the device, or adding the <code>targetAddressSpace="local"</code> property to their <code>fetch()</code> calls). When the site first tries to make a request to the device, the user sees a permission prompt. If the user expects the site to be communicating with devices on their local network, they can choose to grant the permission and the site will continue to function. If the user does not expect this or does not want to grant the permission to the site, they choose to not grant the permission to the site, and no local network requests from the site will be allowed.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integration with Fetch</h3><a id="user-content-integration-with-fetch" aria-label="Permalink: Integration with Fetch" href="#integration-with-fetch"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Fetch spec does not integrate the details of DNS resolution, only defining an <strong>obtain a connection</strong> algorithm, thus Local Network Access checks are applied to the newly-obtained connection. Given complexities such as Happy Eyeballs (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6555" rel="nofollow">RFC6555</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305" rel="nofollow">RFC8305</a>), these checks might pass or fail non-deterministically for hosts with multiple IP addresses that straddle IP address space boundaries.</p>
<p dir="auto">After we have obtained a connection, if we detect a local network request:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If the client is not in a secure context, block the request.</li>
<li>Check if the origin has previously been granted the local network access permission; if not, prompt the user.</li>
<li>If the user grants permission, the request will proceed.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">However, the requirement that local network requests be made from secure contexts means that any insecure request will be blocked as mixed content unless we can know ahead of time that the request should be considered a local network request.</p>
<p dir="auto">To make this easier for developers, we propose adding a new parameter to the <code>fetch()</code> options bag to explicitly tag the address space of the request. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="fetch(&quot;http://router.com/ping&quot;, {
  targetAddressSpace: &quot;local&quot;,
});"><pre><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"http://router.com/ping"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>targetAddressSpace</span>: <span>"local"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This would instruct the browser to allow the fetch even though the scheme is non-secure and obtain a connection to the target server. The <code>targetAddressSpace</code> should be either <code>local</code> or <code>loopback</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the remote IP address does not belong to the IP address space specified as the targetAddressSpace option value, then the request is failed. This ensures the feature cannot be abused to bypass mixed content in general. See "Mixed content" below for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mixed content</h3><a id="user-content-mixed-content" aria-label="Permalink: Mixed content" href="#mixed-content"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is a challenge in the combination of (1) requiring secure contexts in order to make PNA requests, (2) trying to load PNA subresources over HTTP (due to the lack of local network HTTPS), and (3) applying mixed content blocking. The Fetch specification applies mixed content upgrading and blocking steps well before we have obtained a connection.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can know ahead of the mixed content checks whether a request has a local target address if:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The hostname is a private IP address literal (per RFC1918 etc.), or</li>
<li>The hostname is a <code>.local</code> domain, or</li>
<li>The <code>fetch()</code> call is annotated with the <code>{ targetAddressSpace: "local" }</code> option.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If the request meets any of those requirements, we skip steps 6 and 7 of <strong>main fetch</strong> (upgrading mixed content and blocking mixed content) and mark the request as a local network request. Then, after obtaining the connection the local network access checks can fully run, and if the origin is not granted the local network access permission the request will be blocked. Additionally, if the request ends up not resolving to a local network endpoint, we need to block the request (as it should have been blocked as mixed content).</p>
<p dir="auto">A new parameter <code>targetAddressSpace</code> will be added as a <code>fetch()</code> API option, allowing a developer to specify that the request should be treated as going to a <code>local</code> or <code>loopback</code> address space. This allows for HTTP local network requests that are not private IP literals or .local domains as long as they are explicitly tagged with the target address space. This also allows the developer to deterministically request the permission.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integration with HTML</h3><a id="user-content-integration-with-html" aria-label="Permalink: Integration with HTML" href="#integration-with-html"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>Document</code>s and <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code>s store an additional <strong>address space</strong> value. This is initialized from the IP address the document or worker was sourced from.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integration with WebRTC</h3><a id="user-content-integration-with-webrtc" aria-label="Permalink: Integration with WebRTC" href="#integration-with-webrtc"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Local connection attempts that use WebRTC should also be gated behind the Local Network Access permission prompt.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the WebRTC spec, algorithms that add candidates to the ICE Agent already have steps that ensure <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#dfn-administratively-prohibited" rel="nofollow">“administratively prohibited”</a> addresses are not used. We can modify these algorithms to perform the following steps if the candidate has a loopback or local address:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Check if the origin has previously been granted the local network access permission; if not, prompt the user.</li>
<li>If the user grants permission, the algorithm will continue.</li>
<li>If the user denies the permission, we won’t add the candidate to the ICE Agent and it won’t be used when establishing a connection.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note that these checks are done asynchronously and don’t block resolving the methods where they are used i.e. setRemoteDescription() and addIceCandidate().</p>
<p dir="auto">The same checks should also be performed when connecting to STUN/TURN servers with loopback or local addresses.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integration with Permissions Policy</h3><a id="user-content-integration-with-permissions-policy" aria-label="Permalink: Integration with Permissions Policy" href="#integration-with-permissions-policy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By default the ability to make local network requests will be limited to top-level documents that are secure contexts. There are use cases where a site needs to be able to delegate this permission into a subframe. To support these use cases, a new policy-controlled feature ("local-network-access") will be added that will allow top-level documents to delegate access to this feature to subframes.</p>

<p dir="auto">HTML subresource fetches go through the standard Fetch algorithm, but will not have the ability to specify an explicit <code>targetAddressSpace</code>. This includes subframe navigations.</p>
<p dir="auto">For HTTP subresources, only "local names" (i.e., private IP literals or .local hostnames) are allowed for local network requests. This is required for resolving the mixed content problem (see "Mixed content" above, and see "Considered alternatives" for more involved methods that have been discussed).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Websockets</h3><a id="user-content-websockets" aria-label="Permalink: Websockets" href="#websockets"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>establish a WebSocket connection</strong> algorithm depends on the Fetch algorithm (<a href="https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/#websocket-protocol" rel="nofollow">in the updated WHATWG spec</a>), so Websockets should behave like other Fetch requests and trigger local network access prompts without additional work.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Service Workers</h3><a id="user-content-service-workers" aria-label="Permalink: Service Workers" href="#service-workers"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">The previously proposed <a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/blob/main/explainer.md">Private Network Access work</a> (PNA for short, also previously referred to as CORS-RFC1918) required a secure CORS preflight response from the private subresource server. If the preflight failed, the request would be blocked. If the request was for an insecure resource (e.g., due to the lack of trusted local HTTPS), they <a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/blob/main/permission_prompt/explainer.md">proposed a separate permission prompt</a> to allow the connection to a specific endpoint device <em>and</em> relax the mixed content restrictions on the connection.</p>
<p dir="auto">A lot of effort and developer outreach went into this effort, but it was never able to ship. Chrome currently has an opt-in mode behind an enterprise policy, and for a while Chrome shipped a restriction where private network access was restricted to secure contexts only (with a deprecation trial for developers who could not yet meet this requirement due to having HTTP-only private network endpoints). The previous plan was to build and ship the "mixed content permission prompt" to get these remaining developers out of the reverse origin trial.</p>
<p dir="auto">PNA met a lot of different developer and user needs, and in the "good case" (secure website talking to a local network device that had a publicly trusted TLS certificate and a "PNA-aware" server) could be quite seamless, since it required no user intervention. In the non-ideal cases, PNA accumulated a lot of workarounds to address use cases that would result in a permission prompt in many cases (a device chooser style prompt for insecure devices). For example:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Some routers filter out DNS responses mapping public domain names to private IP addresses -- this means that <a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/23" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/WICG/private-network-access/issues/23/hovercard">fallback to direct (insecure) private IP addresses is required</a> (and thus a permission prompt to bypass mixed content blocking), even for developers who provision publicly trusted certs to local network servers.</li>
<li>Some devices could not update to supply preflight, so the permission prompt was relaxed to allow this (<a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/blob/main/permission_prompt/explainer.md#ephemeral-permission">but only grant an ephemeral permission</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Even if the local device has opted in to connections from a top level site, we believe there is value in user awareness and control over this exchange.</p>
<p dir="auto">The use of preflights (without any user consent speed bump) also exposed its own risks. For example, timing attacks could be used to determine valid IP addresses on the network (<a href="https://crbug.com/40051437" rel="nofollow">crbug.com/40051437</a>, <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="822980731" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/41" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/WICG/private-network-access/issues/41/hovercard" href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/41">WICG/private-network-access#41</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Block all local network requests</h3><a id="user-content-block-all-local-network-requests" aria-label="Permalink: Block all local network requests" href="#block-all-local-network-requests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Given the risks of allowing sites to use the browser as an access point into the user's local network, we could simply block all local network requests (or just any requests that cross from a public address space to a more private one). This would be simplest, but would break many existing use cases, or require expensive workarounds.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Do nothing</h3><a id="user-content-do-nothing" aria-label="Permalink: Do nothing" href="#do-nothing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As more operating systems are implementing local network access permissions at the application level, we believe it is the duty of user agents to broker access to that privilege in order to be good stewards of it. A user may have legitimate reasons to grant access for their <em>browser</em> (e.g., Chrome's "cast this tab" functionality) but never want a <em>site</em> to be able to access their local network.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Alternatives for the mixed content problem</h3><a id="user-content-alternatives-for-the-mixed-content-problem" aria-label="Permalink: Alternatives for the mixed content problem" href="#alternatives-for-the-mixed-content-problem"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In our proposal above we recommend restricting local network HTML subresources to "assumed local" hostnames (such as <code>.local</code> domains) as a middle ground that meets developer needs, is relatively easy to deploy, and doesn't require complex technical or specification work to accomplish.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below are some alternatives that have been considered for addressing the mixed content problem.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Require secure local network subresources</h4><a id="user-content-require-secure-local-network-subresources" aria-label="Permalink: Require secure local network subresources" href="#require-secure-local-network-subresources"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In order to restrict local network access to secure contexts (which is necessary in order for a permission prompt to make sense), we need some resolution of the mixed content problem. The Fetch specification orders the "upgrade or block mixed content" steps <em>before</em> we have obtained a connection, and thus before we can know the IP address.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, some developers can work around this by getting publicly trusted certificates for their servers running on local networks (e.g., Plex getting Let's Encrypt certs under a different subdomain for every install) but it is a substantial engineering and maintenance burden. Even for developers that go to the trouble of using publicly trusted certificates, <a href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/23" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/WICG/private-network-access/issues/23/hovercard">fallback to HTTP is required in some network circumstances</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">This could be a "treat hostname as public" / "treat hostname as local" property that could be specified in a response header or in a meta tag (or a response header meta equiv).</p>
<p dir="auto">An initial idea was to add this on to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/" rel="nofollow">CSP</a>, however that was rejected due to CSP already being a bit overloaded and this not being a great conceptual fit for it. A separate "Sec-Treat-Origin-As-Private" header (or something along those lines) could be used to list origins that should be assumed to resolve to private IP addresses.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, it might be useful if such a header could be specified via an http-equiv meta tag (like one can do with CSP).</p>

<p dir="auto">Top-level navigations remain a risk after restrictions on subresource local network requests are in place. For an attacker, main frame navigations are noisier (compared to subresource requests and iframe navigations), although popunder techniques could potentially be used to hide navigations from the user.</p>
<p dir="auto">To prevent these, we could block or show an interstitial warning when a public page navigates to a local one. To avoid too much breakage or over-warning, we could maybe scope protections to just these cases. We might consider that "complex" requests such as POST navigations and GET requests with URL parameters are particularly risky. We might also be able to "defang" navigations by stripping the URL parameters to reduce the risk of exploitation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Consider all cross-origin requests to private addresses as "local network requests"</h4><a id="user-content-consider-all-cross-origin-requests-to-private-addresses-as-local-network-requests" aria-label="Permalink: Consider all cross-origin requests to private addresses as &quot;local network requests&quot;" href="#consider-all-cross-origin-requests-to-private-addresses-as-local-network-requests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We could instead define a <strong>local network request</strong> as "any request targeting an IP address in the local or loopback address space, regardless of the requestor's address space", while maintaining the exception for not blocking same-origin requests. This is a stricter / broader definition, and would likely cause more widespread breakage than our proposal to only consider requests that cross from one address space class to a more private one.</p>
<p dir="auto">This would also allow the mixed content relaxation that is granted when an origin is given the local network access permission to apply to <code>local</code> -&gt; <code>local</code> or <code>loopback</code> -&gt; <code>local</code> requests. This has been raised as a concern by developers in <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1795130611" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/109" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/WICG/private-network-access/issues/109/hovercard" href="https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/109">WICG/private-network-access#109</a>. Note that the status quo could continue here for now -- i.e., the top level page can get around mixed content checks by remaining on HTTP.</p>

<p dir="auto">A <a href="https://martina.lindorfer.in/files/papers/nwscanning_oakland25.pdf" rel="nofollow">recent study</a> (Schmidt et al., S&amp;P 2025) found that the <em>transitivity</em> of the local networks permission on iOS was the hardest for users to understand. It might be beneficial to scope the permission grant to an origin to the specific local network the user is currently connected to. Should the user grant permission to example.com on their home network, it may be reasonable for a UA to re-prompt the user if they bring their device to a different location and visit example.com again.</p>

<p dir="auto">PNA 1.0 worked to add a new <code>targetAddressSpace</code> parameter to <code>fetch()</code> to label the target address space of the request, so that mixed content checks could be relaxed (and then enforced if that connection ended up being public, to avoid it being a mixed content blocking bypass). The challenge is how to handle HTML subresources (e.g., img, iframe, etc.). We could add a new property to these HTML elements allowing developers to "label" them as public/local/loopback. This would function similarly to the parameter on <code>fetch()</code> and allow the user agent to initially bypass mixed content checks (and to know it should trigger the permission prompt). Currently we don't think this is necessary, as most use cases that require explicitly marking the <code>targetAddressSpace</code> should be able to switch to using <code>fetch()</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Security</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>While the local network access permission exempts requests to a priori known local endpoints from mixed content blocking, the page should still be considered to have loaded mixed content if such a request is made. This means that, for example, browsers can choose to show a different security UI for pages that make insecure connections to the local network.</li>
<li>Compared to the original PNA proposal, a site granted the local network access permission has more power to probe and connect to devices on the local network, regardless of whether those devices expect it.</li>
<li>There is some risk of users accepting the permission without understanding it (which couldn't happen with preflights).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compared to the original PNA proposal, no local network connections are allowed until the user has explicitly granted permission to a site.</li>

            <p>Since 2017, Apple have supported depth maps in the images its iPhones capture either via LiDAR scanners, 3D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_camera">time-of-flight</a> scanner-less LIDAR or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured-light_3D_scanner">structured-light</a> 3D scanning.</p>

</a></p><p>These depth maps, along with other imagery, are stored in High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) container files. These files can contain multiple images and vast amounts of metadata. This format was originally designed between 2013 and 2015 and Apple adopted its HEIC variant in 2017.</p>
<p>Since then, HEIC files are the default storage container format for images captured on the iPhone. But with that said, it is possible to use the JPEG format instead if things like depth maps and HDR are not of interest.</p>

This project contains scripts to separate out images and their metadata from HEIC containers as well as convert them into EXR Files. As of this writing, the project contains 374 lines of Python.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll walk through Finn's codebase with an example image from an iPhone 15 Pro.</p>
<div id="my-workstation">
<h2>My Workstation</h2>
<p>I'm using a 5.7 GHz AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. It has 16 cores and 32 threads and 1.2 MB of L1, 16 MB of L2 and 64 MB of L3 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case.</p>
<p>The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 4,800 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive.</p>
<p>The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock X870E Nova 90 Motherboard.</p>
<p>I'm running Ubuntu 24 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and ArcGIS Pro only supports Windows natively.</p>

<div id="installing-prerequisites">
<h2>Installing Prerequisites</h2>
<p>I'll use Python 3.12.3 and a few other tools in this post.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$<span> </span>sudo<span> </span>add-apt-repository<span> </span>ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

<p>Note, the <tt><span>libimage-exiftool-perl</span></tt> package installs <tt>exiftool</tt> version 12.76+dfsg-1 which was released at the end of January 2024. Since then, there have been at least ten releases that have addressed issues or enhanced exiftool's HEIC support.</p>
<p>The above version should work fine for the steps in this post but be mindful that any issues you encounter going forward might be resolved with a more up to date version of exiftool.</p>
<p>I'll be using <a href="https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc?tab=readme-ov-file">JSON Convert</a> (jc) to convert the output of various CLI tools into JSON.</p>

<p>That gain map will then be converted into RGB by duplicating the Y channel three times.</p>

<p>If there were any matte layers, they would be added here.</p>
<p>The <tt>final.exr</tt> file is then moved to a <tt>&lt;prefix&gt;_acesCG.exr</tt> file alongside the source imagery.</p>

	<p><em>By Mathilde Fichen</em></p>



<p>In the early days of computer vision, when memory was scarce and every byte counted, innovation thrived under constraint. “An Efficient Chain-Linking Algorithm,” developed at Inria in the late 1980s, is a brilliant example of this spirit. Now preserved and shared by Software Heritage, this compact yet powerful piece of C code showcases how elegance and efficiency went hand in hand in outlining the future of image processing—one pixel chain at a time.</p>



<p>The code resulted from research work carried out between 1985 and 1991 at Inria, by Gérard Giraudon (research and principal investigator), Philippe Garnesson (a PhD student), and Patrick Cipière (software engineer). Down in sunny Sophia Antipolis, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis">tech park</a> 20 minutes inland from Antibes, the team tackled computer vision with a distinctly local flavor. They called themselves PASTIS, a playful nod to the anise drink. Still, the acronym – Scene Analysis and Symbolic Image Processing Project (Projet d’Analyse de Scène et de Traitement d’Image Symbolique) – hinted at their serious mission.</p>





<h2>Preserving Inria legacy software</h2>



<p>The effort to preserve this source code is part of a broader initiative to preserve the legacy codes of <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">Inria</a> (France’s National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology), launched in 2023 in a joint effort of Software Heritage, Inria Alumni, and Inria. The project to preserve Inria’s legacy software started by reaching out to the institute’s community, past and present, through a survey (as detailed in our <a href="https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/hdap1420/release/1?readingCollection=21e62c05">iPres article</a>.)  This initial outreach informed a dedicated, <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/2024/12/10/preserving-inrias-legacy-software/">hands-on workshop in 2024</a>, which kicked off the practical work of exploring these historical codes. The current focus is on securely archiving the important legacy software we’ve identified within Software Heritage. Sharing the stories behind these codes with the broader community is just as vital.</p>



<p>The recovery of some code has been surprisingly straightforward. For instance, the code for “An Efficient Chain-Linking Algorithm” was readily accessible thanks to Gérard Giraudon’s personal preservation efforts on a local drive. That small success story is a reminder of how important individual initiative is for preserving digital work. Each piece of software recovered isn’t just code; it’s a piece of research history, carrying the stories of the people who created it.</p>

<h2>An algorithm for outlining images&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The chain-linking algorithm processes a 2D pixel matrix, typically the output of a contour detection step.</p>


<div>

<p><em>Raw image used as input for the algorithm. Source: Chaînage efficace de contour, n° 605, Février 1987, Gérard Giraudon</em></p>



<p>The output is a list of contour chains. Each chain in this list is a sequence of pixel coordinates that define a continuous boundary, ready for further steps like polygonal approximation or shape analysis..</p>

<p>Basically, the chain-linking connects the edge pixels to create smooth outlines, just like tracing the shape with a pencil.</p>



<h2>Computer vision in the 80s</h2>



<p>The mid-1980s aspiration of seeing robots hit a speed bump: computer vision algorithms weren’t fast enough. The core challenge? Real-time performance – the essential ingredient for giving robots camera “eyes” that could truly see and react. At the time, such a system was conceived as a pipeline of operations from image acquisition (one shot or video) to a decision-making system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal was to extract meaningful information from raw image data, typically represented as an 8-bit matrix of pixel intensities, and convert it into a graph in list form (i.e., from matrix to list). This process begins with detecting and recognizing shapes within the image, either in 2D or 3D, depending on the available data. From there, the system identifies objects and analyzes their spatial relationships, ultimately constructing a graph of semantic connections between them. This graph captures not just what the objects are, but how they relate to one another within the observed scene. In some cases, the analysis extends over time (3D + t), allowing for the interpretation of motion and dynamic interactions in a sequence of frames.</p>



<h2>Solving key memory issues</h2>


<div>

<p><em>The algorithm was first developed on a PerkinElmer Model 3250 computer, seen above in a brochure <a href="https://www.1000bit.it/ad/bro/perkin/PerkinElmer-3250.pdf">via 1000bit.&nbsp;</a></em></p>



<p>Another challenge in early image processing was the limited amount of short-term memory (RAM) available in computers. This made it essential to focus on reducing the amount of data stored and processed at any given time, while preserving important information.</p>



<p>Due to these constraints, the Efficient Chain-Linking Algorithm could only store three lines of the image at a time while reading it line by line. As each new line was read, the algorithm would build and extend chains of connected pixels on the fly, without knowing how those chains might continue in future lines. Once the entire image was scanned, a final processing stage merged pixel chains belonging to the same contour and resolved junctions or branching points. Importantly, this was done using just one full pass over the data, making it memory-efficient.</p>



<p>But the algorithm wasn’t the only clever bit. From a programming standpoint, the code’s true ingenuity lay in its dynamic memory allocation for storing the chain lists. Back then, predicting memory needs upfront was impossible, making Patrick Cipiere’s approach an elegant solution to an unpredictable challenge.</p>

<h2>Computer vision today</h2>



<p>With the dramatic advancements in computer vision, fueled by deep learning and the prevalence of large memory capacities, contemporary methods often involve storing the full image and constructing contour chains sequentially, possibly necessitating multiple passes over the data, one for each chain. Yet, even with today’s abundant memory, this algorithm retains its power: remarkable efficiency when every byte counts. By processing the image sequentially, storing only a few lines at a time, and building pixel chains incrementally without looking back, it offers a lean and effective alternative to the memory-hungry approaches now common.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>“If you’re explaining, you’re losing.” This line is usually attributed to Ronald Reagan. Whoever said it definitely had a point, and not just about politics. If you’re trying to explain to people, be they voters or bond investors, that you aren’t really as bad or untrustworthy as you seem, you’re already in deep trouble.</p><p><span>So when I saw Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c652f09-cfca-4078-9e2b-5fdacd772a75" rel="">declaring</a><span> Sunday that “The United States of America is never going to default, that is never going to happen,” my reaction was, “Uh-oh.”</span></p><p>And it’s not just me. For generations investors have treated U.S. government debt as the ultimate safe asset. Whenever disaster strikes — even if it’s disaster largely made in America, like the 2008 subprime crisis — bond buyers pile into U.S. Treasuries, because America is a serious country, and the idea that we would fail to honor our debts was unthinkable.</p><p>But are we still that country? Markets seem to have doubts.</p><p><span>Yesterday the Financial Times had a neat chart showing that there used to be a clear relationship between U.S. interest rates and the international value of the dollar. Actually, the chart was a bit </span><em>too</em><span> neat: When I set out to reproduce it, I found that the FT chose a time period during which the relationship looked especially clear. Still, it used to be true that when U.S. interest rates rose, so did the dollar, because higher yields pulled in foreign capital. But since Donald Trump returned to power, that relationship has broken down. Instead, we’ve seen a combination of rising interest rates and a </span><em>falling</em><span> dollar:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png" width="800" height="450" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:75158,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/i/165025603?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F288d0287-3f49-483e-bdb7-9bc89b35655a_800x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>As many have noted, what we’ve been seeing in recent months, with interest rates and the dollar moving in opposite directions, doesn’t look like what we normally see in the United States, or for that matter advanced nations in general. Instead, it’s the kind of thing one sees in emerging markets, where big market moves often reflect crises of confidence: International investors lose faith, pulling their money out, and capital flight causes both a falling currency and rising interest rates.</p><p>Here, for example, is what Mexico looked like during the “tequila crisis” of 1994-5, which involved both soaring interest rates and a plunging peso:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png" width="800" height="450" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61317,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/i/165025603?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d9f259a-0b9d-4799-8b3a-5480d474ef30_800x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Why are markets beginning to treat America as unreliable? It’s not just the debt numbers. Yes, we have large debts, but we’re an immensely wealthy country that, among other things, has lower average taxes than most of our peers. So we certainly have the resources to honor our debts.</p><p><span>But do we have the political will? Maybe even more important, do we have the political </span><em>seriousness</em><span>?</span></p><p>Like many economists, I’ve spent a lot of time analyzing the substance of Trump’s tariffs — how much they are likely to raise prices and reduce trade volumes. I’ve also written about the impacts of policy uncertainty, about how hard it is for businesses to make plans when they have little idea what tariff rates will be even a few months from now, let alone over the next few years.</p><p><span>But I wonder whether we’ve spent enough time looking at the policy </span><em>process</em><span> — how decisions get made in Trump’s America. Consider: On April 2, “Liberation Day,” Trump announced extremely high tariffs on many countries, the biggest tariff hike in U.S. history. The tariff rates — which differed hugely from country to country — were determined by a formula universally panned as stupid and ridiculous. And this tariff announcement was made with so little planning and forethought that it included taxes on imports from remote islands inhabited only by </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8xlj0485o" rel="">penguins</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Then, a week later, these tariffs were replaced by a completely different set of tariffs. How did that happen? Two of Trump’s cabinet members were able to beard him in the Oval Office while Peter Navarro, responsible for the original tariffs, was </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-tariff-pause-navarro-bessent-lutnick-b9e864fb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiBOSVk0wHQwGquJzeffoF7WWhmHKUg490AKNKAI7beYwEiwJ8au1jW-gBGH4A%3D&amp;gaa_ts=683dcdff&amp;gaa_sig=xIdEPFjIsG6tDwLXo4RJ5eBSP5faPCp3McPx6CkxYZ4dSRr3EJUr_ysQIYStqcwE5VL_0ZhadzjRqX58YVM2eA%3D%3D" rel="">in another meeting</a><span>.</span></p><p>Does this sound like policymaking in a serious country?</p><p>Then there’s the budget bill making its way through Congress. It’s a terrible thing, imposing savage cuts on social programs (and decimating U.S. science) while giving such big tax cuts to the wealthy that it will explode the deficit. But content aside, notice that this hugely important piece of legislation is being rushed through with essentially no hearings or analysis.</p><p>And when outsiders, including the Congressional Budget Office and a variety of think tanks — conservative and centrist as well as progressive — have put out the analyses the bill’s sponsors won’t, pointing out the likely effects on debt, health coverage, and so on, the G.O.P. response has basically been to accuse all of the independent analysts of being part of a globalist conspiracy.</p><p><span>Wait, it gets worse. The name of the legislation — not its nickname, its official title — is the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text" rel="">One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a><span>, because that’s what Trump has been calling it. Are we a mature republic with a normal head of state, or are we being ruled by Kim Jong Un in orange makeup?</span></p><p><span>Why, next thing you’ll be telling me that key policy decisions, leading to layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and many deaths around the world, have been made by a presidential crony whose erratic behavior may have reflected massive consumption of ketamine, Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/elon-musk-drugs-children-trump.html" rel="">Oh, wait</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Imagine yourself as a foreigner considering investing in the United States. You may well know that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains a “</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-30/trump-revenge-tax-would-lower-foreign-investment-in-us-scorekeeper-predicts?sref=qzusa8bC" rel="">revenge</a><span>” provision that would allow the U.S. government to impose extra taxes on foreign investors whose home countries have policies America doesn’t like. You probably know that one of Trump’s advisers has suggested the forced conversion of short-term debt into </span><a href="https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/turning-treasury-securities-into-century-bonds-is-a-dead-end/" rel="">century bonds</a><span>. Once upon a time everyone would have dismissed these things as stuff that couldn’t happen in America. Now? Who knows?</span></p><p>In a way, the amazing thing is that we haven’t seen even more capital flight. Presumably investors still can’t believe that America has changed so much from the responsible, reliable nation it seemed to be just a few months ago.</p><p>But I think they’re headed for a rude awakening.</p><p>MUSICAL CODA</p><div id="youtube2-pvlbrKKEPdA" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;pvlbrKKEPdA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pvlbrKKEPdA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<!-- Article Start -->
				
<p>Technologies that promise to track, manage, and supervise workers, increasingly using artificial intelligence, are getting entrenched in the developing world, according to a new <a href="https://home.coworker.org/little-tech-goes-global/">report</a> by Coworker.org, a labor rights nonprofit based in New York.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Audits of more than 150 startups and regional companies based in Kenya, Nigeria, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and India showed workplace surveillance is expanding in scale and sophistication, the researchers said. While large <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252521757/Microsoft-Office-365-has-ability-to-spy-on-workers">corporations</a> are <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/general/what-is-employee-monitoring.html">known</a> to develop surveillance technologies, a so-called Little Tech ecosystem of mostly unregulated, venture capital-funded startups and small vendors making these products has grown since Covid-19, the report found. The term “Little Tech” was popularized by the VC firm <a href="https://a16z.com/the-little-tech-agenda/">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, which argued that excessive regulation was stifling innovation.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/workers-managed-algorithms/">Algorithmic management</a> and surveillance tools are getting even more intrusive in gig work, and are entering offices and the informal labor sector as well, Wilneida Negrón, director of research and policy at Coworker.org and a co-author of the report, told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The pressure of the hyper-surveillance creates a lot of stress and creates a lot of uncertainty for workers. It brings a culture of suspiciousness,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investments by Silicon Valley-based VC firms led to a boom in tech startups globally after Covid-19, Negrón said. This has carried over to companies building bossware products in the developing world, she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The technologies include biometric tracking, AI-powered productivity monitoring, and predictive analytics, the report found. Worker data is continuously collected and analyzed by algorithms with the stated aim to improve hiring, evaluate performance, and optimize processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most managers in wealthier nations say algorithmic management tools improve their decision-making, according to a 2024 <a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2025/02/algorithmic-management-in-the-workplace_3c84ed6d/287c13c4-en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">survey</a> of over 6,000 employers by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. More than 90% of American managers used such tools, especially to reward or sanction employees.</p>



<p>Many tools are first deployed in Latin America, where labor laws are less strictly enforced, according to Ayden Férdeline, a tech policy researcher in Berlin and a co-author of the report.</p>



<p>“There is a Latin America testing ground for products,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. “If they are successful, they tend to be deployed in other jurisdictions, oftentimes with additional safeguards, sometimes not.”</p>



<p>Many workers are unaware of how their information is collected and used, Férdeline said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some gig workers in Kenya, Guatemala, and Brazil said bossware tools make them feel surveilled, and that they have less control over their work. In Porto Alegre, Brazil, Uber driver Carina Trindade told <em>Rest of World</em> she feels the app monitors her continuously, tracking her speed and braking patterns. The app has permissions <a href="https://dig.watch/updates/uber-starts-testing-tool-records-video-inside-car-during-rides">to access</a> her mic and camera, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uber spokesperson Gabriel Gabira said drivers have the option to record trips, and <a href="https://help.uber.com/en/driving-and-delivering/article/record-my-ride---frequently-asked-questions?nodeId=7f86cc51-2c3e-4888-8dc1-0ac2b6337b92">privacy terms</a> are followed to access the footage.</p>



<p>In Nairobi, Godfrey Sanya Wanga, a driver for ride-hailing firm SafeBoda, told <em>Rest of World </em>he felt the app undercharged a customer. “I really wanted to ask [the customer] to pay me more, but I remembered that I was being monitored and this would bring me trouble if the client reported me,” he said. SafeBoda did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Several nations have data protection and privacy laws, including Brazil, Nigeria, and Kenya. But enforcement is inconsistent, the report said.</p>



<p>Here are five current uses of algorithmic management tools. The companies mentioned below did not comment, unless otherwise stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. <strong>Timekeeping and attendance systems&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>What: Platforms that track the attendance of workers, often using geolocation and biometrics to verify presence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example: <a href="https://www.rankmi.com/es/productos/control-asistencia-y-turnos">Rankmi</a>, based in Chile, uses biometrics and geolocation to track workers. The platform also <a href="https://www.rankmi.com/es/ia-para-hr">gives</a> workers continuous performance feedback and evaluates job applicants using AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. <strong>Biometric and identity verification tools</strong></p>



<p>What: Tools that use fingerprint and facial-recognition checks, special digital signatures stored on a secure network, and official records to confirm a worker’s identity before granting access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example: Cincel, based in Mexico, provides <a href="https://www.cincel.digital/productos/verificacion-identidad/">identity verification</a> tools that do various checks including biometrics, and also cross-check against government databases and <a href="https://www.cincel.digital/productos/background-check/">blacklists</a>.</p>



<p>3. <strong>Performance and productivity monitoring platforms</strong></p>



<p>What: Dashboards that score workers using tracked metrics such as keystrokes, transaction counts, customer interactions, and task completion times.</p>



<p>Example: <a href="https://www.ahgora.com/">Ahgora</a>, based in Brazil, offers HR software that allows managers to continually “oversee team attendance in real-time” and that tracks productivity. It uses the data to offer predictions about work, such as potential issues with attendance, which can inform decision-making.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. <strong>Algorithmic management and predictive analytics</strong></p>



<p>What: Platforms that<strong> </strong>automate HR functions, such as hiring shortlists, performance reviews, attrition forecasting, and also unionization-risk scoring.</p>



<p>Example: Visier’s AI-powered analytics platform <a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/internal-mobility/">analyzes</a> HR data and provides insights, including resignation risk. The platform is used by global firms including Deloitte, Accenture, and Tata Consultancy Services.&nbsp;</p>
