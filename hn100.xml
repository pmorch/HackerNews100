<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <p> The main reason for IF Metall to take industrial action at Tesla is to ensure that our members have decent and safe working conditions. Over a long period of time, we have attempted to discuss with Tesla the signing of a collective agreement, yet without success. Now we see no solution other than to take industrial action.  </p><div> <figure> <img loading="lazy" alt="" data-interchange="[/contentassets/73054e884d124ce5b655db9d89e00a33/pexels-pixabay-258083-1140x570.jpg?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;mode=max&amp;saved=2023-10-16+09:06, small], [/contentassets/73054e884d124ce5b655db9d89e00a33/pexels-pixabay-258083-1140x570.jpg?width=1280&amp;height=720&amp;mode=max&amp;saved=2023-10-16+09:06, medium], [/contentassets/73054e884d124ce5b655db9d89e00a33/pexels-pixabay-258083-1140x570.jpg?width=1280&amp;height=720&amp;mode=max&amp;saved=2023-10-16+09:06, large]" src="https://www.ifmetall.se/contentassets/73054e884d124ce5b655db9d89e00a33/pexels-pixabay-258083-1140x570.jpg?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;mode=max&amp;saved=2023-10-16+09:06"> <figcaption> <span> <span> </span> </span> </figcaption></figure> </div> <h3>The Swedish labour market model</h3> <p>Collective agreements are the basis of the Swedish labour market model. This means that the trade unions and the employers' organizations determine the rules of the game in the labour market, without interference from the state and politicians. In Sweden, approximately nine out of ten workers are covered by collective agreements. </p><p>The terms of the collective agreement include wages, form of employment, occupational pension, working hours, vacations, and periods of notice. Thus, the employers benefit from industry-specific, long-term, and stable ground rules. </p><p>The collective agreements are negotiated on a sector-by-sector basis, and employees are guaranteed the wages and working conditions that are standard across the sector. This allows for companies to operate on a level playing field, while avoiding the risk of any one employer distorting competition in the sector by imposing poor conditions on their employees. </p><h3>Very few labour market conflicts in Sweden</h3> <p>Once a collective agreement is signed, both employers and employees have the obligation to keep the peace. This applies throughout the term of the agreement and ensures that no one can strike to obtain better conditions than those set out in the agreement. </p><p>As a result, the collective agreement ensures a Swedish labour market with very few industrial actions, conflicts or strikes. It is grounded on a long-standing Swedish tradition of over 100 years of negotiations between the labour market parties. The collective agreement creates a situation of clarity and order for both employees and employers, while avoiding conflicts. </p><h3>We strive for a swift solution</h3> <p>IF Metall signs approximately 200 local collective agreements a year in the industry sector.&nbsp; Very rarely do we end up in conflict. At the most part, we have one conflict a year, usually ending in a signed agreement. </p><p>IF Metall of course want our members at Tesla to have the same decent and safe working conditions as the members at other similar companies in Sweden. </p><p>Even though we have called for industrial action, it is our sincere hope that Tesla will finally start negotiating and sign a collective agreement for their plants in Sweden. </p><p>Tesla is a global leader in the green transition. We hope that they will be willing to express the same level of leadership regarding working conditions for their employees and our members. We strive for and look forward to a swift solution. </p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> IF Metall, Industrial metalworkers in Sweden, is the trade union organizing 300 000 members within the manufacturing and chemical industries, in mining, and in the automotive industry. </p>  </article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="dataContent">
                                    <p><span>When Maya Santamaria was opening a Minneapolis club in 2003, a city worker handed her a card for a Minneapolis police officer and said, “You’re going to work with this guy.”</span></p>
<p><span>To get a business license, a licensing employee told her she had to hire a certain number of off-duty Minneapolis police officers to provide security.</span></p>
<p><span>Why?</span></p>
<p><span>“Because they’re racist and we’re Mexican,” Santamaria said. “They didn’t want to let Mexicans have nightclubs.”</span></p>
<p><span>That’s her conclusion after seeing other similar-sized, white-owned venues escape the same mandate.</span></p>
<p><span>With over a million dollars invested, Santamaria had little choice. “You gotta do what they say,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, MPD “socked it to me,” she said. She started out paying the officers $40 to $45 an hour, always more than one officer per night. And they didn’t just work one or two hours; they charged a minimum of four hours no matter how many they actually worked, she said. The pay gradually increased to nearly $60 an hour.</span></p>
<p><span>“I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars,” she said. “There were many years I wasn’t making it, and they didn’t give a damn.”</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria was later required to come up with security plans outlining the number of officers needed per night. The officers insisted on getting paid cash, she said. She feared if she didn’t oblige, she’d lose her license.</span></p>
<p><span>Eventually, another officer helped schedule off-duty work: Derek Chauvin. He worked security at her club for 17 years.</span></p>
<p><span>“They were in charge and everybody had to go through them,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span>El Nuevo Rodeo became Minnesota’s largest Latino concert venue, and while there were a few brawls, “We never were a problem property,” Santamaria said.</span></p>
<p><span>MPD officers would usually sit in their squad cars, fully uniformed, and do crossword puzzles or chat with their girlfriends or spouses. Sometimes they’d leave to go help MPD with calls.</span></p>
<p><span>“They were gone half the time,” Santamaria said. “They were on my payroll but they were gone.”</span></p>
<p><span>She sold the club in 2019. When Santamaria saw Chauvin pinning George Floyd on the pavement in the video that shocked the world, she recognized both, because Floyd worked as a bouncer inside the club in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>El Nuevo Rodeo burned to the ground during the subsequent riots.</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria’s allegations about MPD off-duty work are echoed by the experiences of other business owners, documented in government reports and even remarked upon by the city’s new police chief, Brian O’Hara.</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.southwestvoices.news/posts/new-police-chief-candidly-talks-about-youth-violence-police-policies"><span> He </span><span>said</span></a><span> the system is “ripe for corruption,” citing a </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nj.com/hudson/2020/12/jersey-city-brings-back-off-duty-jobs-program-for-cops-after-halting-it-over-of-corruption.html"><span>federal investigation</span></a><span> in Jersey City, where a dozen cops were arrested due to widespread corruption of off-duty work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The timing is favorable for more rigorous oversight: MPD is soon to be operating under both state and federal supervision following damning investigative reports about racist policing, and O’Hara is a newish outsider who speaks the rhetoric of reform.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Changes to off-duty policy face a key obstacle, however: A 1997 court injunction restricts how much the city can manage officers’ side gigs. Given the injunction, the city can only seek major reforms via the collective bargaining process, which means if the city wants to change off-duty policies, it would likely have to give up something in return.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how the off-duty work program works: Some businesses — like large nightclubs —&nbsp;are required by the city to have security, which until 2020, sometimes had to be off-duty Minneapolis police officers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The city can also require that organizers of large events and businesses plagued with a lot of 911 calls also hire off-duty MPD officers. Businesses may also voluntarily hire off-duty officers for security and traffic control, and negotiate pay and hours directly with officers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The city doesn’t keep track of how much officers are working or how much they’re paid, or even have access to the contracts. Off-duty work often pays a lot more — up to hundreds of dollars per hour — than working overtime for MPD.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some officers are still paid in cash, increasing the risk of tax evasion. And, several business owners and Minneapolis officials said some small business owners —&nbsp;particularly those owned by immigrants — have been led to believe they must hire MPD officers, or risk getting ghosted by police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It was precisely this arrangement that caught the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice in its 2011 report on the New Orleans Police Department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, the MPD off-duty situation has parallels to NOPD before the feds arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The recent DOJ investigative report about MPD drew only a passing —&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/16/doj-mpd-off-duty-work-system-undermines-supervision/"><span>but still condemnatory</span></a><span> — reference to off-duty jobs. The DOJ was looking for racism. Some business owners of color say look no further.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h4>‘Instead of helping us, they’re hurting us’</h4>

	
<p><span>Basim Sabri, owner of a Somali mall called Karmel Mall and a Latino mall called Plaza Mexico on Lake Street, said he held a Cinco de Mayo party every year for 27 years to encourage people to come to the area and see that “It really isn’t a war zone, it is a beautiful place.”</span></p>
<p><span>For years, they never had police there, and then about a dozen years ago, he said, there was a shooting a few blocks away from the event. The city began requiring him to hire off-duty police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Lake Street has been tremendously damaged, and instead of helping us, they’re hurting us,” said Sabri, who once </span><a target="_blank" href="https://bringmethenews.com/news/developer-convicted-in-bribery-back-at-minneapolis-city-hall-pushing-reforms"><span>went to prison</span></a><span> for bribing a city council member.</span></p>
<p><span>The officer rates have skyrocketed, he said. He pays officers $150 to $160 an hour, and a “scheduler” also charges $15 to $20.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the big payouts, when he calls the police for help, they don’t always respond, Sabri said. About six weeks ago, a man came into his office with a gun and said he was going to shoot someone. They called 911, but the police never came, Sabri said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An MPD spokesman said “Going back to July 1, all calls we found relating to guns at Karmel Mall did have a police response, and none of the calls match the details” of Sabri’s account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jonathan Soto, owner of EME Antro night club at Fifth Avenue and Lake Street, hired MPD officers — including Chauvin — to monitor his parking lot for a couple of years, but stopped after Floyd’s murder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The officers wanted to be paid in cash, and would sometimes leave to respond to police calls, which benefited the city, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>“The city kind of liked that,” Soto said.</span></p>
<p><span>The FBI interviewed him after Floyd was killed, asking how much he paid officers.</span></p>
<p><span>Other business owners said the officers don’t always respond to problems right under their noses.</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria said the club next to her was tiny but “had to have their own cop,” who she described as an “old guy” who would refuse to help anybody from her club,</span></p>
<p><span>After several East African-owned stores on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis were vandalized in September 2019, Capitol Café owner Abdirahman Awad called his friend KB Brown, owner of a north Minneapolis print shop and a member of the Main Street Alliance of Minnesota, a group of progressive business owners.</span></p>
<p><span>KB Brown said the detectives were rude and disrespectful to Awad. Awad said MPD later told him he’d have to pay off-duty officers $145 an hour to provide security. He returned the next night and saw almost no police presence despite the alleged hate crime. In his view, MPD was sending a message that the cafe would only get protection if it hired off-duty officers.</span></p>
<p><span>“I felt so angry about it,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Kevin Brown, another member of the Main Street Alliance, said Somali business owners have told him MPD pressured them to hire off-duty officers, but they’re afraid to go public because they’ve been threatened with being “blacklisted” by MPD — or ignored when they call police for help.</span></p>
<p><span>“They get to make the rules,” Kevin Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span>Not all business owners feel that way, however.</span></p>
<p><span>When John Wolf bought his liquor store, Chicago-Lake Liquors, in 2000, he inherited the off-duty officers who did security there and continued hiring them. Some officers preferred to be paid in cash, but he said he didn’t do that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One officer scheduled all the shifts, which were 5 p.m. to closing. The cops roved around inside and outside the liquor store and sometimes left to respond to MPD calls — even though Wolf was paying them. Wolf didn’t mind.</span></p>
<p><span>“I had really, really good people working here,” said Wolf, who</span><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/nickhaltermpls/status/1295416454880219137?s=20"> <span>appeared</span></a><span> with Donald Trump at an August 2020 campaign stop.</span></p>
<p><span>But after Floyd’s murder, he made a business decision to stop hiring the officers because they were “pricey” and “hard to get.”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;“The situation became very complicated after George Floyd,” Wolf said.</span></p>
    <h4>
Former council member calls off-duty tactics ‘sleazy and illegal’
</h4>

	
<p><span>In the aftermath of Floyd’s killing, MPD went under a microscope, including off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>Some private businesses and school districts cut ties with the police. Within days, the Minneapolis Orchestra, Minneapolis Institute of Art and iconic club First Avenue said they’d no longer hire them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the few things the city does keep tabs on is sites for off-duty work, which must be approved. </span><span>Officers worked off-duty at about 500 sites in 2018, but that number has dropped to about 100 this year. About 200 officers have worked these gigs this year, according to </span><span>Regulatory Services Director Enrique Velazquez</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2020, the Minneapolis City Council stopped requiring off-duty officers at licensed events, and let them hire private security instead. In August 2020, </span><span>Velazquez </span><span>told the City Council only four businesses were being required to hire off-duty MPD officers. But some businesses were voluntarily hiring them because they were under the impression they had no choice, he said. Others thought if they hired police officers they would get “some level of preferential treatment,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Velazquez said this was discussed with Mayor Jacob Frey’s</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/01/31/mayor-frey-aims-to-rein-in-off-duty-police-work-creates-task-force/"> <span>off-duty task force</span></a><span>, which was launched in January 2020, met twice, and then dissolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Former Minneapolis City Council Member Cam Gordon said small businesses owned by immigrants told him they were led to believe they wouldn’t get police service if they didn’t hire officers. They didn’t want to speak publicly about it, he said, out of fear of retaliation.</span></p>
<p><span>Some people of color said they were told if they wanted to get police to respond to 911 calls, they would have to hire the cops for security, and it could cost, say, $800 per night in cash.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s “sleazy” and illegal, Gordon said.</span></p>
<p><span>Gordon said running a business using city resources — uniforms, guns, squad cars — without city management, should be considered a violation of the city ethics code, even though the city explicitly allows it, even paying insurance for off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>“It creates this whole system of unaccountability in terms of the money, especially if people are paid under the table in cash,” Gordon said.</span></p>
<p><span>A</span><a target="_blank" href="https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/Download/File/2859/Police%20Off-Duty%20Work%20Audit%20Report_Revised%2010092019.pdf"> <span>2019 city audit</span></a><span> noted cash payment was preferred by some employers and officers. The audit recommended ending cash payments and putting the city in charge of the program, but like so many other MPD issues, change has been glacial. MPD policy was updated to limit hours — including off-duty gigs — and prioritize overtime over off-duty work. MPD is instituting a new timekeeping system to track off-duty hours.</span></p>
<p><span>The city’s insurance liability for officers working side gigs can get expensive: The city was forced to defend Lt. Mike Sauro after he arrested, handcuffed and beat a 21-year-old college student in a kitchen. Sauro was off duty, working at a club on New Year’s Eve in 1991. A jury awarded the victim over $1 million in damages, the largest civil award in a police misconduct case in the city’s history at the time, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/police/uspo86.htm"><span>according</span></a><span> to Human Rights Watch.</span></p>
<p><span>After that, former Police Chief Robert Olson vowed to limit officers’ off-duty time, saying the city didn’t have the responsibility to make sure private businesses run smoothly. But 28 years later, the off-duty work continues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even amid the fury after Floyd’s police killing, the council made negligible changes to the off-duty program. Off-duty work is part of the police union contract. The Minneapolis Police Federation said during the last negotiation that any change to off-duty work was a non-starter. Now, negotiations are underway again on the next three-year contract.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h4>City may challenge 1997 injunction that ties its hands on off-duty issues</h4>

	
<p><span>Weeks after Floyd’s death at the hands of his officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo withdrew from labor negotiations, saying the contract would be reviewed with the help of outside experts.</span></p>
<p><span>But even as crime spiked, MPD began hemorrhaging officers, and a judge</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/order-requiring-minneapolis-to-hire-more-cops-reversed-by-court-of-appeals/"> <span>ordered</span></a><span> the city to hire more cops to comply with the city charter. Negotiations were suddenly focused on recruiting and retaining cops.</span></p>
<p><span>A coalition of police reform groups called Minneapolis for a Better Police Contract formed in 2019 to push city officials to use the police labor contract as a tool for reform.</span></p>
<p><span>“Off-duty work is corrupt,” said Stacey Gurian-Sherman, a lawyer on the group’s steering committee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The group made 22 recommendations for the contract, including limiting the number of days and hours officers can work, counting overtime and off-duty work. They recommended officers be paid for off-duty work the same way they’re paid for “</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/downtown-minneapolis-neighborhood-raising-money-for-more-police-patrols/"><span>buyback</span></a><span>” work in which neighborhoods or organizations pay for extra patrols. Those officers are paid $107 an hour, but payroll is handled by the city.</span></p>
<p><span>Aside from labor negotiations, the group says the City Council could make changes to make off-duty work centralized, fair and not subject to the whims of any one police officer. St. Paul, Duluth, Bloomington and Rochester all have such centralized systems.</span></p>
<p><span>In January, the City Council voted to review off-duty work, including how officers get jobs, how much they’re paid and how it affects MPD staffing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Council Member Robin Wonsley authored the legislative directive and is working on a policy that would charge businesses fees to recoup city costs, but the city is largely powerless given the 1990s era court injunction against changing the side gigs policy.</span></p>
<p><span>The 1997 injunction and settlement came after former Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton tried to put the system under the city’s control. The union argued changes to off-duty must be negotiated as part of the union contract, and the agreement says officers have the right to contract with outside employers. It also says officers aren’t allowed to act as brokers, though police seem to be ignoring the proscription.</span></p>

<p><span>It would be expensive for the city to take over the off-duty program, however, since officers would be paid through the city, at an overtime rate, and the pay would count toward their pension benefit calculation.</span></p>
<p><span>Mayor Jacob Frey told the </span><i><span>Reformer</span></i><span> off-duty work is “one of the more difficult and intractable” issues facing MPD, and the 1997 injunction is a major roadblock to change.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asked whether the city might try to get it revoked, he said, “We’re talking.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The police contract doesn’t give the city much authority over off-duty work, but ideally the city would have more managerial oversight, Frey said.</span></p>
<p><span>“It will be a topic that is covered,” during negotiations, he said. “It would make the process more fair and equitable both to police officers and businesses hiring them. We could better ensure officers aren’t overworked by factoring off-duty shifts into work scheduling. It would also streamline the process.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Frey said the city needs its officers working more on-duty, rather than off-duty, which he acknowledges will cost more. In other words, pump up their regular pay so they’re less inclined to take the lucrative off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>Minneapolis police officers start out making about $73,000 annually, but many are working mega overtime hours due to short staffing, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/06/15/minneapolis-police-officers-continue-to-rack-up-hefty-overtime-as-understaffing-continues/"><span>pushing their salaries sky-high</span></a><span>; 70% of officers made six figures last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neither the police union nor MPD responded to multiple requests for comment.</span></p>
    <h4>MPD system mirrors New Orleans, before reforms</h4>

	
<p><span>Many of the concerns about MPD’s off-duty system mirror those federal investigators found in New Orleans when the U.S. Department of Justice</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2011/03/17/nopd_report.pdf"> <span>found</span></a><span> their off-duty work — what they call paid details — facilitated abuse and corruption, contributed to officer fatigue and inequitable policing and was a financial drain on the city.</span></p>
<p><span>A vestige of the days when NOPD’s starting pay was among the lowest in the nation, paid details became so enticing — with some cops paid $300 to $500 a night to provide security for professional athletes — that some officers were more committed to the side hustles than their actual jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>NOPD Officers would “ghost” work after roll call, leave in the middle of an investigation, and double dip or use sick leave to do details, the DOJ found.</span></p>
<p><span>Last summer, the MPD — down 300 officers —&nbsp;struggled to cover shifts. Some officers were doing off-duty shifts rather than overtime for the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Only a dozen cops were patrolling downtown on weekend night shifts.</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/08/25/policing-minneapolis-amid-a-staffing-shortage/"> <span>One night</span></a><span>, as a police dispatcher tried to find a cop to respond to reports of a man pointing a gun at people, Lt. Kelly O’Rourke, who was in charge of policing the downtown area,</span> <span>pulled into a parking lot where an off-duty officer was sitting in a squad car, monitoring the lot near nightclubs.</span></p>
<p><span>The officers make two to four times as much pulling an off-duty shift, so they prefer to do that, O’Rourke</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/08/25/policing-minneapolis-amid-a-staffing-shortage/"> <span>said</span></a><span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span>The DOJ said MPD’s system</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/16/doj-mpd-off-duty-work-system-undermines-supervision/"> <span>undermines</span></a><span> supervision of officers because patrol officers manage disbursement of the gigs, deciding who gets the work — including supervisors. That creates a disincentive for supervisors to hold those officers accountable for misconduct, the DOJ said.</span></p>
<p><span>In New Orleans, the officers scheduling off-duty work got extra pay from businesses, making up to $200 per week, the DOJ found. MPD officers also get paid for scheduling off-duty officers.</span></p>
<p><span>And as in Minneapolis, some New Orleans business owners felt pressured to hire the police.</span></p>
<p><span>“Businesses sometimes feel they must pay for details to obtain the police services that should be provided by NOPD as a matter of routine policing,” the DOJ said. “In addition, businesses have no way to hold officers accountable when they do not show up for their contracted detail or perform poorly while on detail.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 2010, New Orleans banned cash payments and began centralizing the system, with</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.police1.com/local-government/articles/judge-new-orleans-cops-can-work-more-off-duty-details-to-combat-crime-tAg98hZYnlbfFplt/"> <span>mixed results</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If the city of Minneapolis fails to reform off-duty work, Gurian-Sherman, the lawyer pushing for MPD reforms, hopes the DOJ forces its hand.</span></p>
<p><span>“This is happening in full view,” Gurian-Sherman said. “The city has to stop looking the other way.”</span></p>
    <h4>‘It’s a racket’</h4>

	
<p><span>When it became clear that Chauvin and Floyd knew each other because they both worked at El Nuevo Rodeo, the whole world wanted to hear from Santamaria about her two former employees — one dead and one a cop charged with killing him.</span></p>
<p><span>Later, Chauvin was charged with evading taxes on what she’d paid him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Prosecutors said Chauvin failed to pay taxes on $95,920 he earned doing security for El Nuevo Rodeo between 2014 and 2019. In addition to EME Antro Bar, where prosecutors said Chauvin was paid $250 cash for 3.5 hours, he also worked off-duty shifts at Cub Foods and Midtown Global Market.</span></p>
<p><span>Chauvin pleaded guilty to two crimes in March, saying he didn’t report the payments due to financial problems, and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria — who owns a Spanish language radio station, La Raza 95.7FM — was interviewed by state investigators about her work with MPD.</span></p>
<p><span>She looks back on those days with disgust. She sensed the city licensing division was in cahoots with MPD to make minority business owners hire the police.</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s a racket,” she said. “You were damned if you did, damned if you didn’t … you were always having to break the law.”</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component-type="content-lock" data-load-strategy="exclude">
                                  <p>For the first time in a long time, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/layoffs-google-microsoft-salesforce-tech-industry-employees-work-family-lesson-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">tech workers are in a funk</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The industry of innovation was long an outlier when it came to employee satisfaction. Sure, the business goals were ambitious and the deadlines were daunting, but the allure of building the future drew eager, educated young people into tech — not to mention the high salaries, potential for stock-market riches, laid-back dress codes, and gleaming offices with meals and gyms. This rare combination of generous compensation and a reasonable work-life balance kept tech workers happier than employees in other industries. Before the pandemic, over 80% of tech workers routinely said they would recommend their company to a friend, according to Glassdoor company reviews, higher than almost every other industry we tracked.&nbsp;</p><p>All that changed in 2023: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-industry-fake-work-problem-bad-managers-bosses-layoffs-jobs-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Employee satisfaction among tech workers</a> has plummeted, falling in line with workers in finance and consulting — industries that often compete for the same pool of highly educated and in-demand talent. The growing angst among the tech class is palpable in anonymous online communities like<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/apps.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"> Glassdoor's Fishbowl</a>, in work-focused <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-linkedin-got-weird-work-life-blurred-lines-of-oversharing-2023-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">social media like Linkedin</a>, and even in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-slack-channel-for-workers-on-performance-improvement-plans-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">internal Slack groups</a>. Reading through the anonymous and semi-anonymous woes and tips from the Glassdoor community, it's clear that many laid-off techies and new STEM grads are struggling to find work, applying to more open roles, and in some cases, lowering their expectations for pay and job satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>One data analyst in Glassdoor's #JobsInTech group recently wrote: "Cannot believe how difficult it has been this year to get a job. Applied for well over 600 jobs since 1st June, had a fair few interviews, but not getting any further. This is killing me." A <a href="https://joinfishbowl.com/post_c1uc1myi35" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">project manager</a> expressed similar frustration: "I have been looking for over a year now. 25 years in IT. Sent out more than 900 applications. Reduced my rate in half. Do I just give up at this point and switch professions." These often raw sentiments stand in sharp contrast to the Goldilocks outlook painted by official labor-market data for the broader economy.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are plenty of explanations for this sudden vibe shift — from rising interest rates to stock-market swings — an inconvenient truth is that much of the tech sector's problems stem from the fact that the industry strayed from its roots of listening to the front lines. The collaborative culture at tech companies not only kept employees happy but also helped create better products for customers. The buildup of layers of management without also adding tech-savvy workers that build core products has resulted in a sclerotic environment that is weighing on employees. If the tech industry wants to get back to the flow zone of innovation, productivity, and workplace happiness, executives must restart conversations with the front-line workers that make their products — or risk losing what made Silicon Valley so desirable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Big tech, big money, big worries</h2><p>The easiest way for tech companies to explain away the sudden <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-job-site-blind-anxiety-burnout-recession-stock-crash-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sentiment shift</a> among tech workers is to place the blame on the curdling of the broader economic climate.</p><p>For over a decade, low-interest rates, steady consumer confidence, and an increasingly educated workforce created a business ecosystem that encouraged companies to make bold bets on the future. Tech companies, with visions of new ways of connecting the world and living our lives, were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this appetite for growth. To be credible, these bold bets required a patina of scientific innovation — Silicon Valley needed a phalanx of smart, savvy knowledge workers to deliver on the underlying promise of their new products. To woo these potential employees, tech companies had to lure them with cash or a better quality of life than the grueling but lucrative workplace culture of Wall Street firms. Over the past decade, the influx of investor cash facilitated by the favorable economic environment made those promises easy to keep.</p><p>That fertile ground was slowly salted over the past two years as the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher. By increasing the cost of borrowing money to fund risky ideas, rate hikes forced businesses across the economy to reevaluate the bets on their balance sheets and cut projects deemed unlikely to bring in profits in the short term. In an industry like tech, where companies regularly make multibillion-dollar bets on emerging technology that may not produce real profits for years, that's a lot of reevaluation.&nbsp;</p><p>Several prominent tech companies have taken an uncompromising stance to limit growth in compensation costs and enforce in-office work mandates: Microsoft <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-wont-raise-salaries-for-full-time-employees-this-year-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">announced</a> in May that full-time employees would not receive raises this year, and Amazon has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-andy-jassy-rto-office-policy-employee-jobs-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">notified</a> employees reluctant to return to the office that their jobs might be at stake. Winter and spring layoffs this year stretched some teams thin, and the looming threat of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-ai-technology-end-of-coding-software-developers-jobs-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">generative AI</a> is sparking fears of job insecurity among workers who long viewed themselves as the winners in the enduring race between man and machine.&nbsp;</p><p>This turn in the economy is starting to weigh on the tech job market. Despite largely pristine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jobs-unemployment-rate-labor-market-september-report-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">headline jobs data</a>, the tech job market has become a distinct pocket of weakness. The labor market has softened sharply in at least two prominent tech communities — <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/conversation-starter-tech-metro-recessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">the California Bay Area and Austin, Texas</a> — where the local unemployment rate has increased by more than half a percentage point over the past year, a common signal of imminent recession. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/jobs-report-preview-september-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Unemployment claims</a> from information-sector workers have doubled compared to a year ago — and, pandemic aside, are now on par with the highest levels since 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>But the truth is that the pressures of the broader economy are not the main cause of a sag in tech-worker satisfaction. Many other industries have felt the squeeze of higher interest rates and their spillover to consumer spending, but none have seen their employees' satisfaction dip as significantly as Silicon Valley. The underlying reasons for the unhappiness among tech workers have been building for some time — and they strike at the very heart of the industry's once-vaunted conventions.</p><h2>From hoodies to neckties</h2><p>At the core of the tech industry's current malaise is an aging corporate culture. Glassdoor employee-satisfaction data reveals two big changes that have been unfolding over the past several years, predating but accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the "<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/jobs-report-preview-february-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">managementization</a>" of tech. Over the past five years or so, the ratio of front-line workers to managers has deteriorated — meaning there are more managers for every "maker" in tech than before. Earlier this year, before layoffs aimed to flatten organizational hierarchies, the number of front-line jobs was more or less where it stood on the eve of the pandemic, while the number of managerial jobs was 9% higher. Economy wide, there were on average 6.6 front-line workers per manager in 2018 and 2019, but post-pandemic, the ratio dropped to 6 to 1.</p><p>While the trend is not unique to the tech industry — it's also visible in industries like finance and healthcare — it's a sharp contrast from the historically flat hierarchies at companies that fueled the 1990s tech boom and a jarring shift for employees who were used to a more direct line to the top. Of course, many tech managers also perform front-line tasks such as coding or data analysis, and some managers manage processes instead of people (for instance, transportation managers). It's possible that as tech companies have grown into more complex organizations, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-managers-great-flattening-organization-meta-tech-layoffs-firing-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">more management layers</a> are necessary. But the underlying result is the same: The people building the products are increasingly removed from the people making strategic decisions.</p><p>Second, it's an open secret that the best jobs in tech aren't necessarily technical. The workers at big tech companies who report the highest job satisfaction in Glassdoor reviews aren't in technical or builder roles like engineering or science. While non-STEM roles — for instance, in human resources and marketing — can and often do contribute to cutting-edge technological innovations, they are more likely to focus on supporting and enabling the core technology.</p><p>It's worth asking why the employees furthest from the technical frontier are happier in their jobs than those making the actual products. Perhaps it's that they are more grateful for the opportunity, suspecting that their job opportunities might be bleaker in other industries — a sentiment suggested by the writer Kristi Coulter in her recently published <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374600907/exitinterview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">memoir</a> about her decade-long career at Amazon. Or perhaps the rankings reflect overextended and under-resourced technical ranks.&nbsp;</p><p>The unavoidable truth is that working at the most familiar standard-bearers of tech has become a lot like working elsewhere in the economy: High pay is usually justified by a more demanding schedule and longer workdays (and often "work weekends"). This evolution isn't unusual — it's the well-trodden path for past generations of industry innovators. With time, they become bigger, more stable, and more routine. The tech titans of prior generations — from Ford Motor Company in the 1920s to Intel in the 1990s — were once workplace innovators but came to be known as boring, corporate giants as they aged into staples of the global economy.</p><h2>Can tech turn it around?</h2><p>All is not lost for the tech industry, however. Recapturing the spark of innovation among employees will require executives to recalibrate their organizational compass: flatten org structures, focus on the long horizon so that employees have the opportunity to feel stable in their roles, and re-prioritize investment in the core technical talent that drives the development of crucial products.&nbsp;</p><p>Fundamentally, it's about listening to and elevating the voices of front-line employees. When the workers directly involved in creating the technology are allowed to speak up, unconventional, bold ideas tend to bubble up. By asking questions beyond the senior management echo chamber, engaging employees one-on-one, and creating spaces for employees to voice their hopes and hunches in psychologically safe forums, tech companies can not only reignite their workplace culture but also better serve customers.&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of productive communication has perhaps become harder in an era of remote work — but we shouldn't pretend that it comes effortlessly in the office either. It's a starkly different, humbler skill set from the TED Talk theatrics and fundraising prowess that drove tech success over the past decade. To shake tech workers out of their recent funk and get the industry back on a path of innovation, companies need to start listening to their builders again and empower them to do what they do best.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/aaron-terrazas" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Aaron Terrazas</a> is chief economist at Glassdoor, providing research, analysis and commentary on today's evolving workplace and fast-changing labor market.</em></p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>A Medium story first popped in to my feed last year and it got me thinking about the state of how the tech industry interviews and evaluates candidates.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-1.png" alt="Medium article focused on why many senior devs fail leetcode interviews">
<em><a href="https://medium.com/the-coding-diaries/why-experienced-programmers-fail-coding-interviews-b22210ba343">https://medium.com/the-coding-diaries/why-experienced-programmers-fail-coding-interviews-b22210ba343</a></em></p>
<p>Recently, a friend shared with  me his plans to take some time off to study for common leetcode problems to practice as he was planning his applications for FAANG companies.</p>
<p>Is that really what one wants to select for when hiring for a new member of an engineering team - the person that had the most free time to invest in studying leetcode challenges?</p>
<p>Having been on both sides of the coin, I have always had a dislike for leetcode exercises as an evaluation mechanism for technical candidates for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As much as solving algorithmically complex problems is fun and rewarding, the reality is that for most productive developers, most of our coding time isn’t really focused on this type of work.</li>
<li>Most of us regularly reference StackOverflow, documentation, and other online resources when solving challenging coding problems day-to-day. We’ll chat with peers and whiteboard different ideas. With the explosion of AI coding tools, many devs are already including Copilot and ChatGPT into their workflows.</li>
<li>Many types/classes of complex problems, we may only code once or twice in a blue moon. For example, I have a complex Firestore abstraction layer that I wrote once, that I just keep reusing. The point of writing complex, high-abstraction code is so that you only write this type of code once.</li>
<li>It creates an artificial situation that induces stress. Few of us code while others are watching over our shoulders. And fewer of us are coding against a fixed time constraint in real life. For hard problems, I may go for a walk, talk to a co-worker, research algorithms, build small toy codebases first, etc. Quite honestly, most of us probably create our best code in isolation when we’re in a flow state; the exact opposite of a high-stakes interview.</li>
<li>Developers code best in their own environments with their own tools. Using an unfamiliar tool can be disorienting and again, add to stress and anxiety as someone watches.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this means that <em>using this approach could end up measuring for all the wrong metrics or measuring for metrics that have very little impact on how well a candidate can productively fit into a team</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, as teams become more reliant on generated code to increase productivity - whether Copilot or GPT-I think that the ability to quickly read that code and identify subtle defects in the context of the larger application or domain space becomes more valuable.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-2.gif" alt="GPT generating a solution to N-Queens">
<em>GPT generating the solution to a common leetcode challenge N-Queens</em></p>
<p>A while back, I had the opportunity to participate in an interview which was structured around <em>reviewing code</em> rather than writing code. It was a revelation. Rather than focus on coding exercises, using code reviews as interview can be a better way to evaluate software engineering candidates.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-reasons-to-consider-code-review-as-interview">8 Reasons to consider code review as interview</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons why I think code reviews make for an inherently better technical interview experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the age of AI, an emerging reason is that using AI generated code is a source of risk in terms of performance, security, and internal best practices (especially important in regulated industries).  Being able to effectively evaluate code in the context of the larger codebase becomes an even more important skill when relying on piecemeal generated code.</li>
<li>It is a better reflection of the day-to-day activities that engineers - especially more senior roles - engage in. Providing effective guidance and quality feedback to peers and especially junior team members can improve overall productivity and output quality in the long run.</li>
<li>It provides a more holistic view of how a candidate reasons, thinks, and communicates; in other words, it provides a better picture of the candidate as a teammate on the whole. This includes insights into the candidate’s depth of experience.</li>
<li>Code reviews are inherently more collaborative whereas writing code tends to be a more isolated activity (personally, I tend to code best in complete silence in evening hours). Code reviews are perhaps a better indicator of how it feels to work together with a candidate rather than having the candidate solve a technical puzzle.</li>
<li>There is more subjectivity to a code review; it’s not black or white. It naturally provides more opportunities for discussion and interpretation. It also provides more opportunities to arrive at outliers since there’s no single “solution”. For 5 candidates, you’ll get 5 unique variations whereas common algorithmic challenges may have a small number of optimal responses.</li>
<li>It is hard to “cheat” using generative AI or studying for leetcode problems.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is better suited for evaluating technical roles that have a bias towards reading code versus writing code. This includes engineering managers, architects, and support staff.</li>
<li>It better reflects how a candidate is going to be spending their first few days or weeks anyways: learning the existing system by reading through the code. Doesn’t it make sense to measure how well they can do this rather than how quickly they can solve N-Queens?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
<p>If you’re convinced, the next step is to think about different strategies to use when setting up your code review. There are a few strategies that you can mix and match to measure the range of a candidate.</p>
<p>A common thread to each of the strategies is that rather than inventing - or worse finding - a time-boxed puzzle to solve, an approach focused on code reviews lends itself to using bits and pieces of an existing codebase and actual problems that a team has been working on.</p>
<h3 id="au-naturel">“Au naturel”</h3>
<p>Take actual, relevant and interesting parts of an active codebase as-is and use those as the context for review. Data access, exception handling, input handling - these all make for great points of focus to see a candidate’s feedback on an existing codebase and how quickly they can read and understand your existing code.</p>
<h3 id="bug-hunter">Bug hunter</h3>
<p>Intentionally introduce some logical flaw or defect and see if a candidate can spot it. A good idea is to go back and find recent bugs that were solved and pull the source before the fix was applied. Can the candidate identify the root cause? How would the candidate suggest resolving the defect? How does that response differ from the one that was implemented?</p>
<h3 id="refactor-andredesign">Refactor and&nbsp;redesign</h3>
<p>Recently completed a refactor or planning a refactor? Use the code prior to the refactor as the context and see how the candidate thinks about the code before the refactor and what strategies a candidate would use to plan and execute the refactor. See if the candidate can identify why a refactor would be desired and evaluate the sophistication of their approach; you might be surprised and find an entirely novel alternate approach!</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when a candidate is joining a brownfield project.</p>
<h3 id="performance-oriented">Performance oriented</h3>
<p>Find code that was recently fixed for a performance issue and see if the candidate can spot why a piece of code might be slow. See if the candidate can propose an algorithm, alternate design, or fix to improve the performance of the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Include existing SQL DDL schema and common natural language queries that the application will perform.  Remove the index definitions and see if the candidate can propose indices or alternate designs to improve performance.</p>
<p>Instead of asking about the principles of Big-O notation, see if the candidate can actually spot some <code>O(n^2)</code> code or <code>N+1</code> issues in data access code!</p>
<h3 id="test-focused">Test focused</h3>
<p>Share a fragment of code and a set of unit tests for the code. Are all the cases covered? Are there cases not covered? How could the unit tests be improved? This perspective may be more important in the coming age of AI generated code: understanding the domain space and use case and how to write high coverage unit tests - or evaluating the completeness of generated unit tests - becomes a key skill.</p>
<h3 id="security-hawk">Security hawk</h3>
<p>Use code that has subtle security flaws and see if the candidate can identify said flaws. Rather than merely asking what an XSS or SQL injection attack is, see if the candidate can identify such flaws in code by using code that lacks protection against said attacks. Again, as teams come to rely on AI-generated code, having the experience to identify potential security flaws in the generated code becomes more important.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best practices</h3>
<p>For more senior positions, focusing on best practices is a great way to find candidates that can identify, communicate, and teach best practices to more junior candidates and direct reports.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="try-coderevapp">Try CodeRev.app</h2>
<p>If you’re sold on the idea like me, check out my new project <a href="https://coderev.app/">CodeRev.app</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-3.png" alt="CodeRev screenshot">
<em>CodeRev.app candidate workspace.</em></p>
<p>CodeRev.app is a (free) lightweight tool that’s designed to facilitate code review as interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why use it instead of CodeSandbox, Stackblitz, or GitHub?</p>
<ul>
<li>CodeRev is tightly focused on reading and commenting rather than coding whereas GitHub only has comments on PRs</li>
<li>CodeRev works great with fragments of code and you can mix and match different files without trying to make the project as a whole actually run. Just throw in whatever files make for interesting discussion!</li>
<li>CodeRev eliminates boilerplate that is inherent in modern projects one might be tempted to load into CodeSandbox or Stackblitz. Just pick the interesting source files and put them into CodeRev.</li>
<li>CodeRev lets you quickly toggle between the responses from different candidates so you can compare and see the insights and feedback they provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s still early stage so let me know if you run across bugs or you have ideas!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>In <em>The End of Average</em>, Todd Rose writes:</p>
<blockquote>
Just about any meaningful human characteristic - especially talent - consists of multiple dimensions. The problem is that when trying to measure for talent, we frequently resort to the average, reducing our jagged talent to a single dimension like a score on a standardized test or grades or a job performance ranking.
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, if we select for a narrow set of problem solving skills, then we end up selecting against an “average” of candidates who have simply studied and prepared to achieve against those dimensions and miss out on many candidates whose <em>jagged talents</em> contribute to the character and productivity of a team.</p>
<p>Incorporating code reviews as interview as part of a team’s repertoire can help better measure a wider range of a candidate’s skill than leetcode alone.</p>
<p>As our industry shifts and the profession comes to rely more on AI tools like Copilot and GPT to generate code for productivity gains, there is a greater importance on finding ways to identify jagged talent; robotically solving algorithmic puzzles becomes the lesser of the qualities we want in a candidate. Instead, perhaps the key skill is the ability to read and review that code for correctness, best practices, and security.</p>
<p>Replacing leetcode with code reviews as interview can help teams not only better measure candidates on the whole, but also prepare for this shift in how we approach building software by focusing on more relevant skills and those aspects of a candidate that make for a better <em>human</em> teammate.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We have come to a point where end-to-end encrypting all your private data and private communications
is no longer an ethical option, but an ethical <em>duty</em>.</p><p>Imagine a new law was being discussed in your country to make it mandatory that all buildings have glass walls.
All houses would be transparent.
The (stated) goal of the law is to make it harder for criminals to hide their wrongdoings.
It would be difficult to stock up on illegal drugs or to operate an industrial printer of counterfeit money without
the police (and, incidentally, some of your neighbours) noticing.
Domestic violence and child abuse would be visible through transparent walls.
Let's say that the new law will allow you to have a shower curtain, a little folding screen in your bedroom,
and blankets on your bed.
Except for those meagre provisions, assume that your government (and random passers-by, and potentially anyone)
will be able to watch what you do at all times.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.tripu.info/assets/files/glass-building-85ed58b05b74f9885df3562f85c6fbb6.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="An illustration for this post generated by Stable Diffusion" src="https://blog.tripu.info/assets/images/glass-building-85ed58b05b74f9885df3562f85c6fbb6.png" width="1152" height="768"></a></p><p>Now imagine you are a regular, law-abiding citizen who can afford to lead a <!-- -->“<!-- -->transparent<!-- -->”<!-- --> life most of
the time, and manage to get some limited <!-- -->“<!-- -->privacy<!-- -->”<!-- --> only occasionally.
Given how hard it is for individual citizens to steer the behemoth that is the State and its government,
and since
<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/04/7-reasons-why-ive-got-nothing-to-hide-is-the-wrong-response-to-mass-surveillance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you personally <!-- -->“<!-- -->have nothing to hide<!-- -->”</a>,
you could be tempted to simply give up and prepare to obey the new law.</p><p>But <em>you should resist</em>.</p><p>You should strongly oppose that bill and help build resistance to it.
Most importantly, if such a law ever came into effect you would be morally <em>obliged</em> to disobey, to boycott.</p><p>Under such a law, good people in need of privacy would be at risk.
Whistleblowers, investigative journalists, clinical doctors and psychologists and other health professionals,
lawyers, the courts, the police, the military and spies absolutely need secrecy (to varying degrees, and at different times)
to do their job.
Some scientists and engineers need strong privacy, too (those in charge of vital infrastructure like the electrical grid
or the backbone of the internet, gain-of-function research, nuclear tech, or cybersecurity).
And some people need secrecy to be <em>physically safe</em>: prosecuted minorities, sexual dissidents, opposition leaders,
activists, heterodox thinkers, people who are divergent in many ways.</p><p>Enter the European Commission's <!-- -->“<!-- -->Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a heterogeneous group of 27 countries</a>.
Some of its member states, like Hungary and Poland, are still immature barely-liberal regimes with more than
a whiff of political repression
(<a href="https://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/DI-final-version-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“<!-- -->flawed democracies<!-- -->”</a>).
As recently as last year there was strong evidence of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/10/eu-close-to-launching-committee-of-inquiry-into-pegasus-spyware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“<!-- -->attempts by national security services to illegally access information on political opponents through their phones<!-- -->”</a>
in those two countries.
But not even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#Politics_and_government" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most robust democracy in the world (another European country)</a>
should be trusted with a fundamentally unethical law like Chat Control.</p><p>In light of alarming proposals like Chat Control, everyone should make the effort to escape the opaque protocols and
the convenient Trojan Horses that are popular social networks and messaging services,
and make their daily communication truly private.
We should make strong encryption a staple of our digital life.</p><p>We should all use PGP, SSL or equivalent tools; VPNs, Tor and/or SSH tunnelling; IPFS, or other distributed
file systems<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->—<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->and ditch proprietary OS's in favour of Linux or truly free Android distros.
We should switch to Protonmail or similar webmail;
to Matrix, Signal or similar messaging.
Ad-blocking, URL cleansing and third-party cookie rejection should be the default for everyone.
Those tools and techniques should cease to be arcane nice-to-haves for nerds:
we must get more non-technical people onboard.</p><p>All this is a moral imperative to those of us who have the ability and the means to follow this strategy and to educate others about it.</p><p>As long as we still have access to computing resources, free software and some form of encrypted tunnelling,
we can resist: those are the minimum requirements for a humanist digital environment to sustain itself.
In the future it might be that by developing and using some software and exchanging certain sequences of bits we will be breaking some law.
Such a law would be wrong and unjust.</p><p>More than twenty years ago, some of us were sprinkling our regular e-mail with words like <!-- -->“<!-- -->iraq<!-- -->”<!-- -->,
<!-- -->“<!-- -->bomb<!-- -->”<!-- --> and <!-- -->“<!-- -->attack<!-- -->”<!-- -->, often on a line appended to the end of messages, in response to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk about <abbr title="Three Letter Agencies">TLAs</abbr> scanning all digital communication</a>
in the wake of the <!-- -->“<!-- -->war on terror<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
I don't know if that strategy was effective in the end, but the goal we pursued with it was right.</p><p>In the same spirit, today everyone should communicate safely in private, if only to erect
a collective smoke screen that will confuse the mass surveillance apparatus and protect the most vulnerable among us.</p><p>(For similar reasons, everyone should choose free software when that's feasible;
demand open source and open standards and document formats from all public institutions;
and defend blockchains<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->—<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->including cryptocurrencies<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->—<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->and
the <!-- -->“<!-- -->right to repair<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
Strategically though, it may be better to stick to a minimum set of common demands for the sake of building
the largest coalition possible now.)</p><p>There is strength in numbers: that's how civil disobedience works.
It would be naive to think that we can get everyone in the EU to understand the imminent threat of (even deeper)
mass surveillance and to act on it.
But if a significant fraction of European citizens recognised the seriousness of the situation and made
the little effort required to secure their data and their communications, there is no way a law like Chat Control
could be enforced.</p><ul><li><abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr>'s <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveillance self-defence guide</a></li><li>Bruce Schneier: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“<!-- -->The Value of Privacy<!-- -->”</a></li><li><a href="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StopChatControl.eu</a> campaign (<code>#StopChatControl</code>)</li></ul><p><a href="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-1-1024x1024.png" alt="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/"></a></p><div><p>Glass building image by Stable Diffusion <!-- -->&amp;<!-- --> tripu</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In August 1996, US president Bill Clinton made a portentous announcement from the White House. He was talking about a rock.</p>
<p>‘Today, rock 84001 speaks to us across all those billions of years and millions of miles’, he said. ‘It speaks of the possibility of life. If this discovery is confirmed, it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered.’</p>
<p>The Martian meteorite ALH84001, picked up at Allan Hills in Antarctica in 1984, was then in the process of acquiring notoriety for revealing the Martians that never were. Researchers at NASA claimed in 1996 that inspection of the meteorite under the electron microscope revealed weird, wormlike nodules which could be <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.273.5277.924">‘fossil remains of a past martian biota’</a>.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In fact, ALH84001 had a different message for us: about the danger of inferring life from morphology. It has never become clear what processes created the peculiar microstructures of the meteorite, but there’s no strong reason to believe they involved Martian microbes, and plenty of evidence that non-living processes can generate comparable shapes and forms. Perhaps chief among these are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b03018">reaction-diffusion systems</a>, of which the periodic precipitation process discovered in 1896 by German chemist Raphael Eduard Liesegang may be a variant.<sup>2</sup> It’s now widely believed that some of the oldest putative microfossils on Earth,<sup>3</sup> showing filamentary structures once thought to be fossil bacteria, are also in fact inorganic.</p>
<p>Perhaps a little chastened by the damp squib of ALH84001, NASA scientists began in the late 1990s to develop an artificial-intelligence system that would be able to distinguish the living from the non-living on the basis of morphology. They called it the D’Arcy Machine, after Scottish zoologist D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson, whose epic 1917 book <em>On Growth and Form</em> was one of the most comprehensive early efforts to understand how complex morphologies arise in both living and abiotic systems.</p>
<p>The project was led by chemist David Noever of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. The idea was that a neural network would be trained on all known biological forms on Earth to find features diagnostic of life. ‘By repeatedly comparing and contrasting learnable imagery’, NASA claimed, ‘a D’Arcy machine would… give us an interplanetary version of D’Arcy Thompson’s classic [book].’</p>
<p>It seems that nothing notable came from the project. But might that be because there isn’t really any reliable morphological distinction between the living and abiotic?</p>
<p>That question was raised in a recent meeting in Tokyo, Japan, titled ‘Diversity of Biological Patterns and Forms in Nature’ and hosted by the Meiji Institute for Advanced Study of Mathematical Sciences. While most of the presentations discussed the dizzying array of forms that the living world produces – few are more astonishing than those of South American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehopper">treehoppers</a> – chemist <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/4017782.article">Oliver Steinbock</a> of Florida State University offered a reminder of how shape alone is a poor guide.</p>
<h3>In the chemical garden</h3>
<p>Steinbock described the complex and often beautiful forms of chemical gardens, made by precipitating salts within a solution of sodium silicate (water glass). The repeated formation of soft inorganic membranes followed by their breaching due to osmotic pressure gives rise to twisting, bulbous mineral columns. Isaac Newton studied such structures in the 17th century and proclaimed that they had something ‘vegetative’ about them.</p>
<p>Shape is one thing – but even the kind of complex motion we might intuitively associate with life doesn’t necessarily provide clinching evidence. Steinbock showed that short lengths of the tubular structures in manganese chemical gardens can act as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c09088">self-propelled particles</a> – active matter – in solutions of hydrogen peroxide, catalytically generating oxygen that bubbles out of the tube end and propels it forward.<sup>4</sup> The trajectories of these particles can be surprisingly complicated, especially when several interact hydrodynamically with one another. In particular, the particles, typically a few millimetres long, can appear to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2SM00395C">congregate like microbes</a> into a ring pattern – driven by the surface tension and buoyancy of a collective oxygen bubble in the ring’s centre.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>These little tubules can also show <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2SM01681H">periodic cycles of ascent and descent</a> in the liquid due to the buoyancy of an oxygen bubble and its release at the surface.<sup>6</sup> It’s tempting to read this motion visually as some kind of purposeful behaviour. The fact is that we seem naturally inclined to infer life and purpose in all manner of complexity: we are prone to what you might call ‘biotic pareidolia’, the analogue of our impulse to see faces in non-living structures (including the rocks of Mars!).</p>
<p>Can today’s immensely powerful deep-learning AI, potentially free from such cognitive biases, do better in identifying what is truly life-like? Given recent developments that have exposed how strongly we project life and thought onto AI itself, I wonder about that. If AI can persuade us that it’s alive, it might not have much trouble convincing us that something else is.</p></div><div><h3>References</h3><p>1 D S McKay <em>et al.</em>, <em>Science</em>, 1996,&nbsp;<strong>273</strong>, 924 (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.273.5277.924">10.1126/science.273.5277.924</a>)</p>

US-based Microsoft employees in San Francisco and New York are paid more because they live in higher cost-of-living areas and some fields, like roles within engineering, also fetch higher pay.</p><p>The highest pay package in the guidelines viewed by Insider was $361,500 in salary, $1.2 million as a hiring bonus, and about $1 million in annual stock awards. The lowest was a $42,500 salary, with no hiring bonus and no guaranteed stock award.</p><p>Microsoft uses a system of levels to denote seniority. Higher levels come with higher offers, according to the guidelines. Levels also vary by field and location, but generally, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-microsoft-pays-entry-senior-level-engineers-2021-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">"senior" starts at level 63, "principal" starts at level 65</a>, and "partner" starts at level 68, according to insiders.</p><p>Not all types of roles go up to level 70, but in engineering, an employee at this level would be considered a "distinguished engineer.'" There's also a level 80 for a "technical fellow," which is typically one of the highest-ranking executives at the company.</p><p>In 2022, when the economy was still booming, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-pay-raises-merit-increases-stock-grants-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Microsoft granted an across-the board compensation raise</a> for levels 67 and lower through larger stock grants, in response <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-considering-significant-pay-raises-employee-survey-2022-5?utmSource=twitter&amp;utmContent=referral&amp;utmTerm=topbar&amp;referrer=twitter" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">to growing internal dissatisfaction</a> with compensation compared to competitors, and to stop employees from leaving for better pay, especially to Amazon.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609120697/finland-s-chatgpt-equivalent-begins-to-think-in-estonian-as-well">https://news.err.ee/1609120697/finland-s-chatgpt-equivalent-begins-to-think-in-estonian-as-well</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37911404">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The University of Turku in Finland is developing an artificial language corpus proficient in all European languages, including Estonian, to preserve minor languages in the post-ChatGPT era. The Estonian Language Institute (EKI) supports the initiative but warns that an operational language model requires digitizing substantially more Estonian texts than is currently available.</p><div><p>"The English ChatGPT stunned the world with its ability to comprehend and respond to a person&nbsp;in a manner resembling natural speech. It wasn't a miracle technology; it was given an unprecedented amount of text to identify patterns in and learn to mimic human communication," Eleri Aedmaa, a natural language processing engineer at the Institute of the Estonian Language, said.</p><p>"In the new era of language technologies, the quantity of texts matters. To reach this critical mass with Estonian as many texts as possible must be digitized and made available: the entirety of the National Library, all of its archives, as much current and historical news as possible, including online communication. The more Estonian is readily accessible on the Internet, the more secure the language's future will be," the linguist said.</p><p>University of Turku and language technology company SiloGen <a href="https://www.silo.ai/blog/silo-ai-launches-a-consortium-to-build-the-worlds-largest-open-llm">are spearheading</a> the creation of the largest open language model in the world, covering all official European languages, on one of the pan-European supercomputers, LUMI, is located in Kajaani, Finland. It is the third largest supercomputer in the world and the largest in Europe. The quantity of distinct and original digital Estonian texts that can be made available for this and future language learning models, according to Aedmaa, is a fundamental issue for training the model in Estonian.</p><p><strong>ChatGPT only thinks in English</strong></p><p>Aedmaa said that one of the shortcomings of the increasingly prevalent large language models is that they are trained almost exclusively in English. This implies that although GPT-4 appears to comprehend Estonian, it is still limited to translation. The machine, so to say, thinks in English and translates the conversation at the last moment into Estonian. "This is really dangerous for the Estonian language in the long run," Aedmaa said.</p><p>"The value of these new tools lies in the fact that they comprehend not only individual words and sentences, but also the cultural context as a whole. If a language model is trained solely on the basis of English content, it will inevitably lack cultural knowledge of Estonia," she said.</p><p>"The situation is comparable to when the printing press was invented - what would have become of the Estonian language if books had been printed only in the major languages, but not in Estonian?" She asked. According to Aedmaa, the problem now affects nearly all of the world's languages.</p><p>The language model being developed by the Finns is a GPT-like digital&nbsp;machine that has been trained on a wide range of languages from the ground up. "The objectives are European linguistic sovereignty and the democratization of language technology. Unlike the majority of its predecessors, the new language model will be open source; its logic is transparent and can be utilized by anyone developing new language technology applications," Aedmaa said.</p><p>The Finns' project is supported by Business Finland, a body similar to the Estonian Business and Innovation Agency (EISA). It has also been supported by the EU Horizon program. LUMI provided a number of free training hours to the developers so that they could test the model.</p><p><strong>There are too few sources in Estonian to train a large language model</strong></p><p>Kadri Vare, head of the EKI's language and speech technology department, said the agency&nbsp;is presently exploring additional ways to help Finns. "We intend to work with them and have taken preliminary steps in that regard. Then we will be able to specify more precisely what and how much we can contribute to this endeavor. We have already contributed by making all of our legally permissible language data available to them," Vare told ERR.</p><p>In particular, Vare said, even more data could be digitized and made public to contribute to the success of the initiative. "The large language models use the entirety of the internet and every written word. Right now, we do not know exactly what they have taken and from where; we do not know if they have access to potentially more sensitive data. It would be important to us to find out," she said.</p><p>There is a shortage of available Estonian content for the large language model at present, however. "There are approximately three billion words of Estonian public data in the main language corpora, according to our knowledge. In contrast, English contains over 800 billion words. Three billion may seem like a lot, but in reality it is still insufficient. Training an artificial intelligence to comprehend Estonian language and culture is insufficient. It is simply too little," Vare said.</p><p>At the moment, the EKI is in the process of compiling a large Estonian language corpus. "These datasets are public, and we are pleased to share them. Participating in large open language models and collecting data for them is, in my opinion, one of the most important goals for Estonian language preservation," she concluded.</p><p>--</p><p><em>Follow ERR News on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ERRNews/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/errnews">Twitter</a> and never miss an update!</em></p>									</div></div>]]></description>

                            <p><span>Officials in a small Iowa town twice arrested a young man for criticizing the police department and saying it violates people's civil rights. Now the town is facing a lawsuit for violating <em>his</em> civil rights.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ECF-No.-1-Complaint-and-Jury-Demand-FILE-STAMPED-10.12.23.pdf"><span>federal lawsuit</span></a><span> filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Iowa, Noah Petersen says the town of Newton violated the First, Fourth, and 14th Amendments when the police chief arrested him for speaking during the public comment period of a City Council meeting. Petersen is represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public interest law firm.</span></p> <p>"The mayor and police chief had Noah arrested, jailed, strip-searched, and criminally prosecuted simply because they didn't like what Noah had to say," the lawsuit states. "This suit is filed to vindicate the fundamental right to criticize the government without fear of retaliation and to ensure the constitutional accountability of all government officials."</p> <p><span>Petersen was prompted to speak at an October 3, 2022, Newton City Council meeting after the release of </span><a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/watch-newton-man-says-police-wrongfully-arrested-him-at-traffic-stop/41069939"><span>body cam footage</span></a><span> showing Newton officers arresting a college football player, Tayvin Galanakis. Galanakis was arrested for driving under the influence, despite blowing a 0.00 on a Breathalyzer and passing roadside sobriety tests. He was taken to the police station for further drug tests, all of which came back negative, before eventually being released.</span></p> <p>Petersen approached the microphone and said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>Hello. This is my public comment for [the] City Council meeting, now October 3rd, 2022. Defund Newton Police Department. They are a violent, civil and human rights–violating organization who do not make your community safer. They are also pro–domestic abuse because they are currently employing a domestic abuser and choosing to not release the records about that domestic abuser.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>At that point, the Newton mayor ordered Petersen to stop speaking, although his allotted three minutes of time had not expired. When Petersen refused, the mayor ordered the police chief to remove Petersen for violating a council rule forbidding "derogatory statements or comments about any individual."</span></p> <p><span>Petersen was handcuffed, arrested, and jailed until his parents could post bond for him<strong>.</strong> He returned to the next City Council meeting to speak during the public comment period and was once again arrested after calling the police chief and mayor fascists.</span></p> <p><span>Petersen was charged both times with disorderly conduct for disrupting a lawful assembly. However, as </span><i><span>Reason</span></i><span>'s Emma Camp </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/02/06/an-iowa-town-charged-a-man-with-disorderly-conduct-because-he-called-a-cop-a-domestic-abuser/"><span>reported</span></a><span> in February, those charges did not stick:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Last Wednesday, Petersen was found not guilty of his disorderly conduct charge. Adding to his victory, the judge overturned the rule barring "derogatory" statements about individuals during city council meetings. "As applied in this particular instance, the Newton City Council rule is violative of the First Amendment," the verdict states.</span></p> <p><span>Petersen "did not act in any objectively unreasonable manner," the judge added. "He read a prepared statement relating to the basic city service of policing. While some may not agree with the content of his comments, the Court finds the statements made were not 'derogatory,' nor about an 'individual.' In the event the statements could be found 'derogatory' or a comment about an 'individual'…the Court finds these terms vague and overbroad."</span></p></blockquote> <p>Petersen says the entire mess shows why he stepped up to the podium in the first place.</p> <p><span>"Ironically, the actions of the police department have only proven my point," Petersen said in an Institute for Justice <a href="https://ij.org/press-release/lawsuit-seeks-accountability-for-unconstitutional-silencing-and-arrest-during-city-council-meeting/">press release</a>. "My initial criticism was about the way they treat citizens in our community. They arrested me for exercising my right to free speech—for standing up for what I believe is right. Their reaction to my criticism was a clear demonstration of the very issue I was trying to highlight. Their actions underscore the urgent need for the very reforms I was advocating for."</span></p> <p><span>Newton officials simply do not appear to take criticism well. As </span><i><span>Reason</span></i><span>'s Emma Camp </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/10/06/an-iowa-man-published-body-camera-footage-from-his-arrest-the-cops-are-suing-him-for-defamation/"><span>reported</span></a><span> earlier this month, the two Newton police officers who arrested Galanakis have since filed a defamation suit against him for publishing the body cam footage of his own arrest, as well as claims he made about the officers on social media. A judge tossed out most of those defamation claims.</span></p> <p><span>The right to criticize police, even through vulgarities and rude gestures, is firmly enshrined in the First Amendment. As Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. </span><a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/482/451.html"><span>wrote</span></a><span> in 1987, in a ruling striking down a Houston ordinance that made it unlawful to oppose or interrupt a police officer, "The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state."</span></p> <p><span>Peterson's lawsuit is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as a judgment declaring Newton's "derogatory comments" rule unconstitutional.</span></p> <p><span>"By ordering their opponents arrested, Newton's officials behaved like petty dictators in a banana republic, rather than democratically-elected leaders in a constitutional republic," Institute for Justice attorney Brian Morris said. "Anyone with a high school diploma should know that having your political opponents arrested is a textbook example of violating someone's First Amendment rights and we're confident that the courts will agree."</span></p> <p><span>Attorneys for the town of Newton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>                        </div></div>]]></description>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’m excited to share a 3 state, 3 symbol Turing Machine that cannot be proven to halt or not (when starting on a blank tape) without solving a Collatz-like problem. Therefore, solving the \(BB(3, 3)\) problem is at least as hard as solving this Collatz-like problem, a class of problem for which Paul Erdős famously said: “Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.”</p>

<p>Last year, in <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/04/03/mother-of-giants.html">Mother of Giants</a>, I described a family of TMs which require efficient simulation or complete solution of a Collatz-like problem in order to prove if they “quasihalt” or not. These were found in the search for <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2021/03/06/beeping-busy-beaver/">“Beeping” Busy Beavers</a>, a variant of the Busy Beavers introduced by Scott Aaronson in his 2020 <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916">Busy Beaver survey article</a>. Since then I have been looking for an example in the normal Busy Beaver game.</p>

<p>There have been many wonderful TMs produced by hand over the years which provide such results for the Busy Beaver game. For example, proving:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(BB(745)\) <a href="https://www.ingo-blechschmidt.eu/assets/bachelor-thesis-undecidability-bb748.pdf">requires</a> proving the consistency of ZFC</li>
  <li>\(BB(27)\) <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a64213f391339236c2fe31f8749a0df6">requires</a> proving the Goldbach Conjecture</li>
  <li>\(BB(15)\) and \(BB(5, 4)\) <a href="https://dna.hamilton.ie/2021-08-10-busy-beaver-15.html">require</a> proving an Erdős conjecture (that for all \(n &gt; 8\), the base 3 representation of \(2^n\) has at least one digit 2).</li>
</ul>

<p>However, none of these Busy Beaver values are really within reach of us mere mortals yet. In the last 60 years, we have only been able to prove values \(BB(2), BB(3), BB(4)\) and \(BB(2, 3)\) and it is known that <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/06/21/bb-6-2-t15.html">\(BB(6) &gt; 10 \uparrow\uparrow 15\)</a>. Until I analyzed this TM, I thought that we might have a chance to prove \(BB(3, 3)\)!</p>

<h2 id="the-machine">The Machine</h2>

<p>I’ll call this TM “Bigfoot” (I’ll explain the name at the end of the article). It is defined by the transition table:</p>

This specific TM was first <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960643023006490684/1084047886494470185/1163168233445130270">shared and analyzed</a> by @savask on 14 Oct 2023 on that same Discord channel.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>Consider the general configuration:</p><p>

\[A(a, b, c) = 0^\infty \; 12^a \; 11^b \; \text{ &lt;A } \; 11^c \; 0^\infty\]

</p><p>We can prove the following rules:</p><p>

\[\begin{array}{l}
  A(a, &amp; 6k,   &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c-1, &amp; 2)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; 8k+c \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+1, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a+1, &amp; 8k+c-1, &amp; 3)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; 8k+c \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+2, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a-1, &amp; 8k+c+3, &amp; 2)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; a \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+3, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c+1, &amp; 5)   \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+4, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a+1, &amp; 8k+c+3, &amp; 2)   \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+5, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c+5, &amp; 3)   \\
\end{array}\]

\[A(0, 6k+2, c) \to \text{Halt}(16k+2c+7)\]

</p><p>In fact, these rules are exhaustive. Once Bigfoot enters such a \(A(a, b, c)\) config (with \(c \ge 1\)), these rules describe the exact behavior it will follow forever (or until it halts).</p>

<p>Looking at the rules above we can see that they are iterating a Collatz-like function on parameters \(b\) and \(c\) while \(a\) keeps a sort of running total. Every time \(b \equiv 1 \pmod{6}\) or \(b \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\), \(a\) is incremented and every time \(b \equiv 2 \pmod{6}\), \(a\) is decremented. Bigfoot only ever halts if \(a\) would be decremented below 0.</p>

<h3 id="trajectory-from-blank-tape">Trajectory from Blank Tape</h3>

<p>Starting from a blank tape, Bigfoot reaches config \(A(2, 1, 2)\) at step 69. Simulating this forward, \(a\) appears to grow steadily over time. After 24 million iterations, we have \(a = 3\,999\,888\).</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-random-walk">Pseudo-Random Walk</h3>

<p>Let’s consider the sequence of remainders of \(b\) mod 6. If we imagine that this sequence is uniformly randomly distributed, then this process is simulating a biased random walk on the number line where (for each step) the chance of stepping right is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the chance of stepping left is \(\frac{1}{3}\).</p>

<p>This is a famous problem in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a> and it can be proven that if you are at position \(a = n\), there is a \((\frac{1}{2})^{n+1}\) chance you will ever reach the position \(a = -1\) in the future.</p>

<p>Of course, the sequence of remainders of \(b\) are not random, they are completely deterministic. (In fact, they even follow the consistent pattern of odd, odd, even, even, …) However, on a broad scale they do appear to follow a trajectory roughly like the random Markov chain. We can see that in the trajectory listed above where after 24 million steps, the Markov chain would be expected to move to the right 8 million times and to the left 4 million leading to a value very close to the actual \(a\) around 4 million.</p>

<h3 id="probviously-not-halting">Probviously Not Halting</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the random Markov chain would have about a \((\frac{1}{2})^{4\,000\,000}\) chance of ever reaching \(a = -1\) at this point which is a number so small that any scientist would happily declare this guaranteed to fail. Likewise, this is where I will say that Bigfoot “probviously” never halts (using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.03.192">words of John Conway</a>). Meaning that if it operates anything close to the Markov Chain it will never halt.</p>

<p>Of course, this sort of statement says nothing in a rigorous Mathematical sense. Instead it is sort of an experimental heuristic which I am using to guide my intuition in this case. There is always the chance that after a googolplex iterations Bigfoot will halt. In fact, Conway coined this term to describe the heuristic argument for why the Collatz conjecture should be “probviously” true and yet a proof of Collatz is nowhere in sight.</p>

<h2 id="two-worlds">Two Worlds</h2>

<p>We live in one of two worlds, either Bigfoot halts or it runs forever. If it halts, then that could be proven by accelerating iterations of this Collatz-like function enough that it is tractable to simulate it to completion. If it runs forever, then proving that requires proving that this Collatz-like function will never reach the \(a = 0\) halting transition.</p>

<p>Based on the Markov chain argument above, I believe we are living in this second world and it seems to me that this is the much harder case to prove.</p>

<h2 id="cryptids">Cryptids</h2>

<p>What do we call these sorts of machines? Ones whose behavior has been distilled into a relatively simple Mathematical rule that falls into a class of open Mathematical problems. These machines seem to be a sort of legendary creature, rumors have it that they either halt or do not, but nobody has been able to provide any concrete evidence to support either conclusion. I propose calling them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids">“Cryptids”</a>, drawing parallels to the legendary creatures like the Loch Ness Monster or Chupacabra. And well, since this TM appears to randomly walk about, I thought Bigfoot would be an apt name.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-collatz-like-behavior-really-hard">Is This Collatz-like Behavior Really Hard?</h2>

<p>I imagine that some of you might be wondering: Is the behavior of this specific Collatz-like function really hard to analyze? Am I overselling this behavior simply by it’s association with the famously difficult Collatz problem? I think it is safe to say that nobody aside from me has ever looked at the dynamics of this specific problem. So perhaps with a little bit of number theory and elbow grease, someone will be able to find a clever Mathematical property that applies to this problem (but not to the broader set of Collatz-like problems). This is certainly possible and I am excited to hear if anyone has any ideas as to how to attack this problem. It would be lovely to know that proving \(BB(3, 3)\) remains within reach!</p>

<p>However, in my (limited) experience analyzing and reading about Collatz-like problems there seem to be only two types of questions that one can ask: (1) Ones that are relatively trivial to prove and (2) Ones which no Mathematician knows how to prove. In the first category we have patterns like the fact that \(b\) repeats consistently through the pattern (odd, odd, even, even, …) in Bigfoot’s Collatz iterations or that every time you apply the traditional \(3n+1\) Collatz rule you always end up with an even number which will then be divided by 2 on the next step. Examples of the second category include basically all other questions we might ask about the behavior of these Collatz systems.</p>

With a way to store ideas permanently and externally, they would no longer need to memorise. It is tempting to dismiss him as an old man complaining about change. Socrates did not have a stack of peer-reviewed science to make his case about the usefulness of learning concepts by heart.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Today a different debate is raging about the dangers of another technology—computers—and the typing people do on them. As primary-school pupils and <small>P</small>h<small>D</small> hopefuls return for a new school year in the northern hemisphere, many will do so with a greater-than-ever <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2014/06/07/taking-the-learning-tablets">reliance on computers</a> to take notes and write papers. Some parents of younger students are dismayed that their children are not just encouraged but required to tote laptops to class. University professors complain of rampant distraction in classrooms, with students reading and messaging instead of listening to lectures.</p><p data-component="paragraph">A line of research shows the benefits of an “innovation” that predates computers: <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2012/10/08/handwriting-an-elegy">handwriting</a>. Studies have found that writing on paper can improve everything from recalling a random series of words to imparting a better conceptual grasp of complicated ideas.</p><p data-component="paragraph">For learning material by rote, from the shapes of letters to the quirks of English spelling, the benefits of using a pen or pencil lie in how the motor and sensory memory of putting words on paper reinforces that material. The arrangement of squiggles on a page feeds into visual memory: people might remember a word they wrote down in French class as being at the bottom-left on a page, <i>par exemple</i>.</p><p data-component="paragraph">One of the best-demonstrated advantages of writing by hand seems to be in superior<b> </b>note-taking. In a study from 2014 by Pam Mueller and Danny Oppenheimer, students typing wrote down almost twice as many words and more passages verbatim from  lectures, suggesting they were not understanding so much as rapidly copying the material.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Handwriting—which takes longer for nearly all university-level students—forces note-takers to synthesise ideas into their own words. This aids conceptual understanding at the moment of writing. But those taking notes by hand also perform better on tests<i> </i>when students are later able to study from their notes. The effect even persisted when the students who typed were explicitly instructed to rephrase the material in their own words. The instruction was “completely ineffective” at reducing verbatim note-taking, the researchers note: they did not understand the material so much as parrot it.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Many studies have confirmed handwriting’s benefits, and policymakers have taken note.<b> </b>Though America’s “Common Core” curriculum from 2010 does not require handwriting instruction past first grade (roughly age six), about half the states since then have mandated more teaching of it, thanks to campaigning by researchers and handwriting supporters. In Sweden there is a push for more handwriting and printed books and fewer devices. England’s national curriculum already prescribes teaching the rudiments of cursive by age seven.</p><p data-component="paragraph">However, several school systems in America have gone so far as to ban most laptops. This is too extreme. Some students have disabilities that make handwriting especially hard. Nearly all will eventually need typing skills. And typing can improve the quality of writing: being able to get ideas down quickly, before they are forgotten, can obviously be beneficial. So can slowing down the speed of typing, says Dr Oppenheimer.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Virginia Berninger, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Washington, is a longtime advocate of handwriting. But she is not a purist; she says there are research-tested benefits for “manuscript” print-style writing, <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/09/06/the-comeback-of-cursive">for cursive</a> (which allows greater speed) but also for typing (which is good practice for composing passages). Since students spend more time on devices as they age, she argues for occasional “tuning up” of handwriting in later school years.</p><p data-component="paragraph">And perhaps even into adulthood.

            <p>Computational approaches are emerging as powerful tools for the discovery of antibiotics. A study now uses machine learning to discover abaucin, a potent antibiotic that targets the bacterial pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.</p>
            

                
                    
                
            
                
                <p>Traditionally, antibiotics were discovered by the screening of soil microorganisms, seeking secondary metabolites. From these initial molecules, numerous derivatives were synthesized, showing improved bioactivities and greater potential to meet clinical standards. Until recently, discovery efforts relied on the painstaking screening of large compound libraries for antibiotic activity<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Wright, G. D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 34, 694–701 (2017)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01448-6#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d8857608e293">1</a></sup>. Phenotypic screening approaches do not require advanced knowledge of the mechanism of action; however, the extensive and unexplored chemical space in the search for drug-like molecules poses considerable challenges, as the screening of numerous potential combinations (of both compounds and different bacterial strains) is both expensive and time-consuming. Thus, the discovery process of a new antibiotic has consistently depended on chance and serendipity. Recent advances that incorporate cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and other computational approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in accelerating the identification of new drugs with desired properties<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Porto, W.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a reminder: <strong>Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.</strong> Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.</p>
<p>Ruff is used in production by tens of thousands of
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#whos-using-ruff">open source projects</a> and major enterprises.
In the last year, we've been working to expand Ruff's feature set and improve stability for those
that depend on Ruff in their daily workflows.</p>
<p>Today, we're excited to announce that <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff v0.1.0</a> is out! This

<h2><span id="a-growing-feature-set"></span>A growing feature set<!-- --> <a href="#a-growing-feature-set">#</a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Charlie looked back on
<a href="https://notes.crmarsh.com/ruff-the-first-200-releases">the first 200 releases of Ruff</a>, at which
point 376 lint rules were supported. <strong>Ruff now supports over 700 rules</strong>, with new rules being
added in every release. In case you missed it, we've released some exciting features this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.285#stabilized-support-for-jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter notebook support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.292#support-for-pep-701">Python 3.12 f-string syntax support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.283#ruff-supports-pep-695">Python 3.12 type alias and generics syntax support</a></li>

<li>Improvements to the <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/">Ruff playground</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/7310">released an alpha version</a> of our
Black-compatible code formatter. Expect more news on that front soon!</p>
<h2><span id="introducing-preview-mode"></span>Introducing preview mode<!-- --> <a href="#introducing-preview-mode">#</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.289">v0.0.289</a>, we added a new preview mode
to enable the use of unstable features when running Ruff.</p>
<p>Since new rules often benefit from a trial period, we want to be able to release them in a staged
manner. Previously, we used a "nursery" rule category to do this, a concept taken from Clippy,
Rust's linter.</p>
<p>However, the nursery required opt-in for each rule using their exact code, e.g., if you'd selected
<code>F</code> and we released an unstable rule <code>F999</code>, you'd need to update your selection to <code>[F, F999]</code>.
Requiring opt-in for each rule reduced exposure of new rules and could be tedious for users to
update. Furthermore, as Ruff grows, we want a global concept for use of unstable features — the
nursery concept doesn't scale beyond rule selection.</p>
<p>Preview mode will be used to enable new rules, unstable fixes, and experimental code analysis.
Releasing these features — but gating them to users who opt-in — will allow us to collect community
feedback and gain confidence that changes are a net-benefit.</p>
<p>Preview mode can be enabled per-invocation with the <code>--preview</code> flag or by updating your
configuration file:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>tool</span><span>.</span><span>ruff</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>preview</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/">docs</a> for preview mode and give it a try!</p>
<h2><span id="respecting-fix-safety"></span>Respecting fix safety<!-- --> <a href="#respecting-fix-safety">#</a></h2>
<p>Ruff's ability to automatically fix violations is one of its most powerful features. However, given
Python's dynamic nature, it's not always possible to guarantee that a fix is "safe". Since May,
we've been labeling a subset of Ruff's fixes as unsafe. When applying safe fixes, the meaning and
intent of your code will be retained; when applying unsafe fixes, the meaning could change.</p>
<p>For example,
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-iterable-allocation-for-first-element"><code>unnecessary-iterable-allocation-for-first-element</code></a>
is a rule which checks for potentially unperformant use of <code>list(...)[0]</code>. The fix replaces this
pattern with <code>next(iter(...))</code> which can result in a drastic speedup:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-m</span><span> </span><span>timeit</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>head = list(range(99999999))[0]</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>1 </span><span>loop,</span><span> </span><span>best</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.69</span><span> </span><span>sec</span><span> </span><span>per</span><span> </span><span>loop</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-m</span><span> </span><span>timeit</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>head = next(iter(range(99999999)))</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>5000000 </span><span>loops,</span><span> </span><span>best</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>70.8</span><span> </span><span>nsec</span><span> </span><span>per</span><span> </span><span>loop</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, when the collection is empty, this fix changes the raised exception from an <code>IndexError</code> to
<code>StopIteration</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>list(range(0))[0]</span><span>'</span></span>
<span><span>Traceback (most </span><span>recent</span><span> </span><span>call</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>):</span></span>

<span><span>IndexError: </span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>index</span><span> </span><span>out</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>range</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>next(iter(range(0)))[0]</span><span>'</span></span>
<span><span>Traceback (most </span><span>recent</span><span> </span><span>call</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>):</span></span>
<span><span>File </span><span>"</span><span>&lt;string&gt;</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>line</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>modul</span><span>e</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>StopIteration</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since this could break error handling, this fix is categorized as unsafe.</p>
<p>Previously, the safety of a fix was only an internal note, but in v0.1.0, Ruff will only use safe
fixes by default to increase confidence when applying fixes and highlight fixes that need additional
review.</p>
<p>Unsafe fixes can be enabled by passing the <code>--unsafe-fixes</code> flag to <code>ruff check</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span># Show unsafe fixes</span></span>
<span><span>ruff </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>--unsafe-fixes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Apply unsafe fixes</span></span>
<span><span>ruff </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>--fix</span><span> </span><span>--unsafe-fixes</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or by setting
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#unsafe-fixes"><code>unsafe-fixes</code></a> in your configuration file:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>tool</span><span>.</span><span>ruff</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>unsafe-fixes</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When working with Ruff in an IDE (via our LSP), we will no longer apply unsafe fixes with the "Fix
all" action. Instead, unsafe fixes can be applied individually with the "Quick fix" action allowing
review of each fix. If you opt-in to unsafe fixes, they'll be applied during "Fix all". See the
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp#fix-safety">LSP docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The safety of fixes can be adjusted per rule using the
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#extend-safe-fixes"><code>extend-safe-fixes</code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#extend-unsafe-fixes"><code>extend-unsafe-fixes</code></a> settings, allowing
you to customize safety levels for your use-case.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#fix-safety">docs</a> for more details on fix
safety.</p>
<h2><span id="ruffs-versioning-policy"></span>Ruff's versioning policy<!-- --> <a href="#ruffs-versioning-policy">#</a></h2>
<p>Thus far, Ruff releases have only involved incrementing the patch version number. This versioning
scheme suffers from a few core problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no documented policy and little room for a meaningful policy</li>
<li>Rules are added in most releases, resulting in significant new violations for users on upgrade</li>
<li>Users cannot get bug fix upgrades with confidence that they will not need to do other work</li>
<li>Ruff is not perceived as stable</li>
</ul>
<p>With the promotion to v0.1.0, Ruff can adopt a meaningful rules around versioning to ensure that
users know what to expect from each release. With the addition of a minor version number, we hope
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the frequency of large changes</li>
<li>Give rules a period for stabilization before enabling</li>
<li>Differentiate between breaking and non-breaking releases</li>
<li>Move towards stronger stability guarantees</li>
</ul>
<p>With the release of 0.1.0, Ruff includes a full versioning policy. Briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>minor</strong> version will be used for stabilization of <strong>preview</strong> features, changes to
<strong>stable</strong> behavior, and breaking changes.</li>
<li>The <strong>patch</strong> version will be used for bug fixes and <em>any</em> changes to rules or fixes in
<strong>preview.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/">docs</a> for a full description of the policy.</p>

Look south-east, towards Canada, and you see a skyline thick with cranes. New towers are shooting up, old ones being rebuilt, and the pavements below are thick with pedestrians. Cross to the other bedroom, however, and you get quite a different view. Right up to the edge of a highway entire city blocks are occupied by nothing but tarmac. At 11am an ocean of surface parking is uninterrupted by even a single car.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Just over a decade ago Detroit became the biggest American city to go bankrupt. Since then its city centre has made a remarkable recovery. The Book Tower, which was completely derelict in 2009, has been rebuilt at a cost of over $300m by Bedrock, a property firm owned by Dan Gilbert, Michigan’s richest man. Yet though downtown is humming, huge parts of the city remain blighted.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The city now has a more ambitious plan to reduce the amount of vacant land. It intends to tax it. A lot. Will it work?</p><p data-component="paragraph">The idea, proposed by Mike Duggan, the city’s pugnacious mayor, is to replace Detroit’s current property tax with a split tax. In essence, assessors will distinguish between the value of its land and of the buildings on it. This done, the city’s property tax will be reduced from 2% for every $1 of assessed value (which is less than market value) to 0.6%. To make up for the revenues lost, land will be taxed at a new rate of 11.8%, whether or not it has anything built on it. In Michigan changes to property-tax rates have to be approved by voters. A law to allow that cleared its first hurdle in the state House in late September. A referendum could happen in February.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The principle of taxing land instead of buildings has a long history. Over a century ago Henry George, a liberal economist, argued that the rich used land ownership to hoard the wealth being created by progress. His most dedicated fans adopted the slogan “Do you see the cat?” (based on a convoluted metaphor), to refer to his ideas that land ownership underpinned high inequality. Yet George’s proposal—a single tax on land value—has barely been tried. If Mr Duggan’s scheme becomes law, Detroit will be one of the first big cities anywhere in the world to implement one.</p><p data-component="paragraph">How come Detroit is able to try something so radical? One advantage, says Jay Rising, the city’s chief financial officer, is that the city now raises very little from its current system. In 1959, according to a study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a think-tank in Massachusetts, the city’s property tax raised over $1bn, adjusted for inflation. By 2019, after decades of economic decline, the figure had fallen to just $119m. “If this was 80% of our revenues, we’d be a lot more nervous,” says Mr Rising. In fact it is just 16%. Moreover, the value of residential land is very low, which makes it an easier sell to voters.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The hope is that taxing land more will in fact spur development. Right now, says Alex Alsup of Regrid, a data firm, Detroit has “a very pure version of speculation”. As downtown booms, people who bought land nearby years ago—such as the owners of the car parks—merely have to wait for investment nearby to raise the value of their own land. Higher taxes might force them to sell up to people who will build on it. “It is entirely possible that this land tax has the ability to free up properties,” says Kofi Bonner, the <small>ceo</small> of Bedrock.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The bigger immediate benefit, though, comes from reducing taxes on most residents. The city argues that 97% of homeowners will get a tax cut. Lower tax rates on improvements ought to encourage people to invest in properties—and help some avoid falling behind on their taxes. Though they raise little, Detroit’s property taxes are punishing to poor homeowners. Between 2011 and 2015, according to a study published in 2019, one in four city properties went into tax foreclosure, their owners having fallen behind on payments.</p><p data-component="paragraph">But Bernadette Atuahene, one of the authors of that study, suggests that high rates were not the only problem. What mattered more was that after the great financial crisis, Detroit’s assessor systematically overvalued the homes of the poorest residents. When people could not pay, Wayne County, which includes the city, added interest at 18%. Homes ended up auctioned, with any excess over the tax owed banked by the county. Ms Atuahene worries that the proposed new tax does nothing to fix this problem—and if residential land ends up overvalued, may exacerbate it. “We currently have an assessment division that’s not doing its job,” she says.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Getting assessments right is one of the long-standing challenges of land-value taxes, and explains why they are so rare. Still, if the city can do that well, there will be real gains. Gabriel McNeil, a 61-year-old former chef who now lives on disability benefits, says that even a small tax cut would help him a lot. Having bought his home for just $8,000 in 2013, he struggles with tax payments of thousands of dollars each year. “The property tax is not designed for lower-income people at all,” he says. “It’s not easy to keep up.” For some, any cut is better than nothing. <span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Stay on top of American politics with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance" target="_blank">Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which&nbsp;examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div><p>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "By George!"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/">United States</a> <span>October 7th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/04/the-sacking-of-kevin-mccarthy-will-make-supporting-ukraine-harder"><span>Kevin McCarthy’s sacking deepens the chaos in American government</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/travelling-to-and-from-america-has-become-a-waiting-game"><span>Travelling to and from America has become a waiting game</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/republican-parties-in-important-swing-states-are-falling-behind"><span>Republican parties in important swing states are falling behind</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/the-post-title-42-lull-in-border-crossings-is-over"><span>The post-Title-42 lull in border crossings is over</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/detroit-wants-to-be-the-first-big-american-city-to-tax-land-value"><span>Detroit wants to be the first big American city to tax land value</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/what-america-should-really-learn-from-dianne-feinstein"><span>What America should really learn from Dianne Feinstein</span></a></li></ul></div><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Are free markets history?

</figure> <p>John says he pressed representatives of Tesla on whether he or Rob were at fault for the damage, to which he claims he was told that it was a weather issue.</p> <p>He continued: “They said that the battery is effectively submerged in water. How can that be our fault?</p> <p>“After finally getting to speak to a manager, he told me it had water in it due to the fact the weather in Scotland has been so bad. That was the issue. They said it’s not necessarily my fault but it’s not Tesla’s to pay under warranty. He reminded me there was a yellow weather warning in some parts of Scotland.</p> <p>“I pushed him on this and said I’ve never heard or something like this happening. He said it can happen with Range Rovers and Mercs but I’m just not buying it.</p> <p>“To date, it’s been a disaster of a service and the stress and worry of this is excruciating. I said to the manager, ‘so, my understanding is, Teslas are unfit for purpose in Scotland?.”</p> <p>I’ve been driving for 30 years and this is my most premium car to date and this is what it does when Edinburgh’s roads get puddles or a little wet!”</p> <p><i>Edinburgh Live</i> has seen correspondence between the couple and Tesla which confirms the £17,374 bill. </p> <p>Furthermore, an email from Tesla customer relations also commits to an investigation into the complaint and a response on behalf of the business.</p> <p>John added: “If I had known the customer service would be so bad I’m not sure I would have bothered buying the car. Do they know that we’re in Scotland? That weather was not abnormal for living here.</p> <p>"I can only see the number of claims on problems like this going up.

If 1-on-1s were your fulltime job you could at most do 80 per week (2 per hour x 40 hrs). Thats just rotating through 1x1s. That's not doing anything else.</p><p>He claimed "team leads" did 1x1s, which is fine, but its hard to call them a direct report if you're not even aware of their daily work. Theres just no way you can adequately manage 200 people. As mentioned above, you are just a glorified HR person, you're no longer in engineering.</p><p>I would never hire a manager below Director level that isn't themselves an individual contributor. I know its possible to have that but I wouldnt hire it, because we expect IC on our teams.

Your friend is a big old racist”.</p><p>Moving on from that reflexive thought, I'll attempt to answer your question of:</p><p>&gt; I’m asking is there a perceptual issue due to some factor that’s obvious to the typical Nth-generation American?</p><p>Well, perhaps. There are a bunch of factors:</p><p>- The H1B program is terrible in that it ties your immigration status to your current employer. Couple this with the “you can be legally fired because your boss doesn't like the color of your shoes” climate in the US and you have a pretty stressed-out bunch of people.
- A lot of consulting companies seem to pay just enough wages that attract Indian H1B employees of a average to low caliber of talent, and hire them out for random software projects. The Americans on the other side of those contractors get mad at the contractors, who happen to be all Indian.
- There is a genuine cultural gap where Indians are more deferential to someone they perceive as having higher authority. It is sometimes possible that a young Indian employee might call you “Sir”, because that was how they addressed superiors.</p><p>So...all these are perceptual issues of the sort you are looking at. But honestly, these sorts of cultural misunderstandings are not exactly uncommon among Europeans and Americans as well. Big Tech tends to have far fewer of the issues above. Salaries are high (I don't even work in Big Tech and my salary as an H1B was verifiably higher than some of my American coworkers), and IMO there isn't a huge difference between Indians and the N other cultures that make up the boiling pot of tech.</p><p>But then that brings me to the part about “friend who works big tech and he has no chill for <i>Indians</i>”. Like, Indians period? What does he think about Sanjay Ghemawat? What about Vinod Khosla? How about Amit Patel, who came up with Google's “Don't Be Evil”? What about the engineers/PMs/etc. in big tech to whom those issues don't apply?</p><p>All of this leads me to conclude (this time after some reflection) that your friend is actually just a...big old racist if he has a problem with <i>all</i> Indians in general, especially those working in Big Tech.</p><p>Take from that what you will. Hope you find better friends :)

Firstly you now have a bunch of highly paid technical employees completely removed from how things actually work. But what’s worse is you created a culture where you’re incentived to follow - a senior engineer who wants to get promoted should write less code because coding is associated with being a low level employee.</p><p>The fundamental root cause is a misunderstanding of code as low level factory work and not intrinsically tied to the design and architecture. But it’s one of many ways in which traditional business structures and software engineering do not mesh and you need an extremely strong engineering leader to keep software culture on track, which very few organizations have.

We didn't have much meetings, rather lots of one-on-ones or 3-4 people discussing. Most of us were just out of college. So, when we had strong opinions on the product features, they not only heard us, but helped formulate a proper argument that we could present. He was  also a good mentor, helping me reframe my viewpoint, when I didn't agree with one of my very senior colleagues (Later turned out the senior colleague was right. In retrospect, I really pity that colleague for he had to work with a big bunch of naive college graduates with no coding discipline :) )</p><p>It helps that the whole environment in the company was one of openness, camaraderie and a real desire to make a difference.

<p>Cisco is urging customers to protect their devices following the discovery of a critical, actively exploited zero-day vulnerability that’s giving threat actors full administrative control of networks.</p>
<p>“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to create an account on the affected device with privilege level 15 access, effectively granting them full control of the compromised device and allowing possible subsequent unauthorized activity,” members of Cisco’s Talos security team <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/active-exploitation-of-cisco-ios-xe-software/">wrote Monday</a>. “This is a critical vulnerability, and we strongly recommend affected entities immediately implement the steps outlined in Cisco’s PSIRT advisory.”</p>
<h2>Under exploitation for 4 weeks</h2>
<p>The previously unknown vulnerability, which is tracked as CVE-2023-20198, carries the maximum severity rating of 10. It resides in the Web User Interface of Cisco IOS XE software when exposed to the Internet or untrusted networks. Any switch, router, or wireless LAN controller running IOS XE that has the HTTP or HTTPS Server feature enabled and exposed to the Internet is vulnerable. At the time this post went live, the Shodan search engine showed that as many as 80,000 Internet-connected devices could be affected.</p>
<p>Cisco said that an unknown threat actor has been exploiting the zero-day since at least September 18. After using the vulnerability to become an authorized user, the attacker creates a local user account. In most cases, the threat actor has gone on to deploy an implant that allows it to execute malicious commands at the system or iOS level, once the web server is restarted. The implant is unable to survive a reboot, but the local user accounts will remain active.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Monday’s advisory went on to say that after gaining access to a vulnerable device, the threat actor exploits a medium vulnerability, CVE-2021-1435, which Cisco patched two years ago. The Talos team members said that they have seen devices fully patched against the earlier vulnerability getting the implant installed “through an as of yet undetermined mechanism.”</p>
<p>The implant is saved in the file path “/usr/binos/conf/nginx-conf/cisco_service.conf.” It contains two variable strings composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal characters</a>. The advisory continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The implant is based on the Lua programming language and consists of 29 lines of code that facilitates the arbitrary command execution. The attacker must create an HTTP POST request to the device, which delivers the following three functions (Figure 1):</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">The first function is dictated by the “menu” parameter, which must exist and must be non-empty. This returns a string of numbers surrounded by forward-slashes, which we suspect might represent the implant’s version or installation date.</li>
<li>The second function is dictated by the “logon_hash” parameter, which must be set to “1”. This returns an 18-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant.</li>
<li>The third function is also dictated by the “logon_hash” parameter, which checks to see if the parameter matches a 40-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant. A second parameter used here is “common_type”, which must be non-empty, and whose value determines whether the code is executed at the system level or IOS level. If the code is executed at the system level, this parameter must be set to “subsystem”, and if it is executed at the IOS level, the parameter must be “iox”. The IOX commands are executed at privilege level 15.</li>
</ol>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png" data-height="638" data-width="984" alt="Implant code"><img alt="Implant code" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code-640x415.png" width="640" height="415" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png 2x"></a><figcaption><div><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png" data-height="638" data-width="984">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Implant code</p></div><p>Cisco</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In most instances we have observed of this implant being installed, both the 18-character hexadecimal string in the second function and the 40-character hexadecimal string in the third function are unique, although in some cases, these strings were the same across different devices. This suggests there is a way for the actor to compute the value used in the third function from the value returned by the second function, acting as a form of authentication required for the arbitrary command execution provided in the third function.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Talos team members strongly urge administrators of any affected gear to immediately search their networks for signs of compromise. The most effective means is by searching for unexplained or newly created users on devices. One means of identifying if an implant has been installed is by running the following command against the device, where the "DEVICEIP” portion is a placeholder for the IP address of the device to check:</p>                                            
                                                        
<pre>curl -k -X POST "https[:]//DEVICEIP/webui/logoutconfirm.html?logon_hash=1"</pre>
<p>Admin accounts may have the names cisco_tac_admin or cisco_support. IP addresses Cisco has seen so far exploiting the zero-day are 5.149.249[.]74 and 154.53.56[.]231.<br>
Additional guidance from Cisco:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Check the system logs for the presence of any of the following log messages where “user” could be “cisco_tac_admin”, “cisco_support” or any configured, local user that is unknown to the network administrator:</li>
</ol>
<pre>%SYS-5-CONFIG_P: Configured programmatically by process&nbsp;SEP_webui_wsma_http from console as user on line</pre>
<pre>%SEC_LOGIN-5-WEBLOGIN_SUCCESS: Login Success [user:&nbsp;user] [Source: source_IP_address] at 03:42:13 UTC Wed Oct 11 2023</pre>
<p>Note: The %SYS-5-CONFIG_P message will be present for each instance that a user has accessed the web UI. The indicator to look for is new or unknown usernames present in the message.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Check the system logs for the following message where <strong>filename </strong>is an unknown filename that does not correlate with an expected file installation action:</li>
</ol>
<pre>%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename It should go without saying but the HTTP and HTTPS server feature should never be enabled on internet-facing systems as is consistent with long-established best practices. Cisco reiterated the guidance in Monday’s advisory.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It should go without saying, but the HTTP and HTTPS server feature should never be enabled on Internet-facing systems as is consistent with long-established best practices. Cisco reiterated the guidance in Monday’s advisory.</p>
<p>This vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit and gives hackers the ability to take all kinds of malicious actions against infected networks. Anyone administering Cisco gear should carefully read the advisory and the above-mentioned <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z">PSIRT advisory</a> and follow all recommendations as soon as possible.</p>

    </div>
<p>For the past couple of decades, tens of thousands of people living in rural Sri Lanka have been devastated by kidney failure due to unclear causes, also known as CKDu. Similar incidences of mysterious kidney diseases have emerged in tropical farming communities around the world.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>A massive field study of the wells supplying drinking water to the Sri Lankan communities, conducted by researchers at Duke University, has identified a possible culprit—glyphosate, the active compound in Roundup, the most widely used herbicide in the world.
</p><p>The results of the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00504">study</a> were published in <i>Environmental Science and Technology Letters</i> on September 13, 2023.
</p><p>Roundup is a glyphosate-based herbicide used to control weeds and other pests. Because it is supposed to break down in the environment within a few days to weeks, its use is relatively under-regulated by most public health agencies. But when glyphosate encounters certain trace metal ions that make water hard—like magnesium and calcium—glyphosate-metal ion complexes can form. Those complexes can persist up to seven years in water and 22 years in soil.
</p><p>"It was always thought that this chemical would break down very quickly in the environment, but it seems to stick around a lot longer than we expected when it complexes in hard water," said Nishad Jayasundara, the Juli Plant Grainger Assistant Professor of Global Environmental Health at Duke. "We have to consider how glyphosate is interacting with these other elements, and what happens to glyphosate when you take that into your body as a complex."
</p><p>In certain agricultural areas of Sri Lanka, the high, dry climate combined with its geological formations creates the perfect conditions for hard water. It is also in these regions that CKDu has reached <a href="https://phys.org/tags/epidemic+levels/" rel="tag">epidemic levels</a>, with as many as 10% of children aged 5–11 years exhibiting signs of early onset kidney damage.
</p><p>Jayasundara, who is from Sri Lanka himself, believed that glyphosate may play a role in CKDu incidence because of the region's hard water, even though Sri Lanka has banned use of the herbicide. To test his hypothesis, Jayasundara teamed up with environmental chemist Lee Ferguson, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Duke and his Ph.D. student Jake Ulrich. In collaboration with Mangala De Silva, a professor at the University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka, the Duke team sampled more than 200 wells across four regions in Sri Lanka.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>Ferguson's lab at Duke employs high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry to identify contaminants—even the barest trace of them—by their molecular weights. It's a highly sensitive method of identification and quantitation that allows a broad view into the pollutants present in a water system.
</p><p>Through this technique, the researchers found significantly higher levels of the herbicide in 44% of wells within the affected areas versus just 8% of those outside it.
</p><p>"We really focused on drinking water here, but it's possible there are other important routes of exposure—direct contact from <a href="https://phys.org/tags/agricultural+workers/" rel="tag">agricultural workers</a> spraying the pesticide, or perhaps food or dust," said Ferguson. "I'd like to see increased study with more emphasis looking at the links among these exposure routes. It still seems like there might be things we're missing."
</p><p>To this point, Ulrich also found elevated levels of fluoride and vanadium—both of which are linked to kidney damage—in the drinking water of most all of the communities with high incidence of CKDu. The researchers agree that more attention must be paid to the potential contributions each of these contaminants is playing, either individually or in concert with others. But given the reasoning for their glyphosate-based hypothesis going into the study and the herbicide's high levels of use worldwide, they also believe these results should serve as a serious warning when considering risk of exposure to glyphosate.
</p><p>Part of Ferguson's concern, he said, is that glyphosate's fate profile resembles a contaminant that he's studied closer to home—per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are also called "forever chemicals" because of their persistence in the environment.
</p><p>"We think of PFAS as being a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/drinking+water/" rel="tag">drinking water</a> contaminant because it's mobile and persistent. Now we're realizing that glyphosate may also be quite persistent in hard water areas," said Ferguson. "This gives me concerns about exposures here in the United States."

<p><strong>Airplanes Africa Limited (AAL), an aircraft manufacturer based in Morogoro, has unveiled Tanzania’s first locally-assembled aircraft, the Skyleader 600.</strong></p>
<p>This unveiling took place at the Tanzania International Manufacturers Expo 2023 (TIMEXPO) in the nation’s capital at the Diamond Jubilee Hall in Dar es Salaam.</p>


<p>Skyleader 600 is designed to accommodate two passengers, including the pilot, and is very ideal for business travelers on longer journeys.</p>

<p>David Grolic, the AAL director disclosed that his organization decided to take advantage of Tanzania’s favorable business climate, and willingness to adopt new technologies, by setting up the aircraft assembling outfit in the country.</p>
<p>“We conducted thorough research to understand the requirements of business travelers who frequently undertake long-distance trips. In response to the research, we decided to present an aircraft that would enable business people to travel more conveniently and attend various meetings outside of the region before returning to the city for other activities.” He said.</p>
<p>AAL stands as the only company of its kind in the East African country. It boasts the only aircraft manufactured with commercial intent.</p>


<p><strong>What’s Next For AAL?</strong></p>
<p>According to the company, they are already working on a new aircraft called Skyleader 500, which will be a follow-up to Skyleader 600. Skyleader 500 according to the company is set to be completed by next year, 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike the Skyleader 600 which is meant for business purposes, the impending Skyleader 500 is intended for argricultural use as well as other rural commersial activities</p>
<p>According to the AAL director, a team of Tanzanian and Czech workers are working with the AAL to manufacture the Skyleader 500. It goes without saying that this business venture has provided employment opportunities for locals in the country.</p>


<p>David Grolic also noted that these aircraft are affordable and paying for one is comparable to paying for a car. They also have low operational costs, consume little energy, and are easily maintainable.</p>
<p>The director noted that the initial plan revolves around domestic sales before eventually pivoting to selling to the international market.</p>

<h2>Leaving Twitter had no effect on NPR's traffic (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/14/freedom-of-reach/#ex">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Enshittification is the process by which a platform lures in and then captures end users (stage one), who serve as bait for business customers, who are also captured (stage two), whereupon the platform rug-pulls both groups and allocates all the value they generate and exchange to itself (stage three):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys</a></p>
<p>Enshittification isn't merely a form of rent-seeking – it is a uniquely digital phenomenon, because it relies on the inherent flexibility of digital systems. There are lots of intermediaries that want to extract surpluses from customers and suppliers – everyone from grocers to oil companies – but these can't be reconfigured in an eyeblink the way that purely digital services can.</p>
<p>A sleazy boss can hide their wage-theft with a bunch of confusing deductions to your paycheck. But when your boss is an app, it can engage in algorithmic wage discrimination, where your pay declines minutely every time you accept a job, but if you start to decline jobs, the app can raise the offer:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men">https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men</a></p>
<p>I call this process "twiddling": tech platforms are equipped with a million knobs on their back-ends, and platform operators can endlessly twiddle those knobs, altering the business logic from moment to moment, turning the system into an endlessly shifting quagmire where neither users nor business customers can ever be sure whether they're getting a fair deal:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/</a></p>
<p>Social media platforms are compulsive twiddlers. They use endless variation to lure in – and then lock in – publishers, with the goal of converting these standalone businesses into commodity suppliers who are dependent on the platform, who can then be charged rent to reach the users who <em>asked</em> to hear from them.</p>
<p>Facebook designed this playbook. First, it lured in end-users by promising them a good deal: "Unlike Myspace, which spies on you from asshole to appetite, Facebook is a privacy-respecting site that will <em>never, ever</em> spy on you. Simply sign up, tell us everyone who matters to you, and we'll populate a feed with everything they post for public consumption":</p>
<p><a href="https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876">https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876</a></p>
<p>The users came, and locked themselves in: when people gather in social spaces, they inadvertently take one another hostage. You joined Facebook because you liked the people who were there, then others joined because they liked <em>you</em>. Facebook can now make life worse for all of you without losing your business. You might hate Facebook, but you like each other, and the collective action problem of deciding when and whether to go, and where you should go next, is so difficult to overcome, that you all stay in a place that's getting progressively worse.</p>
<p>Once its users were locked in, Facebook turned to advertisers and said, "Remember when we told these rubes we'd never spy on them? It was a lie. We spy on them with every hour that God sends, and we'll sell you access to that data in the form of dirt-cheap targeted ads."</p>
<p>Then Facebook went to the publishers and said, "Remember when we told these suckers that we'd only show them the things they asked to see? Total lie. Post short excerpts from your content and links back to your websites and we'll nonconsensually cram them into the eyeballs of people who never asked to see them. It's a free, high-value traffic funnel for your own site, bringing monetizable users right to your door."</p>
<p>Now, Facebook had to find a way to lock in those publishers. To do this, it had to twiddle. By tiny increments, Facebook deprioritized publishers' content, forcing them to make their excerpts grow progressively longer. As with gig workers, the digital flexibility of Facebook gave it lots of leeway here. Some publishers sensed the excerpts they were being asked to post were a substitute for visiting their sites – and not an enticement – and drew down their posting to Facebook.</p>
<p>When that happened, Facebook could twiddle in the publisher's favor, giving them broader distribution for shorter excerpts, then, once the publisher returned to the platform, Facebook drew down their traffic unless they started posting longer pieces. Twiddling lets platforms play users and business-customers like a fish on a line, giving them slack when they fight, then reeling them in when they tire.</p>
<p>Once Facebook converted a publisher to a commodity supplier to the platform, it reeled the publishers in. First, it deprioritized publishers' posts when they had links back to the publisher's site (under the pretext of policing "clickbait" and "malicious links"). Then, it stopped showing publishers' content to their own subscribers, extorting them to pay to "boost" their posts in order to reach people who had explicitly asked to hear from them.</p>
<p>For users, this meant that their feeds were increasingly populated with payola-boosted content from advertisers and pay-to-play publishers who paid Facebook's Danegeld to reach them. A user will only spend so much time on Facebook, and every post that Facebook feeds that user from someone they <em>want</em> to hear from is a missed opportunity to show them a post from someone who'll <em>pay</em> to reach them.</p>
<p>Here, too, twiddling lets Facebook fine-tune its approach. If a user starts to wean themself off Facebook, the algorithm (TM) can put more content the user has asked to see in the feed. When the user's participation returns to higher levels, Facebook can draw down the share of desirable content again, replacing it with monetizable content. This is done minutely, behind the scenes, automatically, and quickly. In any shell game, the quickness of the hand deceives the eye.</p>
<p>This is the final stage of enshittification: withdrawing surpluses from end-users and business customers, leaving behind the minimum homeopathic quantum of value for each needed to keep them locked to the platform, generating value that can be extracted and diverted to platform shareholders.</p>
<p>But this is a brittle equilibrium to maintain. The difference between "God, I hate this place but I just can't leave it" and "Holy shit, this <em>sucks</em>, I'm outta here" is razor-thin. All it takes is one privacy scandal, one livestreamed mass-shooting, one whistleblower dump, and people bolt for the exits. This kicks off a death-spiral: as users and business customers leave, the platform's shareholders demand that they squeeze the remaining population harder to make up for the loss.</p>
<p>One reason this gambit worked so well is that it was a long con. Platform operators and their investors have been willing to throw away billions convincing end-users and business customers to lock themselves in until it was time for the pig-butchering to begin. They financed expensive forays into additional features and complementary products meant to increase user lock-in, raising the switching costs for users who were tempted to leave.</p>
<p>For example, Facebook's product manager for its "photos" product wrote to Mark Zuckerberg to lay out a strategy of enticing users into uploading valuable family photos to the platform in order to "make switching costs very high for users," who would have to throw away their precious memories as the price for leaving Facebook:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs</a></p>
<p>The platforms' patience paid off. Their slow ratchets operated so subtly that we barely noticed the squeeze, and when we did, they relaxed the pressure until we were lulled back into complacency. Long cons require a lot of prefrontal cortex, the executive function to exercise patience and restraint.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Elon Musk, a man who seems to have been born without a prefrontal cortex, who has repeatedly and publicly demonstrated that he lacks any restraint, patience or planning. Elon Musk's prefrontal cortical deficit resulted in his being forced to buy Twitter, and his every action since has betrayed an even graver inability to stop tripping over his own dick.</p>
<p>Where Zuckerberg played enshittification as a long game, Musk is bent on speedrunning it. He doesn't slice his users up with a subtle scalpel, he hacks away at them with a hatchet.</p>
<p>Musk inaugurated his reign by nonconsensually flipping every user to an algorithmic feed which was crammed with ads and posts from "verified" users whose blue ticks verified solely that they had $8 ($11 for iOS users). Where Facebook deployed substantial effort to enticing users who tired of eyeball-cramming feed decay by temporarily improving their feeds, Musk's Twitter actually overrode users' choice to switch back to a chronological feed by repeatedly flipping them back to more monetizable, algorithmic feeds.</p>
<p>Then came the squeeze on publishers. Musk's Twitter rolled out a bewildering array of "verification" ticks, each priced higher than the last, and publishers who refused to pay found their subscribers taken hostage, with Twitter downranking or shadowbanning their content unless they paid.</p>
<p>(Musk also squeezed advertisers, keeping the same high prices but reducing the quality of the offer by killing programs that kept advertisers' content from being published along Holocaust denial and open calls for genocide.)</p>
<p>Today, Musk continues to squeeze advertisers, publishers and users, and his hamfisted enticements to make up for these depredations are spectacularly bad, and even illegal, like offering advertisers a new kind of ad that isn't associated with any Twitter account, can't be blocked, and is not labeled as an ad:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xs-sneaky-new-ads-might-be-illegal/">https://www.wired.com/story/xs-sneaky-new-ads-might-be-illegal/</a></p>
<p>Of course, Musk has a compulsive bullshitter's contempt for the press, so he has far fewer enticements for them to stay. Quite the reverse: first, Musk removed headlines from link previews, rendering posts by publishers that went to their own sites into stock-art enigmas that generated no traffic:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/05/x-twitter-strips-headlines-new-links-why-elon-musk">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/05/x-twitter-strips-headlines-new-links-why-elon-musk</a></p>
<p>Then he jumped straight to the end-stage of enshittification by announcing that he would shadowban any newsmedia posts with links to sites other than Twitter, "because there is less time spent if people click away." Publishers were advised to "post content in long form on this platform":</p>
<p><a href="https://mamot.fr/@pluralistic/111183068362793821">https://mamot.fr/@pluralistic/111183068362793821</a></p>
<p>Where a canny enshittifier would have gestured at a gaslighting explanation ("we're shadowbanning posts with links because they might be malicious"), Musk busts out the motto of the Darth Vader MBA: "I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further."</p>
<p>All this has the effect of highlighting just how <em>little</em> residual value there is on the platform for publishers, and tempts them to bolt for the exits. Six months ago, NPR lost all patience with Musk's shenanigans, and quit the service. Half a year later, they've revealed how low the switching cost for a major news outlet that leaves Twitter really are: NPR's traffic, post-Twitter, has declined by less than a single percentage point:</p>
<p><a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/npr-twitter-musk/">https://niemanreports.org/articles/npr-twitter-musk/</a></p>
<p>NPR's Twitter accounts had 8.7 million followers, but even six months ago, Musk's enshittification speedrun had drawn down NPR's ability to reach those users to a negligible level. The 8.7 million number was an illusion, a shell game Musk played on publishers like NPR in a bid to get them to buy a five-figure iridium checkmark or even a six-figure titanium one.</p>
<p>On Twitter, the true number of followers you have is effectively zero – not because Twitter users haven't explicitly instructed the service to show them your posts, but because every post in their feeds that they want to see is a post that no one can be charged to show them.</p>
<p>I've experienced this myself. Three and a half years ago, I left Boing Boing and started pluralistic.net, my cross-platform, open access, surveillance-free, daily newsletter and blog:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/#now-we-are-three">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/#now-we-are-three</a></p>
<p>Boing Boing had the good fortune to have attracted a sizable audience before the advent of siloed platforms, and a large portion of that audience came to the site directly, rather than following us on social media. I knew that, starting a new platform from scratch, I wouldn't have that luxury. My audience would come from social media, and it would be up to me to convert readers into people who followed me on platforms I controlled – where neither they nor I could be held to ransom.</p>
<p>I embraced a strategy called POSSE: Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere. With POSSE, the permalink and native habitat for your material is a site you control (in my case, a WordPress blog with all the telemetry, logging and surveillance disabled). Then you repost that content to other platforms – mostly social media – with links back to your own site:</p>
<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">https://indieweb.org/POSSE</a></p>
<p>There are a lot of automated tools to help you with this, but the platforms have gone to great lengths to break or neuter them. Musk's attack on Twitter's legendarily flexible and powerful API killed every automation tool that might help with this. I was lucky enough to have a reader – Loren Kohnfelder – who coded me some python scripts that automate much of the process, but POSSE remains a very labor-intensive and error-prone methodology:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd</a></p>
<p>And of all the feeds I produce – email, RSS, Discourse, Medium, Tumblr, Mastodon – none is as labor-intensive as Twitter's. It is an unforgiving medium to begin with, and Musk's drawdown of engineering support has made it wildly unreliable. Many's the time I've set up 20+ posts in a thread, only to have the browser tab reload itself and wipe out all my work.</p>
<p>But I stuck with Twitter, because I have a half-million followers, and to the extent that I reach them there, I can hope that they will follow the permalinks to Pluralistic proper and switch over to RSS, or email, or a daily visit to the blog.</p>
<p>But with each day, the case for using Twitter grows weaker. I get ten times as many replies and reposts on Mastodon, though my Mastodon follower count is a tenth the size of my (increasingly hypothetical) Twitter audience.</p>
<p>All this raises the question of what can or should be done about Twitter. One possible regulatory response would be to impose an "End-To-End" rule on the service, requiring that Twitter deliver posts from willing senders to willing receivers without interfering in them. End-To-end is the bedrock of the internet (one of its incarnations is Net Neutrality) and it's a proven counterenshittificatory force:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/save-news-we-need-end-end-web">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/save-news-we-need-end-end-web</a></p>
<p>Despite what you may have heard, "freedom of reach" <em>is</em> freedom of speech: when a platform interposes itself between willing speakers and their willing audiences, it arrogates to itself the power to control what we're allowed to say and who is allowed to hear us:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen</a></p>
<p>We have a wide variety of tools to make a rule like this stick. For one thing, Musk's Twitter has violated innumerable laws and consent decrees in the US, Canada and the EU, which creates a space for regulators to impose "conduct remedies" on the company.</p>
<p>But there's also existing regulatory authorities, like the FTC's Section Five powers, which enable the agency to act against companies that engage in "unfair and deceptive" acts. When Twitter asks you who you want to hear from, then refuses to deliver their posts to you unless they pay a bribe, that's both "unfair and deceptive":</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge</a></p>
<p>But that's only a stopgap. The problem with Twitter isn't that this important service is run by the wrong mercurial, mediocre billionaire: it's that hundreds of millions of people are at the mercy of <em>any</em> foolish corporate leader. While there's a short-term case for improving the platforms, our long-term strategy should be <em>evacuating</em> them:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/18/urban-wildlife-interface/#combustible-walled-gardens">https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/18/urban-wildlife-interface/#combustible-walled-gardens</a></p>
<p>To make that a reality, we could also impose a "Right To Exit" on the platforms. This would be an interoperability rule that would require Twitter to adopt Mastodon's approach to server-hopping: click a link to export the list of everyone who follows you on one server, click another link to upload that file to another server, and all your followers and followees are relocated to your new digs:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/#free-as-in-puppies">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/#free-as-in-puppies</a></p>
<p>A Twitter with the Right To Exit would exert a powerful discipline even on the stunted self-regulatory centers of Elon Musk's brain. If he banned a reporter for publishing truthful coverage that cast him in a bad light, that reporter would have the legal right to move to another platform, <em>and continue to reach the people who follow them on Twitter</em>. Publishers aghast at having the headlines removed from their Twitter posts could go somewhere less slipshod and still reach the people who want to hear from them on Twitter.</p>
<p>And both Right To Exit and End-To-End satisfy the two prime tests for sound internet regulation: first, they are easy to administer. If you want to know whether Musk is permitting harassment on his platform, you have to agree on a definition of harassment, determine whether a given act meets that definition, and then investigate whether Twitter took reasonable steps to prevent it.</p>
<p>By contrast, administering End-To-End merely requires that you post something and see if your followers receive it. Administering Right To Exit is as simple as saying, "OK, Twitter, I know you say you gave Cory his follower and followee file, but he says he never got it. Just send him another copy, and this time, CC the regulator so we can verify that it arrived."</p>
<p>Beyond administration, there's the cost of compliance. Requiring Twitter to police its users' conduct also requires it to hire an army of moderators – something that Elon Musk might be able to afford, but community-supported, small federated servers couldn't. A tech regulation can easily become a barrier to entry, blocking better competitors who might replace the company whose conduct spurred the regulation in the first place.</p>
<p>End-to-End does not present this kind of barrier. The default state for a social media platform is to deliver posts from accounts to their followers. Interfering with End-To-End costs <em>more</em> than delivering the messages users want to have. Likewise, a Right To Exit is a solved problem, built into the open Mastodon protocol, itself built atop the open ActivityPub standard.</p>
<p>It's not just Twitter. Every platform is consuming itself in an orgy of enshittification. This is the Great Enshittening, a moment of universal, end-stage platform decay. As the platforms burn, calls to address the fires grow louder and harder for policymakers to resist. But not all solutions to platform decay are created equal. Some solutions will perversely <em>enshrine</em> the dominance of platforms, help make them both too big to fail and too big to jail.</p>
<p>Musk has flagrantly violated so many rules, laws and consent decrees that he has accidentally turned Twitter into the perfect starting point for a program of platform reform and platform evacuation.</p>

<p><b>Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin</b> (born <b>Cecilia Helena Payne</b>; May 10, 1900 – December 7, 1979) was a British-born American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer" title="Astronomer">astronomer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysicist" title="Astrophysicist">astrophysicist</a> who proposed in her 1925 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="Doctor of Philosophy">doctoral</a> thesis that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars" title="Stars">stars</a> were composed primarily of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-cwp-1_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-cwp-1-1">[1]</a></sup> Her groundbreaking conclusion was initially rejected because it contradicted the scientific wisdom of the time, which held that there were no significant elemental differences between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> and Earth.

<p>Cecilia Helena Payne was one of three children born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendover" title="Wendover">Wendover</a> in Buckinghamshire, England,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> to Emma Leonora Helena (née Pertz) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_John_Payne" title="Edward John Payne">Edward John Payne</a>, a London barrister, historian and musician who had been an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University">Oxford</a> fellow.<sup id="cite_ref-Andrews_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Andrews-5">[5]</a></sup> Her mother came from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussian</a> family and had two distinguished uncles, historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Heinrich_Pertz" title="Georg Heinrich Pertz">Georg Heinrich Pertz</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedenborgian" title="Swedenborgian">Swedenborgian</a> writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Garth_Wilkinson" title="James John Garth Wilkinson">James John Garth Wilkinson</a>;<sup id="cite_ref-acropoli_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-acropoli-6">[6]</a></sup> her sister Florence was a pianist.<sup id="cite_ref-Andrews_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-Andrews-5">[5]</a></sup> Cecilia Payne's father died when she was four years old, forcing her mother to raise the family on her own.
</p><p>Cecilia Payne began school in Wendover at a private school run by Elizabeth Edwards. When she was twelve her mother moved to London for the sake of the education of Cecilia's brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humfry_Payne" title="Humfry Payne">Humfry</a>, who later became an archaeologist. Cecilia attended St Mary's College, Paddington, where she was unable to study much mathematics or science, but in 1918 changed schools for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Girls%27_School" title="St Paul's Girls' School">St Paul's Girls' School</a>. There she was urged by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst" title="Gustav Holst">Gustav Holst</a>, who taught music at the school, to pursue a career in music, but she preferred to focus on science. The following year she won a scholarship that paid all her expenses at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newnham_College" title="Newnham College">Newnham College</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>, where she initially read botany, physics, and chemistry but she dropped botany after her first year.<sup id="cite_ref-Andrews_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-Andrews-5">[5]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Her interest in astronomy began after she attended a lecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington" title="Arthur Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919" title="Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919">1919 expedition</a> to the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%ADncipe" title="Príncipe">Príncipe</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Guinea" title="Gulf of Guinea">Gulf of Guinea</a> off the west coast of Africa to observe and photograph the stars near a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> as a test of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" title="General relativity">general theory of relativity</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup> She said of the lecture: "The result was a complete transformation of my world picture. [...] My world had been so shaken that I experienced something very like a nervous breakdown."<sup id="cite_ref-autobiography_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-autobiography-8">[8]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 117">: 117 </span></sup> She completed her studies, but was not awarded a degree because of her sex; Cambridge did not grant degrees to women until 1948.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>Payne realized that her only career option in the U.K. was to become a teacher, so she looked for grants that would enable her to move to the United States. After being introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley" title="Harlow Shapley">Harlow Shapley</a>, the Director of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College_Observatory" title="Harvard College Observatory">Harvard College Observatory</a>, where he had just established a graduate program in astronomy, she left England in 1923.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup> This was made possible by a fellowship to encourage women to study at the observatory. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Ames" title="Adelaide Ames">Adelaide Ames</a> had become the first student on the fellowship in 1922; the second was Payne. She was described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_H._Aller" title="Lawrence H. Aller">Lawrence H.

Shapley persuaded Payne to write a doctoral dissertation, and so in 1925 she became the first person to earn a PhD in astronomy from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_College" title="Radcliffe College">Radcliffe College</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sobel_2016-203213_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sobel_2016-203213-11">[11]</a></sup> Her thesis title was <i>Stellar Atmospheres; A Contribution to the Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-thesis_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-thesis-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-cwp-1_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-cwp-1-1">[1]</a></sup></p><figure typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg/220px-ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg" decoding="async" width="220" height="110" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg/330px-ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg/440px-ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg 2x" data-file-width="6000" data-file-height="3000"></a><figcaption>Ratios of hydrogen and helium measured in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_galaxy" title="Milky Way galaxy">Milky Way galaxy</a> match Payne-Gaposchkin's 1925 calculations.</figcaption></figure><p>Payne was able to accurately relate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification" title="Stellar classification">spectral classes</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" title="Star">stars</a> to their actual temperatures by applying Indian physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghnad_Saha" title="Meghnad Saha">Meghnad Saha</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saha_ionization_equation" title="Saha ionization equation">ionization theory</a>. She showed that the great variation in stellar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line" title="Spectral line">absorption lines</a> was due to differing amounts of ionization at different temperatures, not to different amounts of elements. She found that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon" title="Silicon">silicon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a>, and other common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity" title="Metallicity">metals</a> seen in the Sun's spectrum were present in about the same relative amounts as on Earth, in agreement with the accepted belief of the time, which held that the stars had approximately the same elemental composition as the Earth. However, she found that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a> and particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> were vastly more abundant (for hydrogen, by a factor of about one million).<sup id="cite_ref-:1_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-:1-13">[13]</a></sup> Her thesis concluded that hydrogen was the overwhelming constituent of stars, making it the most abundant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">element</a> in the Universe.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-:2-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>However, when Payne's dissertation was reviewed, astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell" title="Henry Norris Russell">Henry Norris Russell</a>, who stood by the theories of American physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Augustus_Rowland" title="Henry Augustus Rowland">Henry Rowland</a>, dissuaded her from concluding that the composition of the Sun was predominantly hydrogen because it would contradict the scientific consensus of the time that the elemental composition of the Sun and the Earth were similar.<sup id="cite_ref-amnh_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-amnh-15">[15]</a></sup> In 1914, he had written in an academic article:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The agreement of the solar and terrestrial lists is such as to confirm very strongly Rowland's opinion that, if the Earth's crust should be raised to the temperature of the Sun's atmosphere, it would give a very similar absorption spectrum. The spectra of the Sun and other stars were similar, so it appeared that the relative abundance of elements in the universe was like that in Earth's crust.<sup id="cite_ref-russell-1914_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-russell-1914-16">[16]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Payne consequently described her results as "spurious".<sup id="cite_ref-thesis_12-1"><a href="#cite_note-thesis-12">[12]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 186">: 186 </span></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_14-1"><a href="#cite_note-:2-14">[14]</a></sup> A few years later, astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Struve" title="Otto Struve">Otto Struve</a> described her work as "the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy".<sup id="cite_ref-aps_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-aps-17">[17]</a></sup> Russell also realized she was correct when he derived the same results by different means. In 1929, he published his findings in a paper that briefly acknowledged Payne's earlier work and discovery, including the mention that "[t]he most important previous determination of the abundance of the elements by astrophysical means is that by Miss Payne [...]".<sup id="cite_ref-quote_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-quote-18">[18]</a></sup> Nevertheless, he was generally credited for the conclusions she reached.<sup id="cite_ref-russell_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-russell-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-newnham_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-newnham-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-epigenesys_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-epigenesys-21">[21]</a></sup>
</p><p>Accepted ratios for hydrogen and helium in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_galaxy" title="Milky Way galaxy">Milky Way Galaxy</a> are ~74% hydrogen and ~24% helium, confirming the results of Payne-Gaposchkin's calculations from 1925.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

</p><p>Payne-Gaposchkin remained scientifically active throughout her life, spending her entire academic career at Harvard. When she began, women were barred from becoming professors at Harvard, so she spent years doing less prestigious, low-paid research jobs. Nevertheless, her work resulted in several published books, including <i>The Stars of High Luminosity</i> (1930), <i>Variable Stars</i> (1938) and <i>Variable Stars and Galactic Structure</i> (1954). Shapley had made efforts to improve her position, and in 1938 she was given the title of "Astronomer." On Payne's request, her title was later changed to Phillips Astronomer, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_endowment#Endowed_professorships" title="Financial endowment">endowed position</a> which would make her an "officer of the university"; in order to get approval for her title, Shapley assured the university that giving Payne-Gaposchkin this position would not make her equivalent to a professor, but privately pushed for the position to be later converted into an explicit professorship as the "Phillips Professor of Astronomy".<sup id="cite_ref-autobiography_8-1"><a href="#cite_note-autobiography-8">[8]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 225">: 225 </span></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sobel_2016-245258_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sobel_2016-245258-24">[24]</a></sup> She was elected a Fellow of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences" title="American Academy of Arts and Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1943.<sup id="cite_ref-AAAS_25-0"><a href="#cite_note-AAAS-25">[25]</a></sup> Her courses were not recorded in the Harvard University catalogue until 1945.<sup id="cite_ref-cwp-1_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-cwp-1-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>Payne's career marked a turning point at Harvard College Observatory. Under the direction of Harlow Shapley and Dr E. J. Sheridan (whom Payne-Gaposchkin described as a mentor<sup id="cite_ref-autobiography_8-2"><a href="#cite_note-autobiography-8">[8]</a></sup>), the observatory had already offered more opportunities in astronomy to women than did other institutions. This was evident in the achievements accomplished earlier in the century by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming" title="Williamina Fleming">Williamina Fleming</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Maury" title="Antonia Maury">Antonia Maury</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon" title="Annie Jump Cannon">Annie Jump Cannon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt" title="Henrietta Swan Leavitt">Henrietta Swan Leavitt</a>. However, with Payne's PhD, women entered the mainstream.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>
</p><p>The trail she blazed into the largely male-dominated scientific community was an inspiration to many. For example, she became a role model for astrophysicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Feynman" title="Joan Feynman">Joan Feynman</a>. Feynman's mother and grandmother had dissuaded her from pursuing science, since they believed women were not physically capable of understanding scientific concepts.<sup id="cite_ref-Hirshberg1_32-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hirshberg1-32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ottaviani_33-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ottaviani-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sykes_34-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sykes-34">[34]</a></sup> Feynman was inspired by Payne-Gaposchkin when she came across her work in an astronomy textbook. Seeing Payne-Gaposchkin's published research convinced Feynman that she could, in fact, follow her scientific passions.<sup id="cite_ref-Hirshberg1_32-1"><a href="#cite_note-Hirshberg1-32">[32]</a></sup>
</p><p>While accepting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell_Lectureship" title="Henry Norris Russell Lectureship">Henry Norris Russell Prize</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society" title="American Astronomical Society">American Astronomical Society</a>, Payne spoke of her lifelong passion for research: "The reward of the young scientist is the emotional thrill of being the first person in the history of the world to see something or understand something. Nothing can compare with that experience [...] The reward of the old scientist is the sense of having seen a vague sketch grow into a masterly landscape."<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

</p><p>In 1931, Payne became a United States citizen. On a tour through Europe in 1933, she met Russian-born astrophysicist Sergei I. Gaposchkin in Germany. She helped him get a visa to the United States, and they married in March 1934, settling in the historic town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Massachusetts" title="Lexington, Massachusetts">Lexington, Massachusetts</a>, a short commute from Harvard. Payne added her husband's name to her own, and the Payne-Gaposchkins had three children: Edward, Katherine and Peter. Payne's daughter remembers her as "an inspired seamstress, an inventive knitter, and a voracious reader". Payne and her family were members of the First <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism" title="Unitarian Universalism">Unitarian</a> Church in Lexington, where Cecilia taught Sunday school.

  <section> 
  <p>It was March 2020, I was in New England when covid quarantine had just begin and I found myself much more homebound. In these situations I'm not one to just do nothing. I always have some sort of project or hobby to keep me busy, be it taking and editing photos, writing detailed blog posts, or coding something.</p>

  <p>I had always wanted to learn iOS development, so this felt like the perfect opportunity. I was particularly keen to learn SwiftUI to build my designs natively. Years back I had dabbled with writing an Objective-C app, but it never quite filled me with joy, to say the least. As a designer, I've spent the last decade getting good with prototyping tools and frameworks to mimic realistic, interactive mobile prototypes. Building it myself was the natural next step to give me even more control over the experience, and <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/craft/">get even deeper into the craft.</a></p>

  <p>I started learning Swift and SwiftUI basics with courses like Design+Code, and Hacking with Swift. But I knew myself—I learn best with a project of my own. I knew exactly what I wanted to build: a better stock portfolio tracker. The stock market had taken a plunge with covid and I was doing dozens of trades per week with everything on sale. It would be fun to have a simple app of my own to track the performance of my trades instead of dealing with the subpar sites and apps from my stockbrokers.</p>

  <p>Little did I know this project would consume my nights and weekends for over two years, often spending 10-20 hours a week on it. I built a ton of functionality, sweat all the details, wrote a comprehensive node backend for it, created an LLC for it, and managed an active Testflight. I was learning Swift and SwiftUI along the way, so I was often redesigning and rebuilding as I went.</p>
  <p>Eventually, I decided to stop pursuing it. I'll get into the why a bit later. <strong>This post is for me to document <a href="https://stocketa.com/" title="Checking your stocks &amp; crypto should be easy.">Stocketa</a>.</strong> I designed and built a lot that I'm proud of and want to have somewhere to archive it before I pull the plug.</p>

  <h5 id="what-is-stocketa">What <del>is</del> was Stocketa</h5>
  <p>Stocketa was a simple portfolio tracker designed with care. It came out of my frustration of having to check the clunky apps and sites that my brokers had just to get a glimpse at how my investments were doing. I'm a casual investor and don't need much from a tool like this but I had assets in various places, and I just wanted one easy and well-designed place to check them. I wanted to see real per-transaction gain/loss info, based on my own cost basis.</p>

  <p>While there are tons of apps, brokers, and neobanks that address this, nothing quite felt like what I wanted. There were several types of solutions in this space:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>First off, there are simple stock apps like Apple Stocks that let you see stock charts, news, and more. They have good data and don't require any accounts to use. However, they offer no functionality to log your holdings and track your gains/losses.</p></li>
    <li><p>There are lots of broker apps (e.g., Robinhood) that let you trade and track your holdings, but they only let you see your holdings from them, not from any other financial services you might use.</p></li>
    <li><p>Then there's a whole category of what I'd call advanced stock services like TradingView (and several that have since died or pivoted over the years), but they're not mobile-first or as elegant as I wanted.</p></li>
    <li><p>There are broader investment advisor services like Personal Capital. While they do often have some aggregator functionality to link up your other accounts, they're not that powerful for diving into individual assets, aren't particularly well-designed, and are primarily focused on upselling you on their own investment advising services (seriously, I used to get endless 8am calls from Personal Capital).</p></li>
    <li><p>And there are lots of smaller apps on the App Store where you can track your holdings but the design and UX leaves a lot to be desired. I've tried most of them.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>From a design perspective, I generally found that financial apps bias towards density when displaying your assets. They assume you have tons of stocks and prioritize a list view where you have to tap in to a detail view to see more info. I found myself constantly tapping in, manipulating a chart or looking at some basic stats, then swiping back and repeating all that for several stocks. It was not easy or the kind of at a glance info I wanted.</p>

  <p>That left me with my challenge. I wanted a <em>simple</em> portfolio tracker aimed at the casual investor. It didn't have to do it all, but it should aim to do a few things well. An app just for me.</p>

  <h5 id="custom">Going custom</h5>
  <p>I was more than thrilled to be working on a new app from scratch. After years of working at large companies with rigid design systems and gobs of stakeholders for every little design decision, I was yearning for some creative freedom. Freedom from process, freedom from typical design constraints. I would be in full control, designing and building it myself. <strong>It was <em>my</em> <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/side-projects/">side project</a> after all</strong>.</p>

  <p>I had gotten tired of designing for traditional mobile apps. You know the type.. you add a tab bar, a typical navigation stack, page header and the app already feels significantly basic, muted, and limited out of the gate.</p>
  
  <p><strong>This was my place to have fun.</strong> I wanted to go custom and toss out whatever components the system gives you for free. And I knew that by having to figure out how to build various UI components from scratch, I'd learn a lot along the way. Almost all of Stocketa's UI is custom.</p>

  <p>I will say that <strong>going custom is almost always the absolutely <em>wrong</em> thing to do</strong> 99% of the time. The operating system you're working in—be it iOS, Android, macOS—has invested a ton in a highly-considered suite of components. They're remarkably accessible, well-tested, and work on a variety of devices.</p>

  <p>It's absolutely no small feat to consider creating a custom component for your app. However, when going custom does make sense and you're okay with the added scope and responsibility, the app becomes your canvas to do whatever you want and <em>make it yours</em>.</p>

  <p>The first area where custom made sense for me was general app navigation. When I got started, I knew I wanted this app to have minimal app chrome. I didn't want a standard tab bar and header taking up space. I wasn't going to require much navigation: most things would just live inside the stock cards from the home timeline.</p>

  <p>The app would be focused around showing more with less. Personally, I only cared about tracking a few stocks, but I hated the work of constantly having to tap in to see a detail view, or interact with the chart. As such, the main scroll view needed to be more immersive and not get occluded by unnecessary app chrome.</p>

  <p>It started with app navigation, custom stock cards, sheets, and more. Needless to say, I spent a lot of time on the details with everything being custom. Below are a few examples:</p>

  

  <h5 id="building">Designing and building</h5>

  <p>I started with the basics: getting a scroll view of stock cards working, adding charts, and hooking it up to a database for persistence (initially Core Data before moving to Firebase). Then I added the requisite network calls and polling to update the stock card from a financial data provider. I started with IEX as the data provider as they had a decent API, reasonable pricing, and allowed commercial use, which would be required for a consumer app like this to go on the App Store.</p>

  <p>One of the initial key decisions with Stocketa was that I wanted to track stock transactions in a comprehensive way. Simply logging the number of shares you had for each stock was not going to cut it. This ended up being a significant amount of work to do properly, but it was necessary:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>For each stock sale or purchase I wanted to be able to display not only the total gain/loss, but per-transaction gain/loss so you could tell if an individual transaction was a good trade.</p></li>
    <li><p>When it comes to stock sales, I needed to know the cost basis method (FIFO, LIFO, et cetera) so I could correctly calculate and display the realized and unrealized gains on a particular transaction. When selling shares, I also needed to know from which previous transaction or transactions the shares would be sold so I could get the correct cost basis and accurately calculate the gain/loss based on the cost basis method.</p></li>
    <li><p>And then there was dealing with stock splits, which seems simple at first glance but ended up being quite a bit of work to build in a robust way: not simply altering previous transactions. They should be automatically applied for new splits, but also able to be manually applied if you didn't log split-adjusted transactions.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>At some point I gave it a name: Stocketa. In Greek you might say "marketa" (Μαρκέτα, though αγορά might be a more proper word) when referring to a market, so this was like  coalescing Stock and Market with that in mind.</p>

  <p>When I was interviewing for a new job in 2021, I created these slides as part of my presentation after talking about my work at Twitter for the previous 9 years.

  <h5 id="swiftui">A note about SwiftUI</h5>
  <p>I kept designing, building.. and then redesigning and rebuilding. One of the side effects of learning Swift and SwiftUI as I was building this was that I was constantly redoing specific pages and parts of the app as I went. I continually found better ways to build things, and similarly I would continually refine designs. About a year or so into building Stocketa I <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/getting-started-with-swiftui/">wrote about my experience with SwiftUI</a>. Much of that still rings true.</p>

  <p>SwiftUI has come a long way since iOS 13. It's more performant, there's more parity in available components and functionality compared with UIKit, and you get more control over things. And with iOS 17, you get some goodies like shaders, keyframes, scroll transitions, and more.</p>

  <p>There's still a gap between the types of things you can do with AppKit and UIKit, but SwiftUI is undeniably a powerful tool that's dramatically more approachable. And not just a coding tool; it's a great design tool. Designers can quickly lay things out, hook up interactions, and get a real feel for a design using a native tool. </p>
  <p>Almost all of Stocketa's UI is built with SwiftUI. There were only a few occasions when I found it necessary to use UIKit to achieve some goal.<sup><a rel="footnote" href="#footnote-1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
 None of this would have been possible, or drawn me to take a closer look into building iOS apps, if it hadn't been for SwiftUI.</p>

  <h5 id="what-i-built">What I built</h5>
  <p>I used the app daily and continued pouring time into every feature and detail to meet my high quality bar. While I initially planned for this to be a simple to build app that would not require a backend, or even any user accounts, that did not last for long. I quickly realized I needed my own backend to unlock a few things.</p>

  <p>At first, this was so I didn't have to include the API key for my financial data provider inside the app for security reasons—I wouldn't want someone to find it and start running up my bill by abusing it. I created a backend proxy for the API with rate-limiting and throttling. Then, I wanted to have it be authenticated with user accounts, so I added Sign In With Apple along with a stock data caching system so that I only had to fetch stats for a stock once with a certain time period (depending on the particular stat that was either seconds, 24 hours, or weekly) regardless of however many user accounts needed that stock info. The main goal with that was to also reduce my costs associated with financial data API usage.</p>

  <p>By this point I really started enjoying the speed at which I could update endpoints and business logic entirely on the backend. I started moving logic I had in the app to the backend. <strong>Stocketa was starting to come together.</strong></p>

  <p>Even though this was just a solo project, I used Linear to keep track of tasks, ideas, features, customer feedback, and milestones.</p>

  <div>
      <figure>
        <a href="https://turbo.paulstamatiou.com/uploads/2023/08/copyright-paulstamatiou_com-stocketa-linear.webp"><img src="https://turbo.paulstamatiou.com/uploads/2023/08/copyright-paulstamatiou_com-stocketa-linear.webp" data-ratio="1.393" loading="lazy"></a>
      </figure>
    </div>

  <p>I had prioritized lists of things to build and bugs to fix. I was using—and loving—Linear for this. Here's a list of <em>most</em> of the things I built for Stocketa:</p>

  

  <p>I ran a small TestFlight alpha with close friends, then increasingly I added more people. At one point I was up to around 1,000 people. That was the most I wanted to allow. I received lots of feedback from overall great first impressions (below), to general feature requests, and of course lots of bug reports.</p>
    
  <blockquote>
    <p>Already the app is filling a need for me in its personal approach to tracking investments: no pushing for sales, no integrations with brokers and no unnecessary permissions. Brilliant.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Simply amazed at the SwiftUI work you’ve poured into this app. So beautiful. The onboarding alone is a masterclass in attention to detail. Bravo.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>love it, this feels so polished and slick already... really great use of SwiftUI</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Just got the invite, added my stocks... the animations are beautiful, design is clean and precise... it’s all around beautiful. Congrats!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>F**k, man. This app is incredible. You’re building all of this on your own?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dude. This app is f**king beautiful. Really great job. Just imported shares - super easy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This NUX is insane. The particles when you add a stock. Gives me the happy brain chemicals..</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>I had thousands on a waiting list but there were API and hosting costs associated with the increased usage that I didn't want to bear yet, as well as a huge increase in support and customer feedback that took a lot of time to manage. You start to hear the same types of feedback, and it just becomes a chore to manage that many emails. That good news was that something was resonating and people cared enough to go through the work to send in bug reports and feature requests.</p>

  <h5 id="website">The website</h5>
  <p>At some point early in feature development I took a break to focus on the website. At first I wanted a simple landing page to build interest, and collect emails for a waitlist so I could keep people in the loop. And I didn't want to spend that much time on it.</p>

    <p><small><strong>Video:</strong> Initial Stocketa teaser homepage.</small>
  </p></div>

  <p>There was nothing fancy or particularly special about this initial page. It was just something quick I wanted to get out the door. And now, a while later, there's a lot I hate about this early design. The background texture was too strong, the headline alignment feels odd with the phone.. but I digress.</p>
  
  <p>In that initial design I did start playing with some wave-related elements—a loose reference to stock market charts going up and down. And then to add to that, I built a few mini stock cards gently hovering in place (thanks to <code>offset-path</code> CSS along with 2 keyframe animations) in the background. Each stock card had an SVG line chart—loosely based on that stock's actual performance around the time—that would animate on page load. I ended up keeping a version of these mini stock cards on the latest version of the website, and then on an onboarding screen inside the app.</p>

  <p>The original inspiration for these random floating stock cards was from my now <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/work">out-of-date work page</a> where I highlighted projects with some large cards, each with their own intro animation based on the project. One of them was for my work on Twitter Video, where video clip thumbnails would fan out from the phone on hover (shown below).</p>

  </p></div>

  <p>In early 2021 I ended up getting around to designing and building out the first complete homepage for Stocketa. I had enough functionality and features built that it felt worthy of investing some time into showcasing them on the site.</p>
  
  <p>Lots of app websites at the time (and still now) had the typical hero section on their homepage: some app screenshot in a phone frame off to one side, with accompanying header and subtitle text adjacent. Nothing wrong with that, but I wanted something a bit more engaging. I wasn't entirely interested in optimizing for conversion, and cramming a lot in above the page fold.</p>

  <p>I thought it would be nice to try to do something where the 3D phone frame was angled and then began to change position on scroll while a brief teaser video of the app functionality played. Apple had done something similar in recent years with product pages, such as the first-generation AirPods Pro. They used over 100 frames of the AirPods that would progress as you scrolled:</p>

    <p><small>Example of a technique used by Apple.</small>
  </p></div>

  <p>There's a lot of ways to achieve an effect like this. One route route is using Lottie and essentially converting each frame of your video or animation to a base64-encoded string in a json file for the Lottie web player to manage. It's not a flawless solution, however, and can incur some large file sizes depending on what you're doing. It's best for vector micro-animations, not large devices with complex visual content. I also didn't want to incur the cost of that large initial json download blocking the very first thing you see on the site.</p>

  <p>Instead I opted to have javascript display a sequence of frames composited to <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> along with an offscreenCanvas for performance. I used <a href="https://rotato.app/" title="3D mockup images and movies in minutes">Rotato</a> to import my short Stocketa screencast, create a 3D phone video, and then create a PNG sequence of frames. I wasn't super pleased with the quality—the phone frame didn't look super realistic and had some rough pixelated edges—but it was good enough compared to doing it all by hand with other design tools.</p>

  </p></div>
  
  <p>I then exported optimized transparent webp, and jpg files (with accompanying alpha masks created in Sketch to save bandwidth) and had the javascript detect which file type to use for the animation. While I was pleased with how this effect turned out, it ended up becoming a rather huge annoyance when I wanted to update the content later—it's a pain to generate, optimize, and update the image sequence each time.</p>

  <small>Other bits of the website: cards for various features.</small>

<section>
  <p>And finally, as for the rest of the content on this site I went with a basic feature card approach, sometimes called a "bento box" layout; particularly when varying card sizes are used. This is a layout that I've grown to like a bit less over the years as it has become very common.</p>

    <p><small><strong>Video:</strong> New Stocketa site</small>
  </p></div>
  <p>A year later, it was time for another redesign. Stocketa had more functionality, and a lot more refinements. I had more to share, and I had grown tired of the 3D phone frame interaction. It was neat but it was just there for show; it wasn't the best way to show off parts of the app as it scrolled off screen. It was also a pain to update the frame sequences. I essentially just wanted to take screenshots of the real app from the iOS simulator and upload them.</p>

  <p>Separately, I didn't want a super long page with a lot of repetitive modules and screenshots. I wanted a skimmable feature list. I began to wonder if I could get away with just a single phone frame on the site that showed everything.</p>

  <p>I eventually landed on a two pane approach: the device frame was always in view, fixed on the right side, while the scrollable left side contained the feature list. The trade-off with this design was that it would require hovering over each feature item to be able to update the screenshot shown in the device frame. I figured an interesting compromise to that would be having the phones stack up and away on scroll. Almost like the old Apple Time Machine backup UI.</p>

  <p>I built several versions of this and found that it didn't feel great. There wasn't much scroll distance so if you scrolled at a normal or fast pace, you'd see a bunch of phones flicker by you as the animations tried to keep up. It was too busy and hectic, not to mention a lot of state management to deal with jumping between your current scroll-based position screenshot to a hover-based screenshot if you hovered over a feature list item. I ended up simplifying a bit and only having the scroll-based UI manage just a few states: the intro phone frame, the first feature screenshot, and then a final animation at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <p><small>The website's mobile layout uses a carousel of screenshots in the header.</small>
  </p></div>

  <p>After sorting out the core interactions, I had to figure out how to deal with mobile and tablet interactions. The fix two-pane layout made this a bit of a challenge. I ended up turning the header into a carousel of device frames you could scroll through.</p>

  <p>And then finally, I added a few small bits of polish ✨:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Hero title text gradient changes based on scroll</p></li>
    <li><p>The icon accent color and background circle color change based on scroll</p></li>
    <li><p>When hovering over any feature list item, there is a subtle background color change created by an overlaid gradient. SVG-created noise/grain is also overlaid on top of the background.</p></li>
    <li><p>When hovering over any feature list item, or when you're reached the end of the page, there's a subtle icon particle emitter that floats up icons from the bottom. Each feature used a different icon for this.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Overall I liked this design, but looking back at almost a year later, the gradient text and background colors feel a bit too much for my taste now.</p>


  <h5 id="api">API troubles</h5>
  <p>Eventually it became clear that the quality of financial data Stocketa relied on was not cutting it. The first provider I used, IEX, would sometimes have charts outdated, inaccurate prices (especially for less frequently traded assets on the IEX exchange), and lacked data for OTC markets (they required you sign a pricey license directly with OTC), as well as significantly limited data for Nasdaq-listed stocks (even basic things like pre-market and after-hours data). The last straw was when IEX dropped mutual fund data entirely, all without any advance notice.</p>
  
  <p>I later used another provider that allowed commercial use that didn't charge too much ($100/month) but I had even more problems with their data and reliability. Endpoints were even returning old and incorrect data, and even once alerted to issues, their team would not only ignore the bugs but claim they didn't exist. I couldn't ship Stocketa with unreliable financial data to people that would be paying me for a quality app.</p>
  
  <p>I also could not get certain types of data with paid APIs. I had to build a scraping engine on my backend that would visit a few sites to get the data I needed for less updated data like dividend yield, earnings dates, and even for OEF data (other providers would be more than a day delayed for this at times).</p>

  <p>Needless to say, this was all frustrating. It was a hassle, hard to maintain, and unreliable. At the same time, my backend continued getting more involved to deal with more and more of the intricacies of dealing with stocks. Things like dealing with companies merging or stock tickers renaming.</p>

    <small>~13k LOC node/express backend (shown in Zed but I now prefer <a href="https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1713303350987698459">Cursor</a>) for Cloud Run. It manages auth, caching, news, core business logic, cleaning up data, notifications, widgets, working with multiple API, and a bit of scraping. This was my first time doing anything of this size with node and typescript.</small>
  </section>

  <p>Starting out I thought getting access to a stock market data API would be the easy part. I quickly learned about the world of market data feeds, SIPs (Securities Information Processor), and vendor agreements.</p>

  <p>Quality market data exists, it's just not made for indie app developers. It's very expensive. Several leading U.S. market data providers have commercial use data pricing starting at $2,000 per month. And that's not for everything, if you need things like index data or options data, there's more charges ahead.</p>

  <p>I spoke with one of these providers last year, trying to get them to understand how small app developers need affordable commercial use data. They presented a startup-focused plan that they were pitching for $499/month in addition to a per-MAU fee. Even that I would still consider very expensive for my needs, and it seems like that may have fallen by the wayside and is no longer promoted on their website.</p>
    
  <p>I could spend months developing Stocketa, incurring that monthly API cost until I went live (or risk getting shutdown if I tried to use a cheaper non-commercial plan during the TestFlight phase) then not make enough money to cover costs on the App Store and have to shut it down shortly after anyways.</p>
  
  <p>Overall, it feels like no one in this cares to cater to the developer and startup crowd, or they believe there's not much money for them to pursue there. This was the same case with Plaid when I briefly looked into getting access to their investments API to automatically sync holdings data. They required some sort of minimum length contract.</p>
  
  <h5 id="stopping">Why I stopped working on Stocketa</h5>
  <p>When I started this project, I really began to wonder why where weren't any great indie apps focused on stocks like this. Just simple, well-designed apps to help the casual investor keep track of their investments. Well I think I was starting to get my answer: getting quality financial data, even just for the United States, is a nightmare. You can only get it if you have a lot of money to invest in your project. And good luck if you really want a great API with comprehensive international data.</p>
  
  <p>I can't help but draw parallels to what happened recently with the Twitter and Reddit APIs. The risk of running your project or business solely on top of another company's API, no matter how reliable you think they may be, is extremely high.</p>
  
  <p>Stocketa was always meant to be a side project—never a real business. For it to be a real business, I would need to keep adding functionality and introducing more ways to make money. I couldn't just have a simple and elegant little app tracking your stocks. It would have to do more, like dipping into financial advice services, or offering stock trading. That's a hyper-competitive space lined with massive companies. That would mean a busier, cluttered app. The exact reason why I started Stocketa was because of all those cluttered apps.</p>
  
  <p><strong>I decided to stop working on Stocketa for a few reasons:</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Data:</strong> As mentioned above, all the expenses and challenges associated with acquiring reliable, affordable, and high-quality financial data that would make it feasible to release this as a reasonably priced subscription-based app.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> The associated investment in customer support. Based on how people were using my TestFlight, it was going to be a significant investment to keep up with support, emails, maintenance, and ongoing feature development. However, part of this was likely due to complexity incurred from having to fix or skirt around unreliable data. There were lots of things I wanted to keep improving and refining with the app and that wouldn't end any time soon.</p>
      <p>If I were to release and charge for Stocketa, I would feel especially on the hook to resolve issues in a timely manner and that's not something I can accomodate now because of the next point.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Time:</strong> And most importantly, I've found something more worthy of my complete focus and attention: <a href="https://rewind.ai/">Rewind AI</a>. I sunk a lot of nights and weekends into Stocketa over the years. It consumed every spare moment, even taking over my occasional time writing blog posts here when I had something to share. That was something I really missed. Now, I would much rather be focusing my creative thinking time on how I can improve and grow Rewind.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>I originally started working on Stocketa with one goal: to learn Swift and SwiftUI my way with a project that was interesting to me. At the time that was scratching my own itch of keeping track of my investments. While it turned into a much larger and unshipped project, I learned a ton about native iOS development and was able to push myself creatively.</p>

  <p>These days I'm happiest investing my design, product and development time into <a href="https://rewind.ai/">Rewind AI</a>, where my SwiftUI knowledge learned with Stocketa has been tremendously helpful.</p>

  <p id="footnote-1"><a href="#r1">1</a> I only had to go down to UIKit a few times. One time for things like custom text fields for more control over interactions, styling, text input, and formatting. Another to use a CollectionView for drag-to-reorder stocks. A third time for creating particle emitters in a few places, like confetti effects, as well as one area where I have some twinkling stars in a night illustration when the stock market is closed. And one last time to get more control over gestures. I needed to get a location when a long press <em>begins</em> and SwiftUI LongPressGesture() didn't provide that, so I used UILongPressGestureRecognizer instead.</p>

<h2>One of America's most corporate-crime-friendly bankruptcy judges forced to recuse himself (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/16/texas-two-step/#david-jones">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>"I’ll believe corporations are people when Texas executes one." The now-famous quip from Robert Reich cuts to the bone of corporate personhood. Corporations are people with speech rights. They are heat-shields that absorb liability on behalf of their owners and managers.</p>
<p>But the membrane separating corporations from people is selectively permeable. A corporation is separate from its owners, who are not liable for its deeds – but it can also be "closely held," and so inseparable from those owners that their religious beliefs can excuse their companies from obeying laws they don't like:</p>
<p><a href="https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2014/10/13/hobby-lobby-and-closely-held-corporations/">https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2014/10/13/hobby-lobby-and-closely-held-corporations/</a></p>
<p>Corporations – not their owners – are liable for their misdeeds (that's the "limited liability" in "limited liablity corporation"). But owners of a murderous company can hold their victims' families hostage and secure bankruptcies for their companies that wipe out their owners' culpability – without any requirement for the owners to surrender their billions to the people they killed and maimed:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/11/justice-delayed/#justice-redeemed">https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/11/justice-delayed/#justice-redeemed</a></p>
<p>Corporations are, in other words, a kind of Schroedinger's Cat for impunity: when it helps the ruling class, corporations are inseparable from their owners; when that would hinder the rich and powerful, corporations are wholly distinct entities. They exist in a state of convenient superposition that collapses only when a plutocrat opens the box and decides what is inside it. Heads they win, tails we lose.</p>
<p>Key to corporate impunity is the rigged bankruptcy system. "Debts that can't be paid, won't be paid," so every successful civilization has some system for discharging debt, or it risks collapse:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/bankruptcy-protects-fake-people-brutalizes-real-ones/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/bankruptcy-protects-fake-people-brutalizes-real-ones/</a></p>
<p>When you or I declare bankruptcy, we have to give up virtually everything and endure years (or a lifetime) of punitive retaliation based on our stained credit records, and even then, our student debts continue to haunt us, as do lawless scumbag debt-collectors:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/12/do-not-pay/#fair-debt-collection-practices-act">https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/12/do-not-pay/#fair-debt-collection-practices-act</a></p>
<p>When a giant corporation declares bankruptcy, by contrast, it emerges shorn of its union pension obligations and liabilities owed to workers and customers it abused or killed, and continues merrily on its way, re-offending at will. Big companies have mastered the Texas Two-Step, whereby a company creates a subsidiary that inherits all its liabilities, but not its assets. The liability-burdened company is declared bankrupt, and the company's sins are shriven at the bang of a judge's gavel:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/01/j-and-j-jk/#risible-gambit">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/01/j-and-j-jk/#risible-gambit</a></p>
<p>Three US judges oversee the majority of large corporate bankruptcies, and they are so reliable in their deference to this scheme that an entire industry of high-priced lawyers exists solely to game the system to ensure that their clients end up before one of these judges. When the Sacklers were seeking to abscond with their billions in opioid blood-money and stiff their victims' families, they set their sights on Judge Robert Drain in the Southern District of New York:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/23/a-bankrupt-process/#sacklers">https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/23/a-bankrupt-process/#sacklers</a></p>
<p>To get in front of Drain, the Sacklers opened an office in White Plains, NY, then waited 192 days to file bankruptcy papers there (it takes six months to establish jurisdiction). Their papers including invisible metadata that identified the case as destined for Judge Drain's court, in a bid to trick the court's Case Management/Electronic Case Files system to assign the case to him.</p>
<p>The case was even pre-captioned "RDD" ("Robert D Drain"), to nudge clerks into getting their case into a friendly forum.</p>
<p>If the Sacklers hadn't opted for Judge Drain, they might have set their sights on the Houston courthouse presided over by Judge David Jones, the second of of the three most corporate-friendly large bankruptcy judges. Judge Jones is a Texas judge – as in "Texas Two-Step" – and he has a long history of allowing corporate murderers and thieves to escape with their fortunes intact and their victims penniless:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice">https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice</a></p>
<p>But David Jones's reign of error is now in limbo. It turns out that he was secretly romantically involved with Elizabeth Freeman, a leading Texas corporate bankruptcy lawyer who argues Texas Two-Step cases in front of her boyfriend, Judge David Jones.</p>
<p>Judge Jones doesn't deny that he and Freeman are romantically involved, but said that he didn't think this fact warranted disclosure – let alone recusal – because they aren't married and "he didn't benefit economically from her legal work." He said that he'd only have to disclose if the two owned communal property, but the deed for their house lists them as co-owners:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24032507-general-warranty-deed">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24032507-general-warranty-deed</a></p>
<p>(Jones claims they don't live together – rather, he owns the house and pays the utility bills but lets Freeman live there.)</p>
<p>Even if they didn't own communal property, judges should not hear cases where one of the parties is represented by their long term romantic partner. I mean, that is a weird sentence to have to type, but I stand by it.</p>
<p>The case that led to the revelation and Jones's stepping away from his cases while the Fifth Circuit investigates is a ghastly – but typical – corporate murder trial. Corizon is a prison healthcare provider that killed prisoners with neglect, in the most cruel and awful ways imaginable. Their families sued, so Corizon budded off two new companies: YesCare got all the contracts and other assets, while Tehum Care Services got all the liabilities:</p>
<p><a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/prominent-bankruptcy-judge-david-jones-033801325.html">https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/prominent-bankruptcy-judge-david-jones-033801325.html</a></p>
<p>Then, Tehum paid Freeman to tell her boyfriend, Judge Jones, to let it declare bankruptcy, leaving $173m for YesCare and allocating $37m for the victims suing Tehum. Corizon owes more than $1.2b, "including tens of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices and hundreds of malpractice suits filed by prisoners and their families who have alleged negligent care":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kccllc.net/tehum/document/2390086230522000000000041">https://www.kccllc.net/tehum/document/2390086230522000000000041</a></p>
<p>Under the deal, if Corizon murdered your family member, you would get $5,000 in compensation. Corizon gets to continue operating, using that $173m to prolong its yearslong murder spree.</p>
<p>The revelation that Jones and Freeman are lovers has derailed this deal. Jones is under investigation and has recused himself from his cases. The US Trustee – who represents creditors in bankruptcy cases – has intervened to block the deal, calling Tehum "a barren estate, one that was stripped of all of its valuable assets as a result of the combination and divisional mergers that occurred prior to the bankruptcy filing."</p>
<p>This is the third high-profile sleazy corporate bankruptcy that had victory snatched from the jaws of defeat this year: there was Johnson and Johnson's attempt to escape from liability from tricking women into powdering their vulvas with asbestos (no, really), the Sacklers' attempt to abscond with billions after kicking off the opioid epidemic that's killed 800,000+ Americans and counting, and now this one.</p>
<p>This one might be the most consequential, though – it has the potential to eliminate <em>one third</em> of the major crime-enabling bankruptcy judges serving today.</p>
<p>One down.</p>
<p>Two to go.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>When film director <a title="Innocence" href="https://randomwire.com/innocence">Mamoru Oshii</a> was looking for a model of the city of the future for his seminal 1995 animated film adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a> (based on the manga&nbsp;by <a title="Ghost in the Shell Live Action" href="https://randomwire.com/ghost-in-the-shell-live-action">Masamune Shirow</a>), he turned to the cityscape of Hong Kong for his&nbsp;inspiration. Actual spots in the city were recreated for use in this cinematic representation of a near-future city (set in 2029) characterised by decadence, anarchy, and fantastical high-tech hyper-reality. One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_sc%C3%A8ne">mise-en-scène</a> in particular captures the essence of the city in beautiful, almost dreamlike, detail which intrigued me long before I had the chance to explore the real Hong Kong for myself:</p>
<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost in the shell the film" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYVbQ-GQTxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>
<p>When asked why Hong Kong was&nbsp;chosen&nbsp;as the backdrop for the film&nbsp;Mamoru Oshii and his art designer, Takeuchi Atsushi, had the <a href="http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/80/wong80art.htm">following explanation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>[Oshii]</strong> When I was in search of an image of the future, the first thing that came to my mind was an Asian city. At first I did not think it was possible to create a perfect cityscape for the future; and what was done in the past seems unconvincing to me now…. The only way, if one is to be true to the methodology of animation, is to use real streets as models, so I thought of Hong Kong. It is like the Los Angeles of <em><a title="10pm in Shenzhen" href="https://randomwire.com/10pm-in-shenzhen">Blade Runner</a></em>; what has been achieved in that city set will be of use to later films.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>[Atsushi]</strong> <em>Ghost in the Shell </em>does not have a definite chosen set, but in terms of street scenes and general atmosphere, it is obvious that Hong Kong is the model. Such a choice has, of course, something to do with the theme: on the streets there flows an excess or a flood of information, along with everything this excess brings out. The modern city is swamped with billboards, neon lights and symbols…. As people live in this information deluge, the streets will have to be depicted accordingly as being flooded…. There is a sharp contrast between old streets and new ones on which skyscrapers are built. My feeling is that these two, originally very different, are now in a situation where one is invading the other. Maybe it is the tension or pressure that is brought about by so-called modernization! It’s a situation in which two entities are kept in a strange neighboring relationship. Perhaps it is what the future is.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>[Atsushi]</strong> In the midst of the profusion of signs and the heat of the messy urban space, the streets are remarkably chaotic. Passers-by, shouts, cars, all kinds of mechanical noises and human “sound pollution,” all merging into one, forcing itself into humans’ central nervous systems through their ears. But why do people succumb to this “destructive” environment? Now that the artificial has replaced the natural, humans are like animals in the past, deprived of the characteristics of being human as a whole. Pulled directly into the whirlpool of information through the stimulation of visual and auditory senses, their feelings are henceforth numbed. On the other hand, countless mutually interfering and uncertain data pass through cables at light speed. This is the way informatics continues to expand its domain.</p></blockquote>

<p>While the real Hong Kong may not be literally submerged&nbsp;in water (despite being surrounded by it), in nearly every other respect both the imagery and soulful mood depicted in the film mirror reality very closely – especially when contrasting the modern skyscrapers of <a title="Hong Kong Moments IV" href="https://randomwire.com/hong-kong-moments-iv">Central</a> with some of the older neighbourhoods in <a title="Sheung Wan" href="https://randomwire.com/sheung-wan">Sheung Wan</a> and <a title="One Night in Hong Kong" href="https://randomwire.com/one-night-in-hong-kong">Kowloon</a>. There is simply no other city like it.</p>

<p>After getting my <a title="Panasonic Lumix GF 2 Video Test" href="https://randomwire.com/panasonic-lumix-gf-2-video-test">new Lumix GF2</a>&nbsp;earlier in the year I went out on a number of evenings (spanning March – June 2011) to shoot various scenes of everyday life in Hong Kong (mostly around <a title="Tiny HK Hotels" href="https://randomwire.com/tiny-hk-hotels">Mong Kok</a>) and have tried to assemble them in as a simple homage to Ghost in the Shell. Bear in mind that I’m not a professional&nbsp;videographer but I hope it evokes a similar atmosphere…</p>

<p>In many ways, I feel that the <a title="Future Living Inspired by Past Extremes" href="https://randomwire.com/future-living-inspired-by-past-extremes">intensity</a> of living in Hong Kong has a numbing effect on its residents who try to insulate themselves from both the physical and mental demands of a city where money rules and personal space comes at a high premium. It’s no wonder that young people here struggle to get a foothold on <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/hong-kong/2011/08/03/how-to-be-happy-in-hong-kong/?mod=wsj_share_twitter">happiness</a> despite economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Hong Kong is the ultimate abstraction whereby our lives are no longer dependant on mother nature but on artificial life-support systems which feed off mass-produced assemblies of raw materials processed out-of-sight and out-of-mind.&nbsp;As a vision or model of a future city, it’s both&nbsp;enthralling&nbsp;and frightening.</p>

<p dir="auto">Memory-GPT (or MemGPT in short) is a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in LLMs in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window. For example, MemGPT knows when to push critical information to a vector database and when to retrieve it later in the chat, enabling perpetual conversations. Learn more about MemGPT in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560" rel="nofollow">paper</a>.</p>
