Today I'd like&nbsp;</span></span><span>to take the opportunity to talk about some of the larger lessons&nbsp;</span><span>learned since that day. Even the most successful projects have&nbsp;</span><span>things that, upon reflection, could have been done better. And of&nbsp;</span><span>course, things that in hindsight seem to have been key to their&nbsp;</span><span>success.</span></p><p><span><span>Up front I must make clear that I am speaking only for myself, not&nbsp;</span></span><span>for the Go team and not for Google.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>Go was and still is a huge effort by a dedicated team and a huge community, so if you agree with anything I say, thank them. If you disagree, blame me but please keep it to yourself 😃.</span></p><p><span><span>Given the title of this talk, many people might expect I'm going&nbsp;</span></span><span>to be analyzing good and bad things in the language. Of course I'll do some of that, but much more besides, for several reasons.</span></p><p><span><span>First, what's good and bad in a programming language is largely a&nbsp;</span></span><span>matter of opinion rather than fact, despite the certainty with which many people argue about even the most trivial features of Go or any other language.</span></p><p><span><span>Also, there has already been plenty of discussion about things such as where the newlines go, how nil works, using upper case for export, garbage collection, error handling, and so on.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are certainly things to say there, but little that hasn't already been said.</span></span></p><p><span><span>But the real reason I'm going to talk about more than the language is that that's not what the whole project was about. Our original goal was not to create a new programming language, it was to create a better way to write software. We had issues with the languages we were using</span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span>everyone does, whatever the language</span><span>—</span><span>but the fundamental problems we had were not central to the features of those languages, but rather to the process that had been created for using them to build software at Google.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="225" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/l1ERR57yyeKPWdSlzvKhKpmL2ZXk4cZwIplGY7fG3jyOwUFn8esWo79SE6Vh0IiFWiD-AfKyXYk2iC90ryJCqHtpQCZbsDwJUDftuf_jX_p_XtfPP04j-nkZ9LL2u-bQIx2Zykc_uFcmT9j0KifQyo6x9A=w400-h225" width="400"></td></tr><tr><td><span>The first gopher on a t-shirt</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>The creation of a new language provided a new path to explore other ideas, but it was only an enabler, not the real point. If it didn't take 45 minutes to build the binary I was working on at the time, Go would not have happened, but those 45 minutes were not because the compiler was slow, because it wasn't, or because the language it was written in was bad, because it wasn't. The slowness arose from other factors.</span></span></p><p><span><span>And those factors were what we wanted to address: The complexities of building modern server software: controlling dependencies, programming with large teams with changing personnel, ease of maintainability, efficient testing, effective use of multicore CPUs and networking, and so on.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In short, Go is not just a programming language. Of course it is a&nbsp;</span></span><span>programming language, that's its definition, but its purpose was to help provide a better way to develop high-quality software, at least compared to our environment 14 plus years ago.</span></p><p><span><span>And that's still what it's about today. Go is a project to make&nbsp;</span></span><span>building production software easier and more productive.</span></p><p><span><span>A few weeks back, when starting to prepare this talk, I had a title&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>but little else.<span>&nbsp; </span>To get me going, I asked people on Mastodon for&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>input. A fair few responded, and I noticed a trend in the replies:&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>people thought the things we got wrong were all in the language,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>but those we got right were in the larger story, the stuff around&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>the language like gofmt and deployment and testing. I find that&nbsp;</span></span><span>encouraging, actually. What we were trying to do seems to have had an effect.</span></p><p><span><span>But it's worth admitting that we didn't make clear early on what&nbsp;</span></span><span>the true goals were. Perhaps we felt they were self-evident.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>To&nbsp;</span><span>address that shortcoming, in 2013 I gave a talk at the SPLASH&nbsp;</span><span>conference entitled,&nbsp;</span><i>Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering.</i></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="425" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HCe4_dZBgS8SSYkp1xwH0U61SceRS-r1VHnHRxvmkIQUMbv98NEfVr9xWQKkQYiZFdvajhvIRBzoqRWPR9J_xSfktKplJoC7QM_b6VL1eSc3J6PNiSiBCH0YN1y2NF3m45HXdQomQBC5ddqppBgzXxQVcw=w640-h425" width="640"></td></tr><tr><td>Go at Google</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>That talk and associated blog post are perhaps the best explanation of why Go happened.</span></p><p><span><span>Today's talk is something of a follow-on to the SPLASH talk,&nbsp;</span></span><span>looking back on the lessons learned once we got past building&nbsp;</span><span>the language and could apply ourselves to the bigger picture more broadly.</span></p><p><span><span>And so... some lessons.</span></span></p><p><span><span>First, of course, we have:</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The Gopher</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>It may seem an odd place to start, but the Go gopher is one of the&nbsp;</span></span><span>earliest factors in Go's success.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>We knew long before the launch&nbsp;</span><span>that we wanted a mascot to adorn the schwag - every project needs schwag - and Renee French offered to create one for us.

This bothered me. I'd been doing concurrency-like things, sometimes without even realizing it, since the 1970s and it seemed powerful to me. But upon reflection it became clear that Ousterhout was making two mistakes. First, he was generalizing beyond the domain he was interested in using threads for, and second, he was mostly complaining about using them through with clumsy low-level packages like pthread, and not about the fundamental idea.</span></p><p><span><span>It's a mistake common to engineers everywhere to confuse the solution and the problem like this. Sometimes the proposed solution is harder than the problem it addresses, and it can be hard to see there is an easier path. But I digress.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I knew from experience that there were nicer ways to use threads,&nbsp;</span></span><span>or whatever we choose to call them, and even gave a pre-Go talk&nbsp;</span><span>about them.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hB05UFqOtFA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img height="302" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GeRc6AtfheAKNQ8m31O0Y2s2TFLkZ39d8hadIjfzbenL_BwBktjznQiGpjkJpZppRRZorbGmITB1wI_dYxMZB1Ha4cyMR_gXgLjY5ZBfYbFlV01N3aLSHm2rYUWt0P6OQRz7xCl5HsLXyZcvw5jVwkPHvQ=w400-h302" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Concurrency in Newsqueak</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>But I wasn't alone in knowing this; a number of other languages,&nbsp;</span><span>papers, and even books had been written about concurrent programming that showed it could be done well.

And to this day I wish the Unix spell command would learn it.</span></span></p><p><span><span>As an aside, because I am often asked about it, let me speak for a&nbsp;</span></span><span>minute about async/await.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>It saddens me a bit that the async/await model with its associated style is the way many languages have chosen to support concurrency, but it is definitely a huge improvement over pthreads.</span></p><p><span><span>Compared to goroutines, channels, and select, async/await is easier and smaller for language implementers to build or to retrofit into existing platforms.

I've even seen it done several times as a library. But its implementation, done well, requires a significant runtime complexity, and I can understand why some folks would prefer not to build that into their system. It's important, though, whatever concurrency model you provide, to do it exactly once, because an environment providing multiple concurrency implementations can be problematic.

This is&nbsp;</span><span>not the style of object-oriented programming most people were&nbsp;</span><span>familiar with, but it's a very powerful idea.</span></p><p><span><span>That idea was exciting for us, and the possibility that this could become a foundational</span></span></p><p><span><span>programming construct was intoxicating.<span>&nbsp; </span>When Russ joined, he soon pointed out how I/O would fit beautifully into this idea, and the library took place rapidly, based in large part on the three famous interfaces: empty, Writer, and Reader, holding an average of two thirds of a method each.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those tiny methods are idiomatic to Go, and ubiquitous.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The way interfaces work became not only a distinguishing feature&nbsp;</span></span><span>of Go, they became the way we thought about libraries, and generality, and composition. It was heady stuff.</span></p><p><span><span>But we might have erred in stopping the conversation there.</span></span></p><p><span><span>You see, we went down this path at least in part because we had&nbsp;</span></span><span>seen too often how generic programming encouraged a way of thinking that tended to focus on types before algorithms. Early abstraction instead of organic design. Containers instead of functions.</span></p><p><span><span>We defined generic containers in the language proper - maps, slices, arrays, channels - without giving programmers access to the genericity they contained. This was arguably a mistake. We believed, correctly I still think, that most simple programming tasks could be handled just fine by those types. But there are some that cannot, and the barrier between what the language provided and what the user could control definitely bothered some people.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In short, although I wouldn't change a thing about how interfaces&nbsp;</span></span><span>worked, they colored our thinking in ways it took more than a decade to correct. Ian Taylor pushed us, from early on, to face this problem, but it was quite hard to do given the presence of interfaces as the bedrock of Go programming.</span></p><p><span><span>Critics often complained we should just do generics, because they&nbsp;</span></span><span>are "easy", and perhaps they can be in some languages, but the existence of interfaces meant that any new form of polymorphism had to take them into account. Finding a way forward that worked well with the rest of the language required multiple attempts, several aborted implementations, and many hours, days, and weeks of discussion. Eventually we roped in some type theorists to help out, led by Phil Wadler.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>And even today, with a solid generic model in the language, there are still lingering problems to do with the presence of interfaces as method sets.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5SS3786IKXJjs82x4-erKQdrijskx1rOwXBBVsefXsDLwZE5DDUJPRl9sMHzXc85WW8DY8qxQekd3JzuEKgUXqTvCBdpAcuVA8jn-vl_l8rfXoMCJ8_lP0dVmmlgy5lRVXf0yXVe8MPJ4XW6GlAmhsBJj0gpeJ4CpZZEmPR79RUdF9aLRjRWzPQ/s3016/Untitled.jpg"><img data-original-height="552" data-original-width="3016" height="118" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5SS3786IKXJjs82x4-erKQdrijskx1rOwXBBVsefXsDLwZE5DDUJPRl9sMHzXc85WW8DY8qxQekd3JzuEKgUXqTvCBdpAcuVA8jn-vl_l8rfXoMCJ8_lP0dVmmlgy5lRVXf0yXVe8MPJ4XW6GlAmhsBJj0gpeJ4CpZZEmPR79RUdF9aLRjRWzPQ/w640-h118/Untitled.jpg" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Generic sort specification</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>The final answer, as you know, was to design a generalization of&nbsp;</span><span>interfaces that could absorb more forms of polymorphism, transitioning from "sets of methods" to "sets of types".

But you press on.</span></span></p><p><span><span>By the way, I wish we had a better term than "generics", which originated as the term for a different, data-structure-centric style of polymorphism.

But "generics" is what we say, even though it's not quite right.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The Compiler</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>One of the things that bothered the programming language community was that the early Go compiler was written in C. The proper way, in their opinion, was to use LLVM or a similar toolkit, or to write the compiler in Go itself, a process called self-hosting.<span>&nbsp; </span>We didn't do either of these, for several reasons.</span></span></p><p><span><span>First, bootstrapping a new language requires that at least the first&nbsp;</span></span><span>steps towards its compiler must be done in an existing language. For us, C was the obvious choice, as Ken had written a C compiler&nbsp;</span><span>already, and its internals could serve well as the basis of a Go&nbsp;</span><span>compiler. Also, writing a compiler in its own language, while&nbsp;</span><span>simultaneously developing the language, tends to result in a language that is good for writing compilers, but that was not the kind of language we were after.</span></p><p><span><span>The early compiler worked. It bootstrapped the language well. But&nbsp;</span></span><span>it was a bit of an odd duck, in effect a Plan 9-style compiler using&nbsp;</span><span>old ideas in compiler writing, rather than new ones such as static&nbsp;</span><span>single assignment.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>The generated code was mediocre, and the internals were not pretty.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>But it was pragmatic and efficient, and the compiler code itself was modest in size and familiar to us, which made it easy to make changes quickly as we tried new ideas. One critical step was the addition of segmented stacks that grew automatically. This was very easy to add to our compiler, but had we been using a toolkit like LLVM, the task of integrating that change into the full compiler suite would have been infeasible, given the required changes to the ABI and garbage collector support.</span></p><p><span><span>Another area that worked well was cross-compilation, which came directly from the way the&nbsp;</span></span><span>original Plan 9 compiler suite worked.</span></p><p><span><span>Doing it our way, however unorthodox, helped us move fast. Some people were offended by this choice, but it was the right one for us at the time.</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="256" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rfL0OSI7StvNiafGcbDSiUrlI2rYep8MO4XD-IqhatdvmVE7bEzVXf-swzlY5hSUXNgPEbNhHCW6-0O7AZ4uDKeJmVffeXooYqI7kPIHGMp-xjoh7i2Y55dqozmUFlDFQRNcrVJdXzeLzX8zbejDpWG5PQ=w400-h256" width="400"></td></tr><tr><td>The Go compiler architecture post Go 1.5</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>For Go version 1.5, Russ wrote a tool to translate the compiler&nbsp;</span><span>semi-automatically from C to Go.

That was amazing.</span></span></p><p><span><span>It took us a long time to understand the implications of the switch&nbsp;</span></span><span>to an open source project, and how to manage it.</span></p><p><span><span>In particular, it's fair to say it took us too long to understand&nbsp;</span></span><span>the best way to work with the community. A theme throughout this talk is poor communication on our part - even as we thought we were communicating well - and a lot of time was wasted due to misunderstandings and mismatched expectations. It could have been better done.</span></p><p><span><span>In time, though, we convinced the community, at least the part that stayed with us, that some of our ideas, although different from the usual open source way, were valuable. The most important were around our insistence on maintaining high code quality through mandatory code review and exhaustive attention to detail.</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="297" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EM9rbPVLtezym_caYgRFi0ZfzLDCIBHMaBxS42GicnzjtGyPkl_dB74uqtSZa2qZcrudnsucXmQN47EuzIRiBW3GzgcapTJJHkqcCwpvKnp0f5fHYy4SVOOHGd7jct3mDp98GFMAKS_y6KXmL1wCLQaPuw=w400-h297" width="400"></td></tr><tr><td>Mission Control (drawing by Renee French)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>Some projects work differently, accepting code quickly and then&nbsp;</span></span><span>cleaning up once it's been committed. The Go project works the other way around, trying to get the quality first. I believe that's the more efficient way, but it pushes more work back on the community and they need to understand the value or they will not feel as welcome as they should. There is still much to learn here, but I believe things are much better these days.</span></p><p><span><span>By the way, there's a historical detail that's not widely known.&nbsp;</span></span><span>The project has had 4 different content management systems: SVN, Perforce, Mercurial and then Git. Russ did a Herculean job of keeping all the history alive, so even today the Git repo contains the earliest changes as they were made in SVN. We all believe it's&nbsp;</span><span>valuable to keep the history around, and I thank him for doing the&nbsp;</span><span>heavy lifting.</span></p><p><span><span>One other point. People often assume Google tells the Go team what to do. That's simply not true. Google is incredibly generous in its support for Go, but does not set the agenda. The community has far more input. Google has a huge internal Go code base that the team uses to test and verify releases, but this is done by importing from the public repo into Google, not the other way around. In short, the core Go team is paid by Google but they are independent.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>Package Management</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>The process of developing package management for Go was not done well. The package design in the language itself was excellent, I believe, and consumed a large amount of time in the first year or so of our discussions. The SPLASH talk I mentioned earlier explains in detail why it works the way it does if you're interested.</span></span></p><p><span><span>A key point was the use of a plain string to specify the path in&nbsp;</span></span><span>an import statement, giving a flexibility that we were correct in&nbsp;</span><span>believing would be important. But the transition from having only&nbsp;</span><span>a "standard library" to importing code from the web was bumpy.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="400" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdkxLhGP5SGYw-vgB54RiqGJtEv2-PukXcGXvqYhWVz25QM_Aa0QyQUWLFONYd8uOvrOnOx2jxUJ75Lz0e7proBAVrMDnLPV3SVhfRcAEqVYqigWhd4vSYVXyPcZnIeqNiibzhSwWxW8hABFh_jDI1MYhw=w339-h400" width="339"></td></tr><tr><td>Fixing the cloud (drawing by Renee French)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>There were two issues.</span></span></p><p><span><span>First, those of us on the core Go team early on were familiar with how Google worked, with its monorepo and everyone building at head. But we didn't have enough experience using a package manager with lots of versions of packages and the very difficult problems trying to resolve the dependency graph. To this day, few people really understand the technical complexities, but that is no excuse for our failure to grapple with those problems from the start. It's especially embarrassing because I had been the tech lead on a failed project to do something similar for Google's internal build, and I should have realized what we were up against.</span></span></p><p><span><span>My work on <a href="http://deps.dev/">deps.dev</a> was a something of a penance.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Second, the business of engaging the community to help solve the dependency management problem was well-intentioned, but when the final design came out, even with plenty of documentation and writing about the theory, many in the community felt slighted.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This failing was a lesson to the team in how engagement with the community should really work, and much has improved since as a result.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Things are settled now, though, and the design that emerged is technically excellent and appears to be working well for most users. It just took too long and the road was bumpy.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>Documentation and Examples</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>Another thing we didn't get right up front was the documentation.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>We wrote a lot of it, and thought we did a good job, but it soon&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>became clear that the community wanted a different level of&nbsp;</span></span><span>documentation than we expected.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="232" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_Yz8RnFyXvPbkx_Ze-3Uh47XMqRxzfFRKZdj1G8_01w36WxQGLZcA9oLHowHo2weeA0dSW3y4faFerQEjEadgm1giJJ1jaA7XWtw0pEDskTCtTgAIA0gCXwZunzy-DEKqemQZFyiPN0qDXBTnZD8K7VA2g=w400-h232" width="400"></td></tr><tr><td>Gophers fixing a Turing machine (drawing by Renee French)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>The key missing piece was examples of even the simplest functions. We thought that all you needed to do was say what something did; it took us too long to accept that showing how to use it was even more valuable.</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="315" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/adeTwrv9AgtHNZJypQBgKCb18ot3o24uTJko13zDpuf5rtsNDXiNeyEUK297_pj8a9DFXcUE0uEajthMvl0ThBHL44-KJ2OTBuNj6Vx7NRf-ueXklk5wy01Cr1dnwALtUFJv7EC5zNNQwuO_QOLNZeu2Eg=w640-h315" width="640"></td></tr><tr><td>Executable examples</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>That lesson was learned, though. There are plenty of examples in&nbsp;</span><span>the documentation now, mostly provided by open source contributors. And one thing we did very early was make them executable on the web. I gave a talk at Google I/O in 2012 that showed concurrency in action, and Andrew Gerrand wrote a lovely bit of web goo that made it possible to run the snippets right from the browser. I doubt that was the first time it had ever been done, but Go is a compiled language and many in the audience had never seen that trick before. The technology was then deployed to the blog and to the online package documentation.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps even more important was its deployment to the Go playground, a freely available open sandbox for people to try things out, and even develop code.</span></p><p><span><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>We have come a long way.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Looking back, it's clear many things were done right, and they all helped Go succeed. But much could have been done better,&nbsp;</span></span><span>and it's important to own up to those and learn from them. There&nbsp;</span><span>are lessons on both sides for anyone hosting a significant open&nbsp;</span><span>source project.</span></p><p><span><span>I hope that my historical tour of the lessons and their causes will&nbsp;</span></span><span>be helpful, and perhaps serve as a sort of apology/explanation for those who objected to what we were doing and how we were doing it.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="400" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BWBPo-xXaifo9zq3Cspfqa6Ot4GjXf8dTKIvlbA1WQHuYNrbB3AeYh45OQo8Tf3fljo-clYT8mUVd-mDZgL5gYN9NOnKFXVAcyE0QPTKlxH0t9kFK4UOjPdzCqZnrs5Ao4c3YUkHhQYsEWtq0fAS-PRTyw=w400-h400" width="400"></td></tr><tr><td>GopherConAU 2023 mascot by Renee French</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>But here we are, 14 years after the launch. And it's fair to say that overall it's a pretty good place.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Largely because of the decisions made through the design and&nbsp;</span></span><span>development of Go as a way to write software - not just as a&nbsp;</span><span>programming language - we have arrived somewhere novel.</span></p><p><span><span>We got here in part because of:</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span>a strong standard library that implements most of the basics needed for server code</span></span></li><li><span><span>concurrency as a first-class component of the language</span></span></li><li><span><span>an approach based on composition rather than inheritance</span></span></li><li><span><span>a packaging model that clarifies dependency management</span></span></li><li><span><span>integrated fast build and testing tools</span></span></li><li><span><span>rigorous consistent formatting</span></span></li><li><span><span>a focus on readability over cleverness</span></span></li><li><span><span>a compatibility guarantee</span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>And, most of all, because of the support of an unbelievably helpful and diverse community of Gophers.</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4juMexjG4kEsE4zT9mvxvSO_n8kbXjbb_x5WrfCje0FWe0hmFuvlEc0RYl4balyjwdEEulq-5mBaoJXAtF5F8Devq_s_q1j08g9iWcWOdVVfqQ1_8QxC2SJvaKMAnf9FUiN7CVpDMdfbXI2x9XvWFdaJutK-Ec7UnpWWQ97Drt9j1etydjTIqpg/s2922/Untitled.jpg"><img data-original-height="1570" data-original-width="2922" height="344" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4juMexjG4kEsE4zT9mvxvSO_n8kbXjbb_x5WrfCje0FWe0hmFuvlEc0RYl4balyjwdEEulq-5mBaoJXAtF5F8Devq_s_q1j08g9iWcWOdVVfqQ1_8QxC2SJvaKMAnf9FUiN7CVpDMdfbXI2x9XvWFdaJutK-Ec7UnpWWQ97Drt9j1etydjTIqpg/w640-h344/Untitled.jpg" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A diverse community (drawings by @tenntenn)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>Perhaps the most interesting consequence of these matters is that Go code looks and works the same regardless of who's writing it, is largely free of factions using different subsets of the language, and is guaranteed to continue to compile and run as time goes on. That may be a first for a major programming language.</span></span></p><p><span><span>We definitely got that right.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p><br><br>

<p>This began as a quick-and-dirty experiment<sup id="fnref:quick-and-dirty"><a href="#fn:quick-and-dirty">[1]</a></sup> to visualize the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Minimum Wage</a> in real-time, inspired by Blake Fall-Conroy’s <a href="https://www.blakefallconroy.com/minimum-wage-machine.html">Minimum Wage Machine</a>.</p>
<p>Then I added the US <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage">Federal Minimum Wage</a>, since a sizeable proportion of this blog’s readership are US-based. Did you know the US also has a <a href="https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/docs/ymwplink.asp">Youth Minimum Wage</a>? I didn’t.</p>
<p>Then I got curious, and added some CEO salaries for comparison. The vast disparity is nothing new to me, but seeing it like this...</p>
<p>It’s fucking sobering.</p>
<hr>



<hr>
<p>The UK and US minimum wage numbers are, to the best of my knowledge, accurate at the time of publishing. Additionally, the code has been written to account for the changes to the UK minimum wage taking effect on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2024. If you’re reading this in the far future, the numbers presented here may no longer reflect reality.<sup id="fnref:us-refusal-to-change"><a href="#fn:us-refusal-to-change">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>CEO <em>annual</em> salaries were taken from the <a href="https://aflcio.org/paywatch/highest-paid-ceos">American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> (AFL-CIO). <em>Hourly</em> salary estimates were then derived by assuming 260 weekdays in a year, and 8 hours worked per day.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Researchers looked at three formally verified systems, and found critical correctness bugs in all three. The bugs were from "a wide range of mismatched assumptions" and caused servers to crash or produce wrong data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Most bugs were at the system boundaries; none were found in the implemented protocols. Formally verified systems, while not perfect, were considerably less buggy than unverified systems.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> camelCase is easier to read than under_score. So it is a best practice to
use camelCase in variable names, function names, and other identifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Several research papers have been done. But when eye-tracking software was
used to test the claim, two conclusions emerged: (1) developers are equally accurate
regardless of style, but (2) the under_score style can be processed faster and easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> The study's sample size was small (15 people), and "Subjects were
historically trained mostly in the underscore identifier style and were all programmers."
In the study, subjects were presented terms in isolation (not in blocks of code). Thus,
as the study notes, there could be variance due to context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong> "The interaction of Experience with Style indicates that novices benefit
twice as much with respect to time, with the underscore style.
"This paper purports to remedy difficulties in an earlier paper entitled

which concluded that with training, camelCase is more accurately processed. Finally, neither
paper seems to have analyzed whether native language comes into play (e.g. whether it is
easier for non-native English speakers to understand camelCase versus under_score).</p>

<p><img alt="AMD" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/amd.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
AMD engineers are proposing an FPGA Subsystem User-Space Interface to overcome current limitations of the Linux kernel's FPGA manager subsystem.
</p><p>
AMD-Xilinx engineers are proposing a new sysfs interface for the FPGA subsystem that allows for more user-space control over FPGAs. The suggested interface would handle FPGA configuration, driver probe/remove, bridges, Device Tree Overlay file support for re-programming an FPGA while the operating system is running, and other capabilities for user-space not currently presented by the mainline kernel.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=amd_xilinx_ip" alt="AMD Xilinx SoCs"></p>
<p>A "request for comments" issued on the Linux kernel mailing list explained:
</p><blockquote>The existing FPGA manager subsystem didn't have any user space interface (other than the status/state in sysfs) in Kernel. 
<br>Basically, FPGAs are semiconductor devices that can be reprogrammed for desired hardware functionality. FPGAs can be reprogrammed at runtime with different types of logic and IPs as per user need and hence there is a need to use device tree overlays for removing/updating/adding the devices at runtime for the IPs/controllers that are present in FPGA. But we don't have any user interface in kernel for updating the device tree at runtime.
<p>
Sometime back there was a series sent by Pantelis Antoniou. This patch introduced a user interface configfs for Device Tree overlays, a method of dynamically altering the kernel's live Device Tree. However,  this patch series was not accepted in mainline due to various concerns.
</p><p>
One of the major valid concerns that were raised with this configfs interface was security as it opens up the interface to users for modifying the live device tree.
</p><p>
So, in order to configure/program the FPGA devices, All the major vendors of FPGA are using this configfs series as out-of-tree patch for configuring the FPGAs and there was never an attempt to introduce a generic interface to configure/program the FPGA in upstream and hence upstream kernel ended up in not having proper support for FPGAs.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/DM6PR12MB3993D5ECA50B27682AEBE19FCD67A@DM6PR12MB3993.namprd12.prod.outlook.com/">This proposal</a> from AMD hopes to standardize the FPGA subsystem user-space interface in a manner that is suitable for upstreaming into the mainline Linux kernel. We'll see where this work leads for improving FPGA support on Linux.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ever since I visited my first web site (via a slow modem to a library BBS running a text-based web browser), I have been ceaselessly pondering the nature of the web. I knew from my first experience visiting a site as a young child, that the web (and the internet in general) was going to profoundly re-architect our culture. A re-architecting that would be so radical, so complicated, and so fast paced, that we would likely evolve alongside those changes in a way that none of us would really predict or understand. And I knew that we would make some big mistakes along the way.. because we had no idea what the hell we were doing.</p>

<p>One of those big mistakes we made was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">Dot-Com Bubble</a>, where novel ideas for web startups were turned into trumped-up card bets. There were some great ideas and companies that came out of that period. But there were also companies that got too greedy, overvalued their companies to raise easy bubble money, and expanded beyond their ability to sustain themselves (a playbook that, hauntingly to me, seems quite at home with the current startup climate). Massive web corporations flush with stock market cash acquired startups for billions of dollars, like rich brats that wanted a cool new toy, but then quickly got tired of it and threw it away. And in the end, we lost a lot of great ideas, companies, <strong>and user content</strong> that would have otherwise prospered.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/yahoo-writes-geocities-obituary-109042500035_1.html">This is essentially what happened to GeoCities.</a></strong></p>

<p>A lot of people have mistakenly told me that GeoCities was shut down because it was a bad idea, or because it was “too old”, or because people didn’t want to make and visit web sites anymore. The problem is that it ignores the internal problems that would be the real cause of its demise. Yahoo! acquired GeoCities in 1999 for $3.57 billion in bubble stock, and at the time (and perhaps still today) had <a href="http://waxy.org/2013/04/the_death_of_upcomingorg">a toxic approach to acquisitions</a> that would effectively ruin the startups they acquired. Everyone is holding their breath on the Tumblr acquisition to see if they learned their lessons from the previous failures. Hopefully they did.</p>

<p>When Yahoo shut down GeoCities, they did much more than delete a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_baby">obnoxious dancing baby GIFs</a> and <a href="http://www.midiworld.com/files/1067">Limp Bizkit MIDI files</a>. <strong>They deleted the ability for people (both old and new to the web) to easily create web sites, and be in complete control of the content and presentation they provide to their audience.</strong></p>

<p>Sure, some of the old sites weren’t “great”. But they were fun, and quirky, and interesting. We used to call it “surfing” the web, and that was actually a good way to describe it. There was a certain adventure to the activity - a fun and excitement in exploring the unknown.</p>

<p>Go to a Facebook profile, and ponder what we have now. Instead of having adventures into the great unknowns of the web, we instead now spend most of our time on social networks: boring, suburban gated communities, where everybody’s “profile” looks exactly the same, and presents exactly the same content, in the same arrangement. Rarely do we create things on these networks; Instead, we consume, and report on our consumption. The uniformity and blandness rival something out of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel%C3%A1k">Soviet bloc residential apartments corridor</a>. And now adding to that analogy, we’ve found out that our government is actually spying on us while we’re doing it, <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/26/195045/memories-of-stasi-color-germans.html">in ways the Stasi could only dream of</a>. <strong>The web we have today is a sad, pathetic, consumption-oriented digital iron curtain, and we need to change that.</strong></p>

<p>This is why my goal with <a href="http://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a> is not to turn it into a GeoCities parody site, though I don’t really care if people use it that way. The purpose of this project is not to inspire nostalgia. <strong>It’s to rebuild the platform for us to be able to be creative again.</strong> To have sites that we can do whatever we want with. This is not nostalgia speaking. We really did lose our platforms for creativity and rich self expression online, and I want to help bring them back.</p>

<p>None of the technology we have developed has obsoleted what made the old web magical. It did not take away the joy of creation. It’s still fun to make web pages, you can still share it with every internet user in the world 24/7. <strong>And when you don’t have to attach your real identity to everything you do, it still doesn’t matter how old you are, what you look like, or what your social class is</strong>. If you have a library card and a few hours, you can make a web site on NeoCities.</p>

<p>In fact, the technology has made it better. We now have incredible tools for making web pages that don’t look like crap, and don’t randomly break on different web browsers. Now we have HTML5, which enables very powerful web sites. Like <a href="http://mlpfim.neocities.org/">this amazing site</a>, an interactive episode guide to the show My Little Pony, which looks fantastic and uses your browser database for storage (I <em>dare</em> you to make it half as good with your over-engineered, poorly scalable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP stack</a>). And we have great CSS frameworks like <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> and a new, even simpler one that <a href="https://twitter.com/scottohara">Scott O’Hara</a> is working on called <a href="http://groundfloor.neocities.org/">Ground Floor</a>, that makes web sites look pretty good <strong>even if the designer doesn’t use or understand CSS at all</strong>.</p>

<p>After just one week of NeoCities, there are already over 1,600 sites, and even with that short time frame, <a href="http://dragonquest.neocities.org/">a</a> <a href="http://ninjabit.neocities.org/">lot</a> <a href="http://scientology.neocities.org/">of</a> <a href="http://eksith.neocities.org/">them</a> <a href="http://dyingtime.neocities.org/">are</a> <a href="http://mlpfim.neocities.org/">really</a> <a href="http://simonsroom.neocities.org/">good</a>. And there are <a href="http://neocities.org/browse">more sites being generated every day</a>. And there are people using the site to <a href="http://eleanor.neocities.org/">learn HTML</a> (something <a href="https://twitter.com/violasong">Victoria Wang</a> is working to improve, while also working on <a href="https://github.com/kyledrake/neocities-web/commit/4eaa8f7ace84f9062302666fd7997a2154b77a7e">building a really great design</a> for the site with Scott). If that much creativity can happen with one week (and with the site editing code in early stages), how much more creativity will come out of the next year?</p>

<p>Nothing scales like static HTML. It’s easy and affordable for NeoCities to host millions of web sites without having to worry about making a profit. Even the current 10 Megabyte limit on accounts is just a conservative start. <strong>We will be raising the limit to 20 Megabytes soon</strong>, and probably will be raising it much higher later as we learn what our scaling needs are. Part of the reason we will be able to do this is that I’m building some better servers that can handle <strong>2+ million NeoCities accounts</strong>. I’m paying for the servers out of pocket, which is tough for me because I currently don’t have a large income, but NeoCities needs and deserves it. <strong>The web needs and deserves it.</strong> If we are to break free from the consumption-oriented web we have today, we need more creative spaces like this.</p>

<p>My goal is to pay for the site through <a href="http://neocities.org/about">donations from contributors</a> and through supporter accounts. I will not be taking any money with dangerous strings attached to it, and I will not be turning it into a VC-backed startup. We need to maintain this as a sustainable resource, the same way that sites like the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> are. The <a href="https://github.com/kyledrake/neocities-web">source code to NeoCities</a> is available, for anyone that wants to help. If you like this idea, <a href="http://neocities.org/about">any and all help is welcome</a>!</p>

<p>With your help (and your creativity), I know NeoCities can be an amazing site. Thank you for making the web fun again, and for rekindling my love for it.</p>

<p>What are you waiting for? <strong><a href="http://neocities.org/new">Go make your web site!</a></strong></p>

<p>– <a href="https://kyledrake.net/">Kyle</a></p>

Are we really alive if we’re not here?</p><p>When you open <em>Sit.</em>, I don’t try to fill your brain with anything. It’s just you and your thoughts. That can get uncomfortable. But when you finish, for some strange reason you feel better.</p><blockquote><p>Alternative title for reason #1: the time I want back.</p></blockquote><p>The two other reasons I built <em>Sit.</em> are more trivial and less likely to generate a rant.</p><h2>Reason #2: Motivation</h2><p>I’ve decided to drop full time work and move back to personal projects, which means I’m still figuring out a structure for my day, which means it’s easy to get stuck in a rut.</p><p>You see, I suffer from a condition known as <em>irony deficiency</em>: even though I preach simplicity when mentoring or running workshops, I struggle with the very same thing in my own practice. Speak with your GP if these symptoms seem familiar.</p><p>After a few days of running around in circles, I decided to take a detour and build something else to boost my morale a bit, <em>ideally something so small I couldn’t afford not to finish and share it</em> (hold that thought, we’ll get back to it in the second post).</p><p>The most prolific and creative people I know get their boost of motivation from projects with a short feedback loop. This way they can have contact with the user, and watch as their work is enjoyed by others or at the very least interacted with. Building things for others is a form of communication, and it fulfils a very basic human need.</p><p>Iterative methodologies like Agile are not only useful because they allow us to split problems into smaller, more testable chunks, bringing us closer to the essence of a problem. There’s also a mental health and motivation aspect to it which honestly deserves its own article.</p><blockquote><p>Alternative title for reason #2:<br>I’m stuck, pass the shovel, not this one, the small one.</p></blockquote><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-600.avif 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-600.webp 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-600.jpeg 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><img alt="A simple border made of a bunch of tiny shovels in a row, forming a horizontal line.

I’m not a therapist or a qualified medical professional, so I try to help using the skills I have. The areas where I can contribute somewhat usefully took the form of my work on privacy, using music and psychedelics for therapeutic purposes at <a href="https://wavepaths.com/">Wavepaths</a>, and writing tools supporting mental health in my spare time. The beauty of building those (digital) tools for myself is that it costs 0$ to share them with others.</p><blockquote><p>Rant: It just feels perplexing how preoccupied we are with sending people to a dead rock 138600000 km away by treating some random tech bro like your favourite football team, where at the same time we have 1000s of Curies, Teslas, Newtons worth of human potential, brain power which could be unlocked with sometimes relatively little work. Those people are not 1 au away. Yet, we fetishise those who make us miserable instead.</p></blockquote><p>There’s so much low hanging fruit here.</p><h3>Reason #3.1: I have <em>very specific</em> clock needs.</h3><p>I don’t want to be wise. I want to be clockwise.</p><p><em>But seriously</em> now. Another big reason why <em>Sit.</em> is built this way is habit reinforcement. Preventing issues is easier than crisis management once the black dog pays a visit.</p><p>I try to meditate every day in the morning. For me it’s a form of mental hygiene and a “spiritual” practice only in terms of connecting with something bigger than us (nature, not religion). One of the types of meditation I practise, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samatha-vipassana">shi-nè</a>, is quite challenging because it involves learning how to detach yourself from the voice in your head <em>without</em> focusing on anything else in particular like breath or music.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-600.avif 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-600.webp 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-600.jpeg 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><img alt="A red ballon with a face peeking out of a hole in the ground, looking up longingly towards a bunch of tiny people, dressed as if they were going to work, holding suitcases.

Our brain constantly looks for things to focus on, it abhors a vacuum. So the positive effects of this exercise take time to manifest. And maintaining a habit that initially feels <em>unpleasant</em> is hard.</p><p>Remember earlier when I said that although sitting down and doing nothing can be unpleasant at first, when you finish for some strange reason you feel better? It turns out, you benefit from habits more if you take some time to reflect on them after you’re done. It also makes them easier to stick, by teaching us to associate reward with an initially annoying activity.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-600.avif 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-600.webp 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://sonnet.io/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-600.jpeg 600w, https://sonnet.io/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><img alt="A red ballon with a face peeking out of a hole in the ground, looking up longingly towards a little black hole in the ceiling.

<p>Pretty much everyone knows what it feels like to hunt for a job: You revamp your resume, send out a zillion applications — and you wait.</p>



<p>“If you’re unemployed in a down market it is stressful and every day feels like a month, every month feels like a year,” said Dan Kaplan, a senior partner at Korn Ferry, an HR consulting firm. </p>



<p>Job seekers rarely know what’s happening on the other side of the application. And in some cases, what’s happening is absolutely nothing. The position doesn’t even exist. It’s called a ghost job. And about half of companies list jobs they don’t necessarily intend to fill because they’re “always open to new people,” <a href="https://clarifycapital.com/job-seekers-beware-of-ghost-jobs-survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a survey from Clarify Capital</a>. Kaplan said this tactic isn’t new.</p>



<p>“In all practical sense, it’s existed for many years and it means a number of different things,” he said. </p>



<p>Ghost jobs can be an innocent oversight: A recruiter puts up open positions and gets laid off or forgets to take them down once they’re filled. But sometimes employers post ghost jobs on purpose so that to investors it looks like the company is growing, and to overworked and frustrated employees it looks like help is on the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the most common type of ghost job is talent hoarding.</p>



<p>“You keep postings out there. You collect a large pool of resumes. You may, in fact, make contact with candidates and interview them, just so you have a large pool of talent,” said Kaplan. “But you don’t plan on actually filling the job anytime soon or hiring.”</p>



<p>Kaplan said this happens in a lot of industries, especially tech. And it might be more common now because businesses are anxious. They laid off workers at the beginning of the pandemic, then had a hard time hiring them back when they needed them. They laid people off again when wages and interest rates rose. Now, they’re waiting for the economy to give them the green light to grow again.</p>



<p>“It gives you a pool that you can very quickly ramp back up,” said Kaplan.</p>



<p>Ghost jobs might just be a temporary symptom of an uncertain economy. But Erica Groshen, an economist at Cornell University and former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the way companies hire and candidates job hunt is changing.</p>



<p>“We’re moving to a new equilibrium where everybody just applies to more jobs than they used to,” she said.</p>



<p>With online job boards, it’s easier than ever to throw your hat in the ring. Meanwhile, companies are taking longer to screen applicants.</p>



<p>“Now it’s worth it for the employers to hold the jobs open longer, look through more resumes, because they have a hope that they’re actually going to find a worker who’s better suited,” she said.</p>



<p>In 2023, the average number of days it took companies to hire <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-research-shows-that-hiring-is-harder-than-ever-time-to-hire-increasing-significantly-for-almost-all-roles-301839785.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit an all-time high</a> of 44 days, with many jobs open for three months or more. </p>



<p>“I wish I could say ‘here are the top three red flags to look for as a job seeker in these ads to see if they’re real or not real,'” said Vicki Salemi, a career expert at the jobs site Monster. “There aren’t any telltale signs.”</p>



<p>Once upon a time, a posting that’s been open for a while might be a red flag. Now, Salemi encourages job seekers to apply anyway. If you do get an interview, ask about the company’s hiring timeline.</p>



<p>“And do your due diligence throughout the interview process,” said Salemi. “If you discover that what they say they’re now backtracking, that is a sign of their values and their culture and you have to ask yourself, “Is this an organization I’d want to be part of?'”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is, if you don’t get ghosted first.</p>

<div data-testid="description-content">
<p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:286" dir="auto">This MR moves the most of the remaining backend lowering into NIR. Specifically, ftrunc, fcsel (when suitable) and flrp. The backend lowering paths are removed. This is a prerequisite for more backend cleanups, for example I have a MR ready to get rid of backend DCE for vertex shaders.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:1047" dir="auto">To be honest I tried to get this right like five times already, initially even before nir_to_rc and I always failed to make it work reasonably. The reason why this is more tricky than the usual lowering is the required pass order. In fact all the opcodes that we are lowering comes either from integer lowering (ftrunc) or bool lowering. We can't do bool lowering in the main loop in finalize nir (most notably because peephole select expects bools for ifs) and while early integer lowering is OK in tests and seems to work, Emma voiced some opposition to it previously. Therefore all of this now happens when translating to the backend IR. For the same reason there are some custom algebraic passes doing the same lowering that we would normally used the common nir_opt_algebraic. In an ideal world we would do the lowering before late algebraic, so if we lower the fcsels all all the way to add+muls we can optimally generate ffmas, but I couln'd get this right so we just emit ffmas directly when lowering the flrps that come from the fcsels...</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:530" dir="auto">Doing the fcsel lowering in NIR on R500 (we have a native CMP but the vertex engine has the limitation that it can't read from three different TMP registers) is also unfortunately much more complex than doing it in the backend, one needs to look through the fneg and fabs and also check whether constant and inputs will be copy propagated or not. In the end this is a lot of code, so in total this series is mostly even (NIR fcsel lwoering vs the TRUNC, LRP and CMP backend removal), but opens a way for more cleanups in a future.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:276" dir="auto">Shader-db-wise this is a bit of a win for R500 (by doing the fcsel lowering in nir, we still have info if this is fcsel_lt/ge or fcsel and we can save the comparison for the later case if we have to lower it), and mostly even on R300 see individual commits for detailed stats.</p>

We're building a platform to help users go from description to code to game. We aim to make game creation accessible to non-technical creators, so our UI provides explanations alongside the generated code.</p><p>Users have created a diverse range of games on Rosebud, including top-down RPGs, AI companions, and 3D obstacle courses, all within a few hours and sometimes minutes. Here are some examples you can play and clone (to start your own project).</p><p>* Anime Jester Companion: <a href="https://play.rosebud.ai/games/ba438cc4-246e-432e-b170-4e16948cd571">https://play.rosebud.ai/games/ba438cc4-246e-432e-b170-4e1694...</a>

ChatGPT, because we give users a chat interface for this code editor so they can describe the game they want to make and generate game code; Midjourney, because we let users generate assets inside Rosebud, 2D and 3D, to be used in their games; And Replit, because Rosebud includes a browser based code editor that lets you deploy your game instantly.</p><p>Sometimes, users generate a code base from scratch via prompts. Often a simpler place to start is to modify (“clone”) an existing project on Rosebud. In both cases, we need to eventually convert user descriptions and modifications of the game into edits and changes to the codebase. To solve this problem, we had to experiment heavily with using LLM agents in production. Our agent framework tries to follow the instructions of user prompts by deciding when and whether to call upon a number of generative models (some for code generation, some for asset generation, some for character dialogue, and some for game ideas). It also must decide where to insert code snippets when it generates them. Often, a user is asking for ideas or something too vague, and our agent has to decide when to ask for feedback and clarifications.</p><p>Not surprisingly, if we impose more constraints, on both the programming framework and game genres supported, our agent will perform better. However, the constraints on the types of games users can make and frameworks we want to support also constrains how flexible our platform is. Balancing these two factors, we decided to only support browser-based, JavaScript frameworks and focus on supporting AI NPCs that use LLMs themselves for dialogue and actions. This allows us to create abstractions that enable the agent to alter the codebase more successfully and guide the creator towards a more successful experience. Furthermore, we found that our beta testers are very creative with making AI character based games, and the resulting game is usually fun for players.</p><p>How does Rosebud differ from Roblox, Unreal, or Unity simply adding a co-pilot? Incumbent game engines optimized their user-flow and tech stack before the advent of generative AI, and many of their user-flows are well established. We have the advantage of designing this game creation flow from the ground up. It's not just about adding code completion to an existing code editing app and including asset plugins. Such an approach wouldn't fully harness the power of LLMs. We have a chat-first interface, and having identified the limitations of agents, we can create more safeguards for users where failure is likely. Our approach will make it possible for non technical creators to also contribute to making games.
Check it out for yourself!</p><p>To try Rosebud: (1) head over to <a href="https://www.rosebud.ai/hn">https://www.rosebud.ai/hn</a> for access to our Discord beta tester channel and a special role. (2) then go to <a href="https://play.rosebud.ai/">https://play.rosebud.ai</a> and use the code HelloHN to get immediate access. We have an array of trending projects that users can clone and mod to get started, including various character chat based games.</p><p>Here’s a video onboarding of Rosebud in action:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h99H3FefxU0&amp;ab_channel=RosebudAI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h99H3FefxU0&amp;ab_channel=Roseb...</a></p><p>Re business model, we plan on following in Roblox’s footsteps, i.e. keep it free for developers and take a cut of what they can charge users. Since AI tools cost more from usage than just hosting, we may have to evolve that model and see what the unit economics are (and separate a premium versus free tier for devs).</p><p>(Oh and in case you’re wondering why a YC S19 startup is launching now: we basically pivoted. We were always in consumer generative AI, but focused on images until this spring, but always wanted to focus on games–Rosebud is in fact a reference to the cheat code in The Sims. When code gen got good enough this year to work for UGC in gaming, we decided the time had finally come and switched.)</p><p>Some encouraging user feedback from our beta: “I have done some modding before, and I must say, this is much easier. Even when I occasionally need to code, the AI can answer all my questions and tell me how to achieve what I want. Normally, I would have to conduct numerous Google searches. What you guys have created is truly amazing.” “I’ve used Chat GPT to help me code simple games in Unity. This seems more connected and easier to work through.” “This is fascinating. This is ** amazing. Yeah, I know it's obviously early on, but already works for rad generative art. I'll say that much.” “Can finally call myself a game developer lol. Damn that sounds so good.”</p><p>We’re a small team working on this for the last few months, so a lot of things are far from perfect. Constructive feedback is very welcome!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><h2 id="origins">Origins</h2><p>Over half a year ago (in April, to be exact), I eventually decided to learn Rust for good. My previous attempt during the <a href="https://github.com/spetz/advent-of-code-2022">2022 AoC</a> had failed rather quickly, after a few days of completing the exercises - I finally realized that <strong>I needed a real project to work on</strong>. For the last few years, I've been dealing with the different kinds of distributed systems (mostly using C#), including the typical microservices architecture or Web3. Regardless of their nature, some sort of the messaging between the independent components was always required. I had a chance to use the tools such as <a href="https://rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href="https://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>, <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> or <a href="https://aeron.io/">Aeron</a> (just to name a few), as well as implementing the low-level peer-to-peer communication <a href="https://libp2p.io/">protocols</a>.</p><p>After a few months of trying to figure out (or just staying in the limbo I guess), what would be the best project to work on, I decided to build the <strong>message streaming platform</strong> (keep in mind that streaming is <a href="https://blog.iron.io/message-queue-vs-streaming/">not the same</a> as regular message broker). The other reason (besides getting to know Rust) was to <strong>truly understand the internals of the messaging systems</strong> and the trade-offs that were made by their developers - some of them being the sole implication of the theory of distributed systems (ordering, consistency, partitioning etc.), while others the result of the implementation details (programming language, OS, hardware and so on).</p><p>And this is how the <a href="https://iggy.rs/">Iggy.rs</a> was born. The name is an abbreviation of the Italian Greyhound (yes, I own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fabio.and.cookie/">two of them</a>), small yet extremely fast dogs, the best in their class.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggys.jpeg"></p><p>Therefore, what I want, or actually <strong>what we want</strong> (since there's a few of us working on it already) for Iggy.rs to be - the best message streaming platform in its class. <strong>Lightweight</strong> in terms of the resource consumption, <strong>fast</strong> (and predictable) when it comes to the throughput and latency, and <strong>easy to use</strong> when speaking of its API, SDK and configuration of the project.</p><h2 id="project">Project</h2><p>At the very beginning, Iggy had rather limited functionality, and everything was handled using the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/quic/">QUIC</a> protocol based on <a href="https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn">Quinn</a> library. You could connect multiple applications into the server, and start exchanging the messages between them, simply by appending the data to the stream (from the producer perspective), and fetching the records on the consumer side, by providing an offset (numeric value specifying from which element in the stream, you'd like to query the data) - that's pretty much the very basics of how the message streaming platform works in terms of the underlying infrastructure.</p><p>After spending a few weeks on building the initial version, and then another few weeks on rewriting its core part (yes, prototyping + validation repeated in a continuous loop worked quite well), I managed to implement the persistent streaming server being capable of parallel writes/reads to/from independent streams supporting many distinct apps connected into it. Simply put, one could easily have many applications, and even <strong>thousands of the streams</strong> (depending on how do you decide to split your data between them e.g. one stream for user related events, another one for the payments events etc.) and start producing &amp; consuming the messages without interfering to each other.</p><p>On top of this, the support for <strong>TCP</strong> and <strong>HTTP</strong> protocols have been added. Under the hood, the typical architecture of streams, consisting of the topics being split into the partitions, which eventually operate on a raw file data using so-called segments has been implemented as well.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_sample.jpeg"></p><p><strong>It was one of the "aha" moments</strong>, when reimplementing the parallel access to the data with the usage of underlying synchronization mechanism (<em>RwLock</em> etc.), optimized data structures e.g. for dealing with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bytes">bytes</a>, along with the <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a> <strong>work stealing</strong> approach, yielded the great improvements for the overall throughput.</p><p>I do believe, that somewhere at this point I had realized, that <strong>Iggy might actually become something useful</strong> - not just a toy project, to be abandoned after reaching its initial goal (which was sort of already achieved).</p><pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span><span> polled_messages </span><span>=</span><span> client</span><span>.</span><span>poll_messages</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>PollMessages {
</span><span>  stream_id</span><span>: </span><span>Identifier</span><span>::</span><span>numeric(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>,
</span><span>  topic_id</span><span>: </span><span>Identifier</span><span>::</span><span>named(</span><span>"orders"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>,
</span><span>  consumer</span><span>: </span><span>Consumer</span><span>::</span><span>group(Identifier</span><span>::</span><span>named(</span><span>"payments"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>)</span><span>,

</span><span>  strategy</span><span>: </span><span>PollingStrategy</span><span>::</span><span>offset(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>,
</span><span>  count</span><span>: </span><span>10</span><span>,
</span><span>  auto_commit</span><span>: </span><span>true</span><span>,
</span><span>})</span><span>.</span><span>await</span><span>?</span><span>;
</span></code></pre><p>After running some benchmarks (yes, we have a dedicated app for the <strong><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy/tree/master/bench">benchmarking purposes</a></strong>) and seeing the promising numbers (<strong>range of 2-6 GB/s for both, writes &amp; reads when processing millions of messages</strong>), I eventually decided to give it a long-term shot. Being fully aware that there's still lots to be done (speaking of many months, or even years), I couldn't be more happy to find out that there's also someone else out there, who would like to contribute to the project and become a part of the team.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_bench.jpeg"></p><h2 id="team">Team</h2><p>At the time of writing this post, <strong>Iggy consists of around 10 members</strong> contributing to its different parts. Some of us do work on the core streaming server, while the other ones are focused on SDKs for the different programming languages or tooling such as Web UI or CLI - all these projects are equally important, as they add up to the overall ecosystem. But how do you actually gather a team of open source contributors, who are willing to spend their free time working on it?</p><p>Well, I wish I had an answer to that question - honestly, in case of Iggy I wasn't actually looking for anyone, as I didn't think this could be an interesting project to work on (except for myself). Then how did that happen anyway? There were only 2 things in common - all the people that joined the project were part of the same Discord communities, yet more importantly <strong>they all shared the passion for programming</strong>, and I'm not talking about Rust language specifically. From junior to senior, from embedded to front-end developers - regardless of the years of experience and current occupation, everyone has found a way to implement something meaningful.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_server.jpeg"></p><p>For example, when I asked one guy what was the reason behind building an SDK in Go, the reply was the need of playing with and learning a new language. Why C# SDK? Well, the other guy wanted to dive more into the low-level concepts and decided to squeeze out great performance from the managed runtime. Why build Web UI in Svelte? At work, I mostly use React, and I wanted to learn a new framework - another member said.</p><p>My point is - as long as you believe in what you're building, and you're consistent about it (it was one of the main reasons why I've been contributing to Iggy every day since its inception, and still doing so), there's a chance that someone out there will notice it and happily join you in your efforts. <strong>Lead by example, or whatever you call it.</strong></p><p>At the same time, we've started receiving the first, <strong>external contributions from all around the world</strong> - whether talking about simpler tasks, or the more sophisticated ones, requiring significant amount of time being spent on both, the implementation and the discussions to eventually deliver the code.</p><p>It gave us even more confidence, that there are other people (outside our internal bubble), who find this project to be interesting and worth spending their time. And without all these amazing contributors, it'd be much harder (or even impossible) to deliver so many features.</p><h2 id="features">Features</h2><p>At first, let me just point out some of the properties and features that are part of the core streaming server:</p><ul><li><strong>Highly performant</strong>, persistent append-only log for the message streaming</li><li><strong>Very high throughput</strong> for both writes and reads</li><li><strong>Low latency and predictable resource usage</strong> thanks to the Rust compiled language (no GC)</li><li><strong>Users authentication and authorization</strong> with granular permissions and PAT (Personal Access Tokens)</li><li>Support for multiple streams, topics and partitions</li><li>Support for <strong>multiple transport protocols</strong> (QUIC, TCP, HTTP)</li><li>Fully operational RESTful API which can be optionally enabled</li><li>Available client SDK in multiple languages</li><li><strong>Works directly with the binary data</strong> (lack of enforced schema and serialization/deserialization)</li><li>Configurable server features (e.g. caching, segment size, data flush interval, transport protocols etc.)</li><li>Possibility of storing the <strong>consumer offsets</strong> on the server</li><li>Multiple ways of polling the messages: <ul><li>By offset (using the indexes)</li><li>By timestamp (using the time indexes)</li><li>First/Last N messages</li><li>Next N messages for the specific consumer</li></ul></li><li>Possibility of <strong>auto committing the offset</strong> (e.g. to achieve <em>at-most-once</em> delivery)</li><li><strong>Consumer groups</strong> providing the message ordering and horizontal scaling across the connected clients</li><li><strong>Message expiry</strong> with auto deletion based on the configurable <strong>retention policy</strong></li><li>Additional features such as <strong>server side message deduplication</strong></li><li><strong>TLS</strong> support for all transport protocols (TCP, QUIC, HTTPS)</li><li>Optional server-side as well as client-side <strong>data encryption</strong> using AES-256-GCM</li><li>Optional metadata support in the form of <strong>message headers</strong></li><li>Built-in <strong>CLI</strong> to manage the streaming server</li><li>Built-in <strong>benchmarking app</strong> to test the performance</li><li><strong>Single binary deployment</strong> (no external dependencies)</li><li>Running as a single node (no cluster support yet)</li></ul><p>And as already mentioned, we've been working on SDKs for the multiple programming languages:</p><ul><li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/iggy">Rust</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-dotnet-client">C#</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-go-client">Go</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-node-client">Node</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-python-client">Python</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-java-client">Java</a></li></ul><p>Please keep in mind, though, that some of them e.g. for Rust or C# are more up to date with the recent server changes, while the other ones might still need to do some catching up with the latest features. However, given the amount of available methods on the server's API and the underlying TCP/UDP stack with custom serialization to be implemented from the scratch (except for HTTP transport, that's the easier one), I'd say we're doing quite ok, and I can't stress enough <strong>how grateful I am to all the contributors for their huge amount of work</strong>!</p><p>But wait, there's even more - what would be a message streaming platform without some additional tooling for managing it? We've also been developing the <strong><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy/tree/master/cmd">CLI</a></strong>.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_cli.jpeg"></p><p>As well as modern <strong><a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-web-ui">Web UI</a></strong> to make it happen :)</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_web_ui.jpeg"></p><p>Last but not least, we've got a fully-featured <a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy/actions">CI/CD pipeline</a> responsible for running all the checks and tests on multiple platforms, and finally producing the release artifacts and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/iggyrs">Docker images</a>.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/iggy_ci_cd.jpeg"></p><p>At first glance, it might look like there's plenty of features already in place, but for anyone who has ever worked with the message streaming infrastructure before, that might be just a tip of an iceberg, thus let's discuss the roadmap.</p><h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2><p>After gaining some traction a few months ago (mostly due to landing on the GitHub trending page in July), we've talked to some users potentially interested in making Iggy part of their infrastructure (there's even one <a href="https://neferdata.com/">company</a> using it already), and discussed what features would be a good addition to the current stack.</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/gh_trending.jpeg"></p><p>Considering what's already there, being worked on or planned for the future releases, such as interactive CLI, modern Web UI, optional data compression and archivization, plugin support or multiple SDKs, there are at least three additonal challenges to overcome:</p><p><strong>Clustering</strong> - the possibility of having a <strong>highly available and fault tolerant</strong> distributed message streaming platform in a production environment, is typically one of the most important aspects when considering the particular tool. While it wouldn't be too difficult to implement the extension (think of a simple proxy/load balancer), allowing to monitor and deliver the data either to the primary or secondary replica (treated as a fallback server) and switch between them when one of the nodes goes down, such a solution would still result in SPOF and wouldn't really scale. Instead, we've started experimenting with <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> consensus mechanism (de facto the industry standard) in a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-cluster-sandbox">repository</a>, which should allow us in delivering the truly fault tolerant, distributed infrastructure with an additional data replication at the partition level (so-called unit of parallelization).</p><p><img alt="image" src="https://blog.iggy.rs/building-message-streaming/leader_elections.jpeg"></p><p><strong>Low-level I/O</strong> - although the current results (based on the benchmarking tool measuring the throughput etc.) are satisfying, we strongly believe that there's still (potentially a huge) room for improvement. We're planning to use <strong><a href="https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html">io_uring</a></strong> for all I/O operations (disk or network related). The brand new, completion based API (available in the recent Linux kernels) shows a significant boost when compared to the existing solutions such as <strong>epoll</strong> or <strong>kqueue</strong> - at the end of the day, the streaming server at its core is all about writing &amp; reading data to/from disk and sending it via the network buffer. We've decided to give a try <strong><a href="https://github.com/bytedance/monoio">monoio</a></strong> runtime, as it seems to be the most performant one. Going further, we'd like to incorporate techniques such as <strong>zero-copy</strong>, <strong>kernel bypass</strong> and all the other goodies e.g. from <strong><a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a></strong> or other relevant frameworks.</p><p><strong>Thread-per-core</strong> - in order to avoid the rather costly context switches due to the usage of synchronization mechanism when accessing the data from the different threads (e.g. via Tokio's work stealing mechanism), we're planning to explore (or actually, already doing it, in the previously mentioned repository for clustering sandbox) thread-per-core architecture, once again, delivered as part of <strong><a href="https://github.com/bytedance/monoio">monoio</a></strong> runtime. The overall idea can be described in two words - <strong>share nothing</strong> (or as little as possible). For example, the streams could be tied to the particular CPU cores, resulting in <strong>no additional overhead</strong> (via <em>Mutexes</em>, <em>RwLocks</em> etc.) when writing or reading the data. As good as it might sound, there are always some tradeoffs - what if some specific streams are more frequently accessed than the others? Would the remaining cores remain idle instead of doing something useful? On the other hand, tools such as <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/product/technology/shard-per-core-architecture/">ScyllaDB</a> or <a href="https://redpanda.com/blog/tpc-buffers">Redpanda</a> seem to be leveraging this model quite effectively (both are using the same <a href="https://seastar.io/">Seastar</a> framework). We will be looking for the answers, before deciding which approach (thread-per-core or work stealing) suits Iggy better in the future.</p><h2 id="future">Future</h2><p><strong>Why building another message streaming then?</strong> A few months ago, I would probably answer - strictly for fun. Yet, after exploring more in-depth the status quo, what we would like to achieve is sort of twofold - on one hand, it'd be great to deliver the general-purpose tool, such as Kafka. On the other hand, why not to try and really push hard the OS and hardware to its limits when speaking of the performance, reliability, throughput and latency, something what e.g. Aeron does? And what if we could <strong>put this all together</strong> into the easy-to-use, unified platform, supporting the most popular programming languages, with the addition of modern CLI and Web UI for managing it?</p><p>Only the time will tell, but <strong>we're already excited enough to challenge ourselves</strong>. We'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas and <strong>feedback</strong> - anything that will help us in building the best message streaming platform in Rust that you will enjoy using!

									The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706">Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen</a> is the best beginner fountain pen, period. Its durable metal build and smooth stainless steel nib ensure that your first fountain pen is one you can be proud of. The Metropolitan comes in three nib sizes (<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=4cb4dbdf7f3f31d2">fine</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=58abf2a2f635c8ec32ea692af29489e9">medium</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=6914ab5eaeccecd6039d36e7d078ad40b376adb49213ebba">medium italic</a>) and several body colors. It can be filled with Pilot’s proprietary <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Namiki-Fountain-Pen-Refill-Cartridges/ct/130">cartridges</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pen-Black-Plain-Fine-Nib/pd/12075/refills?&amp;f=64f61958cc42490f31a490a25ae468364ebf64e44e23854d">converters</a>—one is included!—which allows you to use any <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Fountain-Pen-Inks/ct/3250">bottled fountain pen ink</a>.
									</p><p>For those who like how the Metropolitan writes but would prefer a different body, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Kakuno-Fountain-Pens/ct/1984">Kakuno</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Penmanship-Fountain-Pens/ct/759">Penmanship</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Prera-Fountain-Pens/ct/410">Prera</a> all use the same swappable nibs. The Kakuno is especially charming thanks to the smiley face stamped on the nib, which reminds you which side should face up.</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>Most fountain pens are filled with cartridges or converters, but some have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Fountain-Pen-Filling-Systems-Explained/pt/912#Built-In%20Filling%20System">built-in mechanisms</a> that allow you to fill the pen barrel with ink. They’re not as convenient as cartridges, but they can be filled with far more ink. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-GO-Fountain-Pens/ct/5275">TWSBI GO</a> is a great place to start if you want to try out this type of filling system. Its spring-loaded piston mechanism is easy to use. Submerge the nib in ink, then press down and release the plunger to fill the pen.</p>
							
							<p>Are you still a little hesitant to try out fountain pens? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fountain-Pens/ct/5111">Platinum Preppy</a> is another beginner option. It has a budget-friendly price that won’t break the bank if you decide fountain pens aren’t for you. Plus, you can repurpose the pen by swapping out the nib for a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fluorescent-Highlighter-Pen-Tip-Refill-Pack-of-2/pd/2820">chisel tip</a> and the fountain pen ink cartridge for a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Highlighter-Ink-Cartridges/ct/3171">highlighter ink cartridge</a>. Now you have a refillable highlighter pen!</p>

									While most piston-filling fountain pens cost more than $100, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3">TWSBI ECO</a> is the best fountain pen under $50. It offers amazing value with its high quality piston-filler, and its sleek, clear body lets you see how much ink is left inside. It’s available in four nib sizes, including a fun <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=6914ab5eaeccecd6039d36e7d078ad40b376adb49213ebba_8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3">1.1 mm stub</a>.
									</p><p>You might be wondering, “Why should I pick the TWSBI ECO over the GO mentioned in the previous section?” It comes down to price, ink capacity, and style. The GO has a budget-friendly price, smaller ink capacity, and quirky design that might look a little childish to some. The ECO is a little more expensive, though its traditional piston mechanism can hold more ink. Additionally, it has a body design with more general appeal, including limited edition colors (<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">some of which</a> are over $50).</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>If the idea of a piston-filling pen makes you a bit nervous—or if you would prefer the convenience of cartridges—we wholeheartedly recommend the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Safari-Fountain-Pens/ct/1185">LAMY Safari</a>. This distinctively modern fountain pen has a triangular grip section that guides your hand into an ergonomic <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pen-for-Your-Hand-Grip/pt/454">tripod grip</a>. The Safari is made of durable ABS plastic. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-AL-Star-Fountain-Pens/ct/1184">AL-Star</a> is a little more expensive, but it’s made from lightweight aluminum.</p>

									The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-AL-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/1040">Kaweco AL Sport</a> is the best fountain pen under $100. It’s a stylish option for anyone ready to venture into more interesting fountain pen styles and materials. It’s both vintage and modern thanks to an iconic octagonal body design that was first introduced in 1935. The Kaweco Sport’s slogan—”Small in the pocket, great in the hand”—describes its appeal perfectly. Although the pen is small enough to fit in a pocket for <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Everyday-Carry-Stationery-Items/pt/46">everyday carry</a>, the cap can be posted on the back of the barrel to extend it to a comfortable size.
									</p><p>The Kaweco Sport is available as an inexpensive <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/3402?&amp;f=bfc2ef6f965adaf41e7007fbf57bff50_8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3_b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">plastic pen</a>, but we like the AL Sport’s premium feel. The aluminum build gives the pen a good weight and durability without adding too much weight.</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Brass-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/2462">Brass Sport</a> is a good alternative for anyone who wants a heavier pen, though we should note that its raw <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Brass-Pens/pt/337">brass</a> construction can have a noticeable scent.</p>
							
							<p>We also want to mention the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=873a409ab1e24078cf6022af66aea815">LAMY Studio</a>. It features the same steel nib found on the Safari fitted to a sturdy metal body. The Studio’s subtle, curving design gives the pen a remarkably sophisticated look. If you like the Studio and are willing to spend more than $100, you can pick up the stealthy all-black <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=f0cf9d16b892f5cd0a0d2415a7dca11f">Lx</a> with a matching steel nib or a fountain pen with a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=1914fdb7b0902f3495804bc50c319a60">14k gold nib</a>.</p>

									Although there are many sophisticated pens that any professional would be proud to carry, we have to say that the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876">Pilot Vanishing Point</a> is the best luxury fountain pen for writing. This fountain pen’s elegance speaks for itself, but its retraction mechanism takes it to another level. Just press the button on the back of the barrel to extend the nib. When the nib is retracted, a “gate” inside the grip section seals the nib and prevents it from drying out.
									
									</p><p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens-Standard/ct/1225">Standard Vanishing Point</a> is best for those with larger hands and comes in a range of finishes, from the stealthy <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876?&amp;f=3e29cb29569d6320_9f666c7890582192">Black Matte</a> to the stunning <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876?&amp;f=372172b339817c6c6272cd02ad9e29fb">Raden</a> series inlaid with real abalone shell. The thinner and lighter <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Decimo-Fountain-Pens/ct/544">Decimo</a> is ideal for those with smaller hands, or anyone who intends to write for long periods of time.</p>
								</div>

							<p>Some writers may find that the Vanishing Point’s clip gets in the way of their fingers. For an alternative that’s no less exceptional, you can’t go wrong with the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-2000-Fountain-Pens/ct/1542">LAMY 2000</a>. This fountain pen balances a striking design with understated style. Because it’s a piston filler, it has a high ink capacity that allows you to write for pages and pages.</p>
							
							<p>Is the LAMY 2000’s design a little too modern for your taste? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-3776-Century-Fountain-Pens/ct/3830">Platinum 3776 Century</a> has a vintage appeal thanks to its classic, cigar-shaped design with rounded ends. Or are you searching for an option with plenty of colors to choose from? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sailor-Pro-Gear-Slim-Fountain-Pens/ct/4019">Pro Gear Slim</a> would be right up your alley. Sailor regularly releases new colors based on seasonal themes, Japanese festivals, and more. </p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/354">Uni Jetstream</a> is definitely the best ballpoint pen for writing. It’ll undoubtedly change your mind if you think ballpoint pens are just low quality writing instruments swiped from restaurants and hotels. Like other ballpoint pens, the Jetstream can write on receipts and other surfaces that gel pens struggle with. And to make it even better, the Jetstream uses a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a> that provides a smooth, vivid, and consistent writing experience. 
							</p><p>The Jetstream comes in several body styles, tip sizes, and ink colors. This includes the comfortable <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Alpha-Gel-Grip-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/655">Alpha Gel Grip</a>, as well as a shockingly fine <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/354?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.28 mm</a> tip size that no other ballpoint pen can match. You can even get the Jetstream in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Multi-Pens/ct/858">multi pen form</a>, which includes several ink colors. Some even have mechanical pencil components!</p>

							If you want your writing instrument to have the finest tip possible, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381">Pilot Hi-Tec-C</a> is the best gel pen for you. Its <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381?&amp;f=f1d84bb55a3b087ba04e42ce0a1eb746">0.25 mm</a> tip can write neatly in the tiniest spaces, from book margins to planner squares. The Hi-Tec-C is remarkably smooth considering the fineness of the tip, and it comes in a handful of bright colors.
							</p><p>However, we must warn that such fine tip sizes will feel more “scratchy” than those found on 0.38 mm or 0.5 mm pens. A smaller tip size has a smaller surface area that comes in contact with the paper, and it puts down less ink that would otherwise lubricate the tip. Additionally, the 0.25 mm Hi-Tec-C may need to be primed with a scribble on a piece of scratch paper to get the ink flowing.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<p>We find these minor flaws a reasonable exchange for such fine lines, but the slightly broader <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381?&amp;f=df8f74e215697aa1cd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.3 mm</a> tip tends to perform more reliably.</p>
					
					<p>Those who prefer ballpoint inks should reach for the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5947?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">Uni Jetstream Edge</a>. As with the Hi-Tec-C, its ultra fine tip doesn’t perform as consistently as the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5947?&amp;f=6c955f272b074045a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.38 mm Jetstream</a>, but we’re still impressed by how well the pen writes. A 0.28 mm tip size is almost unheard of in ballpoint pens, and Uni managed to make a precise pen that still offers a smooth writing experience. You can even get it as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-3-Color-Ballpoint-Multi-Pens/ct/6234">multi pen</a>!</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Dry-Gel-Pens/ct/3703">Zebra Sarasa Dry</a> is the fastest-drying gel pen. Even the largest and wettest <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Dry-Gel-Pens/ct/3703?&amp;f=98b97b6ae48ce49ecd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.7 mm</a> tip size dried in less than five seconds on Rhodia paper, a paper that inks tend to dry slowly on. The Sarasa Dry puts down a wonderfully saturated line, writes smoothly, and comes in three tip sizes. Like many other Sarasa pens, this gel pen has a hinged clip that opens wide so it slides easily over notebooks and pockets.
							</p><p>As with many water-based gel inks, the Sarasa Dry smears readily beneath highlighters. Color-coders should consider using ballpoint pens like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211">Pilot Acro and Acroball</a> instead. Oil-based ballpoint inks won’t react to water-based highlighter inks, so you can go over your notes without worrying about smudges.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>Additionally, Pilot’s Acro ink is a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a>, so it writes smoothly without blobbing.</p>

							The most comfortable ergonomic pen will differ from person to person, with the best options depending on factors like hand size. Even so, we think the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-207-Premier-Retractable-Gel-Pen-0.7-mm-Silver-Body-Black-Ink/pd/8466">Uni-ball Signo 207 Premier</a> is the best ergonomic pen for most writers. It uses the same ink as other <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-Gel-Pens/ct/2576">Signo Gel Pens</a>, so it flows freely and glides across the page with little pressure. The pigmented ink is satisfyingly dark regardless of how lightly you write. If you <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pen-for-Your-Hand-Grip/pt/454">hold your pens tightly</a>, its squishy grip will relieve your achy fingers. In addition, the 207 Premier has a lightweight body with a low center of gravity that won’t tire your hand as you write.
							</p><p>If you prefer ballpoint ink, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-Ballpoint-Pen-Series/ct/857">Pilot Dr. Grip</a> is another excellent ergonomic pen. It has a carefully balanced barrel, and its double layer grip design is moderately soft without being too squishy or too hard.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The Dr. Grip, which is also available as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-4-1-Multi-Pens/ct/306">multi pen</a>, has even earned an “Ease-of-Use” Commendation from the Arthritis Foundation.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-bLen-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5949">Zebra bLen Ballpoint Pen</a> provides the most comfortable writing experience. Most people are unaware of how visual and audible clutter can affect their focus, but the bLen was created with stress-free writing in mind. The name is inspired by the Japanese word <em>burenai</em> (ブレない), which means non-vibrating. This carefully engineered ballpoint pen eliminates all the little rattles and vibrations which can cause frustration and distract us from writing.
							</p><p>Its minimalist design is beautiful and calming to look at, and will fit seamlessly into any aesthetic. We especially enjoy Zebra’s smooth and vibrant <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a>, which is darker and smoother than regular ballpoint inks. The bLen is also available as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-bLen-3C-3-Color-Ballpoint-Multi-Pens/ct/6030">three-color multi pen</a>.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>We also like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Calme-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/6500">Pentel Calme</a> and its clicker, which makes almost no sound. Its grip section has a leather-like texture that covers almost the entirety of the lower barrel, so your fingers have something to grip no matter where you hold your pen. Like the bLen, the Calme is available in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Calme-Multi-Pens/ct/6653">multi pen versions</a>, including some with <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Calme-Multi-Pens/ct/6653?&amp;f=e0522e1495ef94d7a231937c7b9d96eaaa3960751dda7ba6">mechanical pencil components</a>.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Gel-Pens/ct/2574">Pilot FriXion</a> is by far the best “erasable” pen. This remarkable pen offers the best combination of vibrancy, consistency, and “erasability.” It accomplishes this with a special thermosensitive ink that writes just like any other ink, yet disappears without a trace when rubbed with the hard “eraser” on the end of the pen. The friction generated by this rubbing action raises the temperature of the ink and turns it invisible.
							</p><p>The Pilot FriXion comes in several colors, tip sizes, and body designs so that you can find one that fits your style. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Series/ct/4201">FriXion ink technology</a> can be found in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Light-Erasable-Highlighters/ct/682">highlighters</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Colors-Erasable-Markers/ct/1123">markers</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Stamps/ct/2531">stamps</a>.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>FriXion inks are less saturated in color than standard gel inks. This is most noticeable with the black ink, which can appear gray. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Ball-Knock-Zone-Retractable-Gel-Pens/ct/6729">Ball Zone</a> improves the ink’s saturation so the black ink no longer has a green tint and the colored inks are more vibrant. </p>
					
					<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Pilot FriXion ink will “erase” with any heat, so don’t store your notebooks in hot cars or on top of radiators. Additionally, don’t use FriXion ink to take tests or write on important documents, especially those that need permanent signatures. If you accidentally make your writing disappear, you may be able to get it to reappear by placing the paper in a freezer that reaches below 14°F (-10°C).</p>

							For those who frequently switch between writing and using a touchscreen, a good stylus pen like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Stylus-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/4690">Uni Jetstream Stylus</a> is a must-have. Not only can it reduce finger pain from repetitive swiping on digital devices, but it lets you change work surfaces without losing track of your pen. The Uni Jetstream Stylus comes equipped with a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Stylus-Replacement-Tip-Pack-of-2/pd/21686">replaceable capacitive stylus</a> made with silver-covered fibers. This lets it move across your screen more easily than typical rubber styli.

					<div><p>
							It may not look like much, but the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Multi-Ball-Rollerball-Pens/ct/582">Pilot Multi Ball</a> is a fantastic rollerball pen for left-handed writers. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Multi-Ball-Rollerball-Pen-Medium-Black/pd/13782">medium</a> tip size dried within four seconds on Rhodia paper, which tends to make inks dry slower. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Multi-Ball-Rollerball-Pen-Fine-Black/pd/2760">fine</a> tip size dried within two seconds!
							</p><p>The Multi Ball isn’t just a great pen for paper, though. It’ll write on nonporous surfaces too, including glass, ceramic, plastic, and almost anything else. The fine tip size is perfect for signing the backs of credit cards without smearing.</p>
							<p>You may think that there must be a tradeoff to achieve this <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pens-that-Write-on-Any-Surface/pt/743">multi-surface</a> marvel, but Pilot didn’t make any sacrifices on the writing quality. It’s delightfully smooth on paper and produces a deep, dark line every time.</p>

	<p>The Best Pens for Journaling and Planning</p>
		
		<div>
				
					<div><p>
							Just about any pen can work well for journaling, but the JetPens team is especially fond of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pens/ct/262">Zebra Sarasa Clip</a>. Its vibrant pigment ink is smooth to write with and both water and fade resistant, so it won’t disappear if you accidentally spill a drink on your journal. 
							</p><p>If you keep a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Journals/pt/566">journal</a> like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Leuchtturm1917-Bullet-Journals/ct/4259">Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal</a> that you update with quick notations throughout the day, the Sarasa’s fast-drying ink will help prevent smudges. What really sets the Sarasa Clip apart, though, is its namesake clip. It opens wide to let you securely fasten the pen to a notebook so you’ll always be ready to make a new entry.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The Clip comes in a wide variety of hues for color-coding as well as tip-sizes from 0.3 mm to 1.0 mm to suit anyone’s preferences. There’s even a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Multi-Pens/ct/412">multi pen version</a> filled with Sarasa ink. Those who appreciate finer tip sizes should consider trying the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Nano-Gel-Pens/ct/6558">Sarasa Nano</a>. It uses an internal spring that allows the tip to retract slightly into the pen, reducing sideways force and preventing the tip from wiggling undesirably.</p>

							These <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733">Kuretake ZIG Clean Color Dot Markers</a> bring fun and versatility to journaling and planning. We’re big fans of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733?&amp;f=cd4aa3cda9bd1548bd4cf76df45d38a1">double-sided version</a>, which features a 0.5 mm hard plastic tip on one end and a wonderfully squishy dot tip on the other.
							</p><p>Depending on the pressure you use, the dot tip can make marks from one to five millimeters wide, though we should warn that pressing very hard can put a lot of ink on the page and cause bleedthrough. It’s easy and fun to make quick flowers and other fun doodles, or—for a slightly more practical use case—to highlight important dates in your planner or calendar.

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Board-Master-Dry-Erase-Markers/ct/3503">Pilot Board Master</a> is the king of school <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Whiteboard-Markers/pt/919">whiteboard markers</a>. Its highly pigmented ink delivers intense color that’s easy to read from across the room, and its thick tip is easy to control. Its dry-erase ink wipes away cleanly without leaving behind “shadows” on the whiteboard.
							</p><p>Best of all, the Board Master has an ingenious twin pipe feeder system that equalizes the pressure inside and outside the marker. Lines remain crisp, vibrant, and consistent down to the last drop of ink. You’ll never have to struggle with faint whiteboard marker lines again! Once the marker does run dry, you can <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Board-Master-Ink-Cartridges/ct/3504">refill</a> it, cutting down on waste. Even the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Marker-Replacement-Tips/ct/3505?&amp;f=36954fd9823cd2df">tips</a> are replaceable.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910">Sakura Pigma Micron</a> is a fantastic fineliner for lettering (and art, too!). Its precise tip allows letterers to make consistent marks for drawing monoline styles and elaborate letterforms. Its rich, pigment-based ink delivers vivid color that is archival quality and waterproof, so your lettering will last for years. This iconic pen comes in several colors and fineliner tip sizes ranging from <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=90a21b8d54b00f7e9554f72d2b1a94e1">003</a> (0.15 mm) for intricate embellishments to <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=0c76cccd3a5f8bf6a04e42ce0a1eb746">12</a> (0.7 mm) for text that stands out. Pigma Micron tips can be a little delicate, so use a light hand and don’t press too hard while lettering. Otherwise, you might bend the tips.
							</p><p>Other tip types including <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=9337a404131b90fa7df047e3c29eae93">bullet tips</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=0ddcea6bf85d451d32091cb827bdb85a">plastic nibs</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=7dd55fcb7563d511">brushes</a> are also available.</p>

							The best dip pen for lettering is the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Rohrer-Klingner-Glass-Pens/ct/6105">Rohrer &amp; Klingner Glass Pen</a>. It’s a beautiful writing tool and a unique work of art at the same time. A <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/How-to-Use-a-Glass-Dip-Pen/pt/344">glass pen</a> has a tip with spiraling grooves that act as reservoirs. Dip the tip in ink to fill the grooves. As you write, ink travels down the grooves to the tip of the pen. When the tip feels like it’s running dry, turn the pen in your hand to allow ink from another groove to flow to the tip. Glass nibs will never rust, so they can last a lifetime as long as they’re cleaned of ink residue. Be sure to store them in a stable area like a pen cup or tray, too: after all, they’re made of glass, and can break if dropped!
							</p><p>If the designs offered by Rohrer &amp; Klingner don’t strike your fancy, browse the different glass pen colors offered by <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/J.-Herbin-Glass-Dip-Pens/ct/724">J. Herbin</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Guridrops-Glass-Pens/ct/6952">Guridrops</a>.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>All glass pens are handmade by artisans, so no two will look exactly alike.</p>
					
					<p>Since glass dip pens are made of fragile materials, some calligraphers may feel anxious about accidentally damaging them. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Teranishi-Guitar-Aurora-Glass-Pens-with-Cap/ct/7097">Teranishi Guitar Aurora Glass Pens</a> have acrylic barrels and come with screw-on caps to protect their glass tips. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kakimori-Dip-Pen-Nibs/ct/7197?&amp;f=add42f28e0d80e67dacb8f62f5adf3e49e6ad08b7a4ff724">Kakimori Metal Dip Pen Nibs</a> are made from durable brass or stainless steel (though you’ll need to pick up a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kakimori-Dip-Pen-Nib-Metal-Nib-Brass/pd/40028/compatible#index=1">nib holder</a>, too).</p>
					
					<p>You can also try a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Iro-Utsushi-Dip-Pens/ct/6648">Pilot Iro-Utsushi Dip Pen</a>, which has a barrel made of plastic or wood. The nib is made of stainless steel and has a rounded tip similar to a fountain pen nib, so they’re less “sharp” than typical dip pen nibs and feel smoother on paper. You should still be careful not to drop the pen on its nib, but you won’t have to worry about glass shards if an accident happens.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Parallel-Pens/ct/165">Pilot Parallel</a> is the best calligraphy pen for broad edge calligraphy scripts like italic or blackletter. This unique calligraphy pen features a nib made of two metal plates stacked on top of each other. This allows the ink to flow between the plates and along the entire width of the nib for a juicy and consistent line. Its cartridge-filled design makes the Parallel particularly easy and convenient to use, and its <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Parallel-Calligraphy-Pen-Refill-Cartridges/ct/603">mixable ink</a> allows for fun gradation effects. This pen comes in six nib sizes for projects of all sizes.

Their archival-safe, pigment-based inks dry very quickly. We were able to paint over them with watercolors immediately and saw no bleeding whatsoever. And since Multiliners are made by Copic, they’re compatible with alcohol-based <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Markers/ct/3075?&amp;f=1b8763b30df3730297f215786bb046761f4737d59d8d7acd">Copic Markers</a>.

They’re also available in ten colors, so you can line your artwork in a different color for visual appeal.</p>

							<p>Artists who do a great deal of inking should consider the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pens/ct/686">Multiliner SP</a>. They require a higher up-front investment than their disposable siblings, but they’re <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pen-Refills/ct/2357">refillable</a> and even have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pen-Replacement-Nibs-Accessories/ct/3427">replaceable tips</a>.</p>

Unlike traditional drawing pens with metal tips that must be held vertically, the Graphic Liner has a rollerball tip that can be used at your natural drawing angle. Since it’s made of metal rather than felt or plastic, the tip creates consistent lines without fraying or flexing. This makes it especially suitable for beginners, but even experienced artists can appreciate its natural feel and waterproof, Copic-proof, and archival pigment-based ink.

							The best <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Manga-and-Comic-Art-Supplies/pt/956"><em>manga</em> pen</a> for art combines a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Nikko-Comic-Pen-Nibs/ct/3065?&amp;f=a220e003961af2ce">Nikko G Nib</a> with a nib holder like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Tachikawa-T-40-Nib-Holder-Natural/pd/4573">Tachikawa Model 40</a>. A G Nib has a sharp tip that creates both broad and thin lines ideal for facial features, action-packed scenes, and more. We recommend that beginners start with the Nikko G because it’s relatively firm compared to other G nibs. This firmness makes it easy to control while still allowing a satisfying amount of flex.
							</p><p>For consistent lines, try Nikko’s <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Nikko-Comic-Pen-Nibs-Standard/ct/3794?&amp;f=add42f28e0d80e67dacb8f62f5adf3e49e6ad08b7a4ff724">Maru Nibs</a>. Also known as mapping nibs, these stiff nibs don’t flex at all. They work well for precise details.</p>
							<p>Comic pen nibs can’t be used on their own and must be paired with nib holders. The Tachikawa Model 40 is our favorite nib holder for <em>manga</em> artists.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>Its double rubber rings can hold a wide variety of nibs, and its rubber grip makes it comfortable to hold. It even comes with a plastic cap to protect nibs during transport.</p>

							As its name suggests, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Series/ct/4076">Faber-Castell PITT Artist Pen</a> is a great marker for art. It combines the permanence and vibrancy of India ink with the convenience of a marker. Other inks can fade when exposed to light, but the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pens-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/309">PITT Artist Pen</a> uses ink that’s lightfast so you can confidently display your art. Because some colors are more lightfast than others, Faber-Castell prints a rating on each pen’s barrel to help you choose the right hues. A one-asterisk rating means the ink is lightfast for at least five years, while a three-asterisk rating is lightfast for more than 100 years!
							
							</p><p>Faber-Castell offers PITT Pens in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pens/ct/3076">marker</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Brush-Pens/ct/5181">brush pen</a> forms. And no matter which pen you prefer, it’s color-matched with other Faber-Castell products like <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-Polychromos-Colored-Pencils/ct/4107">Polychromos Colored Pencils</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-Albrecht-Durer-Watercolor-Pencils/ct/5448">Albrecht Dürer Watercolor Pencils</a> for consistency in your multimedia projects.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Royal-Talens-Ecoline-Watercolor-Brush-Pens/ct/4166">Royal Talens Ecoline</a> is the best watercolor brush pen for art. Its soft felt tip puts down swaths of bright, juicy color with each stroke. This softness means that it takes some practice to learn how to control the Ecoline, but it makes such wonderful lines that it’s worth it for this excellent watercolor brush pen. The Ecoline contains highly <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Watercolor-Brush-Pens/pt/952">water-soluble ink</a> that blends easily and can continue to be layered and blended after it dries. We recommend pairing the Ecoline with thick <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Watercolor-Supplies/ct/2941?&amp;f=ca1f8d859dd3bdb2">watercolor paper</a> because heavy applications of ink can bleed through thinner papers.

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090">Uni Posca</a> is consistently one of the most popular <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Paint-Pens-For-Arts-and-Crafts/pt/917">paint pens</a> at JetPens, and for good reason. Its opaque, water-based ink writes on a wide variety of porous and nonporous surfaces, including paper, plastic, wood, and metal. This marker has intense color payoff and is easy to remove from nonporous surfaces like glass, which makes it great for window signs. It comes in several different tip sizes from <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=6c3e2810f75bf0d14191bd7ebbc0e799">extra fine</a> to <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=0405f6b2421bcd951f4737d59d8d7acd">broad</a>, and there’s even a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=7dd55fcb7563d511">brush version</a> for lettering and art.

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-One-Gel-Pens-Standard/ct/6100">Uni-ball One</a> might look simple, but it’s hands down the best gel pen for coloring. Its fast-drying, bleed-resistant ink is specially formulated with large pigment particles that stay on the surface of the paper instead of getting absorbed into the fibers. Dark inks look darker and bright inks look brighter, so your <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Coloring-Books/ct/3582">coloring books</a> will be packed with vibrant art. It comes in tons of different colors as well as three tip sizes, all of which are smooth to draw with. Its simple white barrel is accented by a detail near the clicker, which lets you know exactly what color is inside.
							</p><p>Fans of the Sarasa—another popular colored gel pen—can take a look at the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-R-Gel-Pens/ct/6253">Zebra Sarasa R</a>. Its ink has 27% more color density than standard Sarasa ink, so colors are more saturated.</p></div>

							If you want a simple effect that still grabs your attention, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Hybrid-Mattehop-Gel-Pens/ct/7072">Pentel Hybrid Mattehop</a> is the best matte gel pen for art. It features an opaque ink that dries to a matte, plastic-like finish. Our JetPens team members especially liked the way that the Mattehop performed on glossy papers, like those found in yearbooks. It even shows up on dark papers, so you can write over backgrounds without worry. However, we found that the gel pen does take a while to dry, so be careful not to smudge your writing.

							Just like its matte and metallic cousins, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Hybrid-Milky-Gel-Pens/ct/5645">Pentel Hybrid Milky</a> is packed with opaque ink that makes it the best pastel gel pen for art. We love its bold 0.8 mm tip, which puts down smooth lines that stand out on light and dark papers. The water-based ink is acid free, so you can rest assured that your projects won’t deteriorate over time.
							</p><p>The Hybrid Milky is also available in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Milky-Brush-Pens/ct/6696">brush pen</a> form. You can use it to create lettering with line variation, or to quickly fill in large areas with ink. </p>
						</div>
					
					<p>If the Hybrid Milky’s six colorful hues are a bit too vibrant for your taste, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Souffle-Gel-Pens/ct/445">Sakura Souffle</a> might be what you need. It comes in ten colors and has a unique ink with a three-dimensional effect! This finish isn’t as noticeable on porous surfaces like paper, so we recommend saving the Souffle for photos and glossy cards.</p>

We’ve covered full product lineups, written detailed product descriptions, created step-by-step how-tos, and made many other educational resources. </p>
					<p>The tests we use vary depending on the product type and how it’s likely to be used, but they often include qualities like smoothness, waterproofness, showthrough, vibrancy, and drying time. Be sure to read through the guides listed in each of our recommendation categories above to see specific test results.</p>

<p><span><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> – A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06825-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study published today</a> in the journal Nature offers an unprecedented view of previously unmapped industrial use of the ocean and how it is changing.</span></p>
<p><span>The groundbreaking study, led by Global Fishing Watch, uses machine learning and satellite imagery to create the first global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure, finding a remarkable amount of activity that was previously “dark” to public monitoring systems.</span></p>

<p><span><em>“A new industrial revolution has been emerging in our seas undetected—until now,”</em> said <strong>David Kroodsma, director of research and innovation at Global Fishing Watch</strong> and co-lead author of the study. <em>“On land, we have detailed maps of almost every road and building on the planet. In contrast, growth in our ocean has been largely hidden from public view. This study helps eliminate the blind spots and shed light on the breadth and intensity of human activity at sea.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Researchers from Global Fishing Watch, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Duke University, UC Santa Barbara and SkyTruth analyzed 2 million gigabytes of satellite imagery spanning 2017-2021 to detect vessels and offshore infrastructure in coastal waters across six continents where more than three-quarters of industrial activity is concentrated.</span></p>
<p><span>By synthesizing GPS data with five years of radar and optical imagery, the researchers were able to identify vessels that failed to broadcast their positions. Using machine learning, they then concluded which of those vessels were likely engaged in fishing activity.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Historically, vessel activity has been poorly documented, limiting our understanding of how the world’s largest public resource—the ocean—is being used,”</em> said <strong>co-lead author Fernando Paolo, senior machine learning engineer at Global Fishing Watch</strong>. <em>“By combining space technology with state-of-the-art machine learning, we mapped undisclosed industrial activity at sea on a scale never done before.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>While not all boats are legally required to broadcast their position, vessels absent from public monitoring systems, often termed “dark fleets,” pose major challenges for protecting and managing natural resources. Researchers found numerous dark fishing vessels inside many marine protected areas, and a high concentration of vessels in many countries’ waters that previously showed little-to-no vessel activity by public monitoring systems.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Publicly available data wrongly suggests that Asia and Europe have similar amounts of fishing within their borders, but our mapping reveals that Asia dominates—for every 10 fishing vessels we found on the water, seven were in Asia while only one was in Europe,”</em> said<strong> co-author Jennifer Raynor, assistant professor of natural resource economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison</strong>. <em>“By revealing dark vessels, we have created the most comprehensive public picture of global industrial fishing available.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The study also shows how human activity in the ocean is changing. Coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, fishing activity dropped globally by about 12 percent, with an 8 percent decline in China and a 14 percent drop elsewhere. In contrast, transport and energy vessel activity remained stable.</span></p>
<p><span>Offshore energy development surged during the study period. Oil structures increased by 16 percent, while wind turbines more than doubled. By 2021, turbines outnumbered oil platforms. China’s offshore wind energy had the most striking growth, increasing ninefold from 2017 to 2021.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39855"><img decoding="async" src="https://globalfishingwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/GFW-offshore-Infrastructure-global-map-animated_opt.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39855">Two million gigabytes of satellite imagery from 2017-2021 were analyzed to detect offshore infrastructure in coastal waters across six continents where more than three-quarters of industrial activity is concentrated. ⓒ 2023 Global Fishing Watch</figcaption></figure>
<p><span><em>“The footprint of the Anthropocene is no longer limited to terra firma,”</em> said <strong>co-author Patrick Halpin, professor of marine geospatial ecology at Duke University</strong>. <em>“Having a more complete view of ocean industrialization allows us to see new growth in offshore wind, aquaculture and mining that is rapidly being added to established industrial fishing, shipping and oil and gas activities. Our work reveals that the global ocean is a busy, crowded and complex industrial workspace of the growing blue economy.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The study highlights the potential of this new technology to tackle climate change. Mapping all vessel traffic will improve estimates of greenhouse gas emissions at sea, while maps of infrastructure can inform wind development or aid in tracking marine degradation caused by oil exploration.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Identifying offshore infrastructure is critical for understanding offshore energy development impacts and trends, and is crucial data for our work to detect marine pollution events and hold responsible parties to account,”</em> said <strong>co-author Christian Thomas, a geospatial engineer at SkyTruth</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The open data and technology used in the study can help governments, researchers and civil society to identify hotspots of potentially illegal activity, determine where industrial fishing vessels may be encroaching on artisanal fishing grounds, or simply better understand vessel traffic in their waters.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Previously, this type of satellite monitoring was only available to those who could pay for it. Now it is freely available to all nations,”</em> concluded <strong>Kroodsma</strong>. <em>“This study marks the beginning of a new era in ocean management and transparency.”</em></span></p>
<p><span>The study was made possible thanks to the generous support of Bloomberg Philanthropies, National Geographic Pristine Seas and Oceankind, and our technology partner, Google. As an <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/open-ocean-project/">awardee of The Audacious Project</a>, a collaborative funding initiative that is catalyzing social impact on a grand scale, Global Fishing Watch is able to further the application of this innovative work.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/january/giant-worm-fossils-.html">https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/january/giant-worm-fossils-.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38865924">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p property="description">Fossils of a new group of animal predators have been located in the Early Cambrian Sirius Passet fossil locality in North Greenland. These large worms may be some of the earliest carnivorous animals to have colonised the water column more than 518 million years ago, revealing a past dynasty of predators that scientists didn’t know existed.</p><div property="articleBody"><p>The new fossil animals have been named <em>Timorebestia</em>, meaning ‘terror beasts’ in Latin. Adorned with fins down the sides of their body, a distinct head with long antennae, massive jaw structures inside their mouth and growing to more than 30cm in length, these were some of the largest swimming animals in the Early Cambrian times.</p>
<p>“We have previously known that primitive arthropods were the dominant predators during the Cambrian, such as the bizarre-looking anomalocaridids,” said <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Jakob-Vinther-c20784b6-d4a2-4d48-849b-57f899bddaef/">Dr Jakob Vinther</a> from the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol’s</a> <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/">Schools of Earth Sciences</a>, a senior author on the study. “However, <em>Timorebestia</em> is a distant, but close, relative of living arrow worms, or chaetognaths. These are much smaller ocean predators today that feed on tiny zooplankton.</p>
<p>“Our research shows that these ancient ocean ecosystems were fairly complex with a food chain that allowed for several tiers of predators.</p>
<p>“<em>Timorebestia</em> were giants of their day and would have been close to the top of the food chain. That makes it equivalent in importance to some of the top carnivores in modern oceans, such as sharks and seals back in the Cambrian period.”</p>
<p>Inside the fossilised digestive system of <em>Timorebestia</em>, the researchers found remains of a common, swimming arthropod called <em>Isoxys</em>. “We can see these arthropods was a food source many other animals,” said Morten Lunde Nielsen, a former PhD student at Bristol and part of the current study. “They are very common at Sirius Passet and had long protective spines, pointing both forwards and backwards. However, they clearly didn’t completely succeed in avoiding that fate, because <em>Timorebestia</em> munched on them in great quantities.”</p>
<p>Arrow worms are one of the oldest animal fossils from the Cambrian. While arthropods appear in the fossil record about 521 to 529 million years ago, arrow worms can be traced back at least 538 million years back in time. Dr Vinther explained: “Both arrow worms, and the more primitive <em>Timorebestia</em>, were swimming predators. We can therefore surmise that in all likelihood they were the predators that dominated the oceans before arthropods took off. Perhaps they had a dynasty of about 10-15 million years before they got superseded by other, and more successful, groups.”</p>
<p>Luke Parry from Oxford University, who was part of the study, added “<em>Timorebestia</em> is a really significant find for understanding where these jawed predators came from.</p>
<p>"Today, arrow worms have menacing bristles on the outside of their heads for catching prey, whereas <em>Timorebestia </em>has jaws inside its head.</p>
<p>"This is what we see in microscopic jaw worms today—organisms that arrow worms shared an ancestor with over half a billion years ago. <em>Timorebestia </em>and other fossils like it provide links between closely related organisms that today look very different.”</p>
<p>“Our discovery firms up how arrow worms evolved,” added Tae Yoon Park from the Korean Polar Research Institute, senior author and field expedition leader. “Living arrow worms have a distinct nervous centre on their belly, called a ventral ganglion. It is entirely unique to these animals.</p>
<p>“We have found this preserved in <em>Timorebestia</em> and another fossil called <em>Amiskwia</em>. People have debated whether or not <em>Amiskwia</em> was closely related to arrow worms, as part of their evolutionary stem lineage. The preservation of these unique ventral ganglia gives us a great deal more confidence in this hypothesis.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to have discovered such unique predators in Sirius Passet. Over a series of expeditions to the very remote Sirius Passet in the furthest reaches of North Greenland more than 82,5˚ north, we have collected a great diversity of exciting new organisms. Thanks to the remarkable, exceptional preservation in Sirius Passet we can also reveal exciting anatomical details including their digestive system, muscle anatomy, and nervous systems.</p>
<p>“We have many more exciting findings to share in the coming years that will help show how the earliest animal ecosystems looked like and evolved,” Dr Park concluded.</p>

Appearing in the wake of the Z-Library shutdown late 2022, shadow library 'Anna's Archive' now bills itself as the "largest truly open library in human history." A complaint filed in December 2023 by the Italian Publishers Association, which represents publishers of books, scientific journals, and digital content, paints a somewhat different picture. As a result, telecoms regulator AGCOM has issued immediate blocking instructions to ISPs.

<p>In 2022, a platform called Pirate Library Mirror appeared on the scene, courting controversy right from the start after obtaining a full copy of Z-Library before the site’s legal troubles began.</p>
<p>“We deliberately violate the copyright law in most countries. This allows us to do something that legal entities cannot do: making sure books are mirrored far and wide,” the team behind ‘PiLiMi’ wrote.</p>
<p>In November 2022, PiLiMi team member ‘Anna Archivist’ founded ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=anna%27s+archive">Anna’s Archive</a>‘, a platform promising access to Z-Library and Libgen content from the same interface. Just over a year later, the site describes itself as the “largest truly open library in human history” mirroring Sci-Hub, Libgen, Z-Library, and other platforms, to offer 25.5 million books and 99.4 million papers for download.</p>
<h2>90% of Italian Publishing Market Behind Complaint</h2>
<p>Anna’s Archive is a relative newcomer to the world of online shadow libraries, but its impact has already ensured the inevitable. In common with its counterparts who are already blocked by ISPs in several countries, a year after its launch Anna’s Archive will receive the same treatment, starting in Italy.</p>
<p>On December 4, 2023, the Italian Publishers Association (AIE) filed a copyright complaint against Anna’s Archive. Founded in 1869, AIE represents publishers of books, scientific journals, and digital content; together, these companies control 90% of the local market. AIE’s complaint lists over 30 books, but the association stresses this represents just a sample of the content distributed by Anna’s Archive to which its members hold the rights.</p>
<center><em>A sample of books listed in the complaint</em><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png" alt="AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023" width="650" height="991" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png 710w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023-300x458.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20991'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png 710w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023-300x458.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AIE_Annas_Archive_Complaint_Dec_2023.png"></a></center>
<p>“The site annas-archive.org calls itself a mirror of various ‘shadow libraries’ and claims to have over 25 million books and nearly 100 million scholarly articles, which it makes available by disseminating numerous links to each work. Unauthorized reproductions of works belonging to Italian publishers number several thousand,” the complaint reads.</p>
<h2>Investigation Led to Ukraine</h2>
<p>An investigation by Italy’s Digital Services Directorate verified that the content listed in the complaint was actually accessible from Anna’s Archive. In view of the facts, that led investigators to believe that this was probably a case of “serious and massive infringement.”</p>
<p>Official papers indicate that the operator of Anna’s Archive proved “unidentifiable” but with assistance from Cloudflare, Epinatura LLC – a hosting provider in Kiev, Ukraine – was identified as the likely host of at least some of the platform’s servers. Notifications were sent to various service providers warning that “spontaneous compliance” with a blocking request filed by the publishers was a potential outcome.</p>
<h2>Decision: Site Must Be Blocked</h2>
<p>With no counterclaims received from the contacted parties and having determined mass infringement on the site, an order to disable https://annas-archive.org through a DNS block was issued to Italian ISPs, to be completed in 48 hours. Visitors to the site are now greeted by the blocking page below in Italian. <em>(translation on the right)</em></p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AGCOM_block_page_annas_archive.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AGCOM_block_page_annas_archive.png" alt="AGCOM_block_page_annas_archive" width="650" height="352" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20352'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/AGCOM_block_page_annas_archive.png"></a></center>
<p>While Anna’s Archive operates alternative domains that aren’t specifically mentioned in the order (annas-archive.gs, annas-archive.se), the site faces perpetual blocking measures against “all future domain names of the same site.”</p>
<p>If the shadow library wishes to challenge the decision, it has until the middle of February to file a response before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court. All things considered, that seems unlikely.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Ten years isn't long enough for maximum age settings</h2>

	<p><small>January  3, 2024</small></p>
</div><div><p>The recent news of the time interval is that <a href="https://mstdn.social/@jschauma/111688103150154714">a ten year certificate
built into every Keybase client expired at the end of 2023</a>. I had <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/111689032364322410">a little
reaction to this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>So much quiet damage has been done to so many people's pinned cert or
private CA deployments by ten-year defaults. So much.</p>

<p>(It happened to us so now our private OpenVPN CA root is much, much
longer.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're making an internal thing good for ten years, don't (whether
it is a TLS certificate or, for example, setting a retention duration
for some database). Ten years is either not long enough or too long.
If you're writing an example and use a ten year validity period,
please don't (people are sure to copy it). Ten years can sound like
an implausibly long time when you're setting something up, but as
we all know there's nothing quite as permanent as a quick hack and
there you are ten years later with some problems. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/FailingAtTLSRootRollover">This happened
to us with OpenVPN</a> and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/OpenVPNTLSRootExpirySolution">we failed to
find a solution</a>, to our pain.</p>

<p>If you don't have a plan to either roll over and renew whatever it
is or definitely take it out of service, ten years is far too short.
If you want to keep something active until you change your mind,
set your not-after date, retention duration, or whatever to as high
as you can. Ten years is a terrible value for this; it looks and
feels long enough but it isn't anywhere near sufficient.</p>

<p>(In some cases it may be a little bit of a problem that we're now
only fourteen years away from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">the year 2038 issue</a>. But if you have
a problem there, it's better to find out about it early.)</p>

<p>If you want to definitely take your thing out of service after a
certain period of time, ten years is far too long. If your thing
is still in use as ten years approaches, it's almost guaranteed to
have wormed its way into all sorts of places, so that taking it out
of service will cause explosions and the possibility of this will
get people to show up demanding that its lifetime be extended
(assuming that people even remember where it's used and what depends
on it).</p>

<p>If you have a plan to roll over, extend, or renew the duration, ten
years is also far too long. As everyone has found out through painful
experience with TLS certificates, doing something only once every
few years is a recipe for problems (and for forgetting that it needs
to be done at all). To make sure you keep in practice and the process
still works, you need to do this much more frequently than once
every ten years. At this point I'd probably try to do it twice a
year.</p>

<p>As it happens I'm not without sin, because the retention time for
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/PrometheusGrafanaSetup-2019">our Prometheus database</a> is currently
'3650 days' from late November 2018. We may well run out of disk
space before then and when we get there we may decide we don't need
ten years (or more than ten years) after all, but I should probably
bump that up anyway since our intention is 'keep as much as we have
disk space for and maybe get more disk space if we're running short'.
I should definitely have some sort of calendar entry for it, as a
reminder just in case.</p>

<p>(We do now check all of our long-lived internal TLS certificates
and alert if their expiry time is getting close. It's probably
overkill but it doesn't hurt. And some of them are less than a
decade away at this point.)</p>

<p>(This is related to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/NotForever">a much older discovery that '999 days' is not
forever</a>, and for that matter neither is 9999
days, although that's 27 years and change so it's closer. 99999
days is long enough for almost everyone to not worry about it,
though.)</p>
