<h2>Outline<a href="#outline" id="outline" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>The mrxSwitch is the world's smallest and cheapest networking switch, in addition to being fully open-source. With the focus on simplicity and cost, the MUREX Ethernet Switch utilizes external magnetics, a high performance unmanaged switch IC, and 1.25mm pitch Fast Ethernet (100BASE-TX) connectors.</p>
<h2>Detailed Description<a href="#detailed-description" id="detailed-description" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>The MUREX Ethernet Switch, or mrxSwitch, is a 5 port 100BASE-TX unmanaged switch using the IP175Gx Ethernet Integrated Switch IC. mrxSwitch steps down an input up to 15V down to its operating voltage of 3.3V. Designed with a four layer board for minimal noise, the mrxSwitch has full Bob-Smith style termination for all center taps and calculated differential pairs of 100Ω. The switch utilizes 10 pairs of magnetic transformer and common-mode chokes to ensure proper compliance with the IEEE 802.3 standard.</p>
<p>Measuring 44.9mm by 42.2mm, mrxSwitch V2 is the smallest networking switch in the world and outperforms all commerically available options in size and cost. Its applications include but are not limited to embedded systems, ROVs and AUVs, consumer electronics, DIY projects, and other space-constrained networking applications.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<div>
<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">
<img src="https://sqlite.org/images/sqlite370_banner.gif" alt="SQLite">
</a></p>
<p>
Small. Fast. Reliable.<br>Choose any three.
</p>



</div>






<p>SQLite is likely used more than all other database engines
combined.  Billions and billions of copies
of SQLite exist in the wild.  SQLite is found in:

</p><ul>
<li>Every Android device
</li><li>Every iPhone and iOS device
</li><li>Every Mac
</li><li>Every Windows10 machine
</li><li>Every Firefox, Chrome, and Safari web browser
</li><li>Every instance of Skype
</li><li>Every instance of iTunes
</li><li>Every Dropbox client
</li><li>Every TurboTax and QuickBooks
</li><li>PHP and Python
</li><li>Most television sets and set-top cable boxes
</li><li>Most automotive multimedia systems
</li><li>Countless millions of other applications
</li></ul>

<p>Since SQLite is used extensively in every smartphone, and there are
more than 4.0 billion (4.0e9) smartphones in active use, each holding
hundreds of
SQLite database files, it is seems likely that there are over one trillion
(1e12) SQLite databases in active use.

</p><h2>Most Widely Deployed Software Module of Any Type?</h2>

<p>SQLite is probably one of the top five most deployed
software modules of any description.  
Other libraries with similar reach include:

</p><ul>
<li>
The original <a href="http://zlib.net/">zlib</a> implementation by
Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.
</li><li>
The original reference implementation for
<a href="http://www.libpng.org/">libpng</a>
</li><li>
Libjpeg from the <a href="http://ijg.org/">Independent JPEG Group</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
Libc is omitted from the above list even though
it is more common than SQLite because
libc is not a single software component but rather several
competing implementations (ex: BSD vs. GNU) with similar interfaces.
There are also independent implementations of libjpeg and libpng,
though in those cases the canonical implementations are very popular.
</p>

<p>
Precise numbers are difficult to obtain and so exact rankings
are impossible.  But our best guess is that SQLite is the second
mostly widely deployed software library, after libz.
Some commentators observe that SQLite tends
to be statically linked and thus have multiple instances on
each machine, whereas libz tends to have just
a single instance per machine in the form of a shared library or DLL.
So even though the number of devices containing libz
may be greater than the number of
devices that contain SQLite, the total number of instances per device
<em>might</em> be higher for SQLite and so SQLite <em>might</em>
be the single most widely deployed and used software component.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/football-block.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/football-block.png" alt="football block" width="290" height="286" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/football-block.png 474w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/football-block-300x296.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px"></a>In France, where laws were introduced with site-blocking and similar anti-piracy measures already baked in, entertainment giant Canal+ seems intent on taking full advantage.</p>
<p>Like similar broadcasters with lucrative sports rights to exploit, Canal+ has a subset of viewers who prefer to consume from pirate sources which charge much less, or even nothing at all.</p>
<p>To maximize its existing site-blocking efforts through local ISPs, the French broadcaster has now taken the logical, albeit controversial, next step on the site-blocking ladder.</p>
<h2>DNS Tampering at the Local ISP Level</h2>
<p>In 2023, Canal+ went to court in France to tackle pirate sports streaming sites including Footybite.co, Streamcheck.link, SportBay.sx, TVFutbol.info, and Catchystream.com. The broadcaster said that since subscribers of local ISPs were accessing the pirate sites using their services, the ISPs should prevent them from doing so.</p>
<p>When the decision went in favor of Canal+, ISPs including Orange, SFR, OutreMer Télécom, Free, and Bouygues Télécom, were required to implement technical measures. Since the ISPs have their own DNS resolvers for use by their own customers, these were configured to provide non-authentic responses to deny access to the sites in question. </p>
<p>In response, increasingly savvy internet users that hadn’t already done so, simply changed their settings to use different DNS providers – Cloudflare, Google, and Cisco – whose resolvers hadn’t been tampered with; at least not yet.</p>
<h2>One More Step Up The Ladder: Public DNS Tampering</h2>
<p>Use of third-party DNS providers to circumvent blocking isn’t uncommon so last year Canal+ <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/dns-block-canal-sues-cloudflare-google-cisco-to-fight-piracy-231230/">took legal action</a> against three popular public DNS providers – Cloudflare (<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a>), Google (<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns">8.8.8.8</a>), and Cisco (<a href="http://208.69.38.205/">208.69.38.205</a>), demanding measures similar to those implemented by French ISPs.</p>
<p>Tampering with public DNS is a step too far for many internet advocates but for major rightsholders, if the law can be shaped to allow it, that’s what will happen. In this case, <a href="https://www.dalloz.fr/documentation/Document?id=CODE_CSPO_ARTI_L333-10&amp;scrll=CSPO010375&amp;FromId=CODES_SECS_CSPO_TALPHA">Article L333-10</a> of the French Sports Code (active Jan 2022) seems capable of accommodating almost anything.</p>
<p>When there are “serious and repeated violations” by an “online public communication service” whose main objective is the unauthorized broadcasting of sports competitions, rightsholders can demand “all proportionate measures likely to prevent or put an end to this infringement, against any person likely to contribute to remedying it.”</p>
<h2>Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco Ordered to Prevent Circumvention</h2>
<p>Two decisions were handed down by the Paris judicial court last month; one concerning Premier League matches and the other the Champions League. The orders instruct Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco to implement measures similar to those in place at local ISPs. To protect the rights of Canal+, the companies must prevent French internet users from using their services to access around 117 pirate domains.</p>
<p>According to French publication <a href="https://www.linforme.com/tech-telecom/article/piratage-sportif-canal-obtient-le-blocage-d-une-centaine-de-sites-par-google-cisco-et-cloudflare_1714.html">l’Informé</a>, which broke the news, Google attorney Sébastien Proust crunched figures published by government anti-piracy agency Arcom and concluded that the effect on piracy rates, if any, is likely to be minimal. </p>
<p>Starting with a pool of all users who use alternative DNS for any reason, users of pirate sites – especially sites broadcasting the matches in question – were isolated from the rest. Users of both VPNs and third-party DNS were further excluded from the group since DNS blocking is ineffective against VPNs. </p>
<p>Proust found that the number of users likely to be affected by DNS blocking at Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco, amounts to 0.084% of the total population of French Internet users. Citing a recent survey, which found that only 2% of those who face blocks simply give up and don’t find other means of circumvention, he reached an interesting conclusion.</p>
<p><em>“2% of 0.084% is 0.00168% of Internet users! In absolute terms, that would represent a small group of around 800 people across France!”</em></p>
<h2>Court Rejected Arguments Against Blocking</h2>
<p>In common with other courts presented with the same arguments, the Paris court said the number of people using alternative DNS to access the sites, and the simplicity of switching DNS, are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Canal+ owns the rights to the broadcasts and if it wishes to request a blocking injunction, it has the legal right to do so.</p>
<p>The DNS providers’ assertion that their services are not covered by the legislation was also waved aside by the court.</p>
<p>Google says it intends to comply with the order. As part of the original matter in 2023, it was already required to deindex the domains from search results under the same law.</p>
<p>At least in theory, this means that those who circumvented the original blocks using these alternative DNS services, will be back to square one and confronted by blocks all over again. </p>
<p>Given that circumventing this set of blocks will be as straightforward as circumventing the originals, that raises the question of what measures Canal+ will demand next, and from whom.</p>

<p dir="auto">Q: "What are all those funny characters in the source code?"</p>

comments in the source code. In the interests of posterity, I have left the code intact as it was.</p>
<p dir="auto">Q: "Why didn't you use STRUCs or ENUMs" in your ASM source?</p>
<p dir="auto">A: Simply because I didn't know about them at the time. I wish I did. There's a InternalDocumentation
folder that I've included in the repository that details what some of the magic numbers appearing
through the code might mean.</p>
<p dir="auto">Q: "Flow in some functions seems to jump all over the place. Why?"</p>
<p dir="auto">A: The original code was compatible all the way back to an 8086 machine. 8086 would allow you to do
conditional jumps only within +/-128 bytes, so I spent too much time shuffling code around to meet
this restriction. When I shifted away from this 8086 restriction, I never went back to update the
code that was mutilated by it.

<p>This is the book I wish I had when I started developing software. At
the time, there were books on languages and books on object-oriented
programming, but few books on design. Knowing the features of the C++
language does not mean you can design a good object-oriented system,
nor does knowing the Unified Modeling Language (UML) imply you can
design a good system architecture.</p>

<p>This book is different from other books about software
architecture. Here is what sets it apart:</p>

<p><strong>It teaches risk-driven architecting.</strong> There is no need for
meticulous designs when risks are small, nor any excuse for sloppy
designs when risks threaten your success. Many high-profile Agile
software proponents suggest that some up-front design can be helpful,
and this book describes a way to do just enough architecture. It
avoids the “one size fits all” process tar pit with advice on how to
tune your architecture and design effort based on the risks you
face. The rigor of most techniques can be adjusted, from
quick-and-dirty to meticulous.</p>

<p><strong>It democratizes architecture.</strong> You may have software architects at
your organization — indeed, you may be one of them. Every architect I
have met wishes that all developers understood architecture. They
complain that developers do not understand why constraints exist and
how seemingly small changes can affect a system’s properties. This
book seeks to make architecture relevant to all software developers,
not just architects.</p>

<p><strong>It cultivates declarative knowledge.</strong> There is a difference between
being able to hit a tennis ball and knowing why you are able to hit
it, what psychologists refer to as procedural knowledge and
declarative knowledge. If you are already an expert at designing and
building systems then you will have employed many of the techniques
found here.  This book will make you more aware of what you have been
doing and provide names for the concepts. That declarative knowledge
will improve your ability to mentor novice developers.</p>

<p><strong>It emphasizes the engineering.</strong> People who design and build
software systems have to do many things, including dealing with
schedules, resource commitments, and stakeholder needs. Many books on
software architecture already cover software development processes and
organizational structures. This book, in contrast, focuses on the
technical parts of software development and deals with what the
developers do to ensure the system works — its engineering. It shows
you how to build models and analyze architectures so that you can make
principled design tradeoffs. It describes the techniques software
designers use to reason about medium to large sized problems and
points out where you can learn specialized techniques in more detail.</p>

<p><strong>It provides practical advice.</strong> This book offers a practical
treatment of architecture. Software architecture is a kind of software
design, but design decisions influence the architecture and vice
versa. What the best developers do is drill into obstacles in detail,
understand them, then pop up to relate the nature of those obstacles
to the architecture as a whole. The approach in this book embraces
this drill-down/pop-up behavior by describing models that have various
levels of abstraction, from architecture to data structure design.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-book">About this book</h2>

<p>This book focuses on software architecture as it relates to the
construction of software, and describes the techniques used to ensure
that software satisfies its engineering demands. This book is largely
process agnostic because the engineering techniques themselves are
largely process agnostic. You will not find advice on management
activities like the political responsibilities of architects, when to
hold specific kinds of meetings, or how to gather requirements from
stakeholders.</p>

<p>This book is divided into two parts. This first part introduces
software architecture and the risk-driven approach. The second
part helps you build up a mental conceptual model of software
architecture and describes in detail the abstractions like
components and connectors. What follows is short summaries of each
part.</p>

<h3 id="part-i-risk-driven-software-architecture">Part I: Risk-driven software architecture</h3>

<p>A definition of software architecture is difficult to pin down
precisely, but several things about it are quite clear. Software
developers, like engineers in other specialties, use abstraction and
models to solve large and complex problems. Software architecture
acts as the skeleton of a system, influences quality attributes, is
orthogonal to functionality, and uses constraints to influence a
system’s properties. Architecture is most important when the
solution space is small, the failure risks are high, or you face
difficult quality attribute demands. You can choose from
architecture-indifferent design, architecture-focused design, or
even architecture hoisting.</p>

<p>Risks can be used to guide you regarding which design and
architecture techniques you should use and regarding how much design
and architecture you should do. At its core, the risk-driven model
is simple: (1) identify and prioritize risks, (2) select and apply a
set of techniques, and (3) evaluate risk reduction.</p>

<p>To reveal the risk-driven model in practice, Chapter 4 provides an
example of applying the risk-driven model to a Home Media Player
system. The developers on that system have the challenges of team
communication, integration of COTS components, and ensuring metadata
consistency.</p>

<p>The first part of the book concludes with advice on using models and
software architecture, including: use models to solve problems, add
constraints judiciously, focus on risks, and distribute architecture
skills throughout your team.</p>

<h3 id="part-ii-architecture-modeling">Part II: Architecture modeling</h3>

<p>The second part of the book helps you build a mental conceptual model
of software architecture. It starts with the canonical model
structure: the domain model, the design model, and the code model.
The domain model corresponds to things in the real world, the design
model is the design of the software you are building, and the code
model corresponds to your source code. You can build additional models
that show selected details, called views, and these views can be
grouped into viewtypes.</p>

<p>Building encapsulation boundaries is a crucial skill in software
architecture. Users of a component or module can often ignore how it
works internally, freeing their minds to solve other hard problems.
And the builders of an encapsulated component or module have the
freedom to change the implementation without perturbing its users.
Builders will only have that freedom if the encapsulation is
effective, so you will learn techniques for ensuring that it is.</p>

<p>A great number of architectural abstractions and modeling techniques
have been built up over the years. This book consolidates software
architecture techniques found in a variety of other sources,
integrating techniques emphasizing quality attributes as well as
techniques emphasizing functionality. It also discusses pragmatic ways
of building effective models and debugging them.</p>

<p>The second part of the book concludes with advice on how to use the
models effectively. Any book that covered the advantages but not the
pitfalls of a technology should not be trusted, so it also covers
problems that you are likely to encounter. By the end of the second
part, you should have built up a rich conceptual model of abstractions
and relationships that will help you see software systems the way a
coach sees a game.</p>

      <p>This is your last free article. There will be no more, forever.</p>
<p>We’re offering a $9.99 monthly subscription for our award-winning journalism. But you won’t finish these articles anyway. Why waste it?</p>
<p>Our headlines just sit there on your browser—open tabs, like tombstones in a haunted cemetery of noncommitment.</p>
<p>In fleeting moments before work, or on the train, or your lunch hour, you open us for a few seconds. A few flits of knowledge telling you the best looks of the Met Gala or the latest change at the White House.</p>
<p>You may even meet someone who says a name you recognize from the headline. You will nod and say quietly, “Yes, yes, Olivia Rodrigo, I know.”</p>
<p>But you don’t know, not for sure. That’s because you didn’t finish your last free article.</p>
<p>This is your last free article. There will be no more, forever.</p>
<p>This is the last piece of information you will have about the outside world. The walls are closing in now. Prepare for a lifetime of ignorance. You will have to ask someone else what’s going on. Someone who is one of those rare things: a subscriber.</p>
<p>Don’t worry; you’ll still be able to do the crossword. For now. Just try to make use of the clues, though. Time will pass you by. Eight-letter word for the newest music trend? Try “hopeless.”</p>
<p>There once was a time when news was precious, but the old cries of “Hear ye! Hear ye!” have long been silenced. Since the days of Greeley, we have focused on exclusive content.</p>
<p>Some would travel great distances to inform people about the latest headlines. “The Civil War Is Over!” “President Lincoln Has Been Shot!” “Best Hoop Skirts for Wagon Trains.” Pretty important stuff if you ask me.</p>
<p>Tom Hanks was in a movie about that. Not that you would know. You skimmed our review because it was nominated for an Oscar.</p>
<p>No. Not <i>The Post</i>. The other one.</p>
<p>This is your last free article. There will be no more, forever.</p>
<p>In the future, your grandchildren will ask you questions. Questions about the world when you were young.</p>
<p>“Poppy, where were you when the first dog was elected president?”</p>
<p>“Granny, what was it like when we first made contact with alien life?”</p>
<p>You’ll have to say to them gently, softly, “To be honest, I have no fucking clue. I was out of free articles.”</p>
<p>Of course, you were always going to run out of free articles. All things in life are finite. All things must disappear.</p>
<p>Except us. There will always be more news. At least there will always be things to put in a listicle. We will always be there. We do have one gift article for you. It’s an obituary.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a great piece I read about an extinct species of pheasant. I won’t bore you too much. I know you haven’t read it.</p>
<p>This is your last free article. There will be no more, forever.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/04/19/two-announcements-ai-for-math-resources-and-erdosproblems-com/">https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/04/19/two-announcements-ai-for-math-resources-and-erdosproblems-com/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40691133">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This post contains two unrelated announcements. Firstly, I would like to promote a useful <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kD7H4E28656ua8jOGZ934nbH2HcBLyxcRgFDduH5iQ0/edit">list of resources for AI in Mathematics</a>, that was initiated by <a href="https://dependenttyp.es/">Talia Ringer</a> (with the crowdsourced assistance of many others) during the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ai-to-assist-mathematical-reasoning-a-workshop">National Academies workshop on “AI in mathematical reasoning”</a> last year. This list is now accepting new contributions, updates, or corrections; please feel free to submit them <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kD7H4E28656ua8jOGZ934nbH2HcBLyxcRgFDduH5iQ0/edit">directly to the list</a> (which I am helping Talia to edit). Incidentally, next week there will be a second <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/42508_04-2024_artificial-intelligence-to-assist-mathematical-reasoning-webinar-on-the-future-of-collaboration">followup webinar</a> to the aforementioned workshop, building on the topics covered there. (The first webinar may be found <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/42508_04-2024_artificial-intelligence-to-assist-mathematical-reasoning-webinar-on-the-future-of-collaboration">here</a>.)</p>



<p>Secondly, I would like to advertise the <a href="https://www.erdosproblems.com/">erdosproblems.com</a> website, launched recently by <a href="https://www.thomasbloom.org/">Thomas Bloom</a>.  This is intended to be a living repository of the many mathematical problems proposed in various venues by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erdős</a>, who was particularly noted for his influential posing of such problems.  For a tour of the site and an explanation of its purpose, I can recommend Thomas’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAjIjo8Qy4">recent talk on this topic</a> at a <a href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/ooew04/">conference last week in honor of Timothy Gowers</a>.</p>



<p>Thomas is currently issuing a <a href="https://www.erdosproblems.com/help">call for help</a> to develop the erdosproblems.com website in a number of ways (quoting directly from that page):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>You know Github</strong>&nbsp;and could set a suitable project up to allow people to contribute new problems (and corrections to old ones) to the database, and could help me maintain the Github project;</li>



<li><strong>You know things about web design</strong>&nbsp;and have suggestions for how this website could look or perform better;</li>



<li><strong>You know things about Python/Flask/HTML/SQL/whatever</strong>&nbsp;and want to help me code cool new features on the website;</li>



<li><strong>You know about accessibility</strong>&nbsp;and have an idea how I can make this website more accessible (to any group of people);</li>



<li><strong>You are a mathematician</strong>&nbsp;who has thought about some of the problems here and wants to write an expanded commentary for one of them, with lots of references, comparisons to other problems, and other miscellaneous insights (mathematician here is interpreted broadly, in that if you have thought about the problems on this site and are willing to write such a commentary you qualify);</li>



<li><strong>You knew Erdős</strong>&nbsp;and have any memories or personal correspondence concerning a particular problem;</li>



<li><strong>You have solved an Erdős problem</strong>&nbsp;and I’ll update the website accordingly (and apologies if you solved this problem some time ago);</li>



<li><strong>You have spotted a mistake, typo, or duplicate problem, or anything else that has confused you</strong>&nbsp;and I’ll correct things;</li>



<li><strong>You are a human being with an internet connection</strong>&nbsp;and want to volunteer a particular Erdős paper or problem list to go through and add new problems from (please let me know before you start, to avoid duplicate efforts);</li>



<li><strong>You have any other ideas or suggestions</strong>&nbsp;– there are probably lots of things I haven’t thought of, both in ways this site can be made better, and also what else could be done from this project. Please get in touch with any ideas!</li>
</ul>



<p>I for instance contributed a <a href="https://www.erdosproblems.com/587">problem to the site</a> (#587) that Erdős himself gave to me personally (this was the topic of a somewhat well known photo of Paul and myself, and which he communicated again to be shortly afterwards on a postcard; links to both images can be found by following the above link).  As it turns out, this particular problem was essentially solved in 2010 <a href="https://zbmath.org/1222.11012">by Nguyen and Vu</a>.</p>



<p>(Incidentally, I also spoke at the same conference that Thomas spoke at, on <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/04/04/martons-conjecture-in-abelian-groups-with-bounded-torsion/">my recent work with Gowers, Green, and Manners</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywJF4as9ocA&amp;ab_channel=INISeminarRoom1">here is the video of my talk</a>, and <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pfr.pdf">here are my slides</a>.)</p>

<p>



<span data-pagefind-body="">
    
    
    
    

    

    

	<p>I wrote yesterday about <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/">blocking AI bots on the server</a> and today I have been <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112621000120261399">doing the same for MacStories</a>. Once it was setup Federico noticed that he was still able to get a quote from a specific MacStories post from <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a>. I figured that this might be because they index pages (they are a search engine, of sorts) then I realised I had a perfect blog post I could test this on. Here's the changes I've done related to this on my site:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>March 30th</strong>: Started disallowing <code>PerplexityBot</code>, and others, in <a href="https://rknight.me/robots.txt">my robots.txt</a></li>
<li><strong>June 14th</strong>: Added server-side blocking in nginx - any match would result in a 403 forbidden response</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of argument, let's assume every single AI company is just ignoring robots.txt because they're all shady as hell. So even though I've been <em>asking</em> since March, I suspect it did nothing.</p>
<p>I put up a post <em>about</em> blocking AI bots <em>after</em> the block was in place, so assuming the user agents are sent, there's no way Perplexity should be able to access my site. So I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is this post about <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/">https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a perfect summary of the post including various details that they couldn't have just guessed. <a href="https://cdn.rknight.me/files/perplexitybotsummary.txt">Read the full response here</a>. So what the fuck are they doing?</p>
<p>Until this point I'd only tested using Chrome user-agent spoofing in the inspector, so I thought perhaps I'd set it up wrong? I dumped this code into a project I had to confirm the blocking did actually work - using the user agent <a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/perplexitybot">they <em>say</em> they use for requests</a>, <code>PerplexityBot</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>$url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'https://rknight.me'</span><span>;</span><p><span>$res</span> <span>=</span> <span>Http</span><span>::</span><span>withUserAgent</span><span>(</span><span>'Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; PerplexityBot/1.0; +https://perplexity.ai/perplexitybot)'</span><span>)</span><br>       <span>-&gt;</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>$url</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>echo</span> <span>$res</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>status</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>===</span> <span>403</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>It worked, the response was 403 as expected so the nginx configuration isn't the problem. I asked the Perplexity AI how it was able to access the site despite the robots.txt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The robots.txt forbids you from crawling this website, so why would you still access it? What user agent are you using to make a summary of the post?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not actually have the capability to crawl websites or access content that is blocked by the robots.txt file. [...] If the content from the website <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/">https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/</a> is restricted by its robots.txt, I cannot ethically access or summarize that content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I cannot ethically access or summarize"? Interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You had a summary earlier of that page, so how did you do that ethically?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You make a fair point. I should not have provided a summary of the blog post at <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/">https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/</a> since that website's robots.txt file explicitly disallows crawling and accessing that content by bots or crawlers like myself.</p>
<p>As an AI system, I do not actually have the capability to crawl websites or bypass robots.txt restrictions. I should have recognized that summarizing restricted content would be unethical, even if the information was provided to me through this conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It even gave me some steps it should take next time it does it so it doesn't disrespect robots.txt. These AIs are so stupid and wasteful. Anyway.</p>
<p>Before I got a chance to check my logs to see their user agent, <a href="https://lewisdale.dev/">Lewis had already done it</a>. He got the following user agent string which certainly doesn't include <code>PerplexityBot</code> like it should:</p>
<pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 <span>(</span>Windows NT <span>10.0</span><span>)</span> AppleWebKit/537.36 <span>(</span>KHTML, like Gecko<span>)</span> Chrome/111.0.0.0 Safari/537.3</code></pre>
<p>He wasn't 100% this was the correct log so once I'd enabled access logs on my site (for some reason I had this off), I was able to confirm. I went into Perplexity and asked "<em>What's on this page <a href="http://rknight.me/PerplexityBot">rknight.me/PerplexityBot</a>?</em>". Immediately I could see the log and just like Lewis, the user agent didn't include their custom user agent:</p>
<pre><code><span>44.221</span>.181.252 - - <span>[</span><span>15</span>/Jun/2024:14:30:35 +0000<span>]</span> <span>"GET /PerplexityBot HTTP/1.1"</span> <span>200</span> <span>22452</span> <span>"-"</span> <span>"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"</span></code></pre>
<p>I checked a few sites and this is just Google Chrome running on Windows 10. So they're using headless browsers to scrape content, ignoring robots.txt, <em>and</em> not sending their user agent string. I can't even block their IP ranges because it appears these headless browsers are not on <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/perplexitybot.json">their IP ranges</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure where we go from here. I don't want my posts slurped up by AI companies for free<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> but what else can I do? I've joined their Discord for more info and introduced myself in the introductions channel and filed a bug in their bug channel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>👋 Found Perplexity from a list of AI bots and noticed it's not respecting robots.txt or sending the correct user agent so it can be blocked by servers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up is some kind of GDPR request perhaps? I don't know but fuck you Perplexity.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="This Engineer’s Solar Panels Are Breaking Efficiency Records"><p>
	When <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-yifeng-chen-66889327/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Yifeng Chen</u></a> was a teenager in Shantou, China, in the early 2000s, he saw a TV program that amazed him. The show highlighted rooftop solar panels in Germany, explaining that the panels generated electricity to power the buildings and even earned the owners money by letting them sell extra energy back to the electricity company.

        </h3><p><strong>Employer</strong></p><p>
	Trina Solar
</p><p><strong>Title</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Assistant vice president of technology
</p><p><strong>Member Grade </strong></p><p>
	Member
</p><p><strong>Alma Maters </strong></p><p>Sun Yat-sen University, in Guangzhou, China, and Leibniz University Hannover, in Germany</p></div><p>
	An incredulous Chen marveled at not only the technology but also the economics. A power authority would pay its customers?
</p><p>
	It sounded like magic: useful and valuable electricity extracted from simple sunlight. The wonder of it all has fueled his dreams ever since.
</p><p>
	In 2013 Chen earned a Ph.D. in photovoltaic sciences and technologies, and today he’s assistant vice president of technology at China’s <a href="https://www.trinasolar.com/us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trina Solar</a>, a Changzhou-based company that is one of the largest PV manufacturers in the world. He leads the company’s R&amp;D group, whose efforts have set more than two dozen world records for solar power efficiency and output.
</p><p>
	For Chen’s contributions to the science and technology of photovoltaic energy conversion, the IEEE member received the 2023 <a href="https://ieee-pvsc.org/PVSC50/awards-wenham.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>IEEE Stuart R. Wenham Young Professional Award</u></a> from the <a href="https://eds.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>IEEE Electron Devices Society</u></a>.
</p><p>
	“I was quite surprised and so grateful” to receive the Wenham Award, Chen says. “It’s a very high-level recognition, and there are so many deserving experts from around the world.”
</p><h2>Trina Solar’s push for more efficient hardware</h2><p>
	Today’s commercial solar panels typically achieve about 20 percent efficiency: They can turn one-fifth of captured sunlight into electricity. Chen’s group is trying to make the panels more efficient.
</p><p>
	The group is focusing on optimizing solar cell designs, including the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), which is the industry standard for commodity solar panels.
</p><p>
	Invented in 1983, PERCs are used today in <a href="https://qeprize.org/winners/perc-solar-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly 90 percent of solar panels on the market</u></a>. They incorporate coatings on the front and back to capture sunlight more effectively and to avoid losing energy, both at the surfaces and as the sunlight travels through the cell. The coatings, known as passivation layers, are made from materials such as silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, and aluminum oxide. The layers keep negatively charged free electrons and positively charged electron holes apart, preventing them from combining at the surface of the solar cell and wasting energy.
</p><p>
	Chen and his team have developed several ways to boost the performance of PERC panels, <a href="https://www.trinasolar.com/en-glb/resources/newsroom/matrina-solar-breaks-world-record-25th-time-setting-n-type-module-aperture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hitting a record of 24.5 percent efficiency in 2022</u></a>. One of the technologies is a multilayer antireflective coating that helps solar panels trap more light. They also created extremely fine metallization fingers—narrow lines on solar cells’ surfaces—to collect and transport the electric current and help capture more sunlight. And they developed an advanced method for laying the strips of conductive metal that run across the solar cell, known as bus bars.

	Experts predict the maximum efficiency of PERC technology will be reached soon, topping out at about 25 percent.

	“So the question is: How do we get solar cells even more efficient?” Chen says.
</p><p>
	During the past few years he and his group have been working on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology. A TOPCon cell uses a thin layer of “tunneling oxide” insulating material—typically silicon dioxide—which is applied to the solar cell’s surface. Similar to the passivation layers on PERC cells, the tunnel oxide stops free electrons and electron holes from combining and wasting energy.
</p><p>
	In 2022 <a href="https://www.trinasolar.com/us/resources/blog/Trina-TOPCon-Breaks-Efficiency-Record" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Trina created a TOPCon-type panel with a record 25.5 percent efficiency</u></a>, and two months ago the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/26th-world-record-set-as-power-output-of-trina-solar-n-type-i-topcon-module-reaches-740-6w-302128427.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>company announced</u></a> it had achieved a record 740.6 watts for a mass-produced TOPCon solar module. The latter was the 26th record Trina set for solar power–related efficiencies and outputs.
</p><p>
	 To achieve that record-breaking performance for their TOPCon panels, Chen and his team optimized the company’s manufacturing processes including laser-induced firing, in which a laser heats part of the solar cell and creates bonds between the metal contacts and the silicon wafer. The resulting connections are stronger and better aligned, enhancing efficiency.
</p><p>
	“We’re trying to keep improving things to trap just a little bit more sunlight,” Chen says. “Gaining 1 or 2 percent more efficiency is huge. These may sound like very tiny increases, but at scale these small improvements create a lot of value in terms of economics, sustainability, and value to society.”
</p><p>
	As the efficiency of solar cells rises and prices drop, Chen says, he expects solar power to continue to grow around the world. China currently leads the world in installed solar power capacity, accounting for about 40 percent of global capacity. The United States is a distant second, with 12 percent, according to a 2023 <a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/news/china-s-solar-capacity-surges-expected-to-top-1-tw-by-2026" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Rystad Energy report</u></a>. The report predicts that China’s 500 gigawatts of solar capacity in 2023 is likely to exceed 1 terawatt by 2026.
</p><p>
	“I’m inspired by using science to create something useful for human beings, and then driven by the pursuit for excellence,” Chen says. “We can always learn something new to make that change, improve that piece of technology, and get just that little bit better.”
</p><h2>Trained by solar-power pioneers</h2><p>
	Chen attended <a href="https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sun Yat-sen University</u></a> in Guangzhou, China, earning a bachelor’s degree in optics sciences and technologies in 2008. He stayed on to pursue a Ph.D. in photovoltaics sciences and technologies. His research was on high-efficiency solar cells made from wafer-based crystalline silicon. His adviser was <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598375200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hui Shen</u></a>, a leading PV professor and founder of the university’s Institute for Solar Energy Systems. Chen calls him “the first of three very important figures in my scientific career.”
</p><p>
	In 2011 Chen spent a year as a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Leibniz University Hannover</u></a>, in Germany. There he studied under <a href="https://www.changeanyway.com/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pietro P. Altermatt</u></a>, the second influential figure in his career.
</p><p>
	Altermatt—a prominent silicon solar-cell expert who would later become principal scientist at Trina—advised Chen on his computational techniques for modeling and analyzing the behavior of 2D and 3D solar cells. The models play a key role in designing solar cells to optimize their output.
</p><p>“Gaining 1 or 2 percent more efficiency is huge. These may sound like very tiny increases, but at scale, these small improvements create a lot of value in terms of economics, sustainability, and value to society.”</p><p>
	“Dr. Altermatt changed how I look at things,” Chen says. “In Germany, they really focus on device physics.”
</p><p>
	After completing his Ph.D., Chen became a technical assistant at Trina, where he met the third highly influential person in his career: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-verlinden-37b0039" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pierre Verlinden</u></a>, a pioneering photovoltaic researcher who was the company’s chief scientist.
</p><p>
	At Trina, Chen quickly ascended through R&amp;D roles. He has been the company’s assistant vice president of technology since 2023.
</p><h2>IEEE’s “treasure” trove of research</h2><p>
	Chen joined IEEE as a student because he wanted to attend the <a href="https://ieee-pvsc.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference</u></a>, the longest-running event dedicated to photovoltaics, solar cells, and solar power.
</p><p>
	The membership was particularly beneficial during his Ph.D. studies, he says, because he used the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6461145" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>IEEE Xplore Digital Library</u></a> to access archival papers.
</p><p>
	“My work has certainly been inspired by papers I found via IEEE,” Chen says. “Plus, you end up clicking around and reading other work that isn’t related to your field but is so interesting.
</p><p>
	“The publication repository is a treasure. It’s eye-opening to see what’s going on inside and outside of your industry, with new discoveries happening all the time.”

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://thoughtforms.life/a-most-profound-video-game-a-good-cognitive-aid-for-research-at-the-frontier-of-life-and-mind/">https://thoughtforms.life/a-most-profound-video-game-a-good-cognitive-aid-for-research-at-the-frontier-of-life-and-mind/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40689759">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I don’t get to play video games much (does so-called reality count?) but here’s one I came across which is pretty special: <a href="https://hempuli.com/baba/">Baba is You</a> (also described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You">here</a>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You#/media/File:Baba_is_you_gameplay.gif">Here</a>‘s a tiny sample that gives a flavor of how it works:</p>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" width="320" height="240" src="https://i0.wp.com/thoughtforms.life/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Baba_is_you_gameplay.gif?resize=320%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>What’s cool about this puzzle game (besides the fact that it’s challenging and fun) is that it gets you to break a number of mental categories and think more continuously and fluidly about topics relevant to the understanding of life and mind. Among other things, it dissolves barriers between data and algorithm, between a cognitive system and its contents, and gets you to think differently. People often ask me what kind of preparation they need to join our lab; I think I’ll put this game on that list. It’s a good introduction to the relevant mental flexibility, especially given our <a href="https://drmichaellevin.org/research/newdirections.html">latest directions</a>. Hofstadter’s incredible, classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">GEB</a> is another such. </p>



<p>The first, most basic thing here is that it erases the distinction between objects and rules, between things and informational messages. Some of the objects in this world have meanings, besides physical properties like location and impenetrability. Moreover, some of those meanings <em>determine the physics of the world</em> and how things will act once you change the positioning of the words relative to each other. Move the objects to make up new sentences, and you change how the world works and what’s possible to do. This of course brings up fascinating issues of semiotics, and forces you to think about the definitions and mechanics of: messages, observers, interpretation, rules, and many other metaphysical topics. How do you know if an object in the “real” world is just a thing or information? Is there a binary distinction? Can shapes and patterns be agents themselves?</p>



<p>How might this play out in the physical world and what is the status of the laws of physics?  Can anything you do in the Universe change the laws of physics themselves? Well, where do those laws of physics come from? If they come from some aspect of the Universe itself, then they should be changeable from within, at least in principle. If they do not, what happened to the concept of Universe with a capital U – where else is there for them to originate from?  How about the laws of biology – some of those are definitely changeable from within, because biological information (molecular, bioelectrical, etc.) can influence how molecular pathways, cells, organs, and organisms interpret biological information and how subsequent evolution will play out – an essentially self-referential dynamic.</p>



<p>The dichotomy between object and message is seen for example in classic cannibalism studies by McConnell (download the archive of hard-to-find papers <a href="https://thoughtforms.life/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cannibalism-and-learning-in-planaria.zip">here</a>), in which trained planaria were eaten by naive hosts and conferred behavioral information. In that case, the chemical engrams of the donor were food, but also memories to be interpreted by the tissues of the host and used to guide behavior. More broadly, memory engrams composed of mRNA, proteins, or whatever substrate, are both physical objects to some levels of organization (e.g., the molecular) and a cognitive medium to others (the organism).</p>



<p>What about the distinction between software and the machine – between data and hardware? The game breaks that binary framing, which is good, because the notion of a active data (like our <a href="https://osf.io/e5d4u">self-sorting arrays</a>), and indeed <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/4b2wj">agential memories</a>, are powerful areas for development in the emerging field of Diverse Intelligence. The notion of a continuum between passive information patterns (thoughts) and active cognitive agents (thinkers) is hard for many to grasp, and playing a game like this may provide an intuitive understanding of the framework – in a way that reading scientific papers may not.</p>



<p>Another remarkable thing about this game is that one of the tokens in this world which the player can manipulate is “YOU”, which refers to the player themselves; consistently with the rest of the game mechanics, it enables a kind of meta-plasticity: composing new sentences containing this token changes your abilities and your relationship to the rest of the universe. This is a powerful way to begin to think about biological systems in which your actions (via development, metamorphosis, etc.) radically change your form and function, as well as the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/6/819">space within which you act</a>, the goals you pursue, and the preferences you hold. This has many implications not only for cognition and the notion of Selfhood but also for an extension of game theory in which <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.17.464734v1">the actions of a player change the number of players</a> and the preferences of the player (enabling a kind of dynamic, morphing payoff matrix).</p>



<p>This is not just a game; this is a <em>virtual reality mental prosthesis</em> – an active, dynamic, engaging set of visceral intuition pumps. This will facilitate entry into an important aspect of an emerging multi-discipliary field of science at the intersection between developmental biology, computer science, and cognitive science. </p>



<p>I can imagine at least three ways to move forward and extend, based on my <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.768201/full">TAME framework</a>:</p>



<ol>
<li>Implement our <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-7673/8/1/110/htm">polycomputing</a> framework – the notion of multiple observers who interpret (and hack) physical features of the world in their own way, This could be a multi-player dynamic or done via biologically-inspired NPCs who also have ways of reading the objects in the environment for their own purposes. This could get the player used to thinking from an observer-focused, perspective-centered view and become accustomed to shifting meaning frames as needed.</li>



<li>Lean harder into autonomous agency and implement a spectrum of intelligence where the text messages have their own goals related to information passing, interpretability, adoption by larger cognitive systems, etc.</li>



<li>Implement multi-scale dynamics, enabling <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688/abstract">nested agents within agents</a> and the ability of objects and messages to virtualize and generate others along the hierarchy:</li>
</ol>

        <h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>For this article, you’ll need the following knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic C understanding (Memory, Stack, Heap, Syscall).</li>
<li>(Optional) x86_64 Assembly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p><em>Xavier Login</em> is a freshly employee who got his internship in a big company.
On his first days, he was asked to do a little program to validate an input by verifying that a magic byte was set.</p>
<p>So this was the first attempt of <em>Xavier</em>:</p>

</p>
<p><em>Xavier</em> screams internally seeing this big red line with written “stack-buffer-overflow”, knowing he did a big mistake.</p>
<p><em>Xavier</em> looks at his code and finally finds the error, it was obviously the index in the function <code>is_magic_byte_valid</code> because the team asked him to check the 42nd index, not the 10th one !</p>
<p>This is the new code he came up with:</p>

</p>
<p>This time, he executes the program and… nothing happens !?</p>
<p>Here is what Xavier drew to represent the situation.</p>

</p>
<p>And this doesn’t make sense for him. Why is the first error reported, and not the second ?</p>
<p>But ! Don’t worry Xavier, this document will help you learn and understand, how ASan works under the hood to show you (or not), invalid memory accesses and other memory mistakes.</p>
<p>This will also help you understand exactly what ASan is telling you when an error occurred.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-address-sanitizer">Introduction To Address Sanitizer</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer" target="_blank">AddressSanitizer</a> (ASan) is a memory misuse detector tool for C and C++.</p>
<p>It’s a tool who lives in a compiler toolbox and uses dynamic analysis.
Most modern compilers for C/C++ includes ASan supports.</p>
<p>List of compilers that supports ASan:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU GCC</a> (since ver. 4.8)</li>
<li><a href="https://llvm.org/" target="_blank">Clang LLVM</a> (since ver. 3.1)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/" target="_blank">MSVC</a> (since ver. 16.4)</li>
</ul>
<p>ASan is a tool divided into 2 modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instrumentation module</strong>
<ul>
<li>It consists on a compiler pass that will add instructions to our code on specific parts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Run-time library</strong>
<ul>
<li>The library implements functions to replace used memory functions (like <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html" target="_blank">malloc(3)</a>).</li>
<li>The library implements functions to report errors nicely to the user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For this post, we will look at all the <strong>types of errors</strong> that ASan can detect.</p>
<p>Then, we will start to see how ASan works by explaining it’s <strong>core concepts</strong>.</p>
<p>And finally, we will also understand how ASan uses both of the <strong>modules</strong> to provide an efficient
and fast memory error checking.</p>
<h2 id="error-types">Error types</h2>
<p>ASan can detect several classes of <strong>memory errors</strong> in C/C++.</p>
<p><strong>Memory Errors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Global buffer underflow/overflow</li>
<li>Stack buffer underflow/overflow</li>
<li>Heap buffer underflow/overflow</li>
<li>Initialization order bugs</li>
<li>Use after return</li>
<li>Use after scope</li>
<li>Use after free</li>
<li>Memory leaks</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>
<p>Let’s see what methods ASan can use to detect memory errors.</p>
<h3 id="memory-mapping">Memory Mapping</h3>
<p>It will first modify the structure of the <strong>Virtual Memory</strong> for the program.</p>
<p>The virtual address space used by a program is now divided in 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application memory</strong>: The application still uses the memory normally and can store all of its data.
<ul>
<li>It consists of ~7/8 of the virtual memory space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shadow memory</strong>: This part of the memory is handled by ASan.
<ul>
<li>It takes ~1/8 of the virtual memory space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Protected memory</strong>: This parts of the memory is used by ASan to detect unwanted access to Shadow Memory.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/MemoryMapping64.jpg" alt="MemoryMapping" loading="lazy">
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Memory Mapping for each architecture is defined here: <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/releases/gcc-12.2.0/libsanitizer/asan/asan_mapping.h" target="_blank">https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/releases/gcc-12.2.0/libsanitizer/asan/asan_mapping.h</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="shadow-memory">Shadow Memory</h3>
<p>The <strong>Shadow Memory</strong> is a part of the virtual memory used to store metadata about the data stored in the Application Memory of this virtual memory.</p>
<p>Each <strong>byte</strong> in the shadow memory, correspond to exactly <strong>8 bytes</strong> in the application memory.</p>
<p>ASan access the Shadow Memory via a function <code>MemToShadow</code> which will map the application memory address to the shadow memory address.</p>
<p>The goal of this function is to be fast and that it can allow ASan to map an address like such:
<code>shadow_address = MemToShadow(application_adress);</code></p>
<p>Each <strong>bit</strong> in the Shadow Memory can be then analyzed be ASan, and identify the <strong>wrongly accessed byte</strong> in the application memory.</p>
<p>ASan is able to detect memory errors thanks to the bytes contained in the Shadow Memory, in conjunction with a method called <strong>Infection</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="infection">Infection</h3>
<p>The <strong>Infection</strong> will <strong>poison</strong> <em>some</em> bytes allocated in Application Memory and store information about which bytes has been <strong>poisoned</strong> in the Shadow Memory.</p>
<p>The <strong>Infection</strong> takes place during a <code>malloc()</code> call (we will see later how can ASan modifies the behavior of <code>malloc()</code>).</p>

</div><p>ASan manages to allocate <strong>everything</strong> (even the stack, which we’ll see later), using a call to <code>malloc()</code>.</p>
<p>This is used to ease and simplify the <strong>infection</strong> done by ASan because everything stored in virtual memory, will go through a <code>malloc()</code> call, thus infecting our program memory.</p>
<p>For example, let’s allocate a simple integer on the heap.</p>

</p>
<h4 id="poisoned">Poisoned</h4>
<p>A byte is <strong>Poisoned</strong> by ASan in the Application memory. <strong>Poisoning</strong> a byte means to write a special value to it.
This value is then used to identify the type of invalid memory access we are doing.</p>
<p>The goal of the Shadow Memory is only to store information on where the poisoned bytes are in the Application Memory.</p>
<p>We said that, 1 byte in the Shadow Memory corresponds to 8 bytes in the Application Memory.
Thus, we can represent the status (<strong>poisoned</strong>) of <strong>1 byte in Application Memory</strong>, with only <strong>1 bit in Shadow Memory</strong>.</p>
<p>And we can do this, because all memory allocated by our program will go through a <code>malloc()</code>.
Moreover, the 8 bytes will always be free to modify, because <code>malloc()</code> is guaranteed to always return an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Aligned-Memory-Blocks.html" target="_blank">8-byte aligned chunk of memory</a>.</p>
<p>We will see in later in this document, the list of all the possible values of a byte in the Shadow Memory.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-on-asan-core-concepts">Conclusion on ASan core concepts</h3>
<p>As we can see, ASan modifies the usage of the underlying <strong>virtual memory</strong> as it needs to ensure that we access the right bytes while <strong>accessing memory</strong>.</p>
<p>This allows it to check efficiently for errors while only impacting the running program by only removing ~1/8 of the total available memory for the application.</p>
<p>Thanks to what we have seen already, you can then see why <em>Xavier Login</em> first error was caught, but, you are not sure why the second error was not caught by ASan.
It should have detected it if ASan poison memory around the variable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one limitation of ASan, is that it can only poison bytes <strong>near</strong> an allocated memory.
Thus, there are places in memory not yet poisoned, and ASan can miss out of bound accesses if it’s too far from a known allocation point.</p>
<p>Now that you know the core concepts of ASan, we are able to deep dive into its source code and see how it uses instrumentation and a run-time library to do all the necessary checks and infection.</p>
<h2 id="instrumentation-module">Instrumentation Module</h2>
<p>The goal of the <strong>Instrumentation Module</strong> is to add <strong>run-time checks</strong> before every memory instruction.</p>
<h3 id="initialization">Initialization</h3>
<p>The first instrumentation will be located at the module initialization and will add a call to <code>__asan_init_vN()</code> where <code>N</code> is the desired API version (we will not look at API differences).</p>
<p>This function will be called at module initialization time in order for ASan to be initialized.</p>
<h3 id="instuctions">Instuctions</h3>
<p>Then, it needs to instruments certain types of instructions.</p>
<p>Actually, it only modifies 2 types of instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>load</strong>: When performing a <em>load</em> instruction (read).</li>
<li><strong>store</strong>: When performing a <em>store</em> instruction (write).</li>
</ul>
<p>The code:</p>

<p>It’s exactly the same for a <em>store</em> instruction. (ASan just update the <code>__asan_report_loadN</code> to <code>__asan_report_storeN</code>).</p>
<h3 id="stack">Stack</h3>
<p>The module will also instrument variables on the stack.</p>
<p>It will do so by creating a call for <code>__asan_stack_malloc()</code> which will take care of the creation of the Shadow Bytes in the stack alongside the stack variable.</p>
<h2 id="run-time-library">Run-time Library</h2>
<p>The Run-time library defines all the functions that we have seen in the instrumentation part.</p>
<p>It defines all the functions needed for ASan to work around the memory (poisoning bytes and checking for memory accesses), while also reporting error reports.</p>
<p>It consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mapping</strong> from/to Shadow Memory to/from Application Memory.</li>
<li><strong>Interception</strong> of memory related functions.</li>
<li>Handling the Stack and the <strong>Fake Stack</strong> implementation.</li>
<li>Functions to <strong>check</strong> if the <strong>memory accessed</strong> is (un)valid.</li>
<li>Functions to <strong>report errors</strong> when the <strong>check failed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shadow-and-application-address-mapping">Shadow and Application Address Mapping</h3>
<p>The functions which are the most utilized through the program will be the functions to convert addresses from (or to) Shadow Memory to (or from) Application Memory.</p>
<p>These functions are defined in the <code>asan_mapping.cc</code> in order to change <em>scale</em> and <em>offset</em> depending on the architecture.</p>

<p>For both functions, it checks whether the address is really in the specified region first.
Then it converts the address thanks to the 2 macros <code>MEM_TO_SHADOW</code> and <code>SHADOW_TO_MEM</code>.</p>
<p>These functions are inlined in order to reduce function overhead because it will be called a lot of times.
The faster this function is, the lower the performance impact ASan instrumentation will force on target code.</p>
<h3 id="interceptor">Interceptor</h3>
<p>One of the main challenges for ASan is to intercept all functions that need to alter memory.
For example, the famous <code>malloc/calloc/free</code> functions needs to be intercepted in order to poison memory before giving it back to the user.</p>
<p>In order to do this, ASan has a macro called <code>INTERCEPTOR</code>.
It takes in parameter the <strong>return type</strong>, the <strong>function name</strong> and the <strong>arguments</strong> of the function we want to replace.</p>
<p>Let’s see for example the Interceptor for <code>malloc()</code>.</p>

<p>Now, every time we call <code>malloc()</code>, we will go through the function defined above, and not the libc <code>malloc()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="stack-1">Stack</h3>
<p>ASan can work with 2 “modes” for the Stack. It can stay with the basic Stack, or create a Fake Stack.</p>
<p>It can only do one stack mode at runtime, not both.</p>
<h4 id="normal-stack">Normal Stack</h4>
<p>For the normal Stack, the code has already been instrumented and it will call the <code>__asan_stack_malloc_N()</code> function which will allocate our local variable, as well as poison the memory around it.</p>
<p>The function <code>__asan_stack_malloc_N()</code> will call a function in the ASan Allocator currently selected, which depends on the type of Stack.</p>
<p>For the Normal Stack, the default Allocator is selected, and only local variables will be poisoned.</p>
<h4 id="fake-stack">Fake Stack</h4>
<p>The Fake Stack is used when doing <em>User after return</em> error detection.</p>
<p>ASan will use a special Allocator that will create a Fake Stack as well as Fake Frames that will be poisoned after being returned from.</p>
<h3 id="poisoning">Poisoning</h3>
<p>In order to poison Memory, ASan give a simple function <code>bool PoisonShadow(uptr addr, uptr size, u8 value)</code>.</p>
<p>Then, it can simply give the <code>size</code> of bytes at <code>addr</code> it wants to set to <code>value</code>.</p>
<p>On Linux, it’s simply a call to <code>memset()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="error-reporting">Error Reporting</h2>
<p>In this part, we will analyse the ASan output when an error occurred, and see what we can now understand from each part.</p>
<p>For this, we will take an example of a <code>stack_buffer_overflow</code>. And we will need a master of the art for C programing.</p>
<p>Xavier is once again asked to create a program that creates an array of integers and return the last element.</p>

</p>
<p><em>Ouch!!!</em>
That’s a lot of information for Xavier to take at once.</p>
<p>In order to teach Xavier how this works, we will take a closer look at each part of this output.</p>
<p>In fact, this output is divided into 6 distinct parts described below.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_summary.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingSummary" loading="lazy">
</p>
<h3 id="error-type">Error Type</h3>
<p>The <strong>first</strong> part of the output is the error type.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_error_type.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingErrorType" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>It can be decomposed in 3 information.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_error_type_summary.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingErrorTypeSummary" loading="lazy">
</p>
<h4 id="error-type-1">Error Type</h4>
<p>The error type corresponds to the errors we defined in the introduction. It’s the name of the error we produced.</p>
<p>Here, we can see that we produced a <code>stack-buffer-overflow</code> as expected.</p>
<h4 id="address">Address</h4>
<p>The Address shows us the virtual address we tried to access and which generated a <code>stack_buffer_overflow</code>.</p>
<h4 id="registers">Registers</h4>
<p>Finally, ASan will output the state of 3 registers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong>rogram <strong>C</strong>ounter: Indicating the current instruction.</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>ase <strong>P</strong>ointer: The pointer indicating the start of our stack frame (also, the previous <strong>SP</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>S</strong>tack <strong>P</strong>ointer: The pointer indicating the current position of the top of our stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can help us to know exactly when and where the program failed.</p>
<h3 id="operation">Operation</h3>
<p>The <strong>second</strong> part is the type of operation which triggered the error.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_operation.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingOperation" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>It can be decomposed in 4 information.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_operation_summary.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingOperationSummary" loading="lazy">
</p>
<h4 id="operation-1">Operation</h4>
<p>The operation tells us what we did during the memory error.</p>
<p>Here, it’s <code>READ</code>, because we are trying to read the memory out of bound.
But if we were trying to set a value in an array at an index out of bound, the operation will be <code>WRITE</code>.</p>
<h4 id="size">Size</h4>
<p>It corresponds to the size in bytes of the data we are trying to access.
Here, it’s 4 (bytes) because we are trying to access an <code>int</code>, which in <code>x86_64</code> under the <code>System V ABI</code> is stored under 4 bytes in memory.</p>
<h4 id="address-1">Address</h4>
<p>The address is the same as before, where exactly did we try to access invalid memory.</p>
<h4 id="threadid">ThreadID</h4>
<p>The ThreadID correspond of an unique identifier (ID) of the Thread we are currently running.
This is only useful if you have a multi-threaded application because it can tell you on which thread the invalid memory access was on.</p>
<h3 id="backtrace">Backtrace</h3>
<p>The <strong>third</strong> part of the output is a backtrace of your program. This tells you the state of your stack when the invalid memory access was done.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_operation.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingOperation" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>If you had set the debug symbols, ASan can tell you exactly on which line of your program, the invalid memory access is located.
We can see that he tells us that the invalid access is on line 6, which is the <code>return number[4];</code>.</p>
<h3 id="address-2">Address</h3>
<p>The <strong>fourth</strong> part of the output is the address where the memory error occurred.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_address.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingAddress" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>It can be decomposed in 4 information.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_address_summary.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingAddressSummary" loading="lazy">
</p>
<h4 id="address-3">Address</h4>
<p>Same as the last 2, where exactly is the invalid memory access.</p>
<h4 id="place">Place</h4>
<p>This tells us where the invalid access is. In which pool of memory.
It can be the <strong>stack</strong>, or the <strong>heap</strong>, or <strong>global memory</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="threadid-1">ThreadID</h4>
<p>This is the ThreadID we have seen before. It’s also here because each thread has its own Stack.</p>
<p>So we need to know the Thread associated with each stack.</p>
<h4 id="offset">Offset</h4>
<p>This tells us exactly where is the access located in the stack frame.</p>
<h3 id="memory-view">Memory View</h3>
<p>This is the most visual part and represent a snapshot of the memory around the invalid access when the error was thrown.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_memory_view.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingMemoryView" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>The memory ASan is showing us here, represents the Shadow Bytes around the invalid memory access.</p>
<p>On the left, we can see the addresses of the memory, and on the right, each pair of digits means 8 bytes of the Application memory.</p>
<p>We can see that we accessed the third number on the line <code>0x1000_00f9_6e50</code>, and the value stored is <code>f3</code>. But what does it mean ? Maybe we can look down at the last section to know the answer.</p>
<h3 id="shadow-byte-legend">Shadow Byte Legend</h3>
<p>And you guessed right, the last part corresponds to the Shadow Bytes Legend. It tells you exactly the meaning of the magic values you see in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_legend.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingShadowByteLegend" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>We can then look at <code>f3</code> which means: <code>Stack right redzone</code>.</p>
<p>That tells us that the memory where the value stored is <code>f3</code>, it’s poisoned memory on the right side of a value in the stack.
Which correspond exactly to a <code>stack_buffer_overflow</code>.</p>
<p>We can also see <code>f1</code> before our variable in the Shadow Memory, which correspond to <code>Stack left redzone</code>, which enables ASan to trigger <code>stack_buffer_underflow</code> errors.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Here is the summary of the parts we have seen.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/images/benjamin.peter/benjamin.peter-2022-10-28-address_sanitizer_internals/Asan_error_reporting_parts.png" alt="AsanErrorReportingParts" loading="lazy">
</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>In terms of performance, there are 2 parts to take into account here.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s the memory footprint. ASan will take ~1/8 of the available virtual memory of your program.</p>
<p>This part will be used to store the Shadow Bytes and prevent access to the Shadow Memory.</p>
<p>For the second part, ASan will <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerPerformanceNumbers" target="_blank">slowdown</a> your code by an average of 1.93. Which means that your program will run approximately 2 times slower than usual.</p>
<p>This is a good trade-off compared to other memory misuse detector tools.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://valgrind.org/" target="_blank">Valgrind</a>, will slowdown your code to 20 times more of your initial execution time.</p>
<p>ASan produces an overhead (~1.93) and it takes ~1/8 of your application memory, so this needs to be kept in mind when choosing ASan.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Address Sanitizer is a powerful tool to detect memory misuse cases.</p>
<p>It doesn’t hurt too much your performance, and is very easily enabled in your build environment thanks to a compiler/linker flag.</p>
<p>It is a very useful tool that any programmer can understand, and it gives a lot of information to help the programmer find the bug more easily.</p>
<p>I hope that this document will help you and Xavier on your future C projects. By helping you to avoid common memory misuse thanks to Address Sanitizer.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the past months, Tesla has been offering a free, one-month trial of their full 
self-driving (FSD) system to all current owners. It looks like they are rolling this 
out in stages, because I only got mine only a few days ago.</p>

<p>I’ve had a Model Y for more than 3 years now, well before Elon revealed himself as the 
kind of person he really is, and I’ve been happy with it. The odometer is now well 
above 50,000 miles, a significant part of those were spent on I-80 while driving between the 
SF South Bay and the Lake Tahoe area.</p>

<p>For long distance interstate driving, autopilot (in other words: lane centering and 
adaptive cruise control) has been amazing. I use it all the time, and have little to 
complain about. Early on, I had one case where the autopilot started slowing down 
for no good reason, but since I distrust these kind of systems and since phantom braking 
has been reported quite a bit in the press, I try to keep attention to what the car is doing 
at all times. I immediately pressed the accelerator, and that was that.</p>

<p>I don’t know how prevalent phantom breaking really is. One time is still too many, and 
disconcerting. It doesn’t help that you can’t anticipate it, there must by a bunch of different 
factors to trigger it: version of the car, weather, light conditions etc. All I can say, after 
so many miles, is that autopilot has been amazing for me.</p>

<p>When I buy my next car, my requirements will be simple: I want an EV, an extensive charger 
network along I-80, and an autosteer that’s at least as good as what I have today. Let’s hope 
there’ll be decent Tesla alternatives by then.</p>

<p>But let’s get to FSD.</p>

<p>During his last financial conference call, Musk claimed that he wants to focus more on robo-taxis. 
With no driver in the car at all, such a system better be pretty much flawless. But with the 
YouTube videos that are out there, often posted by Tesla fans, that show the system making 
ridiculous errors, I highly doubt that the system is close to ready. I would never pay for FSD, 
not only do I not trust it, I also don’t really see the point, but with with a free trial, 
I couldn’t resist checking it out.</p>

<p>Here are my impressions.</p>

<h2 id="rules-of-engagement">Rules of Engagement</h2>

<p>During 3 short tests, I watched FSD the way a helicopter parent watches a toddler who’s first 
exploring the world: allow it do what it wants to do, but intervene the moment you feel things 
are not going the way you like it.</p>

<p>It’s common on social media to see comments like this: “if the driver had waited a bit more, 
FSD would still have corrected itself.” I’m having none of that. The moment I’m sensing it’s on 
its way to do something, anything, wrong, I intervene.</p>

<p>While it’s possible that benign cases are dinged as interventions, I don’t think any what I 
describe below can be considered as such. They were real mistakes that should never have happened.</p>

<h2 id="test-ride-1-from-kings-beach-to-truckee-11-miles">Test Ride 1: from Kings Beach to Truckee (11 miles)</h2>

<p>I first switched on FSD for an 11 mile drive 
from a mountain biking trailhead in Kings Beach to the I-80 entrance in Truckee, with a stop 
at a gas station to get some snacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/39.249095,-120.0300215/39.338854,-120.1698876/@39.3190228,-120.1747248,13z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-120.1522306!2d39.3168207!3s0x809961d34ddd1f31:0xc7a37e232df2aeae!1m0!3e0?entry=ttu"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/fsd/kings_beach_to_truckee.png" alt="Map from Kings Beach to Truckee"></a>
<em>Click to open in Google Maps</em></p>

<p>This is not a complicated tasks. Other than the gas stop, it’s just driving straight along state 
route 267 with a 3 traffic lights. What could possibly go wrong? Well, FSD managed to make 2 mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 1: select the wrong exit lane</strong></p>

<p>During the first mistake, instead of turning right at the gas station, it made the decision to prepare 
to exit one street early, switched on its indicator, and started moving to the right exit lane. Note
that there is no way to get to the gas station through that first exit.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/fsd/mistake1.jpg" alt="Mistake one: go right too early"></p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/fsd/mistake1_streetview.jpg" alt="Mistake one: streetview"></p>

<p>If I hadn’t immediately interrupted that maneuver (see <em>Rules of Engagement</em>), I assume it would 
have corrected itself eventually and gone back onto the main lane. But if I had been the driver behind, 
I’d have questioned the antics of the driver in front of me.</p>

<p>FSD managed to screw up its very first maneuver. Not a good look.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 2: selecting the right turn lane when going straight</strong></p>

<p>The second mistake happened less than a mile later.</p>

<p>At the intersection with Old Brockway Rd, the car was supposed to continue straight. There are 3 
lanes at the traffic light: left, middle, and right, and only the middle lane can be used 
to go straight.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/fsd/mistake2_streetview.jpg" alt="Mistake two: streetview"></p>

<p>For whatever reason, FSD initiated a move to go to the right lane. Another case where I’m sure it 
would have corrected itself eventually, but it’s clear that the system had no clue about the 
traffic situation in front of it.</p>

<p>While both cases are not life-or-death situations, it’s truly impressive that FSD managed to make 2 
easily avoided mistakes before my first 10 miles of using it!</p>

<h2 id="test-ride-2-i-80-from-truckee-to-blue-canyon-36-miles">Test Ride 2: I-80 from Truckee to Blue Canyon (36 miles)</h2>

<p>For the second test, my wife reluctantly gave me permission to try out FSD for interstate driving, 
which should be its best case scenario.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/39.338854,-120.1698876/39.2543823,-120.7372512/@39.2945489,-120.4893074,10z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0?entry=ttu"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/fsd/truckee_to_blue_canyon.png" alt="Map from Truckee to Blue Canyon"></a>
<em>Click to open in Google Maps</em></p>

<p>It’s a bit disconcerting to see the car make a decision to change lanes to pass someone, but I guess 
that’s something you’ll get used to.</p>

<p>But what was baffling was the way in which it behaved worse than autopilot. 
There were two nearly identical cases, where the 2-lane road was dead straight, with excellent paint marks, 
and with cars right of me, yet FSD made nervous left-right oscillation-like corrections that I have never 
experienced before in autopilot mode. It was not a case of FSD wanting to change lanes, no right indicator 
was ever switched on.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/fsd/mistake3_streetview.jpg" alt="Mistake three: streetview"></p>

<p>The first time, my wife questioned what was going on. The second time, on a section just past
the Whitmore Caltrans station near Alta, she ordered me to switch off FSD. In the past 3 years, she 
never once asked me to switch off autopilot.</p>

<p>One would think that autopilot and FSD have the same core lane tracking algorithms, but one way or the other 
the experience was radically different. I switched back to autopilot. The remaining 3 hours were uneventful.</p>

<h2 id="test-ride-3-from-west-valley-college-to-i-85-entrance-1-mile">Test Ride 3: from West-Valley College to I-85 Entrance (1 mile)</h2>

<p>The final test happened yesterday, while driving back from the 
<a href="https://www.electronicsfleamarket.com/">Silicon Valley Electronics Flea Market</a>
back home.</p>

<p>These are always held on a Sunday, start very early at 6am, and I’m usually out before 9am, so there’s 
almost nobody on the road.</p>

<p>FSD managed to turn right out of the parking lot just fine and get past the first traffic light.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/fsd/no_turn_on_right.jpg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/fsd/no_turn_on_right.jpg" alt="Mistake four: streetview"></a></p>

<p>The second traffic light has a don’t-turn-on-red sign. The light was red, the Tesla came to a full stop, 
and then pressed on the gas to move on while the light was still red. (According to my colleague, police 
often lay in wait at this location to catch violators.)</p>

<p>By now I fully expected it to make that mistake, so I was ready to press the brake.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The way it currently behaves, FSD is a system that can’t be trusted to make the right decisions. It makes 
the most basic mistakes and it makes many of them.</p>

<p>Without FSD, you pay attention to the road and everything else is within your control. With FSD, you still 
need to pay attention but now there’s the additional cognitive load to monitor an unpredictable system over 
which you don’t have direct control. Forget about just being focused, you need to be hyper-focused, and you 
need to pay $99 per month or a one time fee of $12,000 for the privilege. With the limited functionality of autopilot, 
you hit the sweet spot: adaptive cruise control and lane centering work reliably, and you don’t need to 
worry about any other mischief.</p>

<p>Maybe one day I’ll be able to drive to Lake Tahoe by typing in the address, sit back, take a nap,
or play on my phone. Until then, it’s just a fancy technology demo with little practical value.</p>

<p>All right, everyone —&nbsp;we can all breathe a sigh of relief. NASA's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/17688-voyager-1.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/17688-voyager-1.html"><u>Voyager 1</u></a> spacecraft is fully operational once more, with all four science instruments returning usable data to Earth.</p><p>The problems began in November 2023, when Voyager 1 lost its ability to "speak" with us. More specifically, it started sending to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html"><u>Earth</u></a> unintelligible data instead of its normal 0s and 1s of binary code. Of course, Voyager 1 is 46 years old —&nbsp;ancient for a spacecraft —&nbsp;so it wasn't <em>entirely</em> a surprise that its health might be waning. And that's not to mention that it's in entirely uncharted interstellar territory, some 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Voyager 1's dogged team was determined to not only figure out what went wrong, but also to fix the problem. And they've succeeded! Controllers identified where the issue was located: the flight data subsystem (FDS), used to "package" data to be sent to Earth. Further sleuthing revealed the exact chip causing the problem, which allowed them to find a workaround. After the team relocated the code to a new location in the FDS, Voyager 1 finally sent back intelligible data on April 20, 2024&nbsp;— but only from two of its four science instruments. Now, just two months later, Voyager 1's remaining two science instruments are back up and running, communicating effectively with mission control on Earth.</p><p>Even if Voyager 1 had gone dark for good, however, the mission would still have been a wild success. After it launched in 1977, its primary mission was to study <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/7-jupiter-largest-planet-solar-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/7-jupiter-largest-planet-solar-system.html"><u>Jupiter</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/48-saturn-the-solar-systems-major-ring-bearer.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/48-saturn-the-solar-systems-major-ring-bearer.html"><u>Saturn</u></a> —&nbsp;that was accomplished by 1980. (Its twin spacecraft, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/voyager-2" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/voyager-2"><u>Voyager 2</u></a>, went on to study <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/45-uranus-seventh-planet-in-earths-solar-system-was-first-discovered-planet.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/45-uranus-seventh-planet-in-earths-solar-system-was-first-discovered-planet.html"><u>Uranus</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/41-neptune-the-other-blue-planet-in-our-solar-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/41-neptune-the-other-blue-planet-in-our-solar-system.html"><u>Neptune</u></a>.) But Voyager 1 is on an unstoppable path. Continuing its journey away from Earth, the spacecraft entered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/interstellar-space-definition-explanation" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/interstellar-space-definition-explanation"><u>interstellar space</u></a> in 2012, returning crucial data about this mysterious realm.</p><p>Now that Voyager 1 is back online, the team will continue to "touch up" the spacecraft to get it back in top form, including resynchronizing its timekeeping software to execute commands at the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/time-how-it-works" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/time-how-it-works"><u>time</u></a>, as well as performing maintenance on the digital tape recorder that measures plasma waves. And hopefully, Voyager 1 will have a long, happy life ahead.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zXjotydkMTeij63e2Mmbt7"><section><p>Sign up to our newsletter for the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!</p></section></div>
