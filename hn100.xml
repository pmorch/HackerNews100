												<p>Not long ago, the ability to digitally track someone’s daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a dangerous power that should remain only within the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites.</p>
<div id="attachment_69282"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69282" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone.png" alt="" width="748" height="756" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone.png 893w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone-768x776.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone-782x790.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69282">Image: Shutterstock, Arthimides.</p></div>
<p>Delaware-based<strong> Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</strong> helps its users remove their personal information from the clutches of consumer data brokers, and from <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=people+search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people-search services online</a>. Backed by millions of dollars in litigation financing, Atlas so far this year has sued 151 consumer data brokers on behalf of a class that includes more than 20,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers who are signed up for Atlas services.</p>
<p>Atlas alleges all of these data brokers have ignored repeated warnings that they are violating <strong>Daniel’s Law</strong>, a New Jersey statute allowing law enforcement, government personnel, judges and their families to have their information completely removed from commercial data brokers. Daniel’s Law was passed in 2020 after the death of 20-year-old <strong>Daniel Anderl</strong>, who was killed in a violent attack targeting a federal judge — his mother.</p>
<p>Last week, Atlas invoked Daniel’s Law in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.18_Babel_Street_Compl_w_Summons-Case_Info_-_4874-8628-4017_-_1__1_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lawsuit</a> (PDF) against <strong>Babel Street</strong>, a little-known technology company incorporated in Reston, Va. Babel Street’s core product allows customers to draw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slightly dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area.</p>
<p>Babel Street’s <strong>LocateX</strong> platform also allows customers to track individual mobile users by their <strong>Mobile Advertising ID</strong> or <strong>MAID</strong>, a unique, alphanumeric identifier built into all Google Android and Apple mobile devices.</p>
<p>Babel Street can offer this tracking capability by consuming location data and other identifying information that is collected by many websites and broadcast to dozens and sometimes hundreds of ad networks that may wish to bid on showing their ad to a particular user.</p>
<div id="attachment_69280"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69280" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque.jpeg" alt="" width="1448" height="990" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque.jpeg 1448w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque-768x525.jpeg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque-782x535.jpeg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 1448px) 100vw, 1448px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69280">This image, taken from a video recording Atlas made of its private investigator using Babel Street to show all of the unique mobile IDs seen over time at a mosque in Dearborn, Michigan. Each red dot represents one mobile device.</p></div>
<p>In an interview, Atlas said a private investigator they hired was offered a free trial of Babel Street, which the investigator was able to use to determine the home address and daily movements of mobile devices belonging to multiple New Jersey police officers whose families have already faced significant harassment and death threats.</p>
<p>Atlas said the investigator encountered Babel Street while testing hundreds of data broker tools and services to see if personal information on its users was being sold. They soon discovered Babel Street also bundles people-search services with its platform, to make it easier for customers to zero in on a specific device.</p>
<p>The investigator contacted Babel Street about possibly buying home addresses in certain areas of New Jersey. After listening to a sales pitch for Babel Street and expressing interest, the investigator was told Babel Street only offers their service to the government or to “contractors of the government.”</p>
<p>“The investigator (truthfully) mentioned that he was contemplating some government contract work in the future and was told by the Babel Street salesperson that ‘that’s good enough’ and that ‘they don’t actually check,’” Atlas shared in an email with reporters.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was one of five media outlets invited to review screen recordings that Atlas made while its investigator used a two-week trial version of Babel Street’s LocateX service. References and links to reporting by other publications, including <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-u-s-government-bought-tool-that-can-track-phones-at-abortion-clinics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>404 Media</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/security/2024-10-23/ty-article-magazine/.premium/00000192-b90c-dc97-a593-f96f50800000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Haaretz</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.notus.org/technology/cell-phone-tracking-law-enforcement-abortion-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NOTUS</strong></a>, and <strong>The New York Times</strong>, will appear throughout this story.</p>
<p>Collectively, these stories expose how the broad availability of mobile advertising data has created a market in which virtually anyone can build a sophisticated spying apparatus capable of tracking the daily movements of hundreds of millions of people globally.</p>
<p>The findings outlined in Atlas’s lawsuit against Babel Street also illustrate how mobile location data is set to massively complicate several hot-button issues, from the tracking of suspected illegal immigrants or women seeking abortions, to harassing public servants who are already in the crosshairs over baseless conspiracy theories and increasingly hostile political rhetoric against government employees.</p>
<h2>WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE</h2>
<p>Atlas says the Babel Street trial period allowed its investigator to find information about visitors to high-risk targets such as mosques, synagogues, courtrooms and abortion clinics. In one video, an Atlas investigator showed how they isolated mobile devices seen in a New Jersey courtroom parking lot that was reserved for jurors, and then tracked one likely juror’s phone to their home address over several days.</p>
<p>While the Atlas investigator had access to its trial account at Babel Street, they were able to successfully track devices belonging to several plaintiffs named or referenced in the lawsuit. They did so by drawing a digital polygon around the home address or workplace of each person in Babel Street’s platform, which focused exclusively on the devices that passed through those addresses each day.</p>
<div id="attachment_69273"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69273" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="648" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg 1446w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple-768x664.jpeg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple-782x676.jpeg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69273">Each red dot in this Babel Street map represents a unique mobile device that has been seen since April 2022 at a Jewish synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif. Image: Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</p></div>
<p>One unique feature of Babel Street is the ability to toggle a “night” mode, which makes it relatively easy to determine within a few meters where a target typically lays their head each night (because their phone is usually not far away).</p>
<p>Atlas plaintiffs <strong>Scott</strong> and <strong>Justyna Maloney</strong> are both veteran officers with the Rahway, NJ police department who live together with their two young children. In April 2023, Scott and Justyna became the target of intense harassment and death threats after Officer Justyna responded to a routine call about a man filming people outside of the Motor Vehicle Commission in Rahway.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEZWtC9bdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">man filming</a> the Motor Vehicle Commission that day is a social media personality who often solicits police contact and then records himself arguing about constitutional rights with the responding officers.</p>
<p>Officer Justyna’s interaction with the man was entirely peaceful, and the episode appeared to end without incident. But after a selectively edited video of that encounter went viral, their home address and unpublished phone numbers were posted online. When their tormentors figured out that Scott was also a cop (a sergeant), the couple began receiving dozens of threatening text messages, including specific death threats.</p>
<p>According to the Atlas lawsuit, one of the messages to Mr. Maloney demanded money, and warned that his family would “pay in blood” if he didn’t comply. Sgt. Maloney said he then received a video in which a masked individual pointed a rifle at the camera and told him that his family was “going to get [their] heads cut off.”</p>
<p>Maloney said a few weeks later, one of their neighbors saw two suspicious individuals in ski masks parked one block away from the home and alerted police. Atlas’s complaint says video surveillance from neighboring homes shows the masked individuals circling the Maloney’s home. The responding officers arrested two men, who were armed, for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
<div id="attachment_69289"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69289" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png" alt="" width="748" height="437" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png 1457w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg-768x449.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg-782x457.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69289">According to Google Maps, Babel Street shares a corporate address with Google and the consumer credit reporting bureau TransUnion.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said their investigator was not able to conclusively find Scott Maloney’s iPhone in the Babel Street platform, but they did find Justyna’s. Babel Street had nearly 100,000 hits for her phone over several months, allowing Atlas to piece together an intimate picture of Justyna’s daily movements and meetings with others.<span id="more-69216"></span></p>
<p>An Atlas investigator visited the Maloneys and inspected Justyna’s iPhone, and determined the only app that used her device’s location data was from the department store <strong>Macy’s</strong>.</p>
<p>In a written response to questions, Macy’s said its app includes an opt-in feature for geo-location, “which allows customers to receive an enhanced shopping experience based on their location.”</p>
<p>“We do not store any customer location information,” Macy’s wrote. “We share geo-location data with a <a href="https://www.macys.com/ads.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited number of partners</a> who help us deliver this enhanced app experience. Furthermore, we have no connection with Babel Street” [link added for context].</p>
<p>Justyna’s experience highlights a stark reality about the broad availability of mobile location data: Even if the person you’re looking for isn’t directly identifiable in platforms like Babel Street, it is likely that at least some of that person’s family members are. In other words, it’s often trivial to infer the location of one device by successfully locating another.</p>
<p>The terms of service for Babel Street’s Locate X service state that the product “may not be used as the basis for any legal process in any country, including as the basis for a warrant, subpoena, or any other legal or administrative action.” But Scott Maloney said he’s convinced by their experience that not even law enforcement agencies should have access to this capability without a warrant.</p>
<p>“As a law enforcement officer, in order for me to track someone I need a judge to sign a warrant – and that’s for a criminal investigation after we’ve developed probable cause,” Mr. Maloney said in an interview. “Data brokers tracking me and my family just to sell that information for profit, without our consent, and even after we’ve explicitly asked them not to is deeply disturbing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Maloney’s law enforcement colleagues in other states may see things differently. In August, <strong>The Texas Observer</strong> <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-dps-surveillance-tangle-cobwebs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that state police plan to spend more than $5 million on a contract for a controversial surveillance tool called <strong>Tangles</strong> from the tech firm PenLink. Tangles is an AI-based web platform that scrapes information from the open, deep and dark web, and it has a premier feature called <strong>WebLoc</strong> that can be used to geofence mobile devices.</p>
<p>The <strong>Associated Press</strong> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last month</a> that law enforcement agencies from suburban Southern California to rural North Carolina have been using an obscure cell phone tracking tool called <strong>Fog Reveal</strong> — at times without warrants — that gives them the ability to follow people’s movements going back many months.</p>
<p>It remains unclear precisely how Babel Street is obtaining the abundance of mobile location data made available to users of its platform. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>But according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2020-HQFO-01656.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a document</a> (PDF) obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology directorate, Babel Street re-hosts data from the commercial phone tracking firm <strong>Venntel</strong>.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Substack newsletter <strong>All-Source Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_29FTC124C0060_2900_-NONE-_-NONE-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unearthed documents</a> indicating that the <strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</strong> has opened an inquiry into Venntel and its parent company Gravy Analytics.</p>
<p>“Venntel has also been a data partner of the police surveillance contractor Fog Data Science, whose product has been described as ‘mass surveillance on a budget,'” All-Source’s <strong>Jack Poulson</strong> <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/ftc-opened-investigation-into-commercial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. “Venntel was also reported to have been a primary data source of the controversial ‘Locate X’ phone tracking product of the American data fusion company Babel Street.”</p>
<h2>MAID IN HELL</h2>
<p>The Mobile Advertising ID or MAID — the unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each mobile device — was originally envisioned as a way to distinguish individual mobile customers without relying on personally identifiable information such as phone numbers or email addresses.</p>
<p>However, there is now <a href="https://datarade.ai/data-categories/device-graph-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a robust industry</a> of marketing and advertising companies that specialize in assembling enormous lists of MAIDs that are “enriched” with historical and personal information about the individual behind each MAID.</p>
<div id="attachment_69270"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69270" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png" alt="" width="750" height="411" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png 1186w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid-768x420.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid-782x428.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69270">One of many vendors that “enrich” MAID data with other identifying information, including name, address, email address and phone number.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said its investigator wanted to know whether they could find enriched MAID records on their New Jersey law enforcement customers, and soon found plenty of ad data brokers willing to sell it.</p>
<p>Some vendors offered only a handful of data fields, such as first and last name, MAID and email address. Other brokers sold far more detailed histories along with their MAID, including each subject’s social media profiles, precise GPS coordinates, and even likely consumer category.</p>
<p>How are advertisers and data brokers gaining access to so much information? Some sources of MAID data can be apps on your phone such as <strong>AccuWeather</strong>, <strong>GasBuddy</strong>, <strong>Grindr</strong>, and <strong>MyFitnessPal</strong> that collect your MAID and location and sell that to brokers.</p>
<p>A user’s MAID profile and location data also is commonly shared as a consequence of simply using a smartphone to visit a web page that features ads. In the few milliseconds before those ads load, the website will send a “<strong>bid request</strong>” to various ad exchanges, where advertisers can bid on the chance to place their ad in front of users who match the consumer profiles they’re seeking. A great deal of data can be included in a bid request, including the user’s precise location (the current open standard for bid requests is detailed <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p>
<p>The trouble is that virtually anyone can access the “bidstream” data flowing through these so-called “<strong>realtime bidding</strong>” networks, because the information is simultaneously broadcast in the clear to hundreds of entities around the world.</p>
<p>The result is that there are a number of marketing companies that now enrich and broker access to this mobile location information. Earlier this year, the German news outlet <strong>netzpolitik.org</strong> purchased a bidstream data set containing more than 3.6 billion data points, and shared the information with the German daily <strong>BR24</strong>. They concluded that the data they obtained (through a free trial, no less) made it possible to establish movement profiles — some of them quite precise — of <a href="https://interaktiv.br.de/ausspioniert-mit-standortdaten/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several million people across Germany</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Politico</strong> recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/23/tk-alfred-top-00180521" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a>&nbsp;startling <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> from universities in New Hampshire, Kentucky and St. Louis that showed how the mobile advertising data they acquired allowed them to link visits from investigators with the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) to insiders selling stock before the investigations became public knowledge.</p>
<p>The researchers in that study said they didn’t attempt to use the same methods to track regulators from other agencies, but that virtually anyone could do it.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Sherman</strong>, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology,&nbsp;called the research a “shocking demonstration of what happens when companies can freely harvest Americans’ geolocation data and sell it for their chosen price.”</p>
<p>“Politicians should understand how they, their staff, and public servants are threatened by the sale of personal data—and constituent groups should realize that talk of data broker ‘controls’ or ‘best practices” is designed by companies to distract from the underlying problems and the comprehensive privacy and security solutions,” Sherman <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/data-brokers-and-threats-to-government-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote for Lawfare this week</a>.</p>
<h2>A BIDSTREAM DRAGNET?</h2>
<p>The Orwellian nature of modern mobile advertising networks may soon have far-reaching implications for women’s reproductive rights, as more states move to outlaw abortion within their borders. The 2022 Dobbs decision by the U.S. Supreme Court discarded the federal right to abortion, and 14 states have since enacted strict abortion bans.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups are already using mobile advertising data to advance their cause. In May 2023, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/IZenH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that an anti-abortion group in Wisconsin used precise geolocation data to direct ads to women it suspected of seeking abortions.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is little to stop anti-abortion groups from purchasing bidstream data (or renting access to a platform like Babel Street) and using it to geofence abortion clinics, potentially revealing all mobile devices transiting through these locations.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator geofenced an abortion clinic and was able to identify a likely employee at that clinic, following their daily route to and from that individual’s home address.</p>
<div id="attachment_69272"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69272" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="1195" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg 1600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-768x574.jpeg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-1536x1147.jpeg 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-782x584.jpeg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-69272">A still shot from a video Atlas shared of its use of Babel Street to identify and track an employee traveling each day between their home and the clinic.</p></div>
<p>Last year, Idaho became the first state to outlaw “abortion trafficking,” which the <strong>Idaho Capital Sun</strong> <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/26/helping-a-minor-travel-for-an-abortion-some-states-have-made-it-a-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> is defined as “recruiting, harboring or transporting a pregnant minor to get an abortion or abortion medication without parental permission.” Tennessee now has a similar law, and GOP lawmakers in five other states introduced abortion trafficking bills that failed to advance this year, the Sun reports.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator used Babel Street to identify and track a person traveling from their home in Alabama — where abortion is now illegal — to an abortion clinic just over the border in Tallahassee, Fla. — and back home again within a few hours. Abortion rights advocates and providers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/nx-s1-5082217/can-alabama-prosecute-someone-for-helping-people-travel-out-of-state-for-an-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are currently suing Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall</a>, seeking to block him from prosecuting people who help patients travel out-of-state to end pregnancies.</p>
<p><strong>Eva Galperin</strong>, director of cybersecurity at the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation </strong>(EFF), a non-profit digital rights group, said she’s extremely concerned about dragnet surveillance of people crossing state lines in order to get abortions.</p>
<p>“Specifically, Republican officials from states that have outlawed abortion have made it clear that they are interested in targeting people who have gone to neighboring states in order to get abortions, and to make it more difficult for people who are seeking abortions to go to neighboring states,” Galperin said. “It’s not a great leap to imagine that states will do this.”</p>
<h2>APPLES AND GOOGLES</h2>
<p>Atlas found that for the right price (typically $10-50k a year), brokers can provide access to tens of billions of data points covering large swaths of the US population and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Based on the data sets Atlas acquired — many of which included older MAID records — they estimate they could locate roughly 80 percent of Android-based devices, and about 25 percent of Apple phones. Google refers to its MAID as the “<strong>Android Advertising ID</strong>,” (AAID) while Apple calls it the “<strong>Identifier for Advertisers</strong>” (IDFA).</p>
<p>What accounts for the disparity between the number of Android and Apple devices that can be found in mobile advertising data? In April 2021, Apple shipped version 14.5 of its iOS operating system, which introduced a technology called <strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong> (ATT) that requires apps to get affirmative consent before they can track users by their IDFA or any other identifier.</p>
<p>Apple’s introduction of ATT had a swift and profound impact on the advertising market: Less than a year later Facebook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosed</a> that the iPhone privacy feature would decrease the company’s 2022 revenues by about $10 billion.</p>
<div id="attachment_69274"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69274" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png" alt="" width="880" height="324" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png 880w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b-768x283.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b-782x288.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69274">Source: cnbc.com.</p></div>
<p>Google runs by far the world’s largest ad exchange, known as <strong>AdX</strong>. The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/technology/google-ad-antitrust-trial-arguments.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Google of building a monopoly</a> over the technology that places ads on websites, estimates that Google’s ad exchange controls 47 percent of the U.S. market and 56 percent globally.</p>
<p>Google’s <strong>Android</strong> is also the dominant mobile operating system worldwide, with more than 72 percent of the market. In the U.S., however, iPhone users claim approximately 55 percent of the market, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ios-vs-android-market-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechRepublic</a>.</p>
<p>In response to requests for comment, Google said it does not send real time bidding requests to Babel Street, nor does it share precise location data in bid requests. The company added that its policies explicitly prohibit the sale of data from real-time bidding, or its use for any purpose other than advertising.</p>
<p>Google said its MAIDs are randomly generated and do not contain IP addresses, GPS coordinates, or any other location data, and that its ad systems do not share anyone’s precise location data.</p>
<p>“Android has clear controls for users to manage app access to device location, and reset or delete their advertising ID,” Google’s written statement reads. “If we learn that someone, whether an app developer, ad tech company or anyone else, is violating our policies, we take appropriate action. Beyond that, we support legislation and industry collaboration to address these types of data practices that negatively affect the entire mobile ecosystem, including all operating systems.”</p>
<p>In a written statement shared with reporters, Apple said Location Services is not on by default in its devices. Rather, users must enable Location Services and must give permission to each app or website to use location data. Users can turn Location Services off at any time, and can change whether apps have access to location at any time. The user’s choices include precise vs. approximate location, as well as a one-time grant of location access by the app.</p>
<p>“We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and build privacy protections into each of our products and services to put the user in control of their data,” an Apple spokesperson said. “We minimize personal data collection, and where possible, process data only on users’ devices.”</p>
<p><strong>Zach Edwards</strong> is a senior threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm <strong>SilentPush</strong> who has studied the location data industry closely. Edwards said Google and Apple can’t keep pretending like the MAIDs being broadcast into the bidstream from hundreds of millions of American devices aren’t making most people trivially trackable.</p>
<p>“The privacy risks here will remain until Apple and Google permanently turn off their mobile advertising ID schemes and admit to the American public that this is the technology that has been supporting the global data broker ecosystem,” he said.</p>
<h2>STATES ACT, WHILE CONGRESS DITHERS</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Bloomberg Law</strong>, between 2019 and 2023, threats against federal judges have more than doubled. Amid increasingly hostile political rhetoric and conspiracy theories against government officials, a growing number of states are <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/cops-battle-data-brokers-for-privacy-in-constitutional-clash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking to pass their own versions of Daniel’s Law</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, a retired <strong>West Virginia</strong> police officer <a href="https://therecord.media/west-virginia-law-enforcement-sues-broker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a class action lawsuit</a> against the people-search service Whitepages for listing their personal information in violation of a statute the state passed in 2021 that largely mirrors Daniel’s Law.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Maryland passed the <strong>Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act</strong> — named after a county circuit court judge who was murdered by an individual involved in a divorce proceeding over which he was presiding. The law allows current and former members of the Maryland judiciary to request their personal information not be made available to the public.</p>
<p>Under the Maryland law, personal information can include a home address; telephone number, email address; Social Security number or federal tax ID number; bank account or payment card number; a license plate or other unique vehicle identifier; a birth or marital record; a child’s name, school, or daycare; place of worship; place of employment for a spouse, child, or dependent.</p>
<p>The law firm <strong>Troutman Pepper</strong> <a href="https://www.troutman.com/insights/maryland-enacts-the-judge-andrew-f-wilkinson-judicial-security-act-are-more-daniels-laws-on-the-horizon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> that “so far in 2024, 37 states have begun considering or have adopted similar privacy-based legislation designed to protect members of the judiciary and, in some states, other government officials involved in law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Atlas alleges that in response to requests to have data on its New Jersey law enforcement clients scrubbed from consumer records sold by <strong>LexisNexis</strong>, the data broker retaliated by freezing the credit of approximately 18,500 people, and falsely reporting them as identity theft victims.</p>
<p>In addition, Atlas said LexisNexis started returning failure codes indicating they had no record of these individuals, resulting in denials when officers attempted to refinance loans or open new bank accounts.</p>
<p>The data broker industry has responded by having at least 70 of the Atlas lawsuits moved to federal court, and challenging the constitutionality of the New Jersey statute as overly broad and a violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the data broker industry argued in their motion to dismiss that there is “no First Amendment doctrine that exempts a content-based restriction from strict scrutiny just because it has some nexus with a privacy interest.”</p>
<p>Atlas’s lawyers responded that data covered under Daniel’s Law — personal information of New Jersey law enforcement officers — is not free speech. Atlas notes that while defending against comparable lawsuits, the data broker industry has argued that home address and phone number data are not “communications.”</p>
<p>“Data brokers should not be allowed to argue that information like addresses are not ‘communications’ in one context, only to turn around and claim that addresses are protectable communications,” Atlas <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/5.-PLAINTIFFS-MEMORANDUM-OF-LAW-IN-OPPOSITION-TO-DEFENDANTS-CONSOLIDATED-MOTION-TO-DISMISS-PLAINTIFFS-COMPLAINT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> (PDF). “Nor can their change of course alter the reality that the data at issue is not speech.”</p>
<p>The judge overseeing the challenge is expected to rule on the motion to dismiss within the next few weeks. Regardless of the outcome, the decision is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, media law experts say they’re concerned that enacting Daniel’s Law in other states could limit the ability of journalists to hold public officials accountable, and allow authorities <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/09/21/judge-declines-to-limit-daniels-law-for-reporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pursue criminal charges against media outlets</a> that publish the same type of public and government records that fuel the people-search industry.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.) said Congress’ failure to regulate data brokers, and the administration’s continued opposition to bipartisan legislation that would limit data sales to law enforcement, have created this current privacy crisis.</p>
<p>“Whether location data is being used to identify and expose closeted gay Americans, or to track people as they cross state lines to seek reproductive health care, data brokers are selling Americans’ deepest secrets and exposing them to serious harm, all for a few bucks,” Wyden said in a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, 404 Media, Haaretz, NOTUS, and The New York Times.</p>
<p>Sen. Wyden said Google also deserves blame for refusing to follow Apple’s lead by removing companies’ ability to track phones.</p>
<p>“Google’s insistence on uniquely tracking Android users – and allowing ad companies to do so as well – has created the technical foundations for the surveillance economy and the abuses stemming from it,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>Georgetown Law’s Justin Sherman said the data broker and mobile ad industries claim there are protections in place to anonymize mobile location data and restrict access to it, and that there are limits to the kinds of invasive inferences one can make from location data. The data broker industry also likes to tout the usefulness of mobile location data in fighting retail fraud, he said.</p>
<p>“All kinds of things can be inferred from this data, including people being targeted by abusers, or people with a particular health condition or religious belief,” Sherman said. “You can track jurors, law enforcement officers visiting the homes of suspects, or military intelligence people meeting with their contacts. The notion that the sale of all this data is preventing harm and fraud is hilarious in light of all the harm it causes enabling people to better target their cyber operations, or learning about people’s extramarital affairs and extorting public officials.”</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>Privacy experts say disabling or deleting your device’s MAID will have no effect on how your phone operates, except that you may begin to see far less targeted ads on that device.</p>
<p>Any Android apps with permission to use your location should appear when you navigate to the Settings app, Location, and then App Permissions. “Allowed all the time” is the most permissive setting, followed by “Allowed only while in use,” “Ask every time,” and “Not allowed.”</p>
<p>Android users can delete their ad ID permanently, by opening the Settings app and navigating to Privacy &gt; Ads. Tap “Delete advertising ID,” then tap it again on the next page to confirm. According to the EFF, this will prevent any app on your phone from accessing the ad ID in the future. Google’s documentation on this is <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US&amp;ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_69276"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69276" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/android-ads-optout.png" alt="" width="650" height="589"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69276">Image: eff.org</p></div>
<p>By default, Apple’s iOS requires apps to ask permission before they can access your device’s IDFA. When you install a new app, it may ask for permission to track you. When prompted to do so by an app, select the “Ask App Not to Track” option. Apple users also can set the “Allow apps to request to track” switch to the “off” position, which will block apps from asking to track you.</p>
<div id="attachment_69278"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69278" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/applerequesttotrack.png" alt="" width="575" height="390"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69278">Apple’s Privacy and Ad Tracking Settings.</p></div>
<p>Apple also has its own targeted advertising system which is separate from third-party tracking enabled by the IDFA. To disable it, go to Settings, Privacy, and Apple Advertising, and ensure that the “Personalized Ads” setting is set to “off.”</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re the type of reader who’s the default IT support person for a small group of family or friends (bless your heart), it would be a good idea to set their devices not to track them, and to disable any apps that may have location data sharing turned on 24/7.</p>
<p>There is a dual benefit to this altruism, which is clearly in the device owner’s best interests. Because while <em>your</em> device may not be directly trackable via advertising data, making sure they’re opted out of said tracking also can reduce the likelihood that you are trackable simply by being physically close to those who <em>are</em>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/23/huaweis_harmonyos_next_launch/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/23/huaweis_harmonyos_next_launch/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41923387">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Huawei formally launched its home-brewed operating system, HarmonyOS NEXT, on Wednesday, marking its official separation from the Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>Huawei <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.huawei.com/cn/news/2024/10/harmonyos5">declared</a> it released and "officially started public beta testing" of the OS for some of its smartphones and tablets that run its own Kirin and Kunpeng chips.</p>
<p>Unlike previous iterations of HarmonyOS, HarmonyOS NEXT no longer supports Android apps.</p>

    

<p>Huawei maintains top Chinese outfits aren't deterred by that. It cited Meituan, Douyin, Taobao, Xiaohongshu, Alipay, and JD.com as among those who have developed native apps for the OS. In case you're not familiar, they're China's top shopping, payment, and social media apps.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/22/huawei_aims_harmony_os_at/">Huawei dangles developer incentives to sell Harmony OS around the world</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/03/huawei_harmonyos_2/">Huawei names first tablets, phones to run its Android-in-disguise HarmonyOS 2</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/22/tsmc_huawei_sanctions_report/">TSMC blows whistle on potential sanctions-busting shenanigans from Huawei</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/21/global_semiconductor_patents_surge/">China ramps up semiconductor patents amid US export restrictions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Huawei also claimed that at the time of its announcement, over 15,000 HarmonyOS native applications and meta-services were also launched. That's a nice number, but well short of the millions of apps found on the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store.</p>
<p>The Chinese tech player also revealed that the operating system has 110 million lines of code and claimed it improves the overall performance of mobile devices running it by 30 percent. It also purportedly increases battery life by 56 minutes and leaves an average of 1.5GB of memory for purposes other than running the OS.</p>

        


        

<p>If you like the sound of that performance boost on your smartphone or tablet – the OS runs on both, with a consistent interface – we're sorry to report that Huawei told us it currently has no plans to offer Harmony OS NEXT outside of China. That's despite <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/22/huawei_harmonyos_expansion/">previously saying</a> it planned to take an older version of HarmonyOS offshore.</p>

<p>Huawei did try to export the last version of the OS – and even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/22/huawei_aims_harmony_os_at/">offered</a> assistance to developers who coded for the platform and targeted offshore markets – without success.</p>
<p>But it has succeeded in having offshore entities develop for the platform: Singapore-based rideshare-and-more app Grab, and the airline Emirates, have created apps for the OS.</p>
<p>The release marks a moment in China's push for tech independence. Before the upgrade, Huawei's HarmonyOS still relied on the Android Open Source Project for core functionality – a move driven by 2019 US sanctions that blocked Huawei's access to Google Mobile Services. That dependency has now been ditched.</p>

        

<p>Huawei hopes to bring its OS to PCs, too. Last month the chair of the Chinese giant's consumer business group, Yu Chengdong, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/23/asia_tech_news_in_brief/">revealed</a> it would no longer run Windows on its future machines, but Harmony OS instead. When such machines will emerge, and whether other PC-makers will use the OS, are unanswered questions. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2 id="intro-to-hm">Intro to HM</h2>

<p>Damas-Hindley-Milner (HM) is a type system for Standard ML and the ML-family
languages. River and I <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/type-inference">wrote about it</a> earlier this
month. Check out that post if you would like an introduction or refresher. In
this post, we’ll add <em>row polymorphism</em> to it. We’ll do it in the context of
Algorithm J, but the core ideas should be algorithm-independent.</p>

<h2 id="records">Records</h2>

<p>A record is an unordered collection of <em>name</em> to <em>value</em> mappings, like <code>{ x =
1, y = "hello" }</code>. Scrapscript has a very dynamic notion of records in the
interpreter and the compiler: any record can have any number of fields, with
any names, with any values. This makes code like the following possible:</p>

<div><pre><code>get_x { x=1, y=2 }
. get_x =
  | { x=x, ... } -&gt; x
</code></pre></div>

<p>At run-time, the pattern matching looks for a field named <code>x</code> in the record and
ignores the rest. The spread (<code>...</code>) indicates that it’s okay to also have
other fields in the record. If the pattern were instead <code>{ x=x }</code>, then the
match would fail at run-time due to excess fields.</p>

<p>The following snippet also runs even though <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> have different
leftover record parts:</p>

<div><pre><code>get_x left + get_x right
. left  = { x = 1, y = 2 }
. right = { x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 }
. get_x = | { x = x, ... } -&gt; x
</code></pre></div>

<p>This “leftover” bit isn’t straightforward to model in the type system. We’ll
need some special sauce there.</p>

<p>Right now, in the type system, we don’t support records at all. If we try to
infer the type of one, it’ll fail with “unsupported” or something. We need to
model records in the type system.</p>

<h2 id="rows">Rows</h2>

<p>A lot of papers use a notion of <em>rows</em> to model records, kind of how you can
use cons cells to model lists. A <em>row</em> is a mapping of names to types, like
<code>{x=int, y=string}</code>. Rows also have a special field called <em>rest</em> which
contains the type of the leftover fields. It’s either a type variable or the
<em>empty row</em>.</p>

<p>Having the empty row means that the record has no leftover fields. In fact, the
example row above (<code>{x=int, y=string}</code>) is assumed to have the empty row as its
<em>rest</em> field because all of these papers love shorthand. If it were extensible,
if it had a type variable as its <em>rest</em> field, then it would be written as
<code>{x=int, y=string, ...'a}</code>.</p>

<p>This does mean that it’s possible to have nested rows like <code>{x=int,
...'a={y=string, ...'b}}</code>. This is normal but you’ll never see it in notation
because everybody <strong>implicitly flattens the rows</strong> because it looks nicer. Also
because unification happens on the flattened rows, but we’ll get there later.
Now let’s talk about the data structures we’ll use to implement rows. We’ll
reuse some of the data structures from the intro-to-HM post.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-structures">The data structures</h2>

<p>It’s as I said: a row is either an empty row (<code>TyEmptyRow</code>) or has fields and a
leftover/rest field (<code>TyRow</code>).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>(</span><span>MonoType</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>TyRow</span><span>(</span><span>MonoType</span><span>):</span>
    <span>fields</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>]</span>
    <span>rest</span><span>:</span> <span>TyVar</span> <span>|</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span> <span>=</span> <span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>field</span><span>(</span><span>default_factory</span><span>=</span><span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In order to unify and print rows, we’ll often deal with them in their flattened
representation, which is a collapsed tuple of fields and a rest type. One key
difference: because it is collapsed, the <em>rest</em> must be either the empty row or
an <strong>unbound</strong> type variable.</p>

<p>Also: not everybody uses the exact same representation. Some go for more
cons-cell-like representations where every row has a <code>label</code> and a <code>type</code> and
then a <code>rest</code>—no <code>fields</code> dict. They’re equivalent.</p>

<h2 id="inferring-record-literals">Inferring record literals</h2>

<p>When we’re inferring the type of a record literal, we infer the types of the
values and then construct a row from them. We should never see a <code>...</code> in a
record literal because we only support it in pattern matching.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>infer_type</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>:</span> <span>Object</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>:</span>

    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="pattern-matching-on-records">Pattern matching on records</h2>

<p>Pattern matching inference changed a little bit since the last post but not
enough to make a big deal out of it. We now use this kind-of-similar
<code>infer_pattern_type</code> function to infer the type of a pattern. It looks similar
to <code>infer_type</code> but it’s a little more complicated because it has to invent
fresh type variables for all variables in the pattern and it also has to deal
with spread.</p>

<p>In the case of records, we default to building a closed row. However, if we see
a spread, we invent a fresh type variable and use that as the <em>rest</em> of the
row.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>infer_pattern_type</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>:</span> <span>Object</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ...

                <span># Open row
</span>                <span>rest</span> <span>=</span> <span>fresh_tyvar</span><span>()</span>
                <span>if</span> <span>value</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
                    <span>ctx</span><span>[</span><span>value</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Forall</span><span>([],</span> <span>rest</span><span>)</span>
                <span>break</span>
            <span>fields</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>infer_pattern_type</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>set_type</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>,</span> <span>TyRow</span><span>(</span><span>fields</span><span>,</span> <span>rest</span><span>))</span>
    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We also bind the <em>rest</em> variable to the name of the spread, if it’s named. This
means we can do stuff like <code>| { x=x, ...rest } -&gt; something</code> and then use
<code>rest</code> in the <code>something</code> expression.</p>

<h2 id="unifying-rows-building-intuition">Unifying rows: building intuition</h2>

<p>I don’t want to get too into it yet, but I want to explain that rows aren’t
special in unification. I thought that there was some quirk or trick in the
representation that enabled row polymorphism, but that’s not the case <em>at all</em>
(shout-out to <a href="https://osa1.net/">Sinan</a> and <a href="https://k-monk.org/">River</a> for making this clear).</p>

<p>Unification is just unification. Whatever types it gets, it <em>will</em> make them
equal. Permanently. If it can’t, there’s a type error. Let’s look at some
examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> unifies with <code>{x=int}</code></li>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> <strong>does not</strong> unify with <code>{x=string}</code> because the types that
correspond with <code>x</code> don’t unify
    <ul>
      <li>Some type systems allow this by having a notion of “type sets” and I think
this might be related to polymorphic variants but I’m not sure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> <strong>does not</strong> unify with <code>{y=string}</code> because the fields don’t match
and they are not extensible</li>
  <li><code>{x=int, ...'a}</code> unifies with <code>{y=string, ...'b}</code>
    <ul>
      <li>unification will set <code>'a</code> equal to <code>{y=string, ...'c}</code> and <code>'b</code> equal to <code>{x=int, ...'c}</code></li>
      <li>note how they both get the same leftover row <code>'c</code> because they are
<em>unified</em> and supposed to <em>stay that way</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so that means that if you have a function that is meant to be generic
over a single field, how does that work? How can you have <code>| {x=x, ...} -&gt; x</code>
if for every call to that function, the type of <code>...</code> keeps expanding as it is
unified? It might start as <code>{x=int, ...'a} -&gt; int</code> but over time <code>'a</code> will get bound
to other row types and it might end up as <code>{x=int, y=int, z=int, ...'d}</code> and
that will be too restrictive! <em>What’s going on??</em></p>

<h2 id="let-polymorphism">Let polymorphism</h2>

<p>What’s actually happening is boring: let polymorphism strikes once again. We
talked about let polymorphism in the last post, but here’s a refresher: if you
have an unbound type variable in a let-bound function type, it will get
generalized with a <code>forall</code>.</p>

<p>Have a function <code>'a list -&gt; 'a</code>? Well, the type in the context (the environment
that deals in type variables) is actually <code>forall 'a. 'a list -&gt; 'a</code>. Every use
of that named function will <em>instantiate</em> that <code>forall</code> with a fresh type
variable (maybe <code>'b</code> or <code>'t123</code> or whatever). This means that the same function
can be generic over one or more type variables. Great.</p>

<p>So that pattern match function above? The one with type <code>{x=int, ...'a} -&gt;
int</code>? Well, if it’s bound to a name, it will get generalized to <code>forall 'a.
{x=int, ...'a} -&gt; int</code>. So every call, well… you know the rest. That’s row
polymorphism.</p>

<h2 id="unifying-rows-brass-tacks">Unifying rows: brass tacks</h2>

<p>Alright, well, assuming we have what I thought was the hard part done already,
let’s go over unification in excruciating detail. We’ll start with a neat
little base case: empty rows can only unify with other empty rows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>unify_type</span><span>(</span><span>ty1</span><span>:</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>,</span> <span>ty2</span><span>:</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>ty1</span><span>,</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>)</span> <span>and</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>ty2</span><span>,</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span>
    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Yay, nice. Let’s continue. We’ll start by flattenening the rows.</p>

<p>For every field name present in either row, we’ll try to unify the types
pairwise. But if it’s missing in one of the rows, we have to add it to the
other one. So we collect that in <code>ty1_missing</code> (missing from <code>ty1</code>) and
<code>ty2_missing</code> (missing from <code>ty2</code>).</p>

<p>This leaves us with four cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Both rows have all the same fields. In that case, we unify the <em>rest</em>s so
they stay the same.</li>
  <li>One row has all the same fields as the other and also some more. In that
case, add the missing fields to the other (smaller) row. Note that they
share a <em>rest</em>.</li>
  <li>The same, but flipped the other direction.</li>
  <li>They each have fields the other lacks. In that case, create new rows with
the missing fields and share a <em>rest</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now follow along in code:</p>

<p>There’s a lot of code but the important thing to know is that both rows are
going to end up with the same fields and the same rest type.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>There you have it. That constitutes row polymorphism. There’s some other stuff
we don’t need to get into because Scrapscript doesn’t have some language
features. For example, Daan Leijen of scoped labels fame <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41857230">jumped into the
Hacker News thread</a> to explain
why we might not need scoped/shadowed/duplicate labels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About duplicate labels.. one needs to retain the duplicate field at runtime
<em>if</em> there is a “remove_l” or “mask_l” operation that drops a field “l”. For
example, <code>{x=2,x=True}.remove_x.x</code> == <code>True</code>. (Where the type of <code>remove_l</code>
is <code>{l:a|r} -&gt; {r}</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we don’t have such a masking operation, our lives are easier. Cool.</p>

<p>We’ve heard that we can use rows to implement polymorphic variants, but haven’t
figured that part out yet…</p>

<!--
## Variants

Scrapscript supports variants or tags similar to OCaml's notion of [polymorphic
variants](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/polyvariant.html). We don't have any
encoding in the type system for these right now.

We're currently reading:

* [Programming with Polymorphic Variants](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-polymorphic_variants-ml98.pdf) (PDF, 1998)
* [Restrictable Variants: A Simple and Practical Alternative to Extensible Variants](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol263-ecoop2023/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2023.17/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2023.17.pdf) (PDF, 2003)

Please recommend additional papers, blog posts, and implementations.

      <p>The U.S. Forest Service is a federal agency that manages 193 million acres of land, an area about the size of Texas. Next year, the agency will have to manage that land without its seasonal workforce. In September, <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/september-2024-chiefs-all-employee-call-hiring-update">the agency announced</a> that it would be suspending all seasonal hiring for the 2025 season, a decision that will cut about 2,400 jobs. Nearly all of those positions are field-based jobs, ranging from biologists and timber workers to trail technicians and recreation staff. In addition, the agency is freezing all external hiring for permanent positions. The only exception to the hiring freeze are the roughly 11,300 firefighters hired by the agency every year.</p>
<p>According to the agency and its partners, the effects of these staffing cuts will be far-ranging and severe. In the September 17 all-employee call where he announced the hiring freeze, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore said “We just can’t get the same work done with fewer employees.” Though the Forest Service has been shedding jobs for decades—about 8,000 jobs in the last 20 years, Moore said—this will be the largest single-year staff cut in recent memory.</p>
<p>Seasonal employees perform vital fieldwork and research that extends beyond what many Americans consider the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. Rangers patrol whitewater rivers, rock climbing crags, and dangerous alpine summits. Biologists staff critical salmon fisheries. <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/appalachian-trail-hurricane-helene-damage/">Recreation crews maintain forest roads</a> and clean camp latrines. Employees of all types chip in as emergency firefighters when required. According to the American Avalanche Association, the staff cuts could leave some avalanche centers, which rely on the Forest Service for funding, understaffed this winter.</p>
<p>And then there are trails. According to the Government Accountability Office, the Forest Service has had a maintenance backlog for more than a decade, and oversees more miles of trail than it can maintain. Cutting the majority of its field-going trail staff will only make the issue worse.</p>
<p>“This policy will result in a burgeoning of the <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/stories/shortage-trail-builders-these-programs-can-help/">trail maintenance backlog</a>, both through lack of Forest Service staff attention to trail maintenance, but also through the loss of connection and relationships with partner organizations,” Mike Passo, the executive director of American Trails, a non-profit Forest Service partner, said in an email.</p>
<p><i>Backpacker </i>spoke to <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/skills/the-12-best-jobs-in-the-outdoors/">nearly a dozen permanent and seasonal Forest Service employees</a>, most on condition of anonymity, about their experiences with the staffing cuts. Several expressed concern that trail crews would simply be unable to operate. They described crews of six seasonal employees disappearing, leaving one or two permanent crew leaders left trying to make things work. One intern in the National Pathways program, designed to automatically place successful interns into a full-time position with the agency, said she’s been told her job offer will likely be revoked. Other trail workers at conservation corps and non-profits who saw Forest Service positions as a step up the career ladder are rethinking their priorities.</p>
<p>Danica Mooney-Jones, a trail crew leader who’s been with the Forest Service since 2021, is among those out of a job next year. Where she works, the trail crew staff will go from five to two, and the broader recreation program is being cut from 13 employees to just four.</p>

<p>“I moved across the country to work here, for a seasonal job,” she says. “We have people who have worked here for 10 years as seasonals, and made a career out of these positions. They trusted that the jobs wouldn’t go away.”</p>
<p>Now, she and her former co-workers have a tough choice to make: leave their communities to find a job in trails somewhere else, or stay put and find a new career. Mooney Jones considers herself lucky; armed with <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/skills/outdoor-first-aid/these-wilderness-medicine-myths-need-to-disappear/">wilderness EMT training</a>, she found a local winter job as a ski patroller. Still, the idea of leaving the Forest Service behind for good is sobering.</p>
<p>“I’d be really sad if this was the end of my trail career,” says Mooney-Jones. “I really love doing the work, I love seeing the product, and I’m very proud of the work that we do.”</p>
<p>Trail maintenance is important every season, but 2025 may prove an especially difficult year to cut down on the workers who make it happen. After Hurricane Helene, southern portions of the Appalachian Trail are closed due to blowdowns, landslides, and washed out bridges. According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, there are more than 2,000 trees to clear from the AT in Tennessee alone, and many Forest Service access roads from Georgia to Virginia are closed due to erosion and rockfall.</p>
<p>That’s just on the AT—a popular long-distance trail supported by a non-profit organization and hundreds of trained volunteers. Elsewhere in the southern US, lesser-known trails face similar conditions but rely solely on Forest Service staff in order to re-open.</p>
<p>The cuts also left employees and partners wondering how the budget shortfall became so dire after several promising years of funding increases.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Biden administration mandated a $15 per hour minimum wage for all federal employees, which raised wages for some entry-level Forest Service jobs. Over the past several years, the agency also converted about 1,300 seasonal non-fire positions into permanent jobs. <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/stories/issues/environment/on-the-front-lines-with-the-wildland-firefighters-protecting-the-west/">Wildland firefighters</a>, who now make up about half of the Forest Service’s workforce, received bonuses of up to $20,000 per year, which were temporarily funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. Several Forest Service employees said there was hope that pay raises for firefighters would eventually translate into raises for other field-going employees, as well.</p>
<p>But those short-term gains have all but disappeared, replaced by a sudden budget shortfall.</p>
<p>In March, the Forest Service requested $8.9 billion in funding, a $500 million jump from 2024’s $8.37 billion. By the summer, it was clear the agency was unlikely to receive it. In August, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore released a statement preparing the USFS for a reduced budget. With little evidence that Congress would pass a bill funding the government by the end of the year, Moore said in the September 17 all-employee call that “[the Forest Service] has an obligation to plan for the most conservative funding possibility.” A week later, Congress passed a continuing resolution that extended the 2024 funding levels through December 20.</p>
<p>The lowest number Moore referred to comes from the proposal from the House Interior Appropriations Committee, which sets spending limits for all federal land management agencies, including the Forest Service and National Park Service. This year’s proposal includes $8.43 billion for the Forest Service—technically a modest increase compared to 2024. But last year’s budget was boosted by an additional $945 million through pandemic-era stimulus bills, a funding source that has since dried up. And while the House proposal fully funds the firefighter pay raises, the proposed budget would still necessitate cuts elsewhere at the agency. All of these details muddy the financial picture, but compared to total funding in 2024, the agency could face a budget hole of nearly a billion dollars next year.</p>
<p>Because the Forest Service’s budget for next year is still not finalized, there is a chance the agency will fill some seasonal positions in the near future. “We are working closely with individual partners to explore creative solutions to fill gaps where we can. And we hope to have more hiring options in the coming year if additional funding becomes available,” Scott Owen, national press officer for the Forest Service, wrote in an email.</p>
<p>Even with these sobering financial details, it’s clear that the agency’s decision to balance the books by cutting seasonal jobs came as a shock to many employees.</p>
<p>“My trust has definitely taken a hit,” says Mooney-Jones. “I’d consider coming back to the Forest Service, but I’m not sure I could. It’s a balancing act between how I feel about how we’ve been treated and how much I love the forest.”</p>

In addition to exerting vast economic power, tech companies are stepping into roles normally preserved for governments and wreaking havoc on the democratic rule of law in the process. From cybersecurity to systems used for policing, elections, and military defense policy, tech companies large and small are playing an outsized role.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Her book illustrates this thesis with examples drawn from her experiences as a member of the European Parliament from 2009 to 2019 and as an engaged observer of tech culture while a fellow at</span><a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/"><span>&nbsp;Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center</span></a><span> and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/"><span>Stanford HAI</span></a><span>.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Here, Schaake discusses why ceding power to tech companies hurts democracy and outlines a few solutions from her book.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>In what ways are private companies increasingly taking on functions normally assumed by states?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In the digital realm, companies’ control of information, unfettered agency, and power to act have almost overtaken that of governments.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img data-entity-uuid="a6752446-11f5-443e-b62b-703202bf1efa" data-entity-type="file" src="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/the%20tech%20coup_0.jpg" width="600" height="912" alt="cover of the book the tech coup" loading="lazy"></p><p dir="ltr"><span>For example, in the private intelligence sector, companies like NSO Group Technologies with its Pegasus spyware products are creating and selling the capability to hack into people’s devices. This means that anyone with the financial resources to purchase Pegasus spyware can access the capabilities of intelligence services and hack into the very private information of political opponents, judges, journalists, critical employees, competitors, and others.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Another striking example is that of offensive cyber capabilities. In the name of defending their clients or their networks, companies are attacking hackers across borders, using “offense as defense.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>And notice that I’m talking not only about big tech companies</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>but also small ones, because there’s de facto power that comes from the development of digital technologies. Companies like NSO, or Clearview with its facial recognition software, or companies producing election technologies – these are not so-called Big Tech, but they are just as illustrative of some of the challenges that I’m pointing to, [such] as Elon Musk deciding who in Ukraine should and should not have access to Starlink internet connections.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So, we see that these capabilities, these decisions, and these powers that used to be the exclusive domain of the state are now seeping into the hands of private companies, but without the checks and balances that we want in societies that function by the rule of law.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What can be done to put democratic entities back in charge?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>First of all, there needs to be more awareness and understanding of the ways in which companies exert power over governance, democracy, and international law. And then we need to bring the same level of legal clarity, accountability mechanisms, and transparency measures to the digital realm that we expect around other innovations such as medicines, chemicals, foods, cars, or even processes such as the decision to engage in foreign conflict.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Let’s compare how the U.S. responded to the Ukraine war in the physical world versus in the cyber domain. As part of NATO, the U.S. is clear: It doesn’t want to see boots on the ground. But in the cyber domain, the U.S.’s offensive activities are ongoing. That political discrepancy can continue because of the legal gray zone in the digital realm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So, I’m saying that the legal frameworks that we rely on in other industries – as well as the approaches we take to the physical side of foreign conflict – need to be on par in the digital realm and need to keep pace with where the technology has gone. It’s basically about catching up through international law, regulations, and enforcement, to make sure that the ideas that we have about what a democratic mandate looks like, what accountability looks like, and what oversight looks like are actually meaningful whenever activities happen in the digital sphere.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>some extent, you’re calling for implementing traditional types of laws and regulations in the digital realm, but is there also a way in which you’re calling for something new – a reinvention of democratic governments to handle the challenges of digitization?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Yes,</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>there are a number of novel large- and small-scale changes I would recommend. For example, just as legislatures rely on independent legal teams to help draft legislation that will survive court challenges, they also need independent technology experts they can turn to for reliable information. Making tech expertise available to lawmakers would go a long way toward reducing lobbyists’ effectiveness and ensuring lawmakers understand how technology impacts issues like healthcare, education, justice, housing, and transportation. Because tech touches everything, lawmakers can’t get a handle on it by sitting in a single committee. They need to consult independent experts.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Another example: Governments are increasingly outsourcing all kinds of processes to tech companies. And if a tech company operates in the name of a government, it should be as accountable as the government. I call this “the public accountability extension.” It sounds simple, but it would be a huge game changer. Right now, as governments outsource more and more critical governmental functions to tech companies, they also offload governmental accountability.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>For example, in many jurisdictions, the police are not allowed to hack into the devices of suspects. Instead, they engage a hacking company that will do it for them. The police can then say they don’t hack, but they actually gain access by alternate means. Similarly, state and local governments in the United States aren’t constitutionally allowed to discriminate between citizens on the basis of sensitive categories, but oftentimes the technology they use does exactly that without being held accountable. A third example: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Journalists have the right to know what the government does in citizens’ name, but sometimes governments hire private companies to do government work or to collect and store government information, and if the companies don’t keep the information at the standard required of public entities, or if the companies are reluctant to provide information due to proprietary concerns, then the effectiveness of FOIA erodes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So, there are many examples of how governments essentially hide behind companies, including tech companies, to avoid accountability, and the accountability extension would address that.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>In your book, you point out another tension: tech companies’ energy use in the communities they enter. You note that the public needs greater insight to provide greater oversight over the data centers underlying our digital lives. What do you mean?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>There are no standards or reporting obligations requiring companies to say how much energy or water they’re using or plan to use. We have estimates from individual cases, but we don’t know the sum of data centers’ energy use.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>And often, big tech companies seeking to build data centers in a community will bid for those projects under a pseudonym – a company name that hides the fact that Amazon, Google, or Microsoft is behind the bid. The lawyers and consultants that tech companies hire to make these bids often paint a rosy picture of all the economic benefits that will accrue to communities that allow data centers to be built. They do their best to hide critical information about who they are and the data centers’ energy needs. And this complete lack of transparency regarding the use of scarce resources hinders transparent and good governance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We had some cases in the Netherlands where this was a big problem. Part-time city councilors had to make decisions about whether or not to allow a hyperscale data center in their territories. And they were up against billion-dollar companies and all their lawyers, accountants, consultants, and PR firms. The power asymmetry was enormous, and I think by standardizing the transparency and reporting requirements – including who is behind the projects and the metrics of energy use – this could become a much more fair public debate about the types of data centers a community can feasibly host.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>This increased transparency doesn’t begin to address whether society even wants more of these data centers using up scarce energy resources in an era of climate change. But we can’t answer that cost-benefit question if we don’t know what the cost is and all we’re told is benefit, benefit, benefit in some shady presentation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>And of course, the other real issue, especially in the U.S., is the capability of the power grids. In the Netherlands, which is an advanced economy, as in the U.S. and the U.K., we’ve already seen reports that the grids are functioning at near-emergency levels: code red. The grids are stretched to their limits. They break down and outages are more frequent. And yet there are many data centers in the pipeline that were agreed to years ago. When they come online in two or three years, we may face a wave of disaster.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk about the precautionary principle that’s already part of EU law and how it might help rein in tech company power, especially AI?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Basically, the precautionary principle requires a pause to assess the societal impact of an innovation when it is new and before it is widely deployed or implemented. It’s enshrined in EU law but hasn’t been invoked by the authorities for tech innovations like AI because there’s such a push to use AI and also because the EU has now passed a separate law that deals with AI.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But I think the precautionary principle is a useful concept to address situations where tech company engineers are themselves surprised by the behavior of AI models, or where society and lawmakers and citizens don’t know or understand how a particular innovation will impact their lives. So we’d like to create processes that actually serve the public by using the precautionary principle to assess and research before unintended but still preventable problems spread too widely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Have Americans been slow to understand the threat that tech companies pose to democracy?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Around the globe, there have been signs of the harms of tech companies’ power grab for a long time now, but Americans have tended to view them as distant events. People in Myanmar used Facebook to call for genocide in 2017. In 2018, we learned that Cambridge Analytica extracted and analyzed millions of Facebook users’ data and allowed political campaigns to use it for psychological profiling in ways that may have impacted the Brexit vote in the U.K. And then in 2020, there was the storming of the U.S. Capitol, which was in part fed by disinformation on social media that has led to tens of millions of Americans losing trust in the electoral process. So, some of the problems that people were facing elsewhere have come back to Americans quite late as a boomerang.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You invite all of us as democratic citizens to help shape an agenda that puts the survival of democratic principles ahead of short-term economic benefits.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Why Simone Giertz, the Queen of Useless Robots, Got Serious"><p>Simone Giertz came to fame in the 2010s by becoming the self-proclaimed “queen of shitty robots.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KEoMzNz8eYnwBC34RaKCQ" target="_blank">On YouTube</a> she demonstrated a hilarious series of self-built mechanized devices that worked perfectly for ridiculous applications, such as a headboard-mounted alarm clock with a rubber hand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXLzfAHl4-k&amp;list=PLFONC7byEU96gsPcOaWCp3CQxtEdOvgH4&amp;index=5" target="_blank">to slap the user awake</a>. </p><p>But <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/simone-giertz" target="_blank">Giertz</a> has parlayed her Internet renown into <a href="https://yetch-shop.fourthwall.com/" target="_blank">Yetch</a>, a design company that makes commercial consumer products. (The company name comes from how Giertz’s Swedish name is properly pronounced.) Her first release, a daily <a href="https://yetch-shop.fourthwall.com/products/every-day-goal-calendar" target="_blank">habit-tracking calendar</a>, was picked up by prestigious outlets such as the <a href="https://store.moma.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Art design store</a> in New York City. She has continued to make commercial products since, as well as one-off strange inventions for her online audience.  </p><p><strong>Where did the motivation for your useless robots come from?</strong></p><p><strong>Simone Giertz:</strong> I just thought that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/darpa-robotics-challenge-robots-falling" target="_blank">robots that failed</a> were really funny. It was also a way for me to get out of creating from a place of performance anxiety and perfection. Because if you set out to do something that fails, that gives you a lot of creative freedom. </p><p><strong>You built up a big online following. A lot of people would be happy with that level of success. But you moved into inventing commercial products. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Giertz: </strong>I like torturing myself, I guess! I’d been creating things for YouTube and for social media for a long time. I wanted to try something new and also find longevity in my career. I’m not super motivated to constantly try to get people to give me attention. That doesn’t feel like a very good value to strive for. So I was like, “Okay, what do I want to do for the rest of my career?” And developing products is something that I’ve always been really, really interested in. And yeah, it is tough, but I’m so happy to be doing it. I’m enjoying it thoroughly, as much as there’s a lot of face-palm moments. </p><p><img id="11444" data-rm-shortcode-id="b06fca5d370fd3feca45654908f84f06" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-graphical-illustration-of-a-calendar.jpg?id=53806043&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-graphical-illustration-of-a-calendar.jpg?id=53806043&amp;width=980" width="2000" height="2000" alt="A graphical illustration of a calendar."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Giertz’s every day goal calendar was picked up by the Museum of Modern Art’s design store. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Yetch </small></p><p><strong>What role does failure play in your invention process?</strong></p><p><strong>Giertz: </strong>I think it’s inevitable. Before, obviously, I wanted something that failed in the most unexpected or fun way possible. And now when I’m developing products, it’s still a part of it. You make so many different versions of something and each one fails because of something. But then, hopefully, what happens is that you get smaller and smaller failures. Product development feels like you’re going in circles, but you’re actually going in a spiral because the circles are taking you somewhere.  </p><p><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring inventors?</strong></p><p><strong>Giertz: </strong>Make things that <em><em>you</em></em> want. A lot of people make things that they think that other people want, but the main target audience, at least for myself, is me. I trust that if I find something interesting, there are probably other people who do too. And then just find good people to work with and collaborate with. There is no such thing as the lonely genius, I think. I’ve worked with a lot of different people and some people made me really nervous and anxious. And some people, it just went easy and we had a great time. You’re just like, “Oh, what if we do this? What if we do <em><em>this</em></em>?” Find those people.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><main id="primary"><!--[--><!----><!--[--><article><section><!----><!----><div><!--[--><div><p>Three decades ago, astronomers spotted one of the brightest exploding stars in more than 400 years. The titanic supernova, called Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A), blazed with the power of 100 million suns for several months following its discovery on Feb. 23, 1987.</p></div><div><p>Since that first sighting, SN 1987A has continued to fascinate astronomers with its spectacular light show. Located in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, it is the nearest supernova explosion observed in hundreds of years and the best opportunity yet for astronomers to study the phases before, during, and after the death of a star.</p></div><div><p>To commemorate the 30th anniversary of SN 1987A, new images, time-lapse movies, a data-based animation based on work led by Salvatore Orlando at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo, Italy, and a three-dimensional model are being released. By combining data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory, as well as the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), astronomers — and the public — can explore SN 1987A like never before.</p></div><div><p>Hubble has repeatedly observed SN 1987A since 1990, accumulating hundreds of images, and Chandra began observing SN 1987A shortly after its deployment in 1999. ALMA, a powerful array of 66 antennas, has been gathering high-resolution millimeter and submillimeter data on SN 1987A since its inception.</p></div><div><p>"The 30 years' worth of observations of SN 1987A are important because they provide insight into the last stages of stellar evolution," said Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, California.</p></div><div><p>The latest data from these powerful telescopes indicate that SN 1987A has passed an important threshold. The supernova shock wave is moving beyond the dense ring of gas produced late in the life of the pre-supernova star when a fast outflow or wind from the star collided with a slower wind generated in an earlier red giant phase of the star's evolution. What lies beyond the ring is poorly known at present, and depends on the details of the evolution of the star when it was a red giant.</p></div><div><p>"The details of this transition will give astronomers a better understanding of the life of the doomed star, and how it ended," said Kari Frank of Penn State University who led the latest Chandra study of SN 1987A.</p></div><div><p>Supernovas such as SN 1987A can stir up the surrounding gas and trigger the formation of new stars and planets. The gas from which these stars and planets form will be enriched with elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron, which are the basic components of all known life. These elements are forged inside the pre-supernova star and during the supernova explosion itself, and then dispersed into their host galaxy by expanding supernova remnants. Continued studies of SN 1987A should give unique insight into the early stages of this dispersal.</p></div><div><p>Some highlights from studies involving these telescopes include:</p></div><div><p>Hubble studies have revealed that the dense ring of gas around the supernova is glowing in optical light, and has a diameter of about a light-year. The ring was there at least 20,000 years before the star exploded. A flash of ultraviolet light from the explosion energized the gas in the ring, making it glow for decades.</p></div><div><p>The central structure visible inside the ring in the Hubble image has now grown to roughly half a light-year across. Most noticeable are two blobs of debris in the center of the supernova remnant racing away from each other at roughly 20 million miles an hour.</p></div><div><p>From 1999 until 2013, Chandra data showed an expanding ring of X-ray emission that had been steadily getting brighter. The blast wave from the original explosion has been bursting through and heating the ring of gas surrounding the supernova, producing X-ray emission.</p></div><div><p>In the past few years, the ring has stopped getting brighter in X-rays. From about February 2013 until the last Chandra observation analyzed in September 2015 the total amount of low-energy X-rays has remained constant. Also, the bottom left part of the ring has started to fade. These changes provide evidence that the explosion's blast wave has moved beyond the ring into a region with less dense gas. This represents the end of an era for SN 1987A.</p></div><div><p>Beginning in 2012, astronomers used ALMA to observe the glowing remains of the supernova, studying how the remnant is actually forging vast amounts of new dust from the new elements created in the progenitor star. A portion of this dust will make its way into interstellar space and may become the building blocks of future stars and planets in another system.</p></div><div><p>These observations also suggest that dust in the early universe likely formed from similar supernova explosions.</p></div><div><p>Astronomers also are still looking for evidence of a black hole or a neutron star left behind by the blast. They observed a flash of neutrinos from the star just as it erupted. This detection makes astronomers quite certain a compact object formed as the center of the star collapsed — either a neutron star or a black hole — but no telescope has uncovered any evidence for one yet.</p></div><div><p>The Chandra program is managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, controls Chandra's science and flight operations.</p></div><div><p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency).

Perhaps one of the more surprising changes in the 6.12-rc4 development
kernel was <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6e90b675cf94">the removal
of several entries</a> from the kernel's </p><tt>MAINTAINERS</tt><p> file.  The <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/2024101835-tiptop-blip-09ed@gregkh/">patch</a>
performing the removal was sent (by Greg Kroah-Hartman) only to the
patches@lists.linux.dev mailing list; the change was included in <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/ZxUH2J0BL3FCV6Hr@kroah.com/">a char-misc drivers
pull request</a> with no particular mention.
</p><p>
The explanation for the removal is simply "<q>various compliance
requirements</q>".  Given that the developers involved all appear to be of
Russian origin, it is not too hard to imagine what sort of compliance is
involved here.  There has, however, been no public posting of the policy
that required the removal of these entries.<br clear="all"></p><hr>

<p>This summer, I participated in a human challenge trial at the University of Maryland. I spent the days just prior to my 30th birthday sick with shigellosis.</p>



<h2>What? Why?</h2>



<p>Dysentery is an acute disease in which pathogens attack the intestine. It is most often caused by the bacteria <em>Shigella</em>. It spreads via the fecal-oral route. It requires an astonishingly low number of pathogens to make a person sick – so it spreads quickly, especially in bad hygienic conditions or anywhere water can get tainted with feces.</p>



<p>It kills about 70,000 people a year, 30,000 of whom are children under the age of 5. Almost all of these cases and deaths are among very poor people.</p>



<p>The primary mechanism by which dysentery kills people is dehydration. The person loses fluids to diarrhea and for whatever reason (lack of knowledge, energy, water, etc) cannot regain them sufficiently. Shigella bacteria are increasingly resistant to antibiotics. A disease easily treatable by lots of fluids and antibiotics is becoming more lethal.</p>



<p>Can someone do something?</p>



<h2>The deal with human challenge trials</h2>



<p>Clinical trials in general are expensive to run but pretty common; clinical trials <em>where you are given the disease </em>– “challenged”, AKA “human challenge trials” – are very rare. The regular way to investigate a possible treatment is to make a study plan, then find people who have the disease and offer to enroll them in the experimental treatment. Challenge trials are less common, but often more valuable for research – shigellosis is a fast-acting disease that is imminently treatable by antibiotics and uncommon in the US. It would be very difficult to test an alternative shigellosis treatment in the US in the conventional way, but it’s a great candidate for challenge trials.</p>



<p>I’d signed up for email alerts on upcoming challenge trials at the nearby University of Maryland, and got one about an upcoming study. It caught my eye that it was for a phage-based treatment. Bacteriophages are really promising antibacterial medicines, not to mention what I’d studied as an undergrad.</p>



<p>Here’s the thing: you really only get good medical research out of human subjects. Also, I could use $4000 and this seemed like a cool way to spend a couple weeks and help out medical research. So I signed up, got a check-in general health appointment, and shortly after, was told I was in. I made plans to spend my 30<sup>th</sup> birthday in a dysentery ward.</p>



<h2><strong>Dysentery: it’s a modern disease</strong></h2>



<p>Many of you reading this will know about dysentery from the 1971 simulation game The Oregon Trail (or its later versions). The actual Oregon Trail was a network of trails and the corresponding migration of mostly-white pioneers, moving on foot and on ox-drawn wagon from the eastern US to the western US between 1830 and 1869. About 400,000 people* crossed the Oregon Trail in this period, and a lot of them were on similar trails – a bunch of stressed and malnourished people, traveling in close quarters with their families, stopping and pooping near the same trails and creeks with no regard for water safety – diseases spread <em>very </em>fast in these conditions. From these and other stressors, about 65,000 people died in this 40-year period.</p>



<p>Stated another way, more people die from dysentery <em>now, every year </em>than <em>ever died from any cause</em> on the Oregon Trail. So let’s calm down about the Oregon Trail, okay?</p>



<p>*Lots of people use this 400,000 number but I can’t figure out where it came from and if this is referring to individuals or families – I’ve seen sources indicate it was either. If it was families, it was probably counting the men who were “the pioneers” and then being like “oh and there were women and kids there also, I guess.” But maybe it was individuals? Or maybe someone just made this up? Again, no idea where it came from. You gotta be careful every time anyone tells you a number. It’s so bad out there. The only thing worse than someone telling you a number is when they don’t tell you a number.</p>



<h2><strong>Getting ready</strong></h2>



<p>A week or so before I went, I’d been pointed to<a href="https://x.com/wokeglobaltimes/status/1510768591012085768"> Jake Eberts’s twitter thread</a>. Jake Eberts also participated in a challenge trial for a dysentery vaccine, also I think at UMD and the same Baltimore facility I was at, where he got very sick and<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paigeskinner/man-twitter-dysentery-trial"> went viral</a> for livetweeting the experience. He started a fundraiser for dysentery relief and got a lot of people to sign up for clinical trials themselves, and now he works for<a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/"> 1DaySooner</a>, premier “hey, human challenge trials are cool” advocates.</p>



<p>I read his twitter thread and sent my friends this meme:</p>

<p>I brought <em>Infinite Jest</em>, which I was partway through and was a lot more through (but still not done) by the time I was discharged. (I’m writing this while traveling, and in a fit of poor timing I finally finished it on the plane ride in, which means I now have a giant brick of a book to carry around in my suitcase.) My friend Ozy said that <em>Infinite Jest</em> was a really good book for reading in a dysentery ward.</p>



<p>I thought, oh, that’s interesting, you know, a lot of the characters <em>are </em>pretty miserable and living in a controlling institution of some kind. Then I remembered this one passage, where circumstances have forced a character into withdrawing from heroin alone, holed up for days in a public bathroom:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Time began to pass with sharp edges. Its passage in the dark or dim-lit stall was like time being carried by a procession of ants, a gleaming red martial column of those militaristic red Southern-U.S. ants that build hideous tall boiling hills, and each vile gleaming ant wanted a minuscule little portion of Poor Tony’s flesh in compensation as it helped bear time slowly forward down the corridor of true Withdrawal. By the second week in the stall time itself seemed the corridor, lightless at either end. After more time time then ceased to move to be moved or be move-throughable and assumed a shape above and apart, a huge, must-feathered, orange-eyed wingless fowl hunched incontinent atop the stall, with a kind of watchful but deeply uncaring personality that didn’t seem keen on Poor Tony Krause as a person at all, or to wish him well. Not one little bit. It spoke to him from atop the stall, the same things, over and over. They were unrepeatable. Nothing in even Poor Tony’s grim life-experience prepared him for the experience of time with a shape and an odor, squatting; and the worsening physical symptoms were a spree at Bonwit’s compared to time’s black assurances that the symptoms were merely hints, signposts pointing up at a larger, far more dire set of Withdrawal phenomena that hung just overhead by a string that unraveled steadily with the passage of time. It would not keep still and would not end; it changed shape and smell.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was forced to agree that <em>Infinite Jest </em>was indeed probably a pretty good choice.</p>



<h2><strong>Two days until challenge</strong></h2>



<p>Checking in, everyone’s bags were checked. I got the impression they really didn’t want some kind of bad outcome where they had to call cops into a ward where everyone was running around with the bloody flux, which, fair enough. They did take away my craft scissors. I didn’t end up knitting so it wasn’t a big deal but like I’m pretty sure I’ve taken those on airplanes before. Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were assigned a number (I was just on this side of divinity at No. 107), given a plastic wristband, and shown to our rooms. We were also given two pairs of scrubs which were to be our main clothes on the ward – less risk of ruining hard-to-launder clothes in the more messy phases of the study – though it did mean 15 people having to coordinate laundry every day.</p>

<p>The ward was more of a retrofitted office building than a hospital. It consisted of some spaces for nurses and testing, about 6 bedrooms of various sizes (each with their own half-bath), two separate areas with two shower stalls each, a “kitchen” with snacks and where the meals were delivered to, a closet with washer and dryer, and a rec room with couches and a TV and a pool and foosball table.</p>



<p>There were about 16 people on the ward, an even mix of men and women. Most of them were Baltimore locals; many of them had done other trials before. We were fully allowed to socialize – dysentery is, again, infectious through the fecal-oral route, hand sanitizer was stationed all over the place but there wasn’t a huge concern that we’d infect each other or even the nurses.</p>



<p>Life on the ward is very chill. I was worried about being bored, but I’d forgotten that I spend most of my waking hours on the computer anyway, so it really wasn’t a problem. When even my iron gaze faltered and couldn’t stare at the computer anymore, I read Infinite Jest.</p>



<p>Meals were delivered once a day – one cold usually wrap- or sandwich-based meal, one hot breakfast, one hot supper dish, labelled with people’s numbers.</p>

<p>They were, like, fine. The caterers made a few interesting choices – for vegetarians such as myself, every sandwich/wrap was some veggies with hummus, and now and then there’d be like breakfast pancakes with a curry-flavored veggie hamburger patty. I would describe the flavor when drenched with table syrup as “weird.”</p>



<p>Like, you can <em>tell </em>the person planning that menu was like “okay, pancakes and bacon… And wait, crap, something with protein for the vegetarians.” But again, I’ve eaten worse for things I’ve actually paid for ingredients for, and I was definitely eating better in terms of variety and volume than I did at home. I’m not complaining.</p>



<h2>One day before challenge: the age of phage</h2>



<p>This study was sort of an over-time test – ideally the first of a few, where we’d get phages before (unless we were in the control group), during, and after the “challenge” (the shigella) to see if they had any effect at all – if it did, later studies could determine if you could just drink the phage after getting sick, or if it would work best as a prophylactic, or etc. We drank a chalky buffer solution to neutralize stomach acid and give the bacteriophages (and later, the bacteria) a better chance at making it to the intestine.</p>



<p>What do the solutions taste like? Basically all salty fluid with slight mineral nuance, from the buffer. Phages are known to be pretty tasteless so I didn’t expect anything else.</p>



<h2>Bacteriophage therapy: sending a cat after mice</h2>



<p>A bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria. They were discovered shortly after bacteria themselves were really pinned down – microscopes were finally powerful enough to make out bacteria, and visionaries like Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur were pinpointing that these little nothing-pinpricks were in fact the source of diseases. (For more on the discovery of the microbial world, see<a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/through-the-looking-glass"> “Through the Looking Glass and what Zheludev Et Al. (2024) Found There”</a>, my recent piece in Asterisk Magazine.)</p>



<p>In 1917, Félix d’Hérelle found an agent that killed cholera bacteria, which passed through a fine filter, and which could reproduce – a living agent that killed bacteria, but that was itself smaller than a bacteria.</p>



<p>d’Hérelle realized right away this substance which killed bacteria, and which people had apparently been drinking, had potential as medicine. He bred pathogenic bacteria in vats and added solutions, and waited until the cloudy brother of bacteria turned clear – then offered this liquid to sick patients. Many of them, sure enough, recovered. I was (unless I was in the control group) walking in historical footsteps. Dysentery was the first human disease ever treated with phage medicine.</p>



<p>Sending a phage after bacteria is like sending a cat after mice. Phages are small, targeted, well-adapted hunters of specific bacteria. There is no way for them to infect a human cell like a human virus would – they are completely specialized. Phages are already in the body, along with their bacterial hosts – so you’re not introducing a radically new agent – and the immune system tends to play well with them.</p>



<p>Phage are used widely in some parts of the world – the Republic of Georgia and Poland both sell phage over-the-counter, for use in say intestinal conditions or wounds, and have<a href="https://www.phagetherapycenter.com/"> clinics for personalized treatment</a>. In the US, phage therapy is an extremely rare specialty, sometimes even falling under the umbrella of naturopathy. (A phage being a natural bioactive product.)</p>



<p>Why would you use antibiotics instead of phages, or vice versa?</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Phages</td><td>Antibiotics</td></tr><tr><td>Targeted – a phage attacks one species or one strain of bacteria <br>Easy to find usable new ones <br>More finnicky (e.g. less stable) <br>Predator-prey pharmacokinetics <p>Mostly spread where the bacteria are<br>Very few side effects</p></td><td>Broad-spectrum<p>Hard to find usable new ones <br>Shelf stable <br>Regular blood-elimination-curve pharmacokinetics <br>Systemic; enter the bloodstream <br>Sometimes-serious side effects</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>What if the bacteria become resistant to the phages too?</p>



<p>Well, that can happen easily – probably even easier than with antibiotics. Cells have been duking it out with viruses since the beginning of life. (Did you know CRISPR-Cas9, now used for gene editing, evolved in nature as a way for bacteria to recognize and cut up phage DNA?)</p>



<p>But the difference is that whereas new antibiotics are very hard to find, there is a nigh-inexhaustible evolutionary font of phages constantly pulling ahead in the arms race. So in short: once a bacteria becomes resistant to your special phage, just find a new phage.</p>



<h2><strong>Do they work?</strong></h2>



<p>To my knowledge, there aren’t any really gold-standard reviews comparing phages head-on to antibiotics. They are fiddlier than antibiotics, with a specialized body of knowledge for treatment – less stable, have to be introduced to the site directly, much more care in choosing an appropriate treatment.</p>



<p>One small study found a phage treatment comparably effective to antibiotics for <em>Salmonella typhimirium </em>in 36 lab mice.<sup data-fn="93b3a86a-3d76-4aee-b928-9cafbaf0f6a0"><a href="#93b3a86a-3d76-4aee-b928-9cafbaf0f6a0" id="93b3a86a-3d76-4aee-b928-9cafbaf0f6a0-link">1</a></sup> Another meta-study compared modern antibiotic studies to 17 studies from the last time human phage research was in vogue in the US, the 1920s-40s, and found that phages were effective treatments – but 4 modern clinical trials suggested phages were not effective.<sup data-fn="0bdd1add-8828-4f5d-837b-5b564c4baf50"><a href="#0bdd1add-8828-4f5d-837b-5b564c4baf50" id="0bdd1add-8828-4f5d-837b-5b564c4baf50-link">2</a></sup> A more recent study of personalized phage therapy showed promising results in infections considered “difficult-to-treat”.<sup data-fn="e69bd4e0-b087-4432-8149-23a8866b6099"><a href="#e69bd4e0-b087-4432-8149-23a8866b6099" id="e69bd4e0-b087-4432-8149-23a8866b6099-link">3</a></sup> They seem to work best when used <em>with </em>antibiotics.</p>



<p>I’m not doing a full lit review right now. I bet that phage therapy still has promise – more careful formulations and just more research will help. That’s before challenges of commercial rollout, including things like handling FDA approval for a product that must be reformulated regularly.</p>



<p>The elephant in the room is antibiotic resistance – antibiotics usually work extremely well, but increasingly, bacteria can survive them. Antibiotic resistance is, unlike other diseases you might think of that are exacerbated by over-medication, <em>not </em>a condition of privileged countries – lots of <em>Shigella </em>bacteria in developing countries are increasingly antibiotic-resistant.</p>



<p>Even if phages don’t work as well as the magic silver bullet that is antibiotics, they might work well enough to be worth incorporating into our medical toolbox as part of AMR management. And that means developing them now.</p>



<p>The other challenge is of course regulatory – I’m excited that <a href="https://www.intralytix.com/">Intralytix</a>, who made the experimental product I did-or-didn’t take, is throwing their hat into the space of human phage medicine, and to see how they handle this.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 1 of challenge</strong></h2>



<p>On the third day in the ward after a day of baseline and a day of phage (unless we were in the control group), we took another dose of phage (unless we were in the control group), waited a couple of hours, and then drank a glass of shigella. This tasted like baking soda and salt with no particular nuance, nor would I expect nuance; the dose was some 1300 organisms – as in 1300 individual cells of bacteria, count ‘em. A preposterously scant microbial innoculum, even for devoted parasites it often takes on the order of millions of organisms to lodge an infection – but shigella is remarkably tenacious. It would only have taken 10-200. This was overkill – a dose that WILL make you sick, unless you’re protected. All the participants drank.</p>



<h2>The waiting game</h2>



<p>Shigella has a 24-72 hour incubation period, maybe 12-96 hours on the far ends.</p>



<p>Perhaps owing to quirks of my own psyche, whose origins I’m sure we don’t need to explore here, I find it reassuring to have reference experiences to conveniently benchmark the rest of my life by. If you go skiing, you can ask yourself later, “is this more or less exhilarating than skiing?” If you fall in love once, you can compare future loves to that earlier experience.</p>



<p>A good standard reference point for “shared, resigned dread” is the 72 or so hours in a clinical trial ward after everyone has ingested shigella bacteria along with maybe-a-treatment.</p>



<p>The vibes were ominous. Jovially nervous. Unprecedented gastrointestinal distress may or may not have been coming for me, but if it is, it would be arriving in (on average) 48 hours.</p>



<p>The floor was pretty quiet. The hours ticked by.</p>



<p>Infinite Jest is, by the way, a great book. David Foster Wallace knew how to write a goddamn sentence on purpose.</p>



<h2><strong>Let’s learn about </strong><strong><em>Shigella </em></strong><strong>pathogenesis</strong></h2>



<p>While I waited, I decided to read up. Shigella bacteria invades the body via the digestive canal, and infects the intestines – both small and large. It releases a toxin that facilitates its infection of other parts of the intestine and its eventual replication. It’s an intracellular pathogen – some bacteria, like all viruses, actually enter the host’s cell and replicate inside there.</p>



<p>Shigella actually prefers to invade the <em>outside </em>(or should I say the inside?) of intestinal cells. But the body is a locked-down system with its own guard force, the immune system, keeping the dirty external environment separate from the sterile inside environment. Shigella in the digestive tract really wants to poke through that line of intestinal cells and get at them from the other side.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella_flexneri">Wikipedia explains:</a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once inside of the colon, <em>S. flexneri</em> can penetrate the epithelium in three ways: <br>1) The bacterium can alter the tight junctions between the epithelial cells, allowing it to cross into the sub-mucosa. <br>2) It can penetrate the highly endocytic<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfold_cell"> M cells</a> that are dispersed in the epithelial layer and cross into the sub-mucosa. <br>3) After reaching the sub-mucosa, the bacteria can be phagocytosed by macrophages and induce apoptosis, cell death. This releases<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"> cytokines</a> that recruit<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil"> polymorphonuclear cells (PMN)</a> to the sub-mucosa. <em>S. flexneri</em> still in the lumen of the colon traverse the epithelial lining as the PMNs cross into the infected area. The influx of PMN cells across the epithelial layer in response to Shigella disrupts the integrity of the epithelium allowing lumenal bacteria to cross into the sub-mucosa in an M-cell independent mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is really funny. Okay, imagine there’s a blockade of tightly parked police cars facing you and you and your buddies need to go get to their trunks so you can hide in them. Here are 3 ways to do this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Push the police cars to the side so you can walk between them</li>



<li>Look for the police cars with the biggest doors, so that you can squeeze through the car and leave through their trunk (or I guess probably just stay in the trunk at that point)</li>



<li>Get yourself and your buddies arrested, then when they send backup police vans to push through the police to arrest all of you, run through the cracks in the blockade that those vans open up. Then go to the trunks of the original cop cars.</li>
</ol>



<p>And then once you’re inside the car, you can open the doors between the cop cars (they’re sliding doors) and then travel laterally between the cop cars. I love cells.</p>



<hr>



<p>As a fun side note, <em>Shigella –</em> including the strain I was developing an intimate relationship with,<em> Shigella flexneri – </em>is, taxonomically speaking, a kind of <em>Escherichia coli.</em> Now you may notice from the scientific nomenclature that this is not how this is supposed to work.</p>



<p>When genotyping was developed and applied to some familiar standby kinds of bacteria that microbiology-as-science figured it understood pretty well, researchers learned two surprising new things:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>E. coli</em> is not a coherent species. Different strains of <em>E. coli</em> – known to have slightly different properties, but thought to be all slight variations on the same basic species – turned out to have only <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2974192/">20% of their genes</a> in common. (Humans and our closest relatives, chimpanzees, have almost all of our genes in common* and still aren’t considered as the same <em>genus</em>.)</li>



<li><em>Shigella </em>is in that umbrella of shared genes – a secret family member known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon_in_disguise">taxon in disguise</a>. It’s more similar to many <em>E. colis </em>than some <em>E. coli</em>s.</li>
</ul>



<p>For most species, the procedure at this point would be to throw in the towel and reclassify – <em>Escherichia coli spp. shigella</em>, perhaps. But in this case, shigatoxin-producing <em>Shigella </em>and other pathogenic <em>Escherichia coli </em>have different enough clinical presentations that the distinction is still medically valuable, so accurate nomenclature has bowed its head to practicality. Cool! (Compare and contrast with <a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">trees</a>.)</p>



<p>*Wait, don’t people talk about 99% or something? That number is actually about <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/comparison-human-and-chimpanzee-genomes-reveals-striking-similarities-and-differences"><em>sequence similarity</em></a><em> </em>and not related genes – if we have 96% sequence similarity, meaning the exact same genetic code, probably even more of that genome is still <em>in related genes. </em>Genes can code for clearly related proteins/sequences and still not be identical, like they came from a common ancestor and haven’t diverged much but have picked up a few changes along the way. Different<em> E. coli</em> have 80% completely different genes – a human has maaaybe 50 genes that a chimp doesn’t? I didn’t try very hard to find the actual similar metric between them. It’s what I was telling you about numbers. You gotta watch out.</p>



<h2><strong>Let’s really learn about Shigella pathogenesis</strong></h2>



<p>Some 24 hours in, the first people started going down. Via word of mouth I heard the phrase “Exorcist-style projectile vomiting” used to describe someone in the next room over, a description whose accuracy I fortunately cannot verify. Most people were in their rooms all day anyhow, but the crowd in the kitchen at mealtimes or showing up for morning dosing got thinner.</p>



<p>I really held out. Going to bed at end of the second night, I felt okay, but couldn’t sleep well – nerves, I thought, or the faint distorted unpleasant bodily noises from other parts of the ward. I maybe managed a couple hours of sleep by the wee hours.</p>



<p>48 hours in, I woke up for vitals and dosing at 6 AM and started feeling really faint on the short walk to the next room. I stumbled over to the toilet. Off to the races!</p>



<p>I should be clear in this section that I was in as close to zero long-term danger as you can get with dysentery, which is damn close – this was in a controlled setting with doctors and nurses, monitoring my condition regularly, with a known pathogen with a known cure. In this case, we weren’t expected to languish in indefinite misery – they wanted to see if we got sick and then how sick we got, yes, but only up to a point, at which point they would “call it” – administer regular antibiotics and end our experimental treatment.</p>



<p>All I had to do was let the time pass.</p>



<p>The next few hours were very bad. Surprisingly, the gastrointestinal symptoms were not much of a problem for me – I had them, but it wasn’t much worse than those of regular food poisoning. I didn’t throw up. I just wanted to go back to sleep.</p>



<p>But sleep wasn’t coming.</p>



<p>First was the plague of chills. The institutional cotton blankets did nothing; four of them also did nothing, as if there was no heat to hold in. Freezing, tooth-clattering cold.</p>



<p>Within an hour came the plague of joint pain. It sank in rather quickly and was all in the lower extremities – hips, legs. Any more than one blanket became too heavy to bear having on them, so off they go, freezing cold but they weren’t palpably doing anything anyway. Right? I remembered reading people with chronic pain reporting that sometimes laying down was worse than other positions, and sure enough sitting up was – somehow – mildly better. I situated the adjustable bedside table so that I could slump onto it and maybe even sleep like that, but sleep remained out of reach.</p>



<p>Time wasn’t shitting so much as dragging, by the bones, over rough pavement, every second another six inches, grating, relentless, second after second after second. Time is space in which you are moved forward one way or another. Pain is an active process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around three hours later, the doctor came in and judged that I was done – they were calling it – symptomatically I had reached the Clinical Endpoint and would be treated. I was handed tylenol and antibiotics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d always thought of tylenol as sort of a second-rate painkiller, probably worth trying if you couldn’t find ibuprofen, but damn if that tylenol didn’t work pretty quickly. As soon as I could I went to sleep for like four hours – which, as usual, if you are in a position of needing four hours of sleep, makes a lot of things better and more manageable once you can swing it.</p>



<h2><strong>Out the other side</strong></h2>



<p>The antibiotics worked <em>really</em> quickly. Within hours, the fever had vanished and the aches had dwindled to twinges. Within a couple days, even the gastrointestinal situation was back to normal. Other people were harder hit, other people were just starting to get sick – staying vanished in their rooms even after I stuck my head into the kitchen and rec rooms like the first hopeful groundhog of spring – and many had been fine the whole time.</p>



<p>The thing that kills people in dysentery is dehydration and complications thereof. So part of the recovery is collecting and measuring how many fluids were emitted, and then re-administering oral rehydration fluid – a salty liquid served ice-cold – in precise ratios to replace the bodily fluids lost. A human is a series of tubes with attached nervous system and fortunately I was in the company of master plumbers. Once the diarrhea had stopped, I was also able to stop guzzling big plastic cups of what I liked to imagine tasted like arctic seawater. Progress!</p>

<p>People who recovered and who never got sick started hanging out in the rec room more, chatting and playing pool. I spent my birthday calling my parents and talking to internet friends. One streamed himself playing a fish-themed video game in my honor. The Baltimoreans inexplicably set off fireworks many nights – maybe the proximity to July 4<sup>th</sup>? – and this was one of them. Not roadside-stand-ground fireworks, but big aerial fireworks. A fellow subject found ice cream bars in the kitchen freezer and kindly brought me one as a present. Fireworks aside, it was a quiet day.</p>



<p>Apologies for the deception, reader. Technically speaking, the word “dysentery” usually refers to a syndrome, like “psychosis” or “high blood pressure”, which can have multiple causes but which is defined by specific symptoms. The specific symptom of dysentery is bloody diarrhea. I personally did not get this particular symptom – I became sick with <em>shigellosis </em>but, according to a common criteria, did not get <em>dysentery</em>. I’m sorry for clickbaiting you. In my defense, I would have taken it over the joint pain.</p>



<h2><strong>Aftermath</strong></h2>



<p>Twice a day after antibiotics, we gave the nurses a stool sample – these were sampled and cultured at some lab to determine if shigella was still in there. Two negative samples in a row meant that we were free to go.</p>



<p>9 days after coming in, I was cleared for release. I collected my scissors, and, free of dysentery, was released onto the streets of Baltimore. A year older on paper. Healthy, wrung out, ready for time to keep doing what it does. Hopefully, mostly on kinder terms.</p>

<p>I think that despite my relatively mild case, that I was in the control group. But the reason I think that was because in the whole trial, everyone drank the shigella, it sure seemed like about half of them didn’t get sick.</p>



<p>Pretty goddamn cool, if you ask me.</p>

  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>(CNN) —</strong> The 80-year-old communications engineer from Texas had saved for decades, driving around in an old car and buying clothes from thrift stores so he’d have enough money to enjoy his retirement years.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But as dementia robbed him of his reasoning abilities, he began making online political donations over and over again — eventually telling his son he believed he was part of a network of political operatives communicating with key Republican leaders. In less than two years, the man became one of the country’s largest grassroots supporters of the Republican Party, ultimately giving away nearly half a million dollars to former President Donald Trump and other candidates. Now, the savings account he spent his whole life building is practically empty.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The story of this unlikely political benefactor is one of many playing out across the country.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->More than 1,000 reports filed with government agencies and consumer advocacy groups reviewed by CNN, along with an analysis of campaign finance data and interviews with dozens of contributors and their family members, show how deceptive political fundraisers have victimized hundreds of elderly Americans and misled those battling dementia or other cognitive impairments into giving away millions of dollars — far more than they ever intended. Some unintentionally joined the ranks of the top grassroots political donors in the country as they tapped into retirement savings and went into debt, contributing six-figure sums through thousands of transactions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To provide a snapshot of who these vulnerable donors are and how much money they have lost to increasingly aggressive fundraising campaigns, reporters reached out to more than 300 of the biggest and most frequent small-dollar political donors and their family members. Through these interviews and consumer complaints, reporters collected the accounts of more than 50 unwitting elderly donors and traced the path of where their money went.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Often coming in $5 or $10 at a time, contributions from this small sampling of donors alone added up to more than $6 million over the last five years — the majority of which ended up with Trump and a long list of other Republican candidates, CNN found.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
        
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While this is a small fraction of the billions raised by political campaigns, for many of the individuals who made the donations, the sums represented huge portions of their life savings.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

While <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/age-generational-cohorts-and-party-identification/" title="studies show">studies show</a> that older Americans tend to lean more Republican, both parties have continued to rake in donations from elderly voters. And mainstream Republican candidates have only doubled down on this strategy, using more aggressive and predatory tactics than those used by Democrats, according to donor complaints, interviews with experts and a review of solicitations. The Republican fundraising machine has been subject to more than 800 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission since 2022 — nearly seven times more than the number of complaints lodged against the other side.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“The fact there are lots of complaints means this is likely a huge problem,” said Prentiss Cox, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former manager of consumer protection at the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, when presented with CNN’s reporting. “From a consumer protection standpoint, this raises red flag level concerns about consumer misinformation and deception.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Donors identified by CNN were often in their 80s and 90s. They included retired public workers, house cleaners and veterans, widows living alone, nursing home residents and people who donated more money than they paid for their homes, according to records and interviews.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The money they gave came from pensions, Social Security payments and retirement savings accounts meant to last decades. Donors took out new credit cards and mortgages to pay for the contributions. In some cases, they gave away most of their life savings. Their cell phones and email inboxes were so full of pleas for money that they missed photos of their grandkids and other important messages.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At least one person continued to be charged for contributions after his death.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Donors or their families often learned of the extent of their donations from CNN reporters. The family members of some said their loved ones had also been the targets of common elder scams. Most asked CNN not to name them out of concern that they would be further victimized or ashamed.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->One 82-year-old woman, who wore pajamas with holes in them because she didn’t want to spend money on new ones, didn’t realize she had given Republicans more than $350,000 while living in a 1,000 square-foot Baltimore condo since 2020.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By the time a Taiwanese immigrant from California passed away from lung cancer this year at age 80, she had given away more than $180,000 to Trump’s campaign and a litany of other Republican candidates – writing letters to candidates apologizing for not getting donations to them on time because she was going into heart surgery. She had only $250 in her bank account when she died, leaving her family scrambling to cover the cost of her funeral.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And a 78-year-old, a widow who limited showers to save on her water bill and canceled her long-term care insurance, didn’t understand why the retirement savings her husband had left her was dwindling so quickly. After CNN reached out to her family, they learned that the woman gave more than $200,000 in donations to Democratic political groups and candidates.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The federal government has gone after non-political companies for similar tactics, such as making false statements in ads or making them seem as if they were written directly to the recipient. But regulators have done little to stop fundraisers from using misleading and deceptive advertisements to target vulnerable donors. And the lawmakers who experts say would need to act to protect consumers at both the state and federal levels are the same ones benefiting from the current fundraising machines.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The biggest beneficiary of the small-dollar donations from unwitting donors identified by CNN was Donald Trump. His current and former campaigns and affiliated political committees brought in more than $400,000 from these elderly consumers between July 2019 and June 2024, which included multiple election cycles. The national committees which raise money to support House and Senate races across the nation also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from such donors, according to CNN’s analysis, and in all, the long list of Republican candidates and causes took in nearly $4 million.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A spokesperson for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee noted that fundraising efforts over the years have varied and said Trump ads were designed to be respectful, including such language as “don’t sweat it” if donors couldn’t afford to contribute on a regular basis.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->On the Democratic side, much of the money went to left-leaning political action committees known as PACs, not mainstream Democratic candidates. The Progressive Turnout Project and its affiliated group, Stop Republicans, took in the most, with roughly $150,000 coming from the vulnerable donors identified by CNN. President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign was not among the top recipients, taking in only about 10% of the $400,000 Trump brought in from those elderly donors.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Vice President Kamala Harris had not yet launched her presidential bid during the fundraising period covered in CNN’s analysis, though more recent campaign finance reports show her campaign has taken in several thousand dollars from this snapshot of donors. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
        
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The fundraising operations that have solicited money from vulnerable senior citizens use either WinRed or ActBlue, two juggernaut digital platforms that unite hundreds of political groups and campaigns under a single umbrella. Each platform charges a fee of about 4% of every transaction, although WinRed is a for-profit company and ActBlue is a nonprofit. Campaign finance records show that the two groups took in more than $100 million in fees from federal campaigns and political committees in the last two years alone.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->WinRed, founded by a former Trump staffer in 2019, and ActBlue, which has been around for two decades, say it is the campaigns themselves that are choosing the frequency and tenor of the pleas for donations. WinRed did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for ActBlue said the platform is designed to give “donors full control” over their contributions, saying donors or their families can contact their in-house support team with any concerns.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But it is the fundraising platforms that have made it easier than ever for campaigns to bring in as much money as possible from their bases. Both have boasted of record-breaking hauls this campaign cycle, with WinRed saying this summer it was processing more than 2,700 donations per minute — a jump of more than 40% from 2020.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The controversial feature that fools many donors is a pre-checked box campaigns use to automatically authorize recurring donations. Donors often don’t realize they need to uncheck that box, so while attempting to make a one-time small donation, they are unknowingly signing up for weekly or monthly recurring donations. Sometimes it takes months or years before they realize a campaign has been regularly charging their credit card or taking money out of their bank account.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

<figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Richard Benjamin’s family tells CNN he was “manipulated” into donating his life savings to Republican causes while suffering from dementia.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
    
</figcaption>
</figure>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While many mainstream Democratic candidates have backed away from the practice, both the Trump and Harris campaigns have recently been using donation pages with pre-checked recurring boxes to raise money, a CNN analysis of fundraising emails and Facebook and Instagram ads found.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Trump’s campaign said two of his current fundraising committees only returned to the use of pre-checked boxes in September after pausing the practice in January 2023. The spokesperson, however, did not address whether another Trump-affiliated committee still receiving donations this year had been using the tactic. Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Brian Hughes said "we strive to be direct and transparent by informing them immediately when they have registered for recurring donations, sending a notice three days before processing, notifying them when the processing is complete, and having staff on-hand to assist with refunds and cancellations.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Recurring donations only multiply as confirmed donors become valuable political currency — their names and contact information quickly swapped and sold. And once WinRed or ActBlue has a donor’s financial information, donations can be triggered by actions including a response to an online survey, an order of campaign merchandise or a one-word reply to a text message.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As a result, records show, some donors ended up being charged in excess of 100 times in a single day.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <h3>‘Lonely and isolated’
</h3>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Richard Benjamin, an 81-year-old from Arizona, believed he had been in personal communication with former president Trump through all the messages he was receiving.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At one point, he told his children the former president invited him to a luxurious reception at Mar-a-Lago. He had grown up on a farm and worried he would feel out of his element at such a fancy venue. But when he received what he described to his children as an invitation to be a VIP at a rally in Arizona, he was thrilled he would finally meet the former president himself. He started making travel plans and asking his sister-in-law if she would like to accompany him, since his wife had passed away in 2018.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Later, he told his son how angry he was that Donald Trump Jr. wouldn't call him back even though the former president’s son had sent Benjamin so many nice messages.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“He was old, lonely and isolated,” his son, Jason Benjamin, told CNN, saying the pandemic only compounded that isolation. “’Save America, help save America,’ that was the constant message. He would get thanked for helping to save America.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Richard Benjamin, who now lives in a memory care unit at an assisted living facility, would look forward to the emails and texts, and especially to the ones thanking him for being a true American and patriot when he donated his money. This eventually led him to give about $80,000, leaving him tens of thousands of dollars in debt and his children angry at the campaigns who they say tricked their dad and took advantage of his compromised state of mind. “He really, in his heart, believed that Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and other politicians were personally reaching out to him,” Jason Benjamin said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Richard Benjamin and his family showed CNN that he continues to be inundated with text messages and phone calls from politicians to this day. Yet he often couldn’t identify the politicians he financially supported.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“There’s no excuse for them to allow something like this to happen,” Jason Benjamin said of the campaigns behind the many solicitations. An employee from Richard Benjamin’s bank even lodged a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission about deceptive practices, saying Benjamin had never intended to donate close to the amount he did, according to FTC records.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Forensic geriatrician Kathryn Locatell said what Richard Benjamin felt each time he received a “thank you” message or made a donation is the same “dopamine hit” a lot of elderly Americans are seeking. And the solicitations are crafted in a way that intentionally suck elderly donors into their web, providing “a feeling of belonging to a thrilling, special club.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“You and I could call these demands for money laughable but to a person who’s lost their capacity to judge reality, and who’s been soaking up all the toxic misinformation out there, on the internet and TV, it’s a perfectly coherent reality and they’re happy to join in and become a part of it,” she said. “That’s how all their money will be drained until it’s gone.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Because the text informing donors they are enrolling in recurring donations is often so tiny, particularly on WinRed donation pages, it would be very easy for someone who isn’t actually processing what they’re reading to miss it, according to Locatell and other experts interviewed by CNN. Elderly donors who have short-term memory issues could be making one-time donations again and again, not remembering that they made a donation even an hour earlier, they added.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“These ads are a form of misleading, undue influence,” Locatell said. “One simple rule could be enacted: Ads can’t contain these pre-checked boxes; the person has to actively choose recurring donation.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Behavioral symptoms such as getting hooked by solicitations like these and making poor financial decisions often happen in the early stages of dementia, before family members even realize their loved ones are experiencing any sort of cognitive decline.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

She said her mother was going to donate to each before she stopped her. Her mother’s cognitive decline has gotten so bad, she said, that she believed when someone asked her for money, she needed to give it.

  <h3>No oversight
</h3>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When an elderly man discovered thousands of dollars' worth of political charges on his credit card he said he never authorized, he turned to the agency that oversees campaign donations – the Federal Election Commission – for help.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“I am an 89-year-old widower, a retired architect who lives alone,” he wrote in a 2022 complaint. He said he had been plagued by robocalls and scam mail and it appeared ActBlue was “rife with fraud.” By the time the FEC completed its investigation, he had died, collapsing "on his way to the post office to mail postcards to voters in Texas,” according to his obituary. But the agency hadn’t planned on doing anything about his complaint anyway, writing in a response that the matter was “rated as low priority” for an enforcement action based on criteria including the severity of the allegation and the dollar amount involved.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
        
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The agency shut down another complaint made about WinRed by the daughters of an elderly woman who said their mother had lost more than $6,700 to “elder abuse” with the same boiler plate response, noting the “low dollar amount involved.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

The report noted  consumers had often attempted to cancel the donations without success before contacting agency staff for help. Agency officials said the outcry from donors "strongly suggests that many contributors are unaware of the ‘pre-checked boxes’ and are surprised by the already completed transactions appearing on account statements." But it said it didn’t have the authority to ban the practice, and that Congress should introduce legislation to change this — a recommendation agency officials first made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/us/politics/fec-trump-donations.html" title="after">after</a> the New York Times <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html" title="reported">reported</a> on the issue in 2021.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Currently, pre-checked boxes for recurring donations are allowed in almost every state despite widespread condemnation of the practice from consumer advocates. Federal legislation introduced in recent years that would have prevented their use died in committee without gaining traction.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And while four Democratic attorneys general have been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/politics/political-fundraising-winred-actblue/index.html" title="investigating">investigating</a> the fundraising tactics of WinRed and ActBlue, no action has been taken to date. A number of Republican lawmakers have specifically targeted ActBlue with investigations after right-wing influencers claimed the large volume of transactions from some donors suggested money laundering. CNN has found no evidence of money laundering, instead finding that many elderly donors simply didn’t realize how much they were giving.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Individual complaints made to state attorneys general around the country, meanwhile, have not resulted in any apparent action taken against the fundraising platforms or campaigns, according to records obtained by CNN. And in what some donors and experts have pointed to as a potential conflict of interest, the same attorneys general receiving complaints about these platforms have also used WinRed and ActBlue for their own fundraising efforts.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <h3>Making it stop
</h3>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Utah, a 69-year-old woman, who had a tube surgically placed in her brain to drain fluid from it and had such severe dementia that she required around-the-clock home care, donated nearly $20,000 to Republican candidates in less than four months.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->WinRed continued to charge her even after the attorney overseeing her financial affairs informed the company of her condition and sent a cease-and-desist letter. He filed a lawsuit in 2021 against the platform, which remains ongoing. But it still took a year to make the donations stop. Just seven days after she made her last donation to the Republicans, public records show that more donations were charged to her accounts. This time, to a political group supporting Democrats.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
        
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Matthew Hurtt, the chairman of Virginia-based Arlington County Republican Committee, said he has fielded more than 200 calls and emails from frustrated donors located all over the country. Many of them are elderly donors who say they have struggled to stop their recurring contributions and receive refunds. Hurtt is not affiliated with WinRed, but said he receives the angry inquiries because WinRed is registered in Arlington, so charges made through the platform can sometimes show up with “Arlington” on credit card statements.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hurtt, like other experts, told CNN he believes such aggressive fundraising tactics are short-sighted and will turn off voters in the long run.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“We don't have to trick people into giving money to our candidates and to our causes,” Hurtt said. “Any platform that tricks older donors into giving money unwittingly seems like a scheme to me.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Both <a target="_blank" href="https://donors.winred.com/en/articles/3773508-requesting-a-refund" title="WinRed">WinRed</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://support.actblue.com/donors/contributions/i-am-a-caregiver-or-have-been-granted-power-of-attorney-for-someone-else-how-do-i-seek-a-refund-or-support-on-behalf-of-that-person/" title="ActBlue">ActBlue</a> have said they notify donors of each recurring contribution and have guides on their websites explaining how donors or their families can request refunds and cancel recurring donations.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->ActBlue told CNN it has trained its customer service staff to be on the lookout for those donors who use keywords that indicate confusion or cognitive issues and escalate them to a higher level of service. The platform said this situation is rare and that employees do what they can to accommodate refunds beyond the standard 90-day refund window.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->WinRed’s website meanwhile says it “is happy to refund any donation made in error,” but notes that it can only provide refunds for those contributions made in the last 60 days.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some of the candidates and PACs who CNN identified as receiving the most money from elderly, unwitting donors said they try to work with contributors to refund mistaken donations.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But many of those interviewed by CNN said it was hard to determine which campaigns to contact, especially since donations were often spread out among hundreds of groups. They usually contacted WinRed or ActBlue instead and found the process confusing, difficult and frequently unsuccessful.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
        
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In the case of WinRed specifically, many said they couldn’t even figure out how to reach a representative on the phone. One frustrated son who filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office told CNN he resorted to tracking down a company intern he found on LinkedIn in the hopes of finally turning off his mother’s recurring donations. He said she had lost more than $20,000 and that after contacting WinRed and even cancelling her debit card, she continued to be charged.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Washington state, meanwhile, WinRed was quick to dismiss an 80-year-old woman’s plea for the state to investigate the platform for “senior abuse” -- saying the woman had agreed to the company’s terms of use, which make clear it provides refunds only as required by law. By the time she had filed her complaint, her money was long gone. It was up to her to reach out to the campaigns for any refunds.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“With all due respect,” WinRed’s attorney wrote, “there is nothing here to investigate.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

  <h3>How CNN reported this story
</h3>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->CNN reviewed Federal Election Commission reports on hundreds of millions of contributions made through WinRed and ActBlue, the main donation platforms for Republican and Democratic campaigns. Reporters identified the top small-dollar donors who also gave the most frequently on each platform in recent years, and then reached out to more than 150 of those top donors and their family members for each platform.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Based on these interviews, as well as an analysis of hundreds of consumer complaints submitted to the Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General, reporters identified more than 50 elderly donors who gave more than they intended, many of whom suffered from cognitive decline or dementia. Reporters also reviewed complaints lodged on consumer advocacy websites TrustPilot.com and PissedConsumer.com.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Reporters reviewed data on donations made by those vulnerable donors reported in WinRed and ActBlue’s FEC filings over five years, from July 2019 through the end of June 2024. The donation amounts reported in the story do not include any refunds the donors later received, which were typically only a small fraction of the total they had given.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To identify ads with pre-checked recurring donation boxes, reporters downloaded data on fundraising ads on Facebook and Instagram from Meta’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=active&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;media_type=all&amp;source=nav-header" title="Ad Library">Ad Library</a>, and also reviewed fundraising emails sent by Trump and Harris’ campaigns provided by the <a target="_blank" href="https://politicalemails.org/" title="Archive of Political Emails">Archive of Political Emails</a>, which collects emails from numerous campaigns.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
