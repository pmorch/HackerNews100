<p>This post is about finally finding a book from one’s youth forty years later – and after nearly thirty years of searching.</p>
<p>It is also a tale about goblins and Christmas decorations; about the perils of ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence; and about the real value of librarians, cataloguers, indexers, and archivists – what should be called the Noble Professions.</p>
<p>And it is an account that ends with not one but two wonderful events.</p>
<p>So if you are sitting comfortably, with a suitable seasonal drink, we will start with a bit of background and with a historical excursion.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a story.</p>
<p>And the story was in a book – a child’s anthology: the sort of book that one used to get in school bookshops and advertised in the special catalogues that were common in English schools (and elsewhere) in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>All the books I had at the time got lost – house moves and so on – and since the world wide web made searching for second-hand books easy I have replaced the books one-by-one.</p>
<p>When you re-read such books, sometimes what one thinks are one’s own original ideas and expressions stare back at you and you realise where you got them from.</p>
<p>What the economist J. M. Keynes once said –&nbsp;<em>“Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist”</em>&nbsp;– has a far wider application.</p>
<p>Many of us are the slaves of what we read when very young.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>But there was one book what eluded me, every time it was searched for.</p>
<p>What I could remember (or believed I could remember) was as follows:</p>
<p>– it was a story in an anthology;</p>
<p>– the story was about what will happen if you do not take your decorations down by Twelfth Night – for goblins and other ne’er-do-wells will go through your town and hide behind any remaining decorations and cause you mischief all year round;</p>
<p>– but there was a cure to this mischief if a certain thing was done on Candlemas – 2 February – and this was because of an esoteric rule which could be applied surreptitiously by those with special knowledge;</p>
<p>– the book was purple;</p>
<p>– the title or sub-title of the book, or of the story, was <em>“from Michelmas to Candlemas”&nbsp;</em>– the use of “<em>Candlemas</em>” was obvious from the story, and the&nbsp;<em>“Michaelmas”</em>&nbsp;I was certain about because it was a word I would again encounter in my late teens as a student, as it reminded me of the story/book.</p>
<p>(One of these memories, however, was false and another only semi-reliable.)</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The story was important to me because it led to my passion for lore.</p>
<p>For me as a legal commentator, law (in its technical, black-letter sense) is practically far less important than what people – including lawyers and even judges – believe the law to be.</p>
<p>(Long-term followers may also recall my original blogging name was of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_o%27_Kent" rel="">a folklore hero</a>&nbsp;who bested the devil by careful attention to what was actually agreed.)</p>
<p>And so this remembered Candlemas story had everything for a lover of lore and law: a predicament, an obscure rule, the skilled application of that rule, and a remedy.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>How I searched for this story – usually every year in November or December.</p>
<p>At first, I searched the web generally – with text and then, as Google developed, for the book cover.</p>
<p>I searched sites which had pictures of the book catalogues of the time.</p>
<p>I searched the British Library, the Bodleian Library, and every library I could think of.</p>
<p>Nil-return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It was a mini-exercise&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2TilNclT8k" rel="">in being J. R. Hartley</a>&nbsp;year after year.</p>
<p>After a while certain results became familiar – and I probably know more about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=187175ea13837ba9&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIIVO6N79MGGuSSGU9PrVvM2PfL4mQ:1734603763244&amp;q=Candlemas+books+devotional&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWde_MVagR57NIrd96T8bhwqEHeQ8jxei7F1s0aV23iWdi741Y3wNj5M6YQHR2X6laQ2bG_-lQAEb0rBAh8HRP8QnwCon_R8sFRzqEefr32Ob9swxFwdMawgPopA8MJ3jT9WeCgU-iUIUXZtKdtqKHtMWi_SZ41t31ikJ6wkUr5mZT0z82cmGy5mWpAaSfdIqbKHiMSw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj6ionJzrOKAxUcWkEAHS_TK8IQtKgLegQIFhAB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=958&amp;dpr=1" rel="">devotional texts about</a>&nbsp;– and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Candlemas+adventure+stories&amp;sca_esv=187175ea13837ba9&amp;udm=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=958&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKkKlYh0g7MhfVOIAghQnYkSQZRFg%3A1734603765270&amp;ei=9fNjZ8ObEJ6VhbIPsMWz6QE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD6oTKzrOKAxWeSkEAHbDiLB0Q4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=Candlemas+adventure+stories&amp;gs_lp=EgNpbWciG0NhbmRsZW1hcyBhZHZlbnR1cmUgc3Rvcmllc0j2LVDqBFiKLHABeACQAQCYAUGgAfAJqgECMjS4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgmgAoAEwgIEECMYJ8ICBBAAGB7CAgYQABgIGB7CAgUQABiABJgDAIgGAZIHATmgB_Iq&amp;sclient=img" rel="">adventure stories set</a>&nbsp;at – Candlemas than many other people.</p>
<p>And it was always a pleasure to renew contact with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/letters-papers-hen8/vol10/pp1-12" rel="">texts like</a>&nbsp;<em>“[i]t is a very old enactment that no Gascon wines or Toulouse woad be brought into England in strange bottoms, and nothing which has been done affects them but was devised to restrain the folly of English merchants who ventured to Bordeaux at unseasonable times, and the restraint&nbsp;<strong>from Michaelmas to Candlemas</strong>, by avoiding dangerous times, will rather augment the traffic…” (emphasis added.)</em></p>
<p>I bought books of Christmas stories on the off-chance they would reprint the story I was looking for – a disconcerting number of which appear to have been edited by Gyles Brandreth.</p>
<p>Nil-return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When social media came along, I would then appeal from time-to-time for any information.</p>
<p>Those who responded were often very helpful – and so yet more Christmas anthologies were bought, and further lines of enquiry followed.</p>
<p>I made direct contact with experts in folklore and fairy tales, but they were as non-plussed as me.</p>
<p>Still nil-return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Along the way though, I found out a great deal about the lores of the twelve days of Christmas and Candlemas which contextualised what I could remember.</p>
<p>For example, both Twelfth Night and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlemas" rel="">Candlemas</a>&nbsp;have historically been the ends of the Christmas period – the latter being the fortieth day after Christmas.</p>
<p>And I discovered that Candlemas – which is also marked the purification (or what became known in England as ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churching_of_women" rel="">churching</a>’) of Mary and the presentation of Jesus at the Temple – was once an annual event that was very important in English culture.</p>
<p>Indeed Charles I arranged&nbsp;<a href="https://historyofparliament.com/2023/05/11/1626-coronation-charles-i/" rel="">his coronation to be held on Candlemas</a>.</p>
<p>And royalists made a point of celebrating Candlemas as part of what we would now call&nbsp;<em>“culture wars”</em>&nbsp;of the 1600s.</p>
<p>One once-famous poet, the loyalist clergyman&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Herrick_(poet)" rel="">Robert Herrick</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/22421/pg22421-images.html#id_2.p892" rel="">published three poems</a>&nbsp;about Candlemas, one of which urged the burning of decorations on that day, else bad things would follow:</p>
<p><em>Kindle the Christmas brand, and then</em></p>
<p><em>Till sunset let it burn;</em></p>
<p><em>Which quench’d, then lay it up again</em></p>
<p><em>Till Christmas next return.</em></p>
<p><em>Part must be kept wherewith to teend</em></p>
<p><em>The Christmas log next year,</em></p>
<p><em>And where ’tis safely kept, the fiend</em></p>
<p><em>Can do no mischief there.</em></p>
<p>(This ritual burning of decorations is a tradition that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-12930745/BORIS-JOHNSON-burn-Christmas-tree.html" rel="">still has echoes today</a>.)</p>
<p>After the culture wars of the 1600s, however, Candlemas became less popular – and soon it was all-but forgotten culturally, outside the annual blessing of candles at certain churches.</p>
<p>(On Candlemas in particular, see chapter 13 of&nbsp;<em>The Stations of the Sun</em>&nbsp;by Ronald Hutton, and on the place of Candlemas in the politics and religion of early modern England generally, see Eamon Duffy’s&nbsp;<em>The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, 1400-1580</em>.)</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>This was all fascinating, but it was not getting me any closer to the book or the story.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, after the usual social media appeal, someone suggested I try the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/" rel="">r/whatsthatbook</a>&nbsp;thread on Reddit, where very clever and generous people spend time trying to identify books from the scantiest of details.</p>
<p>So&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/zdbnk3/book_with_candlemas_story/" rel="">I did</a>.</p>
<p>And someone there corresponded with a suggestion which actually covered each of the data points I could recall about the book – and it had the right title, and the book even had a well-known editor.</p>
<p>This was an extraordinary find – how could I have missed this in all the years of searching?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>The reason it had never been uncovered before was because the impressive looking account had been generated – entirely fabricated – by ChatGPT.</p>
<p>This false account has now been deleted, but the correspondent remarked when I said this looked like it had been auto-generated:&nbsp;<em>“You’re right, I’ve tried chatGPT on some descriptions around here and it worked pretty well. However sometimes it has a propensity to spew random bullshit. I forgot because it’s so good in other areas. I’ll check better.”</em></p>
<p>I had never come across ChatGPT before – and so I have distrusted it ever since.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>So this year – a couple of weeks ago – I did the annual appeal – but this time on BlueSky and Mastodon, and not on Twitter.</p>
<p>And yet again, people were helpful – anthologies were suggested and bought (though no further ones by Gyles Brandreth).</p>
<p>Someone again used ChatGPT, and they came up with:</p>
<p><em>“The book you’re describing sounds like “From Michaelmas to Candlemas” by Ruth Ainsworth. It was published in the 1970s and features seasonal stories aimed at children, including the one about the need to take down Christmas decorations by Candlemas to avoid goblins hiding behind them. The title references the traditional English calendar, marking the time from the feast of Michaelmas (September 29) to Candlemas (February 2). The story you mentioned aligns with themes found in folklore and poetry, including those by Robert Herrick. If this is the book you’re thinking of, it was indeed popular in school book clubs during that era.”</em></p>
<p>Again, like the account offered by the Reddit correspondent, this passage looks authoritative and plausible.</p>
<p>You will even notice how it neatly covers everything I could remember – giving equal weight to each data point and deftly joining them all together.</p>
<p>And again, what ChatGPT here had to offer was utterly – absolutely – false.</p>
<p>Like a fluent and practised (but unwise) liar it had contrived an account that fitted only the available information.</p>
<p>It was fake.</p>
<p>This year looked like another nil-return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>And then, something remarkable happened.</p>
<p>The appeal got&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tambourine.bsky.social/post/3lc25w54a3k2k" rel="">this response</a>:</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It was the same story, now looking up at me from a computer screen forty years later.</p>
<p>I remember the stylised first letter, the imagery, the pacing, the tone.</p>
<p>It did mention goblins as part of the ne’er-do-wells, but it was about a demon – not a goblin – who hid behind a sprig of holly.</p>
<p>(My insistence that it was a goblin was a semi-unreliable memory.)</p>
<p>And there was (who I now know was) Granny Hawkins being the holder of the all-important esoteric knowledge.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>What had happened was this: Charlotte was far from a ChatGPT bot but instead a trained and experienced librarian.</p>
<p>(You can and should&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tambourine.bsky.social" rel="">follow her here</a>&nbsp;– she is a genius and a treasure, and she has found other odd things out for other people.)</p>
<p>She sensibly assumed some of the things I could recall would have more weight – be more reliable – than others.</p>
<p>(The&nbsp;<em>“Michaelmas”</em>&nbsp;was, it turned out, a false memory – and this had undermined my searches.)</p>
<p>She then used various permutations of my memory points until she found a match, and she then found a book which someone had scanned onto internet archive.</p>
<p>You can see the book <a href="https://archive.org/details/ghostsshadows0000unse" rel="">here</a>.</p>
<p>The details there found could then be cross-referenced against&nbsp;<a href="http://philsp.com/" rel="">this truly amazing catalogue of fantasy short stories</a>&nbsp;-and it was indeed in an anthology – alongside the Herrick poem!</p>

<p>The story had been found – because of a librarian using critical skills (and thereby not giving equal weight to each factor), an archive, and a catalogue/index.</p>
<p>Verily: librarians, archivists, cataloguers, and indexers are the Noble Professions.</p>
<p>For they organise information in a manner in which humans actually think – unlike ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>They are the holders of the old knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>So here is the book:</p>

<p>My initial reaction was that Charlotte had certainly uncovered the same story – but it was perhaps in a different edition.</p>
<p>The cover of what Charlotte had found was black – and I distinctly remembered the book being purple.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I ordered the book online – so I could read all the story again in physical form (I refused to read it on the archive – I could wait one more week after so many years).</p>
<p>And when the book arrived I noticed something.</p>
<p>The back of the book was purple.</p>

<p>Never judge a book by its front cover.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Before we come to the second wonderful event of this book-quest, here is the story of&nbsp;<em>“Twelfth Night Till Candlemas”</em>&nbsp;in full.</p>
<p>Note as you read how the old knowledge is used and the necessary rule are applied – and how the vicar ensures that a suppressed, secret ceremony can take place – there seems to be a great deal of cultural and religious knowledge behind this simple-looking children’s story.</p>

<p><em>“Of course!”</em>&nbsp;said Granny Hawkins.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>But who was Ruth C. Paine?</p>
<p>It was certainly not this&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Paine" rel="">Ruth Paine</a>&nbsp;(which made internet searches very difficult).</p>
<p>The editor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Edwards_(children%27s_writer)" rel="">Dorothy Edwards</a>&nbsp;was a prolific author and editor – many of her books are still in print – and she was also involved with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_with_Mother" rel="">Listen with Mother</a></em>.</p>
<p>(I said you should be sitting comfortably.)</p>
<p>But Ruth C. Paine was more elusive.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>What I was then able to find out was that Ruth C. Paine had published stories in a number of Dorothy Edwards’ anthologies.</p>
<p>Here is another example, about the changing of the seasons, with a splendid line from a frog about how to deal with winter</p>

<p><em>‘I’m just off to the pond. I shall dive to the bottom and cover myself with mud and stay there. That is the only proper way to spend the winter,’ said Frog, and he hopped away.</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I can also recommend the story about old Mother Merriweather in her&nbsp;<em>Cuckoo Fair</em>&nbsp;story, which deals with summer, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.za/Mists-Magic-Dorothy-Edwards/dp/0718825373" rel="">this other Dorothy Edwards anthology</a>.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A bit more research showed that Ruth C. Paine had contributed&nbsp;<a href="https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/service_bbc_radio_fourfm/1971-07-09" rel="">a story for broadcast for&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/service_bbc_radio_fourfm/1971-07-09" rel="">Listen with Mother</a></em>&nbsp;(thank you to the kind person who put the&nbsp;<em>Radio Times</em>&nbsp;listings archive online).</p>
<p>But otherwise it was really not surprising that an author from the 1970s and 1980s had so little online trace.</p>
<p>It crossed my mind that Ruth C. Paine could be a pseudonym of Dorothy Edwards – such things are not uncommon with busy editors who need to fill spaces in books and broadcasts.</p>
<p>Yet there was something about the distinctive depth of knowledge behind the Candlemas story which made it unlikely to be a throwaway pseudonym of someone else. And Dorothy Edwards often included her own stories in her anthologies.</p>
<p>Anyway, no matter: I had the book and the story.</p>
<p>That is where I thought this story would end.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>And then the second remarkable event occurred.</p>
<p>Charlotte and I got&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vickymackenzie.bsky.social/post/3lclu2ovlpc2h" rel="">this reply</a>&nbsp;from the novelist&nbsp;<a href="https://victoriamackenzie.net/" rel="">Victoria MacKenzie</a>:</p>

<p>And so Ruth C. Paine certainly did exist – and, as the Candlemas story indicated, she did have an extensive knowledge of religion and cultural history.</p>
<p>Her great niece has now kindly provided the following fascinating details:</p>
<p><em>“Ruth Cecilia Paine was my great aunt – my grandfather’s twin sister – and although she passed away in 2001, when I was just twenty-one, she was a big influence on my life. We wrote to each other regularly (I still remember her postcode, all these years later) and she was very encouraging to me about my education; at the start of each school year she sent me a little money for stationery, which I found incredibly exciting!</em></p>
<p><em>“I always knew that she had written stories for children, but that only a handful had been published – mostly in anthologies edited by Dorothy Edwards. As far as I knew, writing was a hobby, but I sensed it was one that meant a great deal to her. She often sent me books as gifts and occasionally I visited her in her flat in Canterbury where she lived with her lifelong companion, Lillian.</em></p>
<p><em>“She was a Christian and a church-goer all her life, latterly giving tours of Canterbury Cathedral. My dad told me that she’d been a missionary in India earlier in her life and I seem to half-remember a story she told me of travelling through a monsoon in a small aeroplane – understandably a terrifying experience!</em></p>
<p><em>“When she returned to in Britain she became a Religious Studies teacher, and her last job was at Hastings High School, before her retirement around the time I was born in 1980. Apparently she was regarded as quite formidable by my dad’s generation, but she was always very kind to me. I wish so much that she could have known her great niece would become a writer!”</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The formidable Ruth C. Paine had indeed been a former missionary in her youth – Birmingham University records attest this.</p>
<p>This is Ruth Cecilia Paine in her teaching days:</p>

<p>And not only did Vicky MacKenzie provide this information and this photo, she also had a box of papers from her late great aunt, and in that box of papers were the original amended proofs of the personally influential story I had spent years looking for!</p>

<p><em>“Of course!”</em>&nbsp;said Granny Hawkins.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In a matter of days I has gone from the ritual despair of an annual fruitless, futile search, to not only having the story and the book – but to also seeing the actual manuscript of the story I had spent forty years thinking about and about thirty years searching for.</p>
<p>This was a wonderful, extraordinary turn-of-events.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two things can perhaps be said by way of a conclusion to this story.</p>
<p>The first is that we should be wary of the mischievous demons of our own age – that is ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence – and to renew our trust in the Noble Professions who hold the old knowledge and skills: librarians, archivists, cataloguers, and indexers.</p>
<p>The second is that nowadays the real problem perhaps is not with Christmas decorations staying up too late, but with them going up too early, and with shops selling Christmas wares and playing Christmas music well before Advent, let alone Christmas.</p>
<p>We need new cautionary tales about when such things should be done and not done.</p>
<p>We are going to need some new goblins.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the heirs and holders of the literary estate of Ruth C. Paine for their kind permission for me to publish&nbsp;<em>“Twelfth Night Till Candlemas”</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>“How Nip spent the winter”</em>.</p>
<p>Editors would do well to contact Vicky MacKenzie to arrange permission to put her great aunt’s stories in new anthologies.</p>
<p>I am also grateful to Vicky MacKenzie for her kind permission to publish the unpublished corrected manuscript of&nbsp;<em>“Twelfth Night Till Candlemas”&nbsp;</em>and the unpublished photograph of her aunt..</p>
<p>Many thanks to Charlotte who not only found the story, but dealt with many follow-on queries.</p>
<p>Many thanks also to my friends who listened to previous versions of this post.</p>
<p>This post is dedicated to one of these friends, Nick, who is currently dealing with a challenging time – and who has also listened to me go on about story-telling for over thirty years. Poor sod.</p>

My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn't forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. </p><p>My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. <strong>They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. </strong></p></div><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">College tuition</a> at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years.

But it wasn't.</p><p>I recently attended a theater performance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">The Outsiders</a> at my son's public high school. All I really knew was the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f46JMzVzSB4&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">"stay gold" line</a> from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href="http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. <p>We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and <strong>connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity</strong>. Whether you've read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.</p><p><a href="https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Stay gold</a>.</p></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/" rel="noreferrer">believe deeply</a> in sharing The American Dream. It is the foundation of our country, the second paragraph in our <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Declaration of Independence</a>, written by the founder of the public university I attended:</p><blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote><p>But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjzZh6-h9fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jimi Hendrix - The Star Spangled Banner [ National Anthem ] ( Live at Woodstock 1969 )"></iframe></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today. In November 2024, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">enough of us voted</a> for people who interpret the dream in a way that I don't understand.</p><figure><a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfe_wqbzOe_elPxK-9TqRLDAxtI2Qrd8GHAtxqtJ8DvQ87d69tFasQnClpWuRYvDP-Iofd-PDkfpQU5RayMlyDo2rlVZWzfacm-kr1aM8fZprnh_1XXkpbr63MbGUpiNNaibPmxVQ?key=gIYEBDEiC9EgZC24CSOXGvAl" alt="" loading="lazy" width="661" height="573"></a></figure><p>34% of adults in America <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-2024-our-very-complicated-democracy/election-2024-why-americans-dont-vote-episode-6.html?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">did not exercise their right to vote</a>.

Whatever the reasons, 42% of adults living in America had no say in the 2024 election. The vote <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">failed to represent everyone</a>.</p><div><p>I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively <em>keeping America fair for everyone</em>. Our status as the <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/democracy-index?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">world's leading democracy</a> is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as <strong>making election day a </strong><a href="https://www.actforamerica.org/act-now/Make-Election-Day-a-National-Holiday?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong>national holiday</strong></a><strong>, universal </strong><a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/issues/universal-mailed-ballots?ref=blog.codinghorror.com#issues_map" rel="noreferrer"><strong>mail in voting</strong></a><strong>, and adopting </strong><a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong>ranked choice voting</strong></a> so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.</p><p>It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">fully see how many Americans have so very little</a>.

<p>Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:</p><ul><li>We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.</li><li>We could fund nonprofits that have a <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/our-methodology/ratings/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">proven track record</a> of protecting democratic institutions.</li><li>We could found a new organization loosely based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">RAND Corporation</a>, but modernized like <a href="https://www.leverforchange.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Lever for Change</a>. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for <em>everyone,</em> working within the current system or outside it.</li><li>All states are shades of purple, not fully red or blue. We have <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50343-national-policy-proposals-with-bipartisan-support?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">more in common on specific policies</a> than we realize. It would be very difficult to draw borders if we split. I know what divorce feels like, and we don't want this. Let's come together <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com">through our shared American Dream</a>. </li><li>We can start with change in our local communities. Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs. Listen to the stories of fellow volunteers, listen to the stories of the people you’re serving – that is the heart of Democracy.</li></ul><p>We've already completed the eight $1 million donations <a href="#" rel="noreferrer">listed above</a> to help those most immediately in need. Within the next five years, half of our family wealth will support longer term efforts. There is no single solution, so let's work together. I will gladly advise and <strong>empower others </strong>working towards the same goal.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/share-landscape.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1235" height="690" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/share-landscape.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/share-landscape.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/share-landscape.png 1235w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Please join us in <strong>Sharing the American Dream</strong>:</p><ol><li>Support organizations you feel are <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">effectively helping</a> those most in need across America right now.</li><li>Within the next five years, also contribute <strong>public dedications of time or funds towards longer term efforts </strong>to keep the American Dream fair and attainable for all our children.</li></ol><p><a href="https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Stay gold</a>, America.</p>

<p dir="auto">I love the game Factorio and I really like the look of factories after growing for many hours or blueprints after tweaking them for perfection. That's way I created a <a href="https://piebro.github.io/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/" rel="nofollow">website</a> to artfully visualize Factorio blueprints.</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/blob/master/examples/Rocket_Ship_1.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/raw/master/examples/Rocket_Ship_1.jpg" width="58%"></a>

</p>
<p dir="auto">With the website you can import Factorio blueprints as text and visualize them. You can tweak the drawing settings or create random ones.</p>
<p dir="auto">All buildings and tiles with their bounding boxes and belt, pipe, rail, inserter, wire and electricity connections can be visualized. Everything is drawn in vector graphics (SVG) to be able to view it in any resolution.</p>
<p dir="auto">With the latest update, Blueprints from Factorio before version 2.0 might not work correctly. You can import older blueprints to factorio and export them again to update them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open Factorio and create a blueprint.</li>

<li>Go the the <a href="https://piebro.github.io/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/" rel="nofollow">website</a>.</li>
<li>Click the "Upload Blueprint" button and paste the text into the text area.</li>

<p id="speakable-summary">VLC media player, the popular open-source software developed by nonprofit VideoLAN, has topped 6 billion downloads worldwide and teased an AI-powered subtitle system.</p>

<p>The new feature automatically generates real-time subtitles — which can then also be translated in many languages — for any video using open-source AI models that run locally on users’ devices, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or cloud services, VideoLAN demoed at CES.</p>







<p>The firm didn’t say when it planned to rollout the feature.</p>

<p>VideoLAN started in 1996 as a project by students at Ecole Centrale Paris trying to stream videos across campus. Unlike many open-source projects that have struggled to survive on donations alone, VLC has maintained its free, ad-free model while expanding across multiple operating systems. The media player continues to operate without advertising, data collection, or commercial revenue streams.</p>

<p>“The number of active users of VLC is actually growing, even in this age of streaming services,” VideoLAN president Jean-Baptiste Kempf <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282533937812258816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> in a LinkedIn post.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange" rel="">Stack Exchange</a><span> is a large online crowd sourced content provider for questions and answers. The Stack Exchange network of sites includes everything from </span><a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/" rel="">cooking</a><span>, to </span><a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/" rel="">politics</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://judaism.stackexchange.com/" rel="">Judaism</a><span> and </span><a href="https://islam.stackexchange.com/" rel="">Islam</a><span>.  In 2021, it was sold to a private equity company </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosus" rel="">Prosus</a><span> for 1.8 billion USD. Its largest asset is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow" rel="">Stack Overflow</a><span>, a site tailored to programmers. The Stack Overflow site is a vital resource for software developers. Ideally, it makes it easy and free to ask questions and get professional assistance.</span></p><p><span>On Stack Exchange, all of the contributions on the site are contributed under a license maintained by a third party called </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="">Creative Commons</a><span>; Creative Commons provides a license which states that licensed content must be perpetually shareable for any purpose including modification and by anyone including for-profit ventures, so long as the work remains properly attributed. This incentivizes content creation because every contributor is working on a corpus of work which is free from royalties and modification restrictions: everyone is bettering and growing the commons by using the site. The only “payment” we get out for our work is recognition: the right granted under the Attribution Clause. The Stack Exchange network is further “gameified” with rankings and reputation (a quantifiable standing) to encourage active membership and community while keeping things fun. Work hard, have a larger contribution to the commons and be recognized as such.</span></p><p><span>Alas, this minimal obligation of attribution is too much for some companies which have sought to erode this right. Right now, on Stack Overflow, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4616250/user4616250" rel="">Luigi Magione’s account has been renamed</a><span>. Despite having fruitfully contributed to the network he is stripped of his name and his account is now known as “</span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4616250/user4616250" rel="">user4616250</a><span>”. As reported by one of the </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/332043/zoe-save-the-data-dump" rel="">moderators, Zoe, on Stack Overflow.</a></p><blockquote><p><span>I can confirm SE, Inc. were the ones to clear his name. A reason was not specified anywhere obvious. Mods have been given explicit instructions not to touch that profile. While this particular incident may be limited to SO, the implications of this affect the entire network – </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/332043/zoe-save-the-data-dump" rel="">Zoe - Save the data dump</a></p></blockquote><p><span>Though I’m not a lawyer, even with a guilty verdict I don’t believe Stack Exchange is freed from their contractual obligation of attribution under the Creative Commons license. However, in the spirit of the site I put the </span><a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/q/106594/218" rel="">preliminary legal question about the Creative Commons license to the experts on law.stackexchange.com</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In order to get more information about the justification and reasoning for the unattribution, </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/405208/157251" rel="">I asked a question on the “meta” site that helps run the network called meta.stackexchange</a><span>. I have not received an official answer from the company.</span></p><p><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/405208/removing-attribution-because-someone-was-charged-but-not-convicted-with-a-crime#comment1350698_405208" rel="">As pointed out in a comment</a><span>, this kind of treatment is specific to Mangione,</span></p><blockquote><p><span>This situation has a very direct precedent: </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel="">"Frosty" (Ross Ulbricht) is still attributed under his chosen pseudonym and gets to keep the 500 not-very-organic upvotes on the question he asked </a><em><strong><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel="">in furtherance of the crime</a></strong></em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel=""> for which he was sentenced to life in prison and fined hundreds of millions of dollars</a><span>. – </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/134300/jeremy" rel="">Jeremy</a></p></blockquote><p><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht" rel="">Ross Ulbricht</a><span> case is even more egregious because he was convicted and his old pseudonym remains with his attribution as Ulbricht desired.</span></p><p><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/405210/157251" rel="">One user hypothesizes Stack Exchange is invoking a second seldom-mentioned license that contributors grant</a><span>, many probably unknowingly. In this explanation you grant two licenses to Stack Exchange, one under the CC BY-SA, and one under an unnamed explicit license provided by the terms of use.

While we encourage everyone to upvote great posts and downvote bad ones, the motivation for doing so needs to be anchored in the merits of the post, not the person who wrote it. Please refrain from targeting specific users when voting.  This appears particularly egregious, because you kept doing it over a period of days, even upvoting multiple posts more than once after your prior votes had been invalidated.  Stack Exchange works by ensuring that the best information rises to the top. Voting specifically for content with the intent to benefit or harm a specific user unfairly skews that system.  Please note that the votes and bounties in question have been or will be invalidated. Our system has processes in place to detect various types of voting between groups of users, and these processes are continuously running. If you know anyone who may be voting for your contributions in kind, please ask them to stop before the system detects such activity and takes similar actions on their account.  Continued activity of this sort can result in increasingly longer suspensions. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please feel free to write back.

They eventually did </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/conduct/inauthentic-usage" rel="">cite a separate recent policy created in 2023</a><span>, but not before a very blunt statement that you’d have to really struggle to not see as an admission on retribution,</span></p><blockquote><p><span>As to the question you asked today, </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/405208" rel="">Removing attribution because someone was charged but not convicted with a crime?</a><span>, </span><strong>yes, that question brought a </strong><em><strong>lot</strong></em><strong> more attention to the overall situation, which includes your targeted voting/bounties. If you had not posted that question, it's unclear when your targeted voting/bountied would have been seen by Stack Overflow moderators.</strong><span> But, no, this suspension is not retribution for posting that question. Had you not posted that question and we became aware of the voting fraud situation, which we, eventually, would have, the response and suspension would have been the same.</span></p></blockquote><p>That reads to me like “yes, it was retribution.” My response to this was simple,</p><blockquote><p><span>Had I have not posted that question, you may have never been made aware of my transgressions though. You discovered this after an investigation which was prompted by my question. Let's remove ourselves for a second: </span><strong>if an employee steals a pen and he's fired from it only after reporting sexual harassment the company's defense can't be "we would have eventually fired you for stealing the pen", right? That's not a defense the employer can reasonably make at that point despite being otherwise actionable.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I concluded with the following,</p><blockquote><p><span>That said, I don't feel I ever </span><em>artificially</em><span> did anything; but, I understand how it looks. I did find all the contributions from the profile page, and I did reward all the bounties to a specific user who I felt was trying to be productive (and oblivious to any celebrity he currently has). But this is hardly a "pattern." When you say "pattern" you're referring to this single case (granted over days) with this single user, that culminated in the removal of bounties and upvotes which I just found out about when you told me.</span></p><p><span>My side of the story is easy: I saw an alleged killer that I believe is wrongly framed who has a good head on his shoulders get swept up by the justice system. I went online and viewed his contributions and thought they were warranting of incentive. I wanted to incentivize him to become a productive member of society, and of our network. Let's correct that if it's against policy: keep the bounties removed and the upvotes removed, but a prior offense shouldn't sit as a Trump card for punishment now. I started a respectful conversation because I believe Luigi Mangione should </span><em>NOT</em><span> be treated as a criminal prior to a conviction. That's the request of his defense attorney (today), and I believe there is a trend for that to happen which is wrong.</span></p><p>That's all I'm doing here in asking the question.</p></blockquote><p>How does this sit with how other tech sites react?</p><ul><li><p><span>GitHub, a division of Microsoft, still has </span><a href="https://github.com/lnmangione" rel="">Luigi’s profile online</a><span>. This indifference to a mere charge should be applauded. It’s unfortunate Stack Overflow couldn’t chart the same course. LinkedIn, also owned by Microsoft, seems to have </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-mangione/" rel="">Luigi’s LinkedIn</a><span> still active — however, I’m not sure this has been verified.</span></p></li><li><p>Reddit has deleted his account (presumed to be /u/Mister_Cactus)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/luigi-mangione-social-media-photos-19969945.php" rel="">Facebook and Instagram accounts are long gone</a><span>.

<p dir="auto">3.9 micron data from the GOES-16 East and GOES-18 West satellites on the January 2025 Southern California fires.
We download the reprojected data from UW SSEC's <a href="https://realearth.ssec.wisc.edu/" rel="nofollow">RealEarth program</a>.
Each image is 128x128 pixels, centered at (34.1, -118.4). Each pixel is 1.0 km.
The fires sometimes disappear from view due to cloud cover.</p>
<p dir="auto">The code combines the two satellites' data for increased resolution.

If I have more time I might try doing some other measurements,
but I also wrote in a hurry this to demonstrate the accessibility of citizen science.</p>

one way is to import this repository onto <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Colab</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/you-don-t-have-to-pay-the-microsoft-365-price-increase">https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/you-don-t-have-to-pay-the-microsoft-365-price-increase</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640180">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Microsoft 365 is an all-in-one cloud service. It includes office software like Word and Excel, the storage service OneDrive and a few other miscellaneous bits and pieces. </p>

<p>Until November 2024, Microsoft 365 Personal cost $129 a year, or $12 a month. </p>

<p>Now, the price has risen to $179 annually, or $17 a month – an increase of about 40%.</p>

<p>The 365 Family plan, which includes up to six user accounts, has also risen in cost by $50 a year. </p>

<figure><img alt="Website promo image 1290 x 860  27 " srcset="https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__medium.jpg 416w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__medium%402x.jpg 832w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__full_width.jpg 1010w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__full_width%402x.jpg 2020w" sizes="(min-width: 38em) 830px, 100vw" src="https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__full_width%402x.jpg"></figure>

<p>Customers have been told the price jump comes with integration of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/generative-ai-how-it-works-and-what-it-s-good-for">generative AI</a> chatbot, Copilot, into office apps. (Think AI-generated images for PowerPoint slides or Word docs condensed into shorter summaries.) </p>

<p>But crucially, 365 plans don’t provide unlimited access to Copilot – that requires an extra $37/month subscription called Copilot Pro. Instead, the plans provide a bank of 60 credits per month, where each credit pays for one action that makes use of Copilot.  </p>

<p>Credits don’t carry over if you don’t use them – the first day of each month wipes the slate clean and resets to 60 again. On a Family plan, the credits can only be used by the primary account, not the others in the household. </p>

<p>On face value, a price hike of around 30–40% for a half-hearted implementation of an AI tool seems like a bad deal – at least for some of the tens of thousands of 365 subscribers in Aotearoa.</p>
<h2 id="article-opting-out-of-the-increase" data-sidebar-menu-item="true">Opting out of the increase</h2>
<p>There’s one way to stay on your existing plan, but it’s extremely well hidden and requires calling Microsoft’s bluff. </p>

<p>You have to pretend to cancel your plan! </p>

<p>Log into your Microsoft account at account.microsoft.com. Find your 365 subscription and select “Manage”. Then select “Cancel subscription”. </p>

<p>That’s when a new option will miraculously appear – Microsoft 365 Classic, which has no price increase or Copilot AI. In other words, it’s your old plan. </p>

<figure><img alt="Customers are presented with three subscription options – their current plan, the cheaper “Classic” plan and a “Basic” OneDrive-only plan." srcset="https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__medium.png 416w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__medium%402x.png 832w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__full_width.png 1010w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__full_width%402x.png 2020w" sizes="(min-width: 38em) 830px, 100vw" src="https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__full_width%402x.png"><figcaption>Customers are presented with three subscription options – their current plan, the cheaper “Classic” plan and a “Basic” OneDrive-only plan.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Customers aren’t told about this option anywhere else. It isn’t mentioned in the official post announcing Copilot integration, the email notifying customers of the price rise or on Microsoft’s marketing website. In all three situations, only the new AI-studded versions of 365 are listed. </p>

<p>We strongly encourage all Microsoft 365 customers to consider whether they want to pay a premium for Copilot integration or would prefer to keep the service they know. As it stands, customers aren’t being given that choice. </p>

<p>We’d like to thank Consumer NZ member Rob, who tipped us off about this change and how to get around it.</p>
<h2 id="article-you-can-also-get-the-cheaper-plan-as-a-new-customer" data-sidebar-menu-item="true">You can also get the cheaper plan as a new customer</h2>
<p>To test whether 365 Classic was only available to existing customers at the time of the announcement, we signed up to one month’s worth of 365 Personal, then immediately went to cancel it.  </p>

<p>To our surprise, we were also able to access the classic plan at the old price – we just had to pay for one month at the new, higher price first. </p>

<p>So, anyone who isn’t currently on a 365 plan but might want to access Office apps or OneDrive storage in the future also needs to know about this “secret” tier to be able to make an informed decision about the best option for them.</p>
<h2 id="article-what-this-says-about-microsoft" data-sidebar-menu-item="true">What this says about Microsoft</h2>
<p>Frankly, we feel this is a flagrant breach of goodwill and trust for Microsoft’s customers. </p>

<p>It’s unethical for a company to automatically upgrade all its customers to a more expensive product they didn’t ask for – especially when customers aren’t even informed they have the ability to opt out. It’s also potentially misleading and a breach of the Fair Trading Act.  </p>

<p>It reflects the powerful market position Microsoft enjoys in this space. As long as Word remains the default word processor that everyone uses, Microsoft has consumers over a barrel and can charge what it likes for office apps. We don’t think that’s fair and would encourage consumers to consider free alternatives, like LibreOffice and WPS Office. </p>

<p>This issue also highlights how tech companies are having to smuggle recent innovations into consumers’ lives because many consumers aren’t willing to pay for new features upfront. Microsoft, in particular, has invested many billions of dollars toward its Copilot product and needs to recoup that cost somehow. </p>

<p>Rather than sneaking an extra $5 a month, perhaps Microsoft should focus its efforts on making Copilot valuable enough that its customers will actually be willing to pay for it.</p>
<h2 id="article-the-wider-issue" data-sidebar-menu-item="true">The wider issue</h2>
<p>Hiding the ability to opt out of a change to a pricier plan is a textbook example of a “dark pattern”. </p>

<p>A dark pattern is when a user interface is designed to trick users into making choices they wouldn’t otherwise make.  </p>

<p>Other instances include preselected tick boxes for extras like extended warranties when shopping online or services such as gyms that can be joined online but only cancelled in person. This particular practice is <a href="https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/you-don-t-have-to-go-to-the-gym-to-cancel-your-membership">likely in breach of our country’s consumer law</a>, but most dark patterns are legal. </p>

<p>The Australian federal government is currently consulting on <a href="https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/australia-is-banning-dynamic-pricing-should-aotearoa-do-the-same">a ban of unfair trading practices</a>, which will prohibit many dark patterns, including subscription traps, dynamic pricing and hidden fees. There’s no immediate plan for a similar piece of legislation in Aotearoa, but we’d like to see the same protections introduced here. </p>

<p>Dark patterns have become a particularly pressing consumer issue in the wake of subscription models taking over many industries, including the “software-as-a-service” trend that Microsoft 365 is a part of. </p>

<p>We don’t think a business should have to use deceptive designs to sell its products. Using dark patterns, like Microsoft is doing in this instance, suggests a company that doesn’t believe its products are good enough to stand on their own in the market. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sidhion.com/blog/28h_days_update_1/">https://sidhion.com/blog/28h_days_update_1/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639779">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo=""> <!-- Note: `max-w` determined empirically. The `0` in the font used for body text is too wide, so I had to figure out a number that fit 2.6 alphabets in a single line. --> <article>     <p>It’s been a little over a year since I started living <a href="https://sidhion.com/blog/28h_days" target="_self" data-astro-cid-zbkkag4h=""> 28h days  </a> .
I figured it might be a good idea to write an yearly update, and doing it at the beginning of the year feels appropriate, so here we are.</p>
<p>The one-sentence summary is that moving to a 28h-day schedule is the second best thing I’ve done for my health, with the first one being to regularly exercise.
Keep reading for details, what I had to change, some important things I discovered, and some funny realisations.</p>
<p>It took me around 2 months to adapt to this new schedule.
Those 2 months were hard, trying to get my body used to the new cycle while I got super sleepy after 10 or 11 hours into the day, but also with the SO complaining that I wasn’t available to reply to messages sometimes (because I was sleeping when she was awake), which was no encouragement to keep going.</p>
<p>Things improved after I made an adjustment: if I got too sleepy before the 10- or 11-hour mark, I’d take a nap shorter than 1 hour.
I realised that on certain days, especially when I exercised during my morning, it was almost impossible to stay up the full 18h, so the nap helped me keep going while sticking to the weekly sleep schedule.
I still deploy the <em>strategic nap</em> when needed.</p>
<p>When I travel and visit friends, or friends visit me, or I make plans with people to do things over many days, it's useful to be on a 24h schedule.
This happened a few times so far, and after each one I got better at moving between both schedules.
Since they “match” during weekends, that's when I move from one schedule to another.
I discovered that it's important to stay on the same schedule for the entire week until the next opportunity to move back to the other schedule (i.e. weekends).
Napping is the key to smoothly shift my sleep schedule, and by now I'm able to effortlessly go to 24h when needed, which isn't more than 4 or 5 times distributed over an year.</p>
<p>A consequence of the shifting schedule is that words like “daily”, “day”, “night”, “morning”, “breakfast”, “lunch”, “dinner” get a different meaning and sometimes end up confusing other people.
For example, on Wednesdays I eat my breakfast around 22:00, and my lunch for that “day” falls on Thursdays around 04:00.
People have a hard time following these things, and I haven’t found an easier way to convey this kind of information to them, so I avoid talking about this with others.</p>
<p>In fact, I avoid talking about the schedule at all with others.
I’ve experienced wildly different reactions to my 28h schedule.
Some people find it amusing or a curiosity, others seem interested and end up asking a few questions, but there are those who get offended or think I’m crazy or being unhealthy and try to lecture me or get me to stop.
I’m lucky when the latter kind decide to stop talking to me or change subjects instead.
Because of these reactions, I only comment about this schedule when I need to make plans involving other people <em>and</em> they need to know why I’m not available on certain days.</p>
<p>The internal benefits more than make up for the slightly trickier external interactions.
My sleep has been the most consistent throughout the year when compared to any other year (I don’t keep track of this in any scientific way, only mental notes that I make along the way).
I feel like I have a lot of time every day, and at the end of the day I usually feel like I got a lot of things done.
My workouts got more regular, and I increased the amount of workouts I get every week.</p>
<p>Since my schedule shifts compared to the 24h one, there’s always at least one day in the week when I’m online at the same time as friends that live all over the world.
This means I can chat with people in Australia when they’re going through their day at least once a week, for example.
This is useful for meetings and/or video calls.</p>
<p>I also get to go to the gym between 05:30 and 06:00, which means way fewer people working out at the same time as me, so I never have to wait to use any equipment and the environment isn’t as noisy.
As a result, I get my workouts done faster and feel less drained after them, which is why I increased the amount of workouts per week: they became a more pleasant experience.
I still have to force myself to exercise, but there are hardly any negative experiences since I don’t need to interact with other people anymore.</p>
<p>Even small things became more pleasant.
For example, now I can open my window to let fresh air in when everyone else’s sleeping and there’s almost no noise on the street (I’m in Canada, and it’s essentially impossible to keep windows open for too long for a good part of the year since it’s too cold outside, so I can't leave them unattended).
I’ve had a lot of opportunities to watch the sun rise without forcing myself to wake up earlier.
Since my weekdays only partially overlap normal business hours, there’s less noise on average on my day.
It seems silly, but noise makes a noticeable effect on my mood, so I’m more often on better mood now.</p>
<p>Early on, one of the most important realisations I made was that I had to change my meal plans.
Since I had 6 days on my week, if I kept following the meal plan I had made for a 7-day week it would mean I'd essentially skip an entire day worth of nutrition.
As a result, I increased my daily calorie intake to compensate for the longer days.</p>
<p>Since I now live 6-day weeks, I also do certain things less often, like showering or brushing my teeth.
Brazilians <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bathing-habits-by-country" target="_blank" data-astro-cid-zbkkag4h=""> take the most showers <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" data-astro-cid-zbkkag4h=""> <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M12 6H7a1 1 0 0 0-1 1v10a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h10a1 1 0 0 0 1-1v-5m-6 0 7.5-7.5M15 3h6v6" data-astro-cid-zbkkag4h=""></path> </svg> </a>  out of any other people in the world, so by showering less often I'm also moving closer to the global average.</p>
<p>I still have enough opportunities throughout the week to do things that need to happen at “normal people schedule”, like getting groceries, getting the occasional meal with someone, going to the dentist, and so on.</p>
<p>In summary, 28h days have been a successful experiment for me, and I can’t see myself willingly going back to a 24h schedule again.
It’s only been a year, but I feel like I already found 95% of the “short-term changes” between both schedules.
There might be some longer-term changes, mostly associated with my health, but if these exist, they’ll likely start showing up in the next few years.
We’ll see what the future holds.</p>
<p>Until then, I’ll enjoy as much as possible this freedom that I discovered.</p>   </article> </div></div>]]></description>
