                    <p>Japan's parliament enacted Wednesday a law to promote competition in smartphone app stores by restricting tech giants Apple Inc. and Google LLC from limiting third-party companies from selling and operating apps on their platforms.</p>
<p>The law will prohibit the providers of Apple's iOS and Google's Android smartphone operating systems, app stores and payment platforms from preventing the sale of apps and services that directly compete with the native platforms' own.</p>
<p>The change is aimed at stopping the dominant players from gatekeeping and forcing them to engage in price competition with smaller challengers in hopes of benefiting consumers and promoting innovation.</p>
<p>The law will also prohibit the tech giants from giving priority to their own services in internet search results.</p>

</div>
<p>Violations of the new law will bring a penalty of 20 percent of the domestic revenue of the service found to have breached the rules. The fine can increase to 30 percent if the companies do not cease the anticompetitive practices.</p>
<p>The new penalty is more than triple the existing fine under the antimonopoly law, which imposes fines of 6 percent of revenue gained through services deemed to be using an anticompetitive edge.</p>
<p>The new law, expected to take effect by the end of 2025, follows a similar regulation introduced by the European Union in March.</p>
<p>The technology giants, which will be designated by the Fair Trade Commission, are to be required to submit regulatory compliance reports and will be monitored by the commission to ensure they are following the rules.</p>
<p>The legislation, which was approved by the House of Representatives in May, was enacted after being passed by the House of Councillors on Wednesday.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Swift compiler is notoriously slow due to how types are inferred<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Every June I hope that Apple will announce that they fixed it; sadly this is not that year.</p><p>Here’s an explanation by the creator of Swift, Chris Lattner (From his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ag0fPMmYPQ&amp;t=373s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mojo talk</a>):</p><blockquote><p>My experience with Swift is we tried to make a really fancy bi-directional Hindley-Milner type checker and it’s really great because you can have very beautiful minimal syntax but the problem is that A) compile times are really bad (particularly if you have complicated expressions) and B) the error messages are awful because now you have global constraint systems and when something goes wrong you have to infer what happened and the user can’t know that something over there made it so something over here can’t type check. In my experience it sounds great but it doesn’t work super well.</p></blockquote><p>Let me explain what he means with an example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>enum</span> <span>ThreatLevel</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>red</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>midnight</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>enum</span> <span>KeyTime</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>midnight</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>midday</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>func</span> <span>setThreatLevel</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>ThreatLevel</span><span>)</span> <span>{...}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>setThreatLevel</span><span>(.</span><span>midnight</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>.midnight</code> on the last line could represent <code>ThreatLevel.midnight</code> or <code>KeyTime.midnight</code>. The Swift compiler has to use the surrounding context of <code>setThreatLevel()</code>, which has the type <code>(ThreatLevel)-&gt;Void</code>, to infer that we mean <code>ThreatLevel.midnight</code>. After the Swift compiler parses code into an abstract syntax tree, child nodes influence their parent’s type <em>and</em> parent nodes influence their children’s types (that’s what Chris means by “bi-directional”). Compare this to the Zig language, in which types are determined without looking at the surrounding code.</p><p>This approach becomes a problem when expressions contain many elements that each need their types inferred, with each affecting the others. This often occurs due to Swift’s operator overloading, and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/initialization-with-literals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ExpressibleBy protocols</a>. Every literal (string, number, boolean, dictionary, array) and every operator (* / + - etc) multiply the combinations the type checker must consider.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>address</span> <span>=</span> <span>"127.0.0.1"</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>let</span> <span>username</span> <span>=</span> <span>"steve"</span>

</span></span><span><span>            <span>+</span> <span>"/picture"</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>swiftc</code> spends 42 seconds on these 12 lines on an M1 Pro<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, only to spit out the notorious <code>error: the compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time; try breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions</code>. In the same amount of time, clang can perform a clean build of my 59,000 line C project <em>38 times</em>.</p><p>The issue is caused by using the <code>+</code> operator with the <code>channel</code> Int and a String literal. Thanks to the standard library’s 17 overloads of <code>+</code> and 9 types adopting the <code>ExpressibleByStringLiteral</code> Protocol, the swift compiler can’t rule out that there <em>might</em> be a combination of types and operators that make the expression valid, so it has to try them all. Just considering that the five string literals could be one of the possible nine types results in 59,049 combinations, but I suspect that’s a lower bound, since it doesn’t consider the many overloads of <code>+</code>. It gives up before getting through them all.</p><p>You can fix the code by converting <code>channel</code> to String:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://"</span> <span>+</span> <span>username</span>

</span></span><span><span>            <span>+</span> <span>"/picture"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This now successfully compiles in 0.19 seconds!</p><p>Maybe you think strings are complicated or something, so here’s an example that is just math:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>5.0</span><span>;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, we get <code>error: the compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time; try breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions</code>, this time after “only” 8 seconds. The problem is due to <code>index * 5.0</code>, i.e. an int multiplied by a double. Even <a href="https://youtu.be/-eCwBwTbjAI?si=rQ5tHNcBRkmaFV8-&amp;t=1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toy compilers</a> handle equivalent code quickly, thanks to a context-free type system.</p><p>Both examples are slow because they’re invalid swift and the type checker falls out of the fast path in order to confirm all possible type combinations are invalid. You might think it’s ok for invalid code to take a long time to compile. For me, 42 seconds to produce an “I give up” message is unacceptable. However, there are valid lines of swift that take a long time to compile too. Send me your slow lines (found using <code>-Xfrontend -debug-time-function-bodies</code>) and I’ll add it to this post.</p><p>Swift has come a long way from version 1, but on its 10th birthday it can still be slow. Unfortunately this can’t be completely fixed by optimizing the current approach. It requires a different approach.</p><p>Here’s what I’d do:</p><ol><li>Add a flag to <code>swiftc</code> that makes it infer types using only an expression’s child AST nodes while ignoring the parent AST node. The flag would also disable the <code>ExpressibleBy</code> protocols, which by definition get their type from their context.</li><li>Make a feature that adds type annotations, casts, and enum names to existing code where necessary to compile with the new type checker</li><li>Update all sample code to compile with the flag</li></ol><p>This might be a reasonable stopping point: teams that care about compile times and good error messages could use the flag, and everyone else doesn’t have to. It could go further though:</p><ol start="4"><li>Enable the flag by default for new Xcode projects</li><li>Deprecate the old type inference approach</li></ol><p>With this new approach, you’d have to add type annotations in some places. I’m ok with that. As a result, we’d get faster compilation times and clearer error messages, but the extra verbosity might be too much for the swift community to swallow.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <hr>
    <p>The GJK algorithm is a weird way to do a simple thing.
</p><p>We have shape A and shape B, and we'd like to determine if they overlap.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609145754.png" width="500">
</p><p>A shape is a set of infinitely many points. If there exists any point that's a member of both sets, then the shapes overlap.
</p><p>Alternatively, if there exists point <em>a</em> in set A and a point <em>b</em> in set B such that:
</p><p><em>a</em> - <em>b</em> = <strong>0</strong>
</p><p>Then an intersection exists. Note that the <strong>0</strong> here represents a point itself: the origin.
</p><p>To see what this means intuitively, we can take a shift in perspective. Instead of dealing with specific points, let's try subtracting <em>every</em> point within one shape from <em>every</em> point within another, and plotting where they all end up:
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604163159.png" width="500">
</p><p>We've ended up with a new set that represents the "difference" between A and B. Since it contains the origin, we know that there must be at least one pair of points whose difference is <strong>0</strong>.
</p><p>That's exactly what the GJK algorithm takes advantage of. Instead of directly checking if the sets have an intersection, we subtract them and see if the new set contains the origin.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604163335.png" width="500">
</p><p>Combining sets like this is known as taking the Minkowski difference. You may see this denoted '⊖' to separate it from the normal notion of a difference.
</p><p>More formally, it's defined as:
</p><p>A ⊖ B = {a - b | a ∊ A, b ∊ B}
</p><p>At first, it doesn't seem like we've made any progress, only rephrased the problem. How are we supposed to subtract infinitely many points? Well, let's find the bare minimum that we <em>need to know</em> about the set A ⊖ B to see if it contains the origin.
</p><p>In 2 dimensions, if a convex set contains the origin, it means we're able to draw a triangle between 3 points on the boundary, which contains the origin. This makes the problem even easier. If we know that A ⊖ B is convex, we only need to deal with the boundary.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604164614.png" width="500">
</p><p>Luckily, it's easy to ensure A ⊖ B will be convex.
</p><p>The Minkowski difference of any two convex sets is also convex. So, we just need to break down A and B into convex components, which we can work with individually. On a computer, most shapes are already constructed out of convex components, so this process is often extremely easy.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604182725.png" width="500">
</p><p>By the way, even though I'm explaining in 2D, our problem is fundamentally the same in any dimension. Here, we're looking for a bounding triangle on A ⊖ B. But, more generally, we're looking for a "simplex" in our dimension. An n-dimensional simplex is just the simplest polytope that can enclose an n-dimensional region. For example, a 3D simplex is a tetrahedron, as it has the fewest vertices needed to bound a volume.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604175314.png" width="500">
</p><p><em></em>With these tools, let's restate the problem.
</p><ul><li>We want to determine if any simplex within A ⊖ B will enclose the origin.
</li></ul><ul><li>We don't want to have to compute the entire boundary of A ⊖ B. We only need to find some 3 points on A and some 3 points on B that will map to the vertices of our bounding simplex.
</li></ul><ul><li>There's no one solution, as infinitely many bounding simplexes might exist. We just need to find any 6 points on A and B that work, or prove that we can't find any.
</li></ul><p>So, from now on, whenever I say "shape", I'm speaking only about the boundary of a given set. We've thrown away all the area, as it's no longer relevant to the problem.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604192323.png" width="500">
</p><p>Things would be much easier if we had some system to identify points on our shape. The support function (denoted S here) does just that. It takes in a vector, and outputs the furthest point on the shape in that direction. On a convex shape, every boundary point is identifiable using the support function of some direction.
</p><p>In other words, if we rotate a vector <em>d</em> 360 degrees around the origin, S(<em>d</em>) will hit every point. So, finding N points on a shape corresponds to finding N directions.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609121840.png" width="500">
</p><p>The support function is easy to formally define. It's just the point that has the highest dot product of <em>d</em>. 
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609125706.png" width="500">
</p><p>Remember how I previously said we'd need to find 3 points on A, and 3 points on B? Well, we really only need to find 3 points in total. That's because of the following useful property of the Minkowski difference:
</p><p>The support of direction <em>d</em> in A ⊖ B = the support of <em>d</em> in A minus the support of <em>-d</em> in B.
</p><p>Basically, if we sweep across the borders of A and B in opposite directions by rotating <em>d</em>, we'll hit every boundary point on A ⊖ B. This massively narrows down how many possible points we need to search, as our points on A and B will always be dependent on each other. I know the diagrams are getting a bit confusing now, so bear with me.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240603131831.png" width="500">
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240610135637.png" width="500">
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609122623.png" width="500">
</p><p>Put differently, most combinations of points on A and B don't matter, as they won't land us on the border of A ⊖ B. We only need to consider the case where they're in opposite directions. (There's some easy intuition for why this is the case: I'll leave that as an exercise)
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609123441.png" width="500">
</p><p>Alright, the stage has been set for GJK. The goal of the GJK algorithm is to find a simplex on A ⊖ B that contains the origin (or show that none exists), while doing as few operations as possible.
</p><p>Let's appreciate how incredible such an algorithm would be: given <em>any</em> convex shape, as long as it has some defined notion of support points, we can detect collisions. That's unbelievably powerful. 
</p><p>Here's how it works:
</p><p>1) First, find a point on A ⊖ B using a random direction <em>d</em>, which we'll call <em>p</em>. This is just S(<em>d</em>) - S(-<em>d</em>). It's the first point on our simplex.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240603135933.png" width="500">
</p><p>2) Then, let's take the dot product of <em>d</em> and <em>p</em>. If it's positive, we keep going on with the algorithm. If it's negative, that means <em>d</em> and <em>p</em> point in opposite directions. In that case, we terminate the algorithm, as there's no way for B and A to overlap.
</p><p>But why?
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240603151836.png" width="500">
</p><p>It's more clear when we rotate our view to be in line with <em>d</em>. Point <em>a</em> is S(<em>d</em>), and point <em>b</em> is S(-<em>d</em>). Now, point <em>a</em> is the "top" of shape A, and point <em>b</em> is the "bottom" of B. Remember that <em>p</em> = <em>a - b</em>. So, if we project <em>p</em> onto <em>d</em> by taking the dot product, and it's negative, a gap exists between A and B.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609131123.png" width="500">
</p><p>3) Ok, great. We've got one point of our simplex. Now, we need another. From our point <em>p</em>, let's shoot in the direction of the origin. Take the support of that vector <em>-d</em>, and run our check from step 2 on it.
</p><p>If you think about it, we're just finding the point most in the direction of the origin from <em>p</em>. If our shape encloses the origin, then our new point will have to be on the opposite side of it.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240610080829.png" width="500">
</p><p>Remember how we just performed the check from step 2? Well, there's another way to think about it. We're just checking to see if we've crossed the origin. If the origin is within our shape, we'll have to cross it when we take support points in opposite directions.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609152836.png" width="500">
</p><p>4) Now, we're ready to complete the simplex. Let's take the vector perpendicular to our first 2 points in the direction of the origin. The support of that vector is the 3rd point of our simplex.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609133818.png" width="500">
</p><p>I mean, think about it. We've effectively divided the space in half with our first line. We know the origin can't be anywhere on one side of our line, so we continue our search in the opposite direction. That's the efficiency of GJK: we'll keep dividing the space in half, until we find the point.
</p><p>Oh, and as usual, we can run our check from step 2 to see if we've proven that the shapes do not overlap.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609134721.png" width="500">
</p><p>5) Now, let's see if our simplex contains the origin. If it does, we return true. Otherwise, we continue on.
</p><p>To find if the origin is within our triangle, first, let's break down the area surrounding it into the three infinite regions depicted below.
</p><p>The overlapping red, green, and blue regions each divide the space in half: an inside region, and an outside region.
</p><p>We've already eliminated the possibility of the origin being in the red region. So, we just have to check whether it's outside either of the remaining 2 lines.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240610140613.png" width="500">
</p><p>Luckily, we already know how to do this. Just take the dot product perpendicular to a given line to see if the origin is beyond it. If so, we know it must be in the white region.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240610140732.png" width="500">
</p><p>6) Now, it's time to iterate. We repeat from step 4, this time from the line on our simplex closest to the origin. We update our simplex using this new support point, and check if the new simplex contains the origin, as we did in step 5. This time, it does! Our algorithm returns <em>true</em>. If it doesn't, we keep doing this iterative process until it does, or one of our checks fails.

</p><p>And, that's it. That's the essence of the GJK algorithm. 
</p><p>I've glossed over a few implementation details, but you now have all the intuition you need to develop an in-depth understanding.
</p><p>Personally, I find this algorithm pretty because it's such a tidy example of what makes mathematics so powerful. Through a bunch of subtle shifts in perspective, a complicated problem becomes obvious.
</p><p>There's probably a few things incorrect with what I said. So, take it with the appropriate amount of salt for a high school sophomore's explanation of anything math related.</p>

I travel regularly and I love having a big, crisp, private display every where I am: Hotel, plane, train.

I also bought an Insta X4 360 camera which, while a far cry from Apple's immersive content in resolution, can still be a really nice way to relive memories.</p><p>More content: Last year I started 3d scanning (using Scaniverse) sculptures and other art / items that catch my eye during my travels. The AVP makes it really easy to import and place them in my environment. When I'm working I'll often place a favorite sculpture next to me for company &amp; as a reminder of a trip I took.</p><p>Finally, even after 4 months of use, it's still really fun and, from a tech perspective, astounding in terms of image quality, stability, 3D placement, integration in environment, etc. I love it and I can't wait for this tech to get better and better.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>How would this even work? The only plausible way I could think it that there's a 360 degree camera mounted court side and you can control the view by turning your head. But it would be entirely non-immersive because moving your upper body in any walk would immediately break the illusion. If the idea is just a court side camera I don't see what benefit the big headset is adding?</p>

                  <p>I hadnt been for a month or so (picked it up at launch), but the new beta release of Vision OS 2 looks feels like a massive quality of life improvement. Foveation and implied resolution seem to be massively improved, framerates are much higher too. The new Bora Bora (day + night) environment is fabulous and has moments of "am I actually there", the prior exisiting environments have all had a decent bump in apparent quality too. Apple are slow rolling content and experiences, but I can see this working out in the long run.
P.S. if anyone is still hung up on comfort, the "open face" headstraps do wonders, very much like wearing glasses.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago OpenAI released GPT-4o ushering in a new standard for multimodal, conversational experiences with sophisticated reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>Several days later, my good friends at <a href="https://poly.ai/">PolyAI</a> announced their Series C fundraising round after tremendous growth in the usage of their enterprise voice assistant.</p>
<p>Amid this news, a former Alexa colleague messaged me: “You’d think voice assistants would have been our forte at Alexa.”</p>
<p>For context, I joined Alexa AI as a research scientist in early 2019. By this time, the Alexa consumer device had existed for 5 years and was already in 100M+ homes throughout the world. </p>
<p>In 2019, Alexa was experiencing a period of hypergrowth. Dozens of new teams sprouted every quarter, huge financial resources were invested, and senior leadership made it clear that Alexa was going to be one of Amazon’s big bets moving forward. </p>
<p>My team was born amidst all this with a simple charter: bring the latest and greatest in AI research into the Alexa product and ecosystem. I’ve often described our group (later dubbed the Conversational Modeling team) as Google Brain meets Alexa AI-SWAT team. </p>
<p>Over the course of the 2.5 years I was there, we grew from 2 to ~20 and tackled every part of the conversational systems stack. </p>
<p>We built the first LLMs for the organization (though back then we didn’t call them LLMs), we built knowledge grounded response generators (though we didn’t call it RAG), and we pioneered prototypes for what it would mean to make Alexa a multimodal agent in your home. </p>
<p>We had all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI. But most of that tech never saw the light of day and never received any noteworthy press. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The reality is Alexa AI was riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.</p>
<h2>Bad Technical Process</h2>
<p>Alexa put a huge emphasis on protecting customer data with guardrails in place to prevent leakage and access. Definitely a crucial practice, but one consequence was that the internal infrastructure for developers was agonizingly painful to work with. </p>
<p>It would take weeks to get access to any internal data for analysis or experiments. Data was poorly annotated. Documentation was either nonexistent or stale. </p>
<p>Experiments had to be run in resource-limited compute environments. Imagine trying to train a transformer model when all you can get a hold of is CPUs. Unacceptable for a company sitting on one of the largest collections of accelerated hardware in the world. </p>
<p>I remember on one occasion our team did an analysis demonstrating that the annotation scheme for some subset of utterance data was completely wrong, leading to incorrect data labels. </p>
<p>That meant for months our internal annotation team had been mislabeling thousands of data points every single day. When we attempted to get the team to change their annotation taxonomy, we discovered it would require a herculean effort to get even the smallest thing modified. </p>
<p>We had to get the team’s PM onboard, then their manager’s buy-in, then submit a preliminary change request, then get that approved (a multi-month-long process end-to-end). </p>
<p>And most importantly, there was no immediate story for the team’s PM to make a promotion case through fixing this issue other than “it’s scientifically the right thing to do and could lead to better models for some other team.” No incentive meant no action taken.</p>
<p>Since that wasn’t our responsibility and the lift from our side wasn’t worth the effort, we closed that chapter and moved on. </p>
<p>For all I know, they could still be mislabeling those utterances to this day.</p>
<h2>Fragmented Org Structures</h2>
<p>Alexa’s org structure was decentralized by design meaning there were multiple small teams working on sometimes identical problems across geographic locales. </p>
<p>This introduced an almost Darwinian flavor to org dynamics where teams scrambled to get their work done to avoid getting reorged and subsumed into a competing team. </p>
<p>The consequence was an organization plagued by antagonistic mid-managers that had little interest in collaborating for the greater good of Alexa and only wanted to preserve their own fiefdoms. </p>
<p>My group by design was intended to span projects, whereby we found teams that aligned with our research/product interests and urged them to collaborate on ambitious efforts. The resistance and lack of action we encountered was soul-crushing. </p>
<p>I remember on one occasion we were coordinating a project to scale out the large transformers model training I had been leading. This was an ambitious effort which, if done correctly, could have been the genesis of an Amazon ChatGPT (well before ChatGPT was released). </p>
<p>Our Alexa team met with an internal cloud team which independently was initiating similar undertakings. While the goal was to find a way to collaborate on this training infrastructure, over the course of several weeks there were many half-baked promises made which never came to fruition. </p>
<p>At the end of it, our team did our own thing and the sister team did their own thing. Duplicated efforts due to no shared common ground. With no data, infrastructure, or lesson sharing, this inevitably hurt the quality of produced models.</p>
<p>As another example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=13727921011">Alexa skills ecosystem</a> was Alexa’s attempt to apply Amazonian decentralization to the dialogue problem. Have individual teams own individual skills.</p>
<p>But dialogue is not conducive to that degree of separation of concerns. How can you seamlessly hand off conversational context between skills? This means endowing the system with multi-turn memory (a long-standing dream of dialogue research). </p>
<p>The internal design of the skills ecosystem made achieving this infeasible because each skill acted like its own independent bot. It was conversational AI by an opinionated bot committee each with its own agenda. </p>
<h2>Product-Science Misalignment</h2>
<p>Alexa was viciously customer-focused which I believe is admirable and a principle every company should practice. Within Alexa, this meant that every engineering and science effort had to be aligned to some downstream product. </p>
<p>That did introduce tension for our team because we were supposed to be taking experimental bets for the platform’s future. These bets couldn’t be baked into product without hacks or shortcuts in the typical quarter as was the expectation. </p>
<p>So we had to constantly justify our existence to senior leadership and massage our projects with metrics that could be seen as more customer-facing. </p>
<p>For example, in one of our projects to build an open-domain chat system, the success metric (i.e. a single integer value representing overall conversational quality) imposed by senior leadership had no scientific grounding and was borderline impossible to achieve. </p>
<p>This introduced product/science conflict in every weekly meeting to track the project’s progress leading to manager churn every few months and an eventual sunsetting of the effort.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>As we look forward, in the battle for the future of the conversational AI market, I still believe it’s anyone’s game.</p>
<p>Today Alexa has sold 500M+ devices, which is a mind-boggling user data moat. But that alone is not enough. </p>
<p>Here’s how I would organize a dialogue systems effort from the ground-up:</p>
<p><strong>Invest in robust developer infrastructure especially around access to compute, data quality assurance, and streamlined data collection processes.</strong> Data and compute are the lifeblood of modern ML systems so proactively setting up this foundation is imperative.</p>
<p><strong>Make LLMs the fundamental building block of the dialogue flows.</strong> In retrospect, the Alexa skills ecosystem was a premature initiative for the abilities of conversational systems at the time. I liken it to when Leap Motion created and released a developer SDK before the underlying hardware device was stable. </p>
<p>But with the power of modern LLMs, I’m optimistic about redesigning a developer conversational toolkit with LLMs as their primitives. </p>
<p><strong>Ensure product timelines don’t dictate science research time frames.</strong> Because things are moving so fast in the AI world, it’s hard not to feel the pressure of shipping quickly. But there are still so many unsolved problems that will take time to solve. </p>
<p>Of course you should conduct research aggressively, but don’t have delivery cycles measured in quarters, as this will produce inferior systems to meet deadlines. </p>
<p>—</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about the future of multimodal conversational systems and interfaces, I would love to hear from you. We’ve got work to do!</p></div></div>]]></description>

This is full of false positives, requiring many hours to wade through to figure out what intel matters most to our users, why, and what they can do next.</p><p>Overwatch uses an alternative approach by layering AI agents and NLP techniques, including a combination of multifarious datasets, cluster analysis, topic modeling, Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALM) and domain knowledgeable agents.</p><p>This allows us to (1) Filter through OSINT in real time to identify events and narratives that matter to our users, and write reports on what they could do about it; (2) Identify dark web and deep web threats, fraud methods, new tactics, and compromised accounts, stolen checks, and credentials affecting our users or their peers; (3) Send an alert any time one a 3rd party supplier or parts of the tech stack are impacted by a widely exploited vulnerability, ransomware attack, or breach; and (4) Track malware and ransomware groups that are actively targeting your industry including Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</p><p>Our intelligence is actionable because the alert comes with the context and important details that an analyst needs to make an informed decision. Being AI-native, we also have a range of chat and data visualization features to effectively function as an intel co-pilot or industry expert. Finally, our in-house intelligence analysts and investigators can assist threat intelligence teams with HUMINT investigations and darkweb acquisition.</p><p>Our current customers include internet platforms, financial institutions, and supply chain companies. Within a day of one breach, one of our customers used Overwatch to surface 18,000+ leaked credentials. Another used us to surface fraudulent checks and learn exactly how threat actors were targeting their specific product features.</p><p>Our website says “Request a demo” but if you want to poke around on a very basic example of how we’re aggregating dark web, deep web, social, and surface web, log in at <a href="https://app.overwatchdata.io/" rel="nofollow">https://app.overwatchdata.io/</a> using these credentials:
  username: try_overwatch@overwatchdata.io 
  pw: HelloHNWorld</p><p>That login is for an un-personalized feed of cyber threat intel (breaches, vulnerabilities, ransomed organizations, and industry updates) that gives you a flavor of not just the kind of information from which we can collect, but more importantly, how our technology prioritizes, clusters, and summarizes alerts for cyber / fraud analysts. Try the chat agent on the left-hand side to parse through the data.</p><p>Or sign up for a longer trial and preview of our email alerts: <a href="https://xryl45u9uep.typeform.com/to/pvtZQyS0" rel="nofollow">https://xryl45u9uep.typeform.com/to/pvtZQyS0</a>. You can also check out our clickthrough demo for dark and deep web intelligence: <a href="https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis">https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis</a>.</p><p>Integration options range from simple dashboard access to our API for those who want to weave our intelligence directly into other products. Pricing is dependent on how complex a threat landscape our users want to monitor and we’re still figuring out how to standardize this but we’ll always do our best for the HN community.</p><p>Since the platform is AI-powered, it can also be used for news monitoring, supply chain disruptions, regulatory monitoring, or social media monitoring. We’ve had a lot of experience wrangling text-based feeds and using numerous AI-models (from embeddings, entity extractors, and LLMs) to filter, categorize, cluster, and analyze the data into meaning - so let us know if you’d like to nerd-out or have had any particular challenges. Looking forward to your feedback and questions! Thanks, HN!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

The immense scale of the cold box necessitates a transit process that moves at a "parade pace" of 5-10 miles per hour.</p><figure><blockquote><p>There's a lot of moving parts to it.

"There's a lot of moving parts to it. It's not just jump in a truck and go from point A to point B," said Matt Bruning, ODOT press secretary. "There's a lot of planning and coordination and analysis that goes with doing a move like that." The Department of Transportation has been planning the route for months, ensuring that bridges and roadways could handle the loads coming for them.

Bruning shared that other companies are piggybacking on the super load route plans now that accommodations have already been made. "It is kind of abnormal to see this many in this close succession. Usually, you have a couple, and you may not see another load like that for years," he said.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. –&nbsp;In a head-to-head comparison of masks worn by people with active COVID-19, the inexpensive “duckbill” N95 came out on top, stopping 98% of COVID-19 particles in the breath of infected people from escaping into the air. Led by researchers from the University of Maryland School of Public Health (SPH), results showed other masks also performed well, blocking at least 70% of viral particles from escaping from the source – an infected person’s exhaled breath.</p><div id="umd_terp_paragraph--12679">
				<p>The study,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(24)00192-0/fulltext">Relative efficacy of masks and respirators as source control for viral aerosol shedding from people infected with SARS-CoV-2</a>, published May 29 in eBioMedicine, a Lancet journal.</p>

<p>“The research shows that any mask is much better than no mask, and an N95 is significantly better than the other options. That’s the number one message,” says the study’s senior author,&nbsp;<a href="https://sph.umd.edu/people/donald-milton">Dr. Donald Milton</a>. Milton is a UMD SPH professor of environmental health and a global expert on how viruses spread through the air.</p>

<p>The study started in May 2020, shortly after the pandemic began, and compared breath samples from volunteers who had active COVID-19, testing the performance of four commonly-used masks. Even without giving participants fit tests or training on how to wear masks correctly, all masks significantly reduced the amount of virus escaping into the air. The study tested masks as a way to control the spread of the virus from the source, i.e. the infected person, and did not test masks as protection from COVID-19 in the surrounding air.</p>

<p>“Because COVID-19 is airborne, we focused on the extent to which wearing a mask reduces contamination of the air around you,” Milton says. This latest study is a continuation of investigations by UMD’s&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/phablabumd/home?authuser=0">Public Health AeroBiology Lab</a>&nbsp;(PHAB Lab) into how contagious respiratory viruses such as influenza contaminate the air.</p>

<p>Researchers asked volunteers with COVID-19 to breathe into a unique contraption known as the Gesundheit II Machine, developed by Milton and colleagues to measure viruses in exhaled breath. Participants, who breathed into the machine for 30 minutes at a time, were asked to do a&nbsp;variety of vocalizations such as repeating the alphabet, singing Happy Birthday, and even&nbsp;honoring&nbsp;<a href="https://umterps.com/sports/2018/6/7/school-mascot">UMD’s mascot</a>&nbsp;by repeatedly shouting “Go Terps!”</p>

<p>In each instance, researchers measured the amount of viral particles in the exhaled breath of volunteers, pairing each 30-minute session of breathing with a mask on with another 30-minute session with no mask.</p>

<p>“Data from our study suggests that a mildly symptomatic person with COVID-19 who is not wearing a mask exhales a little over two infectious doses per hour,” says first author Dr. Jianyu Lai, a postdoctoral researcher at the PHAB Lab. “But when wearing an N95 mask, the risk goes down exponentially.”</p>

<p>The duckbill N95 blocked 99% of large particles and 98% of small particles from escaping out of a person’s mask. Milton says the design’s tight seal, a powerful filter, and large air space for breath to move around all contribute to the duckbill’s success.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, KN95 masks – the disposable masks used widely – were no more effective than cloth or surgical masks. The study found that a common brand of KN95 masks leak more air than duckbills or other studied masks, because they don’t conform to the face well. That flaw is compounded by a powerful filter with more flow resistance that pushes air out of the mask at the sides instead of through the filter, allowing more virus particles to escape into the surrounding air.</p>

<p>Cloth masks also outperformed both KN95 and surgical masks. Milton theorizes that cloth masks with greater coverage, wrap around the face and give a better seal than either KN95 or surgical masks. With cloth mask filters, flow resistance is also lower, allowing breath to pass through the filter and not leak out the sides of the mask.</p>

<p>Limiting the amount of viral particles in the air is a key way to control highly contagious respiratory viruses in general, Milton said. This is even more the case with the COVID-19 virus, given transmissibility has increased over time, with Omicron in particular breaking through the immunity people developed from vaccinations or prior infections.</p>

<p>“Our research shows definitively why it’s so important to have non-pharmaceutical responses like wearing masks, and why we need studies like this to illuminate which masks are most effective,” says Milton.</p>

<p>Both Milton and Lai hope that their findings will inform health policies going forward, including when combatting potential outbreaks like bird flu or even the common flu.</p>

<p>“Duckbill N95 masks should be the standard of care in high-risk situations, such as nursing homes and health care settings,” Lai says. “Now, when the next outbreak of a severe respiratory&nbsp;virus occurs, we know exactly how to help control the spread, with this simple and inexpensive&nbsp;solution.”</p>

<p>In addition to researchers from the UMD School of Public Health, collaborators include authors from the UMD A. James Clark School of Engineering and the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at the University of Hong Kong, China.</p>

<p>This research was supported by the Prometheus-UMD, sponsored by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (agreement N66001-18-2-4015), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (contract 12-HHSN272201400008C), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (contract 200-2020-09528); by a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation; and by a gift from The Flu Lab.</p>

For a while, she made good money on a freelance writing platform called WritersAccess, where she wrote blogs and other content for small and midsize companies. But halfway through 2023, the income plummeted as some clients switched to ChatGPT for their writing needs. It was already a difficult time. Then the email came. </p><p>“I only got one warning,” Gasuras said. “I got this message saying they’d flagged my work as AI using a tool called ‘Originality.’” She was dumbfounded. Gasuras wrote back to defend her innocence, but she never got a response. Originality costs money, but Gasuras started running her work through other AI detectors before submitting to make sure she wasn’t getting dinged by mistake. A few months later, WritersAccess kicked her off the platform anyway. “They said my account was suspended due to excessive use of AI. I couldn’t believe it,” Gasuras said. WritersAccess did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>When ChatGPT set the world on fire a year and a half ago, it sparked a feverish search for ways to catch people trying to pass off AI text as their own writing. A host of startups launched to fill the void through AI detection tools, with names including Copyleaks, GPTZero, Originality.AI, and Winston AI. It makes for a tidy business in a landscape full of AI boogeymen. </p><p>These companies advertise peace of mind, a way to take back control through “proof” and “accountability.” Some advertise accuracy rates as high as 99.98%. But a growing body of experts, studies, and industry insiders argue these tools are far less reliable than their makers promise. There’s no question that AI detectors make frequent mistakes, and innocent bystanders get caught in the crossfire. Countless <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/student-accused-ai-cheating-turnitin-1234747351/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/student-accused-ai-cheating-turnitin-1234747351/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students have been accused of AI plagiarism</a></span>, but a quieter epidemic is happening in the professional world. Some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4602944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4602944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing gigs are drying up thanks to chatbots</a></span>. As people fight over the dwindling field of work, writers are losing jobs over false accusations from AI detectors.</p><p>“This technology doesn’t work the way people are advertising it,” said Bars Juhasz, co-founder of Undetectable AI, which makes tools to help people humanize AI text to sneak it past detection software. “We have a lot of concerns around the reliability of the training process these AI detectors use. These guys are claiming they have 99% accuracy, and based on our work, I think that’s impossible. But even if it’s true, that still means for every 100 people there’s going to be one false flag. We’re talking about people’s livelihoods and their reputations.”</p><h4 id="h1203"><a id=""></a><strong>Safeguard, or snake oil?</strong></h4><p>In general, AI detectors work by spotting the hallmarks of AI penmanship, such as perfect grammar and punctuation. In fact, one of the easiest ways to get your work flagged is to use Grammarly, a tool that checks for spelling and grammatical errors. It even suggests ways to rewrite sentences for clarity using, you guessed it, artificial intelligence. Adding insult to injury, Gizmodo spoke to writers who said they were fired by platforms that required them to use Grammarly. (Gizmodo confirmed the details of these stories, but we are excluding the names of certain freelance platforms because writers signed non-disclosure agreements.)</p><p>Detectors look for more telling factors as well, such as “burstiness.” Human writers are more likely to reuse certain words in clusters or bursts, while AI is more likely to distribute words evenly across a document. AI detectors can also assess “perplexity,” which essentially asks an AI to measure the likelihood that it would have produced a piece of text given the model’s training data. Some companies, such as industry leader Originaility.AI, train their own AI language models specially made to detect the work of other AIs, which are meant to spot patterns that are too complex for the human mind. </p><p>However, none of these techniques are foolproof, and many major institutions have backed away from this class of tools. OpenAI released its own AI detector to quell fears about its products in 2023 but pulled the tool off the market just months later “due to its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/open-ai-chatgpt-ai-text-detector-1850055005&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/open-ai-chatgpt-ai-text-detector-1850055005">low rate of accuracy</a></span>.” The academic world was first to adopt AI detectors, but false accusations pushed a long list of universities to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/23/turnitin_ai_detection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/23/turnitin_ai_detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ban the use of AI detection software</a></span>,, including Vanderbilt, Michigan State, Northwestern, and the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>AI detection companies “are in the business of selling snake oil,” said Debora Weber-Wulff, a professor at the University of Applied Sciences for Engineering and Economics in Berlin, who co-authored a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent paper</a></span> about the effectiveness of AI detection. According to Weber-Wulff, research shows that AI detectors are inaccurate, unreliable, and easy to fool. “People want to believe that there can be some magic software that solves their problems,” she said. But “computer software cannot solve social problems. We have to find other solutions.”</p><p>The companies that make AI detectors say they’re a necessary but imperfect tool in a world inundated by robot-generated text. There’s a significant demand for these services, whether or not they’re effective.</p><p>Alex Cui, chief technology officer for the AI detection company GPTZero, said detectors have meaningful shortcomings, but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. “We see a future where, if nothing is changed, the internet becomes more and more dictated by AI, whether it’s news, peer-reviewed articles, marketing. You don’t even know if the person you’re talking to on social media is real,” Cui said. “We need a solution for confirming knowledge en masse, and determining whether content is high quality, authentic, and of legitimate authorship.”</p><h4 id="h1204"><a id=""></a><strong>A necessary evil?</strong></h4><p>Mark, another Ohio-based copywriter who asked that we withhold his name to avoid professional repercussions, said he had to take work doing maintenance at a local store after an AI detector cost him his job.</p><p>“I got an email saying my most recent article had scored a 95% likelihood of AI generation,” Mark said. “I was in shock. It felt ridiculous that they’d accuse me after working together for three years, long before ChatGPT was available.” </p><p>He tried to push back. Mark sent his client a copy of the Google Doc where he drafted the article, which included timestamps that demonstrated he wrote the document by hand. It wasn’t enough. Mark’s relationship with the writing platform fell apart. He said losing the job cost him 90% of his income.</p><p>“We hear these stories more than we wish we did, and we understand the pain that false positives cause writers when the work they poured their heart and soul into gets falsely accused,” said Jonathan Gillham, CEO of Originality.AI. “We feel like we feel like we’re building a tool to help writers, but we know that at times it does have some consequences.”</p><p>But according to Gillham, the problem is about more than helping writers or providing accountability.“Google is aggressively going after AI spam,” he said. “We’ve heard from companies that had their entire site de-indexed by Google that said they didn’t even know their writers were using AI.” </p><p>It’s true that the internet is being flooded by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/study-junk-news-sites-ad-systems-ai-generated-content-1850578259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/study-junk-news-sites-ad-systems-ai-generated-content-1850578259">low-effort content farms</a></span> that pump out junky AI articles in an effort to game search results, get clicks, and make ad money from those eyeballs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-search-updates-downrank-seo-ai-generated-content-1851309904&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/google-search-updates-downrank-seo-ai-generated-content-1851309904">Google is cracking down on these sites</a></span>, which leads some companies to believe that their websites will be down-ranked if Google detects any AI writing whatsoever. That’s a problem for web-based businesses, and increasingly the No. 1 selling point for AI detectors. Originality promotes itself as a way to “future proof your site on Google” at the top of the list of benefits on its homepage.</p><p>A Google spokesperson said this completely misinterprets the company’s policies. Google, a company that provides AI, said it has no problem with AI content in and of itself. “It’s inaccurate to say Google penalizes websites simply because they may use some AI-generated content,” the spokesperson said. “As we’ve clearly stated, low value content that’s created at scale to manipulate Search rankings is spam, however it is produced. Our automated systems determine what appears in top search results based on signals that indicate if content is helpful and high quality.”</p><h4 id="h1205"><a id=""></a><strong>Mixed messages</strong></h4><p>No one claims AI detectors are perfect, including the companies that make them. But Originality and other AI detectors send mixed messages about how their tools should be used. For example, Gillham said “we advise against the tool being used within academia, and strongly recommend against being used for disciplinary action.” He explained the risk of false positives is too high for students, because they submit a small number of essays throughout a school year, but the volume of work produced by a professional writer means the algorithm has more chances to get it right. However, on one of the company’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://originality.ai/blog/ai-content-detection-in-education&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://originality.ai/blog/ai-content-detection-in-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a></span>, Originality says AI detection is “essential” in the classroom. </p><p>Then there are questions about how the results are presented. Many of the writers Gizmodo spoke to said their clients don’t understand the limitations of AI detectors or even what the results are actually saying. It’s easy to see how someone might be confused: I ran one of my own articles through Originality’s AI detector. The results were “70% Original” and “30% AI.” You might assume that means Originality determined that 30% of the article was written by a chatbot, especially because the tool highlights specific sentences it finds suspect. However, it’s actually a confidence score; Originality is 70% sure a human wrote the text. (I wrote the whole thing myself, but you’ll just have to take my word for it.)</p><p>Then there’s the way the company describes its algorithm. According to Originality, the latest version of its tool has a 98.8% accuracy rate, but Originality also says its false positive rate is 2.8%. If you’ve got your calculator handy, you’ll notice that adds up to more than 100%. Gillham said that’s because these numbers come from two different tests.</p><p>In Originality’s defense, the company provides a detailed explanation of how you should interpret the information right below the results, along with links to more detailed writeups about how to use the tool. It seems that isn’t enough, though. Gizmodo spoke to multiple writers who said they had to argue with clients who misunderstood the Originality tool.</p><p>Originality has published numerous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://originality.ai/blog/ai-content-detection-accuracy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://originality.ai/blog/ai-content-detection-accuracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a></span> and studies about accuracy and other issues, including the dataset and methodology it used to develop and measure its own tools. However, Weber-Wulff at the University of Applied Sciences for Engineering and Economics in Berlin said the details about Originality’s methodology “were not that clear.” </p><p>A number of experts Gizmodo spoke to, such as Juhasz of Undetectable AI, said they had concerns about businesses across the AI detection industry inflating their accuracy rates and misleading their customers. Representatives for GPTZero and Originality AI said their companies are committed to openness and transparency. Both companies said they go out of their way to provide clear information about the limitations and shortcomings of their tools.</p><p>It might feel like being against AI detectors is being on the side of writers, but according to Gillham the opposite is true. “If there are no detectors, then the competition for writing jobs increases and as a result the pay drops,” he said. “Detectors are the difference between a writer being able to do their work, submit content, and get compensated for it, and somebody being able to just copy and paste something from ChatGPT.” </p><p>On the other hand, all of the copywriters Gizmodo spoke to said the AI detectors are the problem. </p><p>“AI is the future. There’s nothing we can do to stop it, but in my opinion that’s not the issue. I can see lots of ways AI can be useful,” Mark said. “It’s these detectors. They are the ones that are saying with utmost certainty that they can detect AI writing, and they’re the ones who are making our clients on edge and paranoid and putting us out of jobs.” </p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/06/12/elixir-v1-17-0-released/">https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/06/12/elixir-v1-17-0-released/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40656747">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <p>Elixir v1.17 has just been released. 🎉</p>

<p>This release introduces set-theoretic types into a handful of language constructs. While there are still <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2023/06/22/type-system-updates-research-dev/">many steps ahead of us</a>, this important milestone already brings benefits to developers in the form of new warnings for common mistakes. This new version also adds support for <a href="https://www.erlang.org/downloads/27">Erlang/OTP 27</a>, the latest and greatest Erlang release. You’ll also find a new calendar-related data type (<code>Duration</code>) and a <code>Date.shift/2</code> function.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="warnings-from-gradual-set-theoretic-types">Warnings from gradual set-theoretic types</h2>

<p>This release introduces gradual set-theoretic types to infer types from patterns and use them to type check programs, enabling the Elixir compiler to find faults and bugs in codebases without requiring changes to existing software. The underlying principles, theory, and roadmap of our work have been outlined in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06391">“The Design Principles of the Elixir Type System” by Giuseppe Castagna, Guillaume Duboc, José Valim</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment, Elixir developers will interact with set-theoretic types only through <strong>warnings</strong> found by the type system. The current implementation models all data types in the language:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>binary()</code>, <code>integer()</code>, <code>float()</code>, <code>pid()</code>, <code>port()</code>, <code>reference()</code> - these
types are indivisible. This means both <code>1</code> and <code>13</code> get the same <code>integer()</code>
type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>atom()</code> - it represents all atoms and it is divisible. For instance, the
atom <code>:foo</code> and <code>:hello_world</code> are also valid (distinct) types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>map()</code> and structs - maps can be “closed” or “open”. Closed maps only allow
the specified keys, such as <code>%{key: atom(), value: integer()}</code>. Open maps
support any other keys in addition to the ones listed and their definition
starts with <code>...</code>, such as <code>%{..., key: atom(), value: integer()}</code>. Structs
are closed maps with the <code>__struct__</code> key.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>tuple()</code>, <code>list()</code>, and <code>function()</code> - currently they are modelled as
indivisible types. The next Elixir versions will also introduce fine-grained
support to them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We focused on <em>atoms</em> and <em>maps</em> on this initial release as they are respectively the simplest and the most complex types representations, so we can stress the performance of the type system and quality of error messages. Modelling these types will also provide the most immediate benefits to Elixir developers. Assuming there is a variable named <code>user</code>, holding a <code>%User{}</code> struct with a <code>address</code> field, Elixir v1.17 will emit the following warnings at compile-time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pattern matching against a map or a struct that does not have the given key,
such as <code>%{adress: ...} = user</code> (notice <code>address</code> vs <code>adress</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accessing a key on a map or a struct that does not have the given key, such
as <code>user.adress</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invoking a function on non-modules, such as <code>user.address()</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capturing a function on non-modules, such as <code>&amp;user.address/0</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attempting to call an anonymous function without an actual function, such as
<code>user.()</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Performing structural comparisons between structs, such as <code>my_date &lt;
~D[2010-04-17]</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Performing structural comparisons between non-overlapping types, such as
<code>integer &gt;= string</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building and pattern matching on binaries without the relevant specifiers,
such as <code>&lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;</code> (this warns because by default it expects an integer, it
should have been <code>&lt;&lt;name::binary&gt;&gt;</code> instead).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attempting to rescue an undefined exception or a struct that is not an
exception.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accessing a field that is not defined in a rescued exception.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example of how the warning for accessing a misspelled field of a
struct looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/type-warning-on-struct-field.png" alt="Example of a warning when accessing a mispelled struct field"></p>

<p>Another example, this time it’s a warning for structural comparison across two
<code>Date</code> structs:</p>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/type-warning-on-date-comparison.png" alt="Example of a warning when comparing two structs with &quot;>&quot;"></p>

<p>These warnings also work natively in text editors, as they are standard Elixir
compiler warnings:</p>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/type-warning-in-editor.png" alt="Example of a type warning inline in an editor"></p>

<p>These new warnings will help Elixir developers find bugs earlier and give more
confidence when refactoring code, especially around maps and structs. While
Elixir already emitted some of these warnings in the past, those were discovered
using syntax analysis. The new warnings are more reliable, precise, and with
better error messages. Keep in mind, however, that the Elixir typechecker only
infers types from patterns within the same function at the moment. Analysis from
guards and across function boundaries will be added in future releases. For more
details, see our new <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/gradual-set-theoretic-types.html">reference document on gradual set-theoretic
types</a>.</p>

<p>The type system was made possible thanks to a partnership between
<a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/">CNRS</a> and <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>. The development
work is currently sponsored by <a href="https://www.fresha.com/">Fresha</a>
(<a href="https://www.fresha.com/careers/openings?department=engineering">they are hiring!</a>),
<a href="https://starfish.team/">Starfish*</a>, and <a href="https://dashbit.co/">Dashbit</a>.</p>



<p>This release adds support for Erlang/OTP 27 and drops support for Erlang/OTP 24.
We recommend Elixir developers to migrate to Erlang/OTP 26 or later, especially
on Windows. Support for WERL (a graphical user interface for the Erlang terminal
on Windows) will be removed in Elixir v1.18.</p>

<p>You can read more about Erlang/OTP 27 in <a href="https://www.erlang.org/downloads/27">their release
announcement</a>. The bits that are
particularly interesting for Elixir developers are the addition of a <a href="https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc3/lib/stdlib-6.0/doc/html/json.html"><code>json</code>
module</a>
and process labels (<code>proc_lib:set_label/1</code>). The latter will also be available
in this Elixir release as <code>Process.set_label/1</code>.</p>

<h2 id="new-duration-data-type-and-shifting-functions">New <code>Duration</code> data type and shifting functions</h2>

<p>This Elixir version introduces the <code>Duration</code> data type and APIs to shift dates,
times, and date times by a given duration, considering different calendars and
time zones.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>iex</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>shift</span><span>(</span><span>~D[2016-01-31]</span><span>,</span> <span>month:</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>~D[2016-03-31]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We chose the name <em>“shift”</em> for this operation (instead of “add”) since working
with durations does not obey properties such as <strong>associativity</strong>. For instance,
adding one month and then one month does not give the same result as adding two
months:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>iex</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>~D[2016-01-31]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>shift</span><span>(</span><span>month:</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>shift</span><span>(</span><span>month:</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>~D[2016-03-29]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Still, durations are essential for building intervals, recurring events, and
modelling scheduling complexities found in the world around us. For <code>DateTime</code>s,
Elixir will correctly deal with time zone changes (such as Daylight Saving
Time). However, provisions are also available in case you want to surface
conflicts, such as shifting to a wall clock that does not exist, because the
clock has been moved forward by one hour. See <code>DateTime.shift/2</code> for examples.</p>

<p>Finally, we added a new <code>Kernel.to_timeout/1</code> function, which helps developers
normalize durations and integers to a timeout used by many APIs—like <code>Process</code>,
<code>GenServer</code>, and more. For example, to send a message after one hour, you can
now write:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>send_after</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>:wake_up</span><span>,</span> <span>to_timeout</span><span>(</span><span>hour:</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="learn-more">Learn more</h2>

<p>Here are other notable changes in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are new <code>Keyword.intersect/2,3</code> functions to mirror the equivalent in
the <code>Map</code> module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new Mix profiler was added, <code>mix profile.tprof</code>, which lets you use the
new <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/tools/tprof.html">tprof</a>
profiler released with Erlang/OTP 27. This profiler leads to the
soft-deprecation of <code>mix profile.cprof</code> and <code>mix profile.eprof</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We added <code>Kernel.is_non_struct_map/1</code>, a new guard to help with the common
pitfall of matching on <code>%{}</code>, which also successfully matches structs (as
they are maps underneath).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elixir’s Logger now formats
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_statem.html"><code>gen_statem</code></a>
reports and includes Erlang/OTP 27 <em>process labels</em> in logger events.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Who would have thought that Raspberry Pi, the maker of the tiny, cheap, single-board computers, would become a public company? Yet, this is exactly what’s <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happening</a>: Raspberry Pi <a href="https://investors.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced its IPO</a> on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday morning at £2.80 per share, valuing it at £542 million, or $690 million at today’s exchange rate.</p>

<p>Shortly after that, the company’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6419f805-01e8-4900-9da7-7e4fc8504a81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shares jumped a nice 32% to £3.70</a>. It means that Raspberry Pi could end up raising more than $200 million during its IPO process.</p>

	
	


<p>Retail investors can’t buy Raspberry Pi shares just yet, as only certain institutional shareholders can trade the company’s shares right now. Retail investors will be able to buy and sell shares starting on Friday.</p>

	
	


<p>This listing is also a win for the London stock market. Deliveroo and Wise both trade in London, but many U.K. tech companies choose to go public in the U.S., as the stock markets there are more liquid.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi is mostly known for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/raspberry-pi-5/">tiny computers</a> that can be programmed to perform all sorts of tasks without spending too much money and requiring too much power. These ARM-based computers became particularly popular among tech hobbyists who wanted to create media servers, retro game consoles, interactive dashboards, robotics projects and more.</p>

<p>More recently, many industrial companies have started integrating the Raspberry Pi in their devices and facilities. The company <a href="https://investors.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that the industrial and embedded segment represents 72% of its sales.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi has sold 60 million units since its inception. In 2023 alone, Raspberry Pi generated $266 million in revenue and $66 million in gross profit.</p>

	
	



<p>Raspberry Pi Ltd, the public company, is the commercial subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The Foundation says it wants to make it easier for people to learn coding through a low-cost, programmable computer. It also remains the main shareholder of Raspberry Pi Ltd.</p>

	
	


<p>Other strategic shareholders in the company include ARM and Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation, a subsidiary of Sony that makes image sensors for smartphones and other components. ARM previously said it intended to increase its stake in Raspberry Pi via the public listing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Ask most venture-backed founders why they get 10x more equity than employee #1, 100x more equity than employee #5, and 1000x more equity than employee #15, and you'll get the same answer: "I'M TAKING SO MUCH RISK, IT'S SO HARD TO START A COMPANY, I MADE A BIG MOVE!!!" And then you'll ask, "but why are you yelling?”</p><p>The narrative of the founder's risk is a cornerstone of Silicon Valley's mythology. Founders are celebrated for leaving stable jobs and pouring their lives into an “uncertain” and “high-risk” venture. This mythos justifies the enormous equity stakes founders hold compared to early employees who take very similar risks by joining an unproven startup.</p><p>However, there's a lesser-known aspect of the startup ecosystem that significantly shifts the risk landscape: <strong>founder liquidity</strong>.</p><h3 id="my-experience-in-early-stage-startups">My Experience in Early Stage Startups</h3><p>Being a software engineer who has a strong preference for creativity, problem-solving, and autonomy I realized during college that very big and slow companies were not for me. I joined a startup straight out of college as employee number 8 and immediately knew I made the right choice. My skills were improving week over week, I was responsible for shipping important features and was given a lot of responsibility right out of the gate.</p><p>I eventually got pretty good at choosing strong founders to join and building great products from zero to one which in turn spawned a cycle of joining a team early, finding success, the company gets too big, and then I leave to do it again elsewhere. I have been an early or first engineer at five different companies and have had three liquidity events in a 9-year career.</p><h3 id="the-reality-of-founder-risk-liquidity">The Reality of Founder Risk &amp; Liquidity</h3><p><strong>Founder liquidity</strong> refers to the practice where founders sell a portion of their shares during a new funding round. This allows them to "take chips off the table," securing personal financial stability while continuing to build the company with a fresh influx of venture capital. This practice is often kept under wraps, discussed in closed boardrooms, and only briefly mentioned in investor updates. You would really only know this happened if you were a founder, investor, or had direct access to the cap table.</p><p>Why is it a secret that founders get liquidity in many venture rounds? Because it undermines the narrative of the founder who is "all-in." The story of the founder who mortgaged their house and lived on ramen noodles for years is compelling. It garners admiration and sympathy, attracting top talent willing to work for lower salaries in exchange for a piece of the pie. If it were widely known that founders could de-risk their financial position while their employees remained all-in, it might change how startups are perceived and valued.</p><p>This is a graph of cash compensation over time modeled off of a real scenario that happened over 4 years. This level of founder liquidity is fairly common.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1056" height="547" srcset="https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 600w, https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 1000w, https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The founder in this scenario was offered $400,000 of liquidity at Series A and $750,000 at Series B and encouraged to do so by their board of investors to de-risk their own life. Liquidity was not offered to any employees and the fact that this happened at all was only revealed to people on the cap table.</p><p>Another more well-known and extreme example was in the case of Adam Neumann the founder of WeWork - Neumann was able to cash out over 2B in secondary meanwhile not a single WeWork employee was able to capitalize on their equity stakes. They were told internally how much their shares were worth at each raise, and the hype surrounding each raise continued as WeWork sky-rocketed in valuation. Neumann was smart to de-risk his position by selling as much secondary as possible during the ascent but only attempted to structure a tender offer for non-founding employees in 2019 <strong><em>nine years</em></strong> after WeWork was created. That tender offer with SoftBank fell through and employees were left with absolutely nothing. (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/04/13/wework-employees-feel-abandoned-and-angry-as-softbank-ditches-its-3-billion-buyout-offer?ref=stefantheard.com">source</a>)</p><p>The part about these stories that feels unfair is not that the founders are getting liquidity - it's that they are the <em>only ones</em> getting liquidity. There are other stories like <a href="https://techfundingnews.com/unravelling-virtual-dreams-the-rise-and-fall-of-hopin/?ref=stefantheard.com" rel="noreferrer">Hopin</a> where the founder takes tens or hundreds of millions in secondary just to later sell the company for less than the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/venture-capital/sections/liquidation-preference?ref=stefantheard.com" rel="noreferrer">liquidation preference</a> stack and leave the employees with a grand total of zero dollars for their equity.</p><h3 id="right-sizing-perception">Right-Sizing Perception</h3><p>There are a lot of odd perceptions surrounding founder liquidity:</p><ol><li>Investors and founders both tend to think that if employees knew founders were getting liquidity that that would negatively impact employee morale (<strong>it wouldn’t</strong>)</li><li>Founders often feel guilty that they are getting liquidity (<strong>they shouldn’t</strong>)</li><li>Investors think that the liquidity could taint the perception of future investors negatively (<strong>it doesn’t</strong>)</li><li>Investors, founders, and employees all believe that founders are taking more risk than early employees (<strong>this isn’t true once founders have exclusive access to liquidity</strong>)</li></ol><p>When I found out that my founders got access to liquidity during our series A my first thought was “That is awesome, they deserve it” my second thought was “I wonder why employees didn’t get access to any liquidity?” and then my third thought was “Is this a secret? It seems like a secret. That’s weird”. I was the only employee who knew about it because I had incidental access to the cap table.</p><p>Once I found out I was curious if I was reading it correctly so I immediately went to one of the founders and asked “Did you get a bit of liquidity during the series A?”. His reaction went from surprise to confusion and then he said “Yeah I did, a little bit”. I said “Wow that is awesome, congrats! It has to be nice to be able to backfill some salary after grinding for a couple of years” and he said, “Yeah, definitely.”. I could sense relief after chatting about it with him, almost like he felt better knowing that I knew about it. I never felt negative, had low morale, or anything of the sort, I trusted in my founding team and I was happy for them. If it were the case that I was lied to about it, then I would be upset and have low morale but that would be a result of being lied to - not liquidity access.</p><h3 id="balancing-the-scales">Balancing the Scales</h3><p>As of 4 months ago I left a very successful stealth startup (which grew to 40M in ARR in two years) to become a founder and that is when it clicked - I expected to feel stressed, pressured, and the weight of all of the risk I was taking. What actually happened is that I realized I could have been a founder 6 years ago and I would have been taking a similar amount of risk as I did then as the first employee at <a href="http://tackle.io/?ref=stefantheard.com">tackle.io</a>.</p><p>My intention now, as a founder, is to balance the risk for early employees by being transparent, more generous with equity, and only taking liquidity if I can also offer it to employees as well.</p><ul><li>Our employee option pool is 20% which is double the average</li><li>We have a 3-month equity cliff which is 9 months sooner than the average.</li><li>We allow employees to exercise options up to 10 years after they leave instead of 90 days.</li><li>Our equity packages vest over 3 years instead of the industry standard 4-year period.</li></ul><p>These changes are great, but nowhere near enough. In my view, every internal announcement of a new round at venture-backed companies should be accompanied by education and transparency around liquidity. Without transparency, none of the misperceptions have a chance of going away. The net result is that employees have a fundamentally misguided idea of the risk landscape as it shifts beneath their feet. </p><div><p>If you work at a venture-backed company the next time a round is announced ask if the founders took any liquidity. Do it anonymously if you have to. This question should become so common that founders and investors become transparent by default. If they say no, great - no change to risk profiles. If they say yes - great, employees are operating with the same information as the founders and investors. This levels the playing field and allows employees to assess if they are still in a lower risk bucket than the founders, or if they are now taking significantly more risk than the founders.</p><p>If employees realize they are taking more risk than the founders, maybe they'll ask for more compensation, maybe they'll congratulate the founders and move on with their day, maybe they'll start yelling: "I'M TAKING SO MUCH RISK, IT'S SO HARD TO BUILD A COMPANY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY!!!". And maybe they're right.</p></div><p><em>(special thanks to anu, jessica, erika, laura, derek, and minh for reading drafts and giving  feedback on this)</em></p>

<!-- cache hit 245:single/related:3bb49bf898878db2dc1931d956d3c958 --><!-- empty -->
<p>When T-Mobile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/">announced price hikes</a> of up to $5 per line on older smartphone plans last month, many customers were shocked because of T-Mobile's years-old promise that their price would never rise as long as they stuck with the same plan.</p>
<p>"New rule: Only YOU should have the power to change what you pay," T-Mobile said in a <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next">January 2017 announcement</a> of its "Un-contract" promise for T-Mobile One plans. "Now, T-Mobile One customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it. T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile One plan."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the promise wasn't as simple as T-Mobile claimed it to be in that press release. T-Mobile also published an FAQ that answered the question, "What happens if you do raise the price of my T-Mobile One service?" It explained that the only guarantee is T-Mobile will pay your final month's bill if the price goes up and you decide to cancel.</p>
<p>The FAQ stated, "The Un-contract is our commitment that only you can change what you pay and we mean it! To show just how serious we are we have committed to pay your final month's recurring service charges if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave. Just let us know within 60 days."</p>
<p>The FAQ link now just redirects to the T-Mobile home page but the Internet Archive has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180124073308/https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/tmo_one_faqs#uncontractpromise">capture</a> of the FAQ from January 2018. While we couldn't find an earlier capture of the page, a <a href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/t-mobile-un-carrier-next.760027/#post-5636154">discussion</a> on an Android Central forum shows that the text mentioned above was noticed by some customers in January 2017.</p>
<p>The Un-contract was also previously <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/uncontract-carrier-freedom">applied to T-Mobile Simple Choice plans</a> starting in March 2015. The 2015 announcement said the Un-contract would be enabled automatically with "no crazy strings, no hoops to jump through, no hidden fees, no BS."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The recent price increases <a href="https://tmo.report/2024/05/confirmed-t-mobile-is-raising-prices-on-some-legacy-plans/">reportedly</a> affect Simple Choice plans as well as other packages, but we haven't been able to find any language from 2015 that acknowledges an exception that lets T-Mobile raise prices on Simple Choice. We asked T-Mobile several questions today and will update this article if it provides more information.</p>
<h2>T-Mobile disputes complaint to FCC</h2>
<p>T-Mobile is pointing to the above caveat to defend itself against at least one complaint filed to the Federal Communications Commission after the recent price hike. Yesterday, a Reddit user and T-Mobile subscriber <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1dd1x5t/did_anyone_else_get_the_following_letter_from/">posted a letter</a> in which T-Mobile asked the FCC to close the complaint filed by the user.</p>
<p>T-Mobile's response to the FCC and the user who complained said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regarding these changes, we are aware some customers have inquired about T-Mobile's <em>Un-contract</em> and <em>Price Lock</em>. With <em>Un-contract</em>, T-Mobile committed to its customers that if we were to increase prices and customers chose to leave as a result, T-Mobile would pay the customers' final month's recurring service charge, as long as we are notified within 60 days. Consistent with this commitment, customers who activated on an eligible rate plan between January 5, 2017 and April 27, 2022, can request to have their final month's qualifying service charge reimbursed if their rate plan increases and they choose to cancel service. Customers simply need to request reimbursement within 60 days of the price increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>The T-Mobile response goes on to describe the more recent "Price Lock" guarantee that was offered starting in April 2022 and discontinued in January 2024. The T-Mobile response said that customer lines covered by Price Lock are exempt from the recent price increases:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for customers with concerns about T-Mobile's <em>Price Lock</em> guarantee, it is important to note that customers with <em>Price Lock</em> are not impacted by the change. On April 28, 2022, T-Mobile began offering <em>Price Lock</em> on new account activations on qualifying rate plans. For customers who activated on a qualifying plan between April 28, 2022 and January 17, 2024, <em>Price Lock</em> guarantees that accounts activated with a qualifying rate plan, within the enrollment period, would not be subject to a price increase, so long as the account remained in good standing and the customer remained on the qualifying rate plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>T-Mobile's response to the complaint also said that customers who switch plans lose their Price Lock guarantee.</p>
