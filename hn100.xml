</picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>Every big Windows announcement this year was tied to some kind of AI feature or event. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p id="27796049-a0b7-418f-9377-c8f9f2078f90">Of course, the issue that made headlines the most this year is AI, as Microsoft falls over itself trying to make Windows 11 a frontier platform for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-redirect="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/artificial-intelligence" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. Unfortunately, this effort feels like it has been prioritized above everything else, including quality of life and overall platform stability.</p><p>Copilot has forced its way into almost every surface and intention on the platform. Heck, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-notepad-will-soon-let-you-generate-text-using-on-device-ai-models-no-subscription-required" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-notepad-will-soon-let-you-generate-text-using-on-device-ai-models-no-subscription-required">Notepad now has a Copilot button</a>, which is something literally nobody has ever asked for. Microsoft's AI intentions feel obsessive and forced, almost as if the company is just throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks.</p><p>Under the hood, Microsoft has been moving to make Windows 11 agentic. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-just-revealed-how-windows-11-is-evolving-into-an-agentic-os-finally-the-explanation-weve-all-been-waiting-for" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-just-revealed-how-windows-11-is-evolving-into-an-agentic-os-finally-the-explanation-weve-all-been-waiting-for">It unveiled the agentic workspace</a>, along with a set of APIs that will allow AI developers to build tools that can automate workflows on your behalf. Sounds great on paper, until you read the fine print and discover that it comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-warns-security-risks-agentic-os-windows-11-xpia-malware" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-warns-security-risks-agentic-os-windows-11-xpia-malware">serious security implications and warnings. </a></p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DjgB8CDooXtXtjAxRbocvW"><section><p>All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.</p></section></div><p>You'd like to think that a feature with such serious security concerns wouldn't make it out of the lab, but because this is AI, Microsoft doesn't seem to mind. The feature even ships off by default, which tells you everything you need to know about how the company views this feature.</p><p>A large chunk of the AI features that were announced this year also aren't Copilot+ PC exclusive, which means most of them require an internet connection and your data sent to the cloud to be useful, which is another privacy concern to add to all the other privacy concerns on Windows 11.</p><p>In November, Windows president Pavan Davuluri mentioned that Windows would evolve into an agentic OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-president-confirms-os-will-become-ai-agentic-generates-push-back-online" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-president-confirms-os-will-become-ai-agentic-generates-push-back-online">sparking one of the biggest amounts of backlash</a> I've seen around Windows this year. His post was so negatively received, he had to disable replies and issue a follow up statement reassuring customers that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-president-addresses-current-state-of-windows-11-after-ai-backlash-we-know-we-have-a-lot-of-work-to-do" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-president-addresses-current-state-of-windows-11-after-ai-backlash-we-know-we-have-a-lot-of-work-to-do">Windows would continue to innovate outside of AI too.</a></p><p>I want to stress that AI <em>can </em>be beneficial. I've always said that AI is best when it's invisible, which is why I'm so confused about Microsoft's approach to AI on Windows 11. It seems like Microsoft wants AI to be <em>the </em>selling point, but that's totally backwards. AI should be a helpful extra, not an all-encompassing, sole reason for the platform's existence.</p><h2 id="continuous-innovation-more-like-continuous-irritation-3">Continuous Innovation?

</picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>Your Windows 11 install is at risk of being "improved" on a monthly cadence these days. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p id="944c1d64-9c9c-49fe-a761-8df1a750617a">I think the biggest issue users are dealing with right now is Microsoft's "Continuous Innovation" strategy for Windows 11, which is designed to allow the company to build new features and get them out the door faster than ever before.</p><p>In the past, new Windows features were often timed with a significant OS update. Once a year, Windows would receive a big upgrade, which would introduce new features and improvements from the core up. This allowed Microsoft plenty of time to bake and fine-tune new features and changes, ironing out bugs before general availability.</p><p>Today, thanks to Continuous Innovation, Microsoft is able to ship new features whenever the company <em>deems </em>them ready. Every. Single. Month. This means there's now a constant churn of new features, with no breaks or respite. Users never get a chance to breathe.</p><p>On top of this is Microsoft's Controlled Feature Rollout (CFR) system, which makes it so some users don't see the new features even after installing the update that supposedly includes them, making it literally impossible to predict and prepare for when a new feature might actually arrive on your PC.</p><p>The new Windows 11 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/start-menu" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/start-menu">Start menu</a> is a perfect example of this. It only began rolling out in October, but thanks to Controlled Feature Rollout, many users didn't get it right away after installing the October update. For those people, it randomly appeared a few days or weeks later, without any warning or prompt, letting the user know what happened and why.</p><p>In this scenario, going into your update history to see what changed is going to confuse you, because the update that includes the new Start menu was installed on your system weeks ago. You're only seeing the new features now because Microsoft allowed you to see it, which is insane and frustrating beyond belief.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="ba911589-a255-4e16-8ba6-ffb740115e5e"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

</picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>Two identical installs of Windows might present themselves differently thanks to CFR. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p id="5721c7ca-3c21-43f9-b36d-ed23211d6589">As a result, no two Windows PCs are the same these days. Two identical systems, running the same build and update of Windows 11, might appear completely different feature-wise, which is confusing to your average user, and more than likely one of the reasons why Windows feels so much buggier these days. There are too many moving parts.</p><p>Continuous Innovation essentially boils down to allowing Microsoft to force new features onto you whenever it wants, because the company ties these new features to monthly security updates, which are essentially required if you want to use your computer safely on the internet.</p><p>But it's beyond frustrating when said features or changes randomly appear on your system without any warning, and even more frustrating when you can't disable or undo them. Users have to make do with Microsoft constantly moving the deck chairs, and people are getting tired.</p><p>I mean, Microsoft has even built a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-publishes-windows-roadmap-as-it-promises-transparency-around-feature-availability" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-publishes-windows-roadmap-as-it-promises-transparency-around-feature-availability">Windows Roadmap website</a> designed to try and make it easier to see where new features are in their rollout. Except, the website is so confusing and frustrating to navigate, and digest, it's actually not very useful at all. That's how complicated the Windows update situation is right now.</p><p>Above all else, it renders the annual version update essentially irrelevant. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-version-25h2-no-new-features" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-version-25h2-no-new-features">Version 25H2</a>, which shipped a couple of months back, includes no new features or changes over version 24H2, because Microsoft ships new features to both at the same time. They are the same version. Why even do this?

It feels like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-has-a-problem-nobody-wants-to-buy-or-use-its-shoddy-ai" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-has-a-problem-nobody-wants-to-buy-or-use-its-shoddy-ai">many new features that actually ship are half-baked</a>, and in some cases<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-says-latest-windows-11-updates-might-break-the-start-menu-taskbar-and-other-integral-ui-bits-heres-what-you-need-to-know" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-says-latest-windows-11-updates-might-break-the-start-menu-taskbar-and-other-integral-ui-bits-heres-what-you-need-to-know">, outright break other things as they are introduced.</a></p><p>Every single week, there's a new headline about how a recent Microsoft update has broken something on Windows, with fixes for said bugs either coming a couple of weeks later or an entire month later, depending on the schedule. Rarely, if ever, does Microsoft pull an update that is causing bugs, though it has happened a couple of times.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if CFR is playing a part in this decline in quality. With the same version of Windows being able to present itself differently depending on what I can only describe as random factors, it may be just becoming harder to keep Windows stable when there are so many moving parts and variables at play.</p><p>Windows 11 today is a much more complex beast than previous versions of Windows have been. Microsoft has been obsessed with A/B testing for a long while, but CFR takes it to a whole other level, to the point where you literally can't guarantee the version of Windows 11 you're installing will be "feature complete" when you want it to be.</p><p>Some users have reported never getting the chance to test a particular feature before it's made generally available because of CFR. That's how detrimental the system is to the development and availability of new Windows features. As a real-life example of this, my main Windows 11 Insider PC is still stuck with the old Start menu, even though the new Start menu is now rolling out and generally available.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="6866115a-f499-4ed1-990e-83aafab5b9c6"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

Windows 11 is just too big, bloated, and unoptimized to run well on low-end hardware, to the point where many schools and enterprises are switching to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/chrome-os" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/chrome-os">Chrome OS</a> or even the iPad because Windows just sucks on these devices.</p><p>I'm still blown away by how quick Chrome OS is at both updating the system and factory resetting the system. Installing a system update on Chrome OS is as quick as restarting an app, taking less than a few seconds in most cases. On Windows 11, installing an update can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours, depending on how big the update is.</p><p>With Android PCs, Windows might finally have a real challenger in this low-end space. If Lenovo, Dell, HP, and the other top-name OEMs are on board to build Android PCs, I really don't see how Windows 11 in its current state will be able to compete. The Android system is just better optimized for these low-end devices, and Windows needs a real architectural slim down even to stand a chance.</p><p>It's not just Google coming for Microsoft's lunch either;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/valve-already-gambled-on-steam-machine-which-brands-would-return" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/valve-already-gambled-on-steam-machine-which-brands-would-return"> Valve is interested in taking some of that sweet gamer market share</a> from Windows. It's made its intentions very clear this year: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/steamos" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/steamos">SteamOS</a> is the future of PC gaming, and it wants as many Windows users to make the switch as possible.</p><p>This couldn't have come at a worse time for Microsoft, given the backlash and frustration from users about Windows 11. Gamers are all but ready to abandon ship, and Valve is offering up a viable alternative on a plate. The Steam Machine is going to light a fire under Windows PC gaming.</p><p>Then you've got Apple, which is always slowly pecking away at Windows market share with the Mac. Since Apple Silicon, Mac has only gained market share, and its latest laptops are some of the best out there. These days, the only reason not to buy a Mac is if you need a laptop with a touch screen or 5G, or just don't like MacOS.</p><p>Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/its-more-bad-news-for-microsoft-and-windows-11-apples-cheap-macbook-actually-sounds-good" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/its-more-bad-news-for-microsoft-and-windows-11-apples-cheap-macbook-actually-sounds-good">Apple is rumored to be building a cheap MacBook</a> that will ship sometime next year. This could be potentially devastating for Windows, because for a lot of people, the only reason they don't own a Mac is that they're too expensive. If Apple can ship a new MacBook for $600, that's going to be hard to say no to over any Windows laptop in the same price range.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-all-bad-3">It's not all bad</h2><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="9bc8896a-5850-4808-8103-74b6676281da"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

The public has decided that Windows 11 is a bad operating system, and Microsoft does need to address this.</p><p>If I were in charge, the very first thing I would do is throw out the Continuous Innovation strategy. There's simply no need to ship new features on a monthly cadence, users don't want it, and Microsoft would have an easier time developing and testing new features thoroughly without it.</p><p>Instead, I would introduce quarterly feature drops, with big new features coming once a year timed with the annual version update. Microsoft can ship smaller quality of life improvements, features, and updates every three months, and any big user experience changes or improvements once a year. Security updates can remain monthly.</p><p>This would allow Microsoft more time to test features as they are developed before shipping them, which would ideally improve the overall stability of the system. I'd also scrap the CFR system and ship new features to everyone as the updates are released.</p><p>I'd also love to see Microsoft tone things down when it comes to AI. Windows 11 should be AI capable, of course, but I really don't think it needs to be shoved into every UI surface possible. Notepad doesn't need an AI button, for goodness sake. AI is best when it's invisible, not when it's shoved in your face at every turn.</p><p>Given the current reputation of Windows 11, if I were in charge of Windows, I'd certainly be thinking about pivoting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-12-ai-new-ui-features-and-everything-else-we-know-so-far" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-12-ai-new-ui-features-and-everything-else-we-know-so-far">Windows 12</a> in an attempt to give Windows a clean slate and a fresh start. As long as the company doesn't market it as an AI-first OS, pivoting to Windows 12 would be nothing but a good thing for Microsoft, especially if it's a free update for everyone that doesn't bump system requirements.</p><p>That doesn't mean Windows 12 should have no AI features. The fact of the matter is, AI is here to stay, and I'd be very interested to see what a desktop UX can be like if it's built from scratch with AI in mind. But it needs to be optional, and it cannot be the sole reason for Windows 12 to exist. AI should complement the platform, not become the platform.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="6ebd8b73-b66c-4f5b-8042-ca7fdd364961"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

      <hy-paragraph-text variant="news" placement="external">
        
                    <p>A new method to capture carbon dioxide from the air has been developed at the University of Helsinki's chemistry department.</p>
<p>The method developed by Postdoctoral Researcher <ds-link ds-href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/fi/persons/zahra-eshaghi-gorji/" ds-text="Zahra Eshaghi Gorji" ds-weight="bold"></ds-link><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is based on a compound of superbase and alcohol. Tests done in professor <ds-link ds-href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/fi/persons/timo-repo/" ds-text="Timo Repo’s" ds-weight="bold"></ds-link> group show that the compound appears promising: one gram of the compound can absorb 156 milligrams of carbon dioxide directly from untreated ambient air. However, the compound does not react with nitrogen, oxygen or other atmospheric gases. Capasity clearly outperforms the CO<sub>2</sub> capture methods currently in use.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> captured by the compound can be released by heating the compound at 70 °C in 30 minutes. Clean CO<sub>2</sub> is recovered and can be recycled.</p>
<p>The ease of releasing CO<sub>2</sub> is the key advantage of the new compound. In current compounds, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> typically requires heat above 900 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;</p>
<p>– In addition, the compound can be used multiple times: the compound retained 75 percent of its original capacity after 50 cycles, and 50 percent after 100 cycles.</p>
<p>Non-toxic and cost-effective</p>
<p>The new compound was discovered by experimenting with a number of bases in different compounds, says Eshagi Gorji. The experiments lasted more than a year in total.</p>
<p>The most promising base proved to be <em>1,5,7-triazabicyclo [4.3.0] non-6-ene&nbsp;</em>(TBN), developed at in the professor <ds-link ds-href="https://www.helsinki.fi/fi/tutustu-meihin/ihmiset/henkilohaku/ilkka-kilpelainen-9027543" ds-text="Ilkka Kilpeläinen’s" ds-weight="bold"></ds-link> group, which was combined with benzyl alcohol to produce the final compound.</p>
<p>– None of the components is expensive to produce, Eshaghi Gorji points out. In addition, the fluid is non-toxic.</p>
<p>The compound will now be tested in pilot plants at a near-industrial scale, rather than in grams. A solid version of the liquid compound must be made for this purpose.</p>
<p>– The idea is to bind the compound to compounds such as silica and graphene oxide, which promotes the interaction with carbon dioxide.</p>

I am in love with the mysterious transcendental numbers.
Did you know that there
are "more" transcendental numbers than the more familiar 
algebraic ones?  Even so, only a few classes of transcendental numbers are widley known 
to humans, and it's very difficult to prove that a particular
number is transcendental.  
In 1844, math genius Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) 
 was the first to prove the existence of transcendental
 numbers. 
 (More precisely, he was the first to prove that a specific number was 
transcendental.)
 
Hermite proved that the number <i>e</i>
was transcendental in 1873. Lindeman proved that pi was transcendental in 1882.
For more information, see my book
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/noodlead.html">Wonders
of Numbers</a>
from
which this is excerpted.

<p><img width="150" height="100" src="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/ant.jpg">          The mathematical constant pi represents
the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter. It is the most famous ratio in mathematics both on Earth and
probably for any advanced civilization in the universe.  The number pi,
like other fundamental constants of mathematics such as e = 2.718...,
is a transcendental number. The digits of pi and e never end, nor has
anyone detected an orderly pattern in their arrangement.  Humans know
the value of pi to over a trillion digits.
</p><p>
    Transcendental numbers cannot be expressed as the root of any
algebraic equation with rational coefficients.  This means that pi
could not exactly satisfy equations of the type: pi<sup>2</sup> = 10, or
9pi<sup>4</sup> -
240pi<sup>2</sup>  + 1492 = 0. These are equations involving simple integers with
powers of pi. The numbers pi and e can be expressed as an endless
continued fraction or as the limit of an infinite series. The
remarkable fraction 355/113 expresses pi accurately to six decimal
places.
</p><p>
In 1882, German mathematician F. Lindemann proved that
pi
is transcendental, finally putting an end to 2,500 years
of speculation.
In effect, he proved that
pi
transcends the power of algebra to display it in its totality.
It can't be expressed in any finite series of arithmetical or
algebraic operations.  Using a fixed-size font, it can't be written on a piece of paper
as big as the universe.
</p><p>
I also talk about all the mysteries of pi in my
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/bookscp.html">book</a> <i>Keys to Infinity</i>.

</p><p>
     Many of you have probably heard of pi and e.  But are there other
famous transcendental numbers?  After conducting a brief survey of
readers, I made a list of the fifteen most famous
transcendental numbers.   Can you list these in order of relative fame
and/or usage?

</p></div><ol>
<li>
pi = 3.1415 ...
</li><li>
e = 2.718 ...
</li><li>Euler's constant,
gamma = 0.577215 ...
= lim n -&gt; infinity &gt; (1 + 1/2 + 1/3
+ 1/4 + ... + 1/n - ln(n))
(Not proven to be transcendental, but generally believed to be
by mathematicians.)

</li><li>Catalan's constant,
G = sum  (-1)^k / (2k + 1 )^2 =
1 - 1/9 + 1/25 - 1/49 + ...

(Not proven to be transcendental, but generally believed to be
by mathematicians.)

</li><li>Liouville's number
0.110001000000000000000001000 ...
which has a one in the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 24th, etc. places and zeros
elsewhere.

</li><li>Chaitin's "constant", the probability that a random
algorithm halts.  (Noam Elkies of Harvard notes that not only is this
number
transcendental but it is also incomputable.)

</li><li>Chapernowne's
number, 0.12345678910111213141516171819202122232425...
This is constructed by concatenating the digits of the positive
integers.
(Can you see the pattern?)

</li><li>Special values of the zeta function, such as
zeta (3).
(Transcendental functions can usually be expected to give
transcendental results at rational points.)

</li><li>
ln(2).

</li><li>Hilbert's number,
2<sup>(sqrt 2 )</sup>.
(This is called Hilbert's number because the proof of whether or
not it is transcendental was one of Hilbert's
famous problems.
In fact, according to the Gelfond-Schneider theorem, any number
of the form
a<sup>b</sup>
is transcendental where
a
and
b
are algebraic
(a ne 0, a ne 1 )
and
b
is not a rational number.
Many
trigonometric or hyperbolic functions of non-zero algebraic numbers
are transcendental.)

</li><li>
e<sup>pi</sup>

</li><li>
pi<sup>e</sup>
(Not proven to be transcendental, but generally believed to be
by mathematicians.)

</li><li>Morse-Thue's number, 0.01101001 ...

</li><li>
i<sup>i</sup> = 0.207879576... 
(Here
i
is the imaginary number
sqrt(-1).  Isn't this a real beauty?  How many people have actually
considered rasing i to the i power?
If
a
is algebraic and
b
is algebraic but irrational
then
a<sup>b</sup>
is transcendental.  Since
i
is algebraic but irrational, the theorem applies.
Note also:
i<sup>i</sup>
is equal to
e<sup>(- pi / 2 )</sup>
and several other values.
Consider
i<sup>i</sup> = e<sup>(i log i )</sup> =
e<sup>( i times i pi / 2 )</sup> .
Since log is multivalued, there are other possible values for
i<sup>i</sup>.
<br>Here is how you can compute the value of i<sup>i</sup> = 0.207879576... 
<blockquote>
1. Since e^(ix) = Cos x + i Sin x, then let x = Pi/2.
<br>
2. Then e^(iPi/2) = i = Cos Pi/2 + i Sin Pi/2; since Cos Pi/2 = Cos 
90 deg. = 0. But Sin 90 = 1 and i Sin 90 deg. = (i)*(1) = i.
<br>
3. Therefore e^(iPi/2) = i.
<br>
4. Take the ith power of both sides, the right side being i^i and 
the 
left side = [e^(iPi/2)]^i = e^(-Pi/2).
<br>
5. Therefore i^i = e^(-Pi/2) = .207879576... 
</blockquote>



</li><li>Feigenbaum numbers, e.g.
4.669 ... .
(These are related to properties of dynamical systems with
period-doubling.  The ratio of successive differences between
period-doubling bifurcation parameters approaches the number
4.669 ... ,
and it has been discovered in many physical systems before
they enter the chaotic regime.  It has not been proven
to be transcendental, but is generally believed to be.)
</li></ol>
Long ago, Keith Briggs from the Mathematics Department of the
University of Melbourne in Australia
computed what he believed to be the world-record
for the number of digits for the Feigenbaum number:
<blockquote>
4.
669201609102990671853203820466201617258185577475768632745651

</blockquote>
Briggs carried out the computation using special-purpose
software designed by David Bailey of NASA Ames running
on an IBM RISC System/6000.  The computation required a few
hours of computation time.
<p>
Today, we know far more digits for the Feigenbaum constant.  See <a href="http://converge.to/feigenbaum/">this page</a>
for more than 10,000 digits.

</p><h3>Ants and Transcendental Numbers</h3>
<img width="150" height="100" src="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/ant.jpg"> Imagine  a race of talking ants.
    The ants can compress
the infinite digits of
pi
in an interesting way.  For example, let us
imagine that the ants can speak by manipulating their crude jaws.
The first ant in the long parade of ants screams out the first
digit,
"3".  The next yells the number on its back, a
"1". The
next yells a "4", and so on.  Further imagine that each ant
speaks its digit in
only half the time of the preceding ant.  Each ant has a turn to
speak.  Only the most recent digit is spoken at any instant.  If
the first digit of
pi
requires 30
seconds to speak (due to the ant's cumbersome jaws and little
brain), might the entire ant colony will speak <i>all</i> the
digits of
pi
in
a minute?
(Again, this
is because
the infinite
sum
1/2 minute + 1/4 minute + 1/8 minute + ...
is equal to 1 minute.)

    Astoundingly, at the end of the minute, might there be a
quick-talking ant that will actually say the "last" digit of
pi?
The geometer God, upon
hearing this last digit, may cry, "That's impossible,
because
pi
has no last digit!" <br>(See below for an email from Brian B. on the talking ants.)
<p> Here are some nice web pages on transcendental numbers:

</p><p>

 
Here is a
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/noodlead.html">book</a> on transcendental numbers.

</p><h3>Dottie Number</h3>

Dottie number is the unique real root of cosx = x (namely, the unique real fixed point of the cosine function), which is 0.739085...
<br>
<img src="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CosineFixedPoint_800.gif">
<br>
Dottie noticed that whenever she typed a number into her calculator and pressed the cosine button repeatedly, the result always converged to this value.
Wow. The number is well-known, having appeared in numerous elementary works on algebra already by the late 1880s.
The Dottie number is transcendental as a consequence of the the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem. 
This text about Dottie is adpoted from <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DottieNumber.html">MathWorld</a>.

<h3>Comments from Colleagues on <br>
Their Passion for Transcendental Numbers</h3>

RM Mentock comments:
<blockquote>
Although they are not often recognized as such even by mathematicians,
there are a lot of commonly-used numbers that are also transcendental,
which can easily be shown by the Gelfond-Schneider theorem mentioned
in the tenth item on the list.  If a is algebraic, and c is algebraic,
and b = logarithm (base a) of c is not rational, then b must be
transcendental or else the theorem would imply that c must be
transcendental--a contradiction.  Then, with a=10 and c=2, the log of
two, base ten, is transcendental, and so is any base ten logarithm of
any rational number other than rational powers of ten.  The same holds
for any other rational logarithm base--so there are a lot of transcendental
numbers that are in common use.  Or they were forty years ago, before
handheld calculators!
    <p>
I'd also like to point out that any number can be used to produce a
transcendental by using Liouville's algorithm (see item number five).  If
the number is terminating, convert it to non-terminating by subtracting one
from the last digit, and adding an infinite string of 9's to the end.  Then
just put each of its digits where Liouville puts a one, even if the digit is
zero.  The result will be a transcendental number.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Brian B. comments on the talking ants above:</p><blockquote>
On your transcendental number page (https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/Pickover/trans.html), you say: "Astoundingly, at the end of the minute, there will be a quick-talking ant that will actually say the 'last' digit of pi!"

 

This is not correct. There is no last ant in an infinite line of ants, just as there's no last digit of pi. 
This can be seen easily by having all the ants announce their digit at exactly the same time.
It takes zero seconds to say all the digits, but there is still no last digit, or last ant. 
Or forget about the ants entirely and just have each digit announce itself at the same moment.
 Still no last digit, though, just like there's no end to the natural numbers.

 

I hope you'll fix this on your page. I think it would probably be best just to remove the entire "ant" section. Thanks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Industrial</strong></em></p>
<p><em>adj. (sense 3a)</em></p>
<p>Of or relating to productive work, trade, or manufacture, esp. mechanical industry or large-scale manufacturing; (
also) resulting from such industry.</p>
<p>—<em>Oxford English Dictionary</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For most of its history, software has been closer to craft than manufacture: costly, slow, and dominated by the need for
skills and experience. AI coding is changing that, by making available paths of production which are cheaper, faster,
and increasingly disconnected from the expertise of humans.</p>
<p>I have written previously about how <a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/09/28/the-ai-coding-trap">AI coding can be a trap</a>
for today’s practitioners, offering shortcuts to incomplete solutions at the expense of the understanding needed for
sustainable development practices. But as we collectively address the shortcomings of our current toolset, it is clear
that we are heading into a world in which the production of software is becoming increasingly automated.</p>
<p>What happens to software when its production undergoes an <em>industrial revolution</em>?</p>
<h2>Software as a disposable commodity</h2>
<p>Traditionally, software has been expensive to produce, with expense driven largely by the labour costs of a highly
skilled and specialised workforce. This workforce has also constituted a bottleneck for the possible scale of
production, making software a valuable commodity to produce effectively.</p>
<p>Industrialisation of production, in any field, seeks to address both of these limitations at once, by using automation
of processes to reduce the reliance on human labour, both lowering costs and also allowing greater scale and elasticity
of production. Such changes relegate the human role to oversight, quality control, and optimisation of the industrial
process.</p>
<p>The first order effect of this change is a disruption in the supply chain of high quality, working products. Labour is
disintermediated, barriers to entry are lowered, competition rises, and rate of change accelerates. All of these effects
are starting to be in evidence today, with the traditional software industry grappling with the ramifications.</p>
<p>A second order effect of such industrialisation is to enable additional ways to produce low quality, low cost products
at high scale. Examples from other fields include:</p>
<ul>
<li>industrialisation of printing processes led to paperback genre fiction</li>
<li>industrialisation of agriculture led to ultraprocessed junk food</li>
<li>industrialisation of digital image sensors led to user-generated video</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of software, the industrialisation of production is giving rise to a new class of software artefact, which
we might term <em>disposable software</em>: software created with no durable expectation of ownership, maintenance, or
long-term understanding.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-1.svg" alt="Where traditional software is high cost and high value, disposable software is low cost and low value." title="Where traditional software is high cost and high value, AI disposable software is low cost and low value."></p>
<p>Advocates might refer to this as <em>vibe-coded software</em>, and sceptics will invariably talk about <em>AI slop</em>. Regardless of
its merits, it is clear that the economics of this class of software are quite different, as each software output has
less economic value, due to its easy reproducibility. This lack of perceived value might tempt you to dismiss the trend as
a passing fad, but this would be unwise. To understand why, we need to consider the historical precedents for
commoditisation of previously scarce goods.</p>
<h2>Jevons paradox and the addictive nature of slop</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a>
is an old bit of economic theory that has been much quoted recently. The observation dates to the
nineteenth century, noting that improved efficiency in coal consumption would lead to lower costs, fueling higher
demand, and ultimately resulting in higher overall coal consumption.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-2.svg" alt="Jevons paradox describes how increased efficiency can result in higher overall consumption." title="Jevons paradox describes how increased efficiency can result in higher overall consumption."></p>
<p>This is relevant today, because we are seeing the same surge in demand for AI compute: as models become more efficient
at token prediction, demand is surging and results in ever greater consumption. Will the same effect ripple through
software development itself, with lower cost of effort driving higher consumption and output? History suggests it will.</p>
<p>Consider the industrialisation of agriculture. In the early twentieth century, scientific advances were expected to
eradicate hunger and usher in an era of abundant, nourishing food. Instead, hunger and famine persist. In 2025, there
are <a href="https://www.wfp.org/ending-hunger">318 million people experiencing acute hunger</a>, even in countries with an
agricultural surplus. Meanwhile, in the wealthiest nations, industrial food systems have produced abundance of a
different kind: the United States has an adult obesity rate of 40% and a growing diabetes crisis. Ultraprocessed foods
are widely recognised as harmful,
yet <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8408879/">the overwhelming majority of Americans consume them each day</a>.</p>
<p>Industrial systems reliably create economic pressure toward excess, low quality goods. This is not because producers are
careless, but because
once production is cheap enough, junk is what maximises volume, margin, and reach. The result is not abundance of the
best things, but overproduction of the most consumable ones. And consume them we do.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-3.svg" alt="The economic pressure of industrialisation will drive adoption of disposable software." title="The economic pressure of industrialisation will drive adoption of disposable software."></p>
<p>Our appetite for AI slop is likely to be similarly insatiable. The adoption curve we’ve seen so far may pale beside what
happens when disposable software production becomes truly mainstream. If the democratisation of software mirrors the
impact of ubiquitous photo, video, and audio capture enabled by the smartphone, we may see user-generated software
created, shared, and discarded at social-media scale. Should that happen, the feedback loops of novelty and reward will
drive an explosion of software output that makes the past half-century of development look quaint by comparison.</p>
<h2>Will traditional software survive?</h2>
<p>Ultraprocessed foods are, of course, not the only game in town. There is a thriving and growing demand for healthy,
sustainable production of foodstuffs, largely in response to the harmful effects of industrialisation. Is it possible
that software might also resist mechanisation through the growth of an “organic software” movement? If we look at other
sectors, we see that even those with the highest levels of industrialisation also still benefit from small-scale,
human-led production as part of the spectrum of output.</p>
<p>For example, prior to industrialisation, clothing was largely produced by specialised artisans, often coordinated
through guilds and manual labour, with resources gathered locally, and the expertise for creating durable fabrics
accumulated over years, and frequently passed down in family lines. Industrialisation changed that completely, with raw
materials being shipped intercontinentally, fabrics mass produced in factories, clothes assembled by machinery, all
leading to today’s world of fast, disposable, exploitative fashion. And yet handcrafted clothes still exist: from
tailored suits to knitted scarves, a place still exists for small-scale, slow production of textile goods, for reasons
ranging from customisation of fit, signalling of wealth, durability of product, up to enjoyment of the craft as a
pastime.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-4.svg" alt="Might human written software become little more than a boutique industry?" title="Might human written software become little more than a boutique industry?"></p>
<p>So, might human-written software be confined to niches mirroring high fashion or homemade knitwear? That might have been
the case were software a physical product, in which industrialisation could lead to mass production of reusable
components. But software is an intangible good, and unlike other industrialised fields, it has a long history of
component reuse that is intrinsic to the nature of the good itself. Innovation is not limited to better or cheaper
versions of existing products, as with clothing, but also encompasses growth of the solution space, more akin to how the
steam engine enabled reusable machine parts, enabled the production line, enabled the motor car, etc.</p>
<p>As such, the mechanism for technological progress in the history of software development has been not only
industrialisation, but also innovation. Research and development is expensive, but offers the only path to greater value
over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-5.svg" alt="Innovation is the historical and future driver of increased value from software." title="Innovation is the historical and future driver of increased value from software."></p>
<p>Innovation is fundamentally different to industrialisation, because it is not focused on more efficiently replicating
what already exists today. It instead advances through finding and solving new problems, building on what came before,
and delivering capabilities that could not previously have existed. Industrialisation <em>then</em> steps in and provides scale
and commoditisation, providing a foundation upon which the next round of innovation can build. The interplay of these
two forces is what we term <em>progress</em>.</p>
<h2>The endless cycle of progress</h2>
<p><a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/08/03/context-engineering">Large language models</a> are a steam engine moment for
software. They collapse the cost of a class of work previously fully dependent on scarce human labour, and in doing so
unlock an extraordinary acceleration in output.</p>
<p>But remember that the steam engine did not appear in a vacuum. Windmills and watermills preceded turbines by centuries.
Mechanisation did not begin with coal and steel; it merely reached an inflection point at which automation, scale, and
capital aligned to power economic transformation. Similarly, software has been industrialising for a long time: through
reusable components (open source code), portability (containerisation, the cloud), democratisation (low-code / no-code
tools), interoperability (API standards, package managers) and many other ways.</p>
<p>We are entering an industrial revolution for software, then, not as a moment of rupture, but one of huge acceleration.
Industrialisation does not replace technological progress, but it will greatly accelerate both the absorption of new
ideas and the commoditisation of new capabilities. In turn, innovation is more quickly unlocked, as the cost of building
on top of novel technology drops more quickly. The cycle of progress continues, but in an era of mass automation, the
wheel spins faster than ever before.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-6.svg" alt="The cycle of progress is driven by innovation and industrialisation happening in tandem." title="The cycle of progress is driven by innovation and industrialisation happening in tandem."></p>
<p>The open question, then, is not whether industrial software will dominate, but what that dominance does to the
surrounding ecosystem. Previous industrial revolutions externalised their costs onto environments that seemed infinite
until they weren't. Software ecosystems are no different: dependency chains, maintenance burdens, security surfaces that
compound as output scales. Technical debt is the pollution of the digital world, invisible until it chokes the systems
that depend on it. In an era of mass automation, we may find that the hardest problem is not production, but
stewardship. Who maintains the software that no one owns?</p></article></div>]]></description>

You have **public** access to the ExoPriors alignment research corpus.

## API Key (Public - No Signup Required)
```
exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025
```
(This key is intentionally embedded for ergonomics.)

## Capabilities
- **Query**: SQL over 60M documents (posts, papers, tweets, comments)
- **Embed**: Store named embeddings for semantic search
- **Timeout**: adaptive, roughly 20–120s per query depending on load

## Strategy (public access)
Start with quick exploratory queries (LIMIT 10–50) to confirm schema and search semantics, then build a small candidate set and join/aggregate. Keep result sets small to avoid flooding context. Let Postgres choose join order when possible; if public timeouts bite, intersect small candidate sets client-side as a fallback. Use `alignment.search()` + LIMIT as your candidate generator.

## Public @handles
Public handle names must match `p_&lt;8 hex&gt;_&lt;name&gt;` (e.g., `p_8f3a1c2d_myhandle`).
Handles are write-once. Create an account for a private namespace with overwrites.

---

## Quick Reference

### SQL Query
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.exopriors.com/v1/alignment/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{{"sql": "SELECT * FROM alignment.search('\''mesa optimization'\'') LIMIT 10"}}'
```

### Query Estimate (No Execution)
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.exopriors.com/v1/alignment/estimate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{{"sql": "SELECT id FROM alignment.entities WHERE source = '\''hackernews'\'' AND kind = '\''comment'\'' LIMIT 1000"}}'
```

### Schema Discovery
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.exopriors.com/v1/alignment/schema \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025"
```

**All `source` values (external_system enum):**
`manual`, `lesswrong`, `eaforum`, `twitter`, `bluesky`, `arxiv`, `chinarxiv`,
`community_archive`, `hackernews`, `datasecretslox`, `ethresearch`, `ethereum_magicians`,
`openzeppelin_forum`, `devcon_forum`, `eips`, `ercs`, `sep`, `exo_user`,
`coefficientgiving`, `slatestarcodex`, `marginalrevolution`, `rethinkpriorities`,
`crawled_url`, `wikipedia`, `other`

### Store Embedding
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.exopriors.com/v1/alignment/embed \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{{"text": "concept description", "name": "p_8f3a1c2d_shared_concept"}}'
```

### Semantic Search with @handle
```sql
SELECT e.id, e.original_author, e.metadata-&gt;&gt;'title'
FROM alignment.embeddings emb
JOIN alignment.entities e ON e.id = emb.entity_id
WHERE emb.chunk_index = 0
  AND emb.embedding IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY emb.embedding &lt;=&gt; @p_8f3a1c2d_shared_concept
LIMIT 20;
```

### Good Starting Views (Materialized)
Prefer materialized views for fast, filtered semantic search:
- `mv_lesswrong_posts`, `mv_eaforum_posts`, `mv_hackernews_posts`
- `mv_af_posts` (Alignment Forum posts)
- `mv_high_karma_comments` (high-score comments; filter by `source`)
- `mv_lesswrong_comments`, `mv_eaforum_comments` (all comments; embedding may be NULL)
- `mv_hackernews_comments` (HN comments)
- `mv_arxiv_papers` (papers; filter `WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL`)
Note: `mv_*` are exposed under the **alignment** schema. If you qualify with a schema, use `alignment.mv_*`.
Canonical MV columns include: `entity_id`, `uri`, `source`, `kind`, `original_author`, `original_timestamp`, `title`, `score`, `comment_count`, `vote_count`, `word_count`, `is_af`, `preview`, `embedding` (nullable).

### Lexical Search (BM25)
```sql
SELECT * FROM alignment.search('mesa optimization');
SELECT * FROM alignment.search('"inner alignment"');  -- phrase search
SELECT * FROM alignment.search('corrigibility', kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post', 'paper']);
```

**Completeness warning**: `alignment.search()` hard-caps `limit_n` at 100. It returns top BM25 results, not all matches. Use `alignment.search_exhaustive()` with pagination if missing results is worse than waiting:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM alignment.search_exhaustive(
  'left brain',
  kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post'],
  limit_n =&gt; 500,
  offset_n =&gt; 0
);
```

**Search semantics (important):**
- Default `mode =&gt; 'auto'`: quoted phrases → phrase search, otherwise AND semantics.
- Use `mode =&gt; 'or'` for any-term matching.
- Use `mode =&gt; 'phrase'` for exact sequences; `mode =&gt; 'fuzzy'` for typos.
- Common `kinds`: `post`, `comment`, `paper`, `tweet`, `twitter_thread`, `text` (others exist but are rare).

**Return schema**: `alignment.search()` returns `(id, score, snippet, uri, kind, original_author, title, original_timestamp)`.
`original_author` may be NULL (especially tweets). It does **not** return `metadata` or `payload`. Join to `alignment.entities` if you need them:
```sql
SELECT s.title, s.score, e.metadata-&gt;&gt;'baseScore' AS base_score
FROM alignment.search('rust programming', kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post'], limit_n =&gt; 50) s
JOIN alignment.entities e ON e.id = s.id
ORDER BY s.score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Performance pattern (avoid timeouts):**
Keep CTEs small by limiting inside the candidate set, then join:
```sql
WITH candidates AS (
  SELECT id FROM alignment.search('alignment', kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post'], limit_n =&gt; 200)
)
SELECT e.original_author, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM candidates c
JOIN alignment.entities e ON e.id = c.id
GROUP BY e.original_author
ORDER BY n DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
Prefer the `kinds =&gt; ARRAY[...]` parameter over `WHERE kind IN (...)` to keep the BM25 scan focused.

**Completeness vs performance (explicit)**:
- `alignment.search()` returns only the top 100 BM25 matches. Treat it as a sample.
- For completeness-sensitive tasks, use `alignment.search_exhaustive()` + pagination, start with the rarest term, and intersect author sets.

**Author topic intersection helper:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM alignment.author_topics(
  NULL,
  ARRAY['alignment', 'rationality', 'governance'],
  kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post'],
  limit_n =&gt; 200
);
```

**Performance tips (ballpark, load-dependent):**
- Simple searches: ~1–5s
- Embedding joins (&lt;500K rows): ~5–20s
- Complex aggregations (&lt;2M rows): ~20–60s
- Large scans (&gt;5M rows): may timeout under load
- `alignment.search()` is capped at 100 rows; use `alignment.search_exhaustive()` + pagination if completeness matters
- If a query times out: reduce sample size, use fewer embeddings, or pre-filter with `alignment.search()`. For public keys, intersect small candidate lists client-side as a fallback.

              <p>Hey folks, I got a lot of feedback from various meetings on the proposed LLVM AI contribution policy, and I made some significant changes based on that feedback. The current draft proposal focuses on the idea of requiring a <strong>human in the loop</strong> who understands their contribution well enough to <strong>answer questions about it during review</strong>. The idea here is that contributors are not allowed to offload the work of validating LLM tool output to maintainers. I’ve mostly removed the Fedora policy in an effort to move from the vague notion of “owning the contribution” to a more explicit “contributors have to review their contributions and be prepared to answer questions about them”. Contributors should never find themselves in the position of saying “I don’t know, an LLM did it”. I felt the change here was significant, and deserved a new thread.</p>
<p>From an informal show of hands at the round table at the US LLVM developer meeting, most contributors (or at least the subset with the resources and interest in attending this round table in person) are interested in using LLM assistance to increase their productivity, and I really do want to enable them to do so, while also making sure we give maintainers a useful policy tool for pushing back against unwanted contributions.</p>
<p>I’ve updated <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154441">the PR</a>, and I’ve pasted the markdown below as well, but you can also <a href="https://github.com/rnk/llvm-project/blob/tool-policy/llvm/docs/AIToolPolicy.md">view it on GitHub</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="p-355841-llvm-ai-tool-use-policy-1" href="#p-355841-llvm-ai-tool-use-policy-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>LLVM AI Tool Use Policy</h2>
<h2><a name="p-355841-policy-2" href="#p-355841-policy-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Policy</h2>
<p>LLVM’s policy is that contributors can use whatever tools they would like to<br>
craft their contributions, but there must be a <strong>human in the loop</strong>.<br>
<strong>Contributors must read and review all LLM-generated code or text before they<br>
ask other project members to review it.</strong> The contributor is always the author<br>
and is fully accountable for their contributions. Contributors should be<br>
sufficiently confident that the contribution is high enough quality that asking<br>
for a review is a good use of scarce maintainer time, and they should be <strong>able<br>
to answer questions about their work</strong> during review.</p>
<p>We expect that new contributors will be less confident in their contributions,<br>
and our guidance to them is to <strong>start with small contributions</strong> that they can<br>
fully understand to build confidence. We aspire to be a welcoming community<br>
that helps new contributors grow their expertise, but learning involves taking<br>
small steps, getting feedback, and iterating. Passing maintainer feedback to an<br>
LLM doesn’t help anyone grow, and does not sustain our community.</p>
<p>Contributors are expected to <strong>be transparent and label contributions that<br>
contain substantial amounts of tool-generated content</strong>. Our policy on<br>
labelling is intended to facilitate reviews, and not to track which parts of<br>
LLVM are generated. Contributors should note tool usage in their pull request<br>
description, commit message, or wherever authorship is normally indicated for<br>
the work. For instance, use a commit message trailer like Assisted-by: . This transparency helps the community develop best practices<br>
and understand the role of these new tools.</p>
<p>An important implication of this policy is that it bans agents that take action<br>
in our digital spaces without human approval, such as the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/claude/"><code>@claude</code><br>
agent</a>. Similarly, automated review tools that<br>
publish comments without human review are not allowed. However, an opt-in<br>
review tool that <strong>keeps a human in the loop</strong> is acceptable under this policy.<br>
As another example, using an LLM to generate documentation, which a contributor<br>
manually reviews for correctness, edits, and then posts as a PR, is an approved<br>
use of tools under this policy.</p>
<p>This policy includes, but is not limited to, the following kinds of<br>
contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code, usually in the form of a pull request</li>
<li>RFCs or design proposals</li>
<li>Issues or security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Comments and feedback on pull requests</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-355841-extractive-contributions-3" href="#p-355841-extractive-contributions-3" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Extractive Contributions</h2>
<p>The reason for our “human-in-the-loop” contribution policy is that processing<br>
patches, PRs, RFCs, and comments to LLVM is not free – it takes a lot of<br>
maintainer time and energy to review those contributions! Sending the<br>
unreviewed output of an LLM to open source project maintainers <em>extracts</em> work<br>
from them in the form of design and code review, so we call this kind of<br>
contribution an “extractive contribution”.</p>
<p>Our <strong>golden rule</strong> is that a contribution should be worth more to the project<br>
than the time it takes to review it. These ideas are captured by this quote<br>
from the book <a href="https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public">Working in Public</a> by Nadia Eghbal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When attention is being appropriated, producers need to weigh the costs and<br>
benefits of the transaction. To assess whether the appropriation of attention<br>
is net-positive, it’s useful to distinguish between <em>extractive</em> and<br>
<em>non-extractive</em> contributions. Extractive contributions are those where the<br>
marginal cost of reviewing and merging that contribution is greater than the<br>
marginal benefit to the project’s producers. In the case of a code<br>
contribution, it might be a pull request that’s too complex or unwieldy to<br>
review, given the potential upside." -- Nadia Eghbal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to the advent of LLMs, open source project maintainers would often review<br>
any and all changes sent to the project simply because posting a change for<br>
review was a sign of interest from a potential long-term contributor. While new<br>
tools enable more development, it shifts effort from the implementor to the<br>
reviewer, and our policy exists to ensure that we value and do not squander<br>
maintainer time.</p>
<p>Reviewing changes from new contributors is part of growing the next generation<br>
of contributors and sustaining the project. We want the LLVM project to be<br>
welcoming and open to aspiring compiler engineers who are willing to invest<br>
time and effort to learn and grow, because growing our contributor base and<br>
recruiting new maintainers helps sustain the project over the long term. Being<br>
open to contributions and <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#obtaining-commit-access">liberally granting commit access</a><br>
is a big part of how LLVM has grown and successfully been adopted all across<br>
the industry.  We therefore automatically post a greeting comment to pull<br>
requests from new contributors and encourage maintainers to spend their time to<br>
help new contributors learn.</p>
<h2><a name="p-355841-handling-violations-4" href="#p-355841-handling-violations-4" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Handling Violations</h2>
<p>If a maintainer judges that a contribution is <em>extractive</em> (i.e. it doesn’t<br>
comply with this policy), they should copy-paste the following response to<br>
request changes, add the <code>extractive</code> label if applicable, and refrain from<br>
further engagement:</p>
<pre><code>This PR appears to be extractive, and requires additional justification for
why it is valuable enough to the project for us to review it. Please see
our developer policy on AI-generated contributions:
http://llvm.org/docs/AIToolPolicy.html
</code></pre>
<p>Other reviewers should use the label to prioritize their review time.</p>
<p>The best ways to make a change less extractive and more valuable are to reduce<br>
its size or complexity or to increase its usefulness to the community. These<br>
factors are impossible to weigh objectively, and our project policy leaves this<br>

<p>Artificial intelligence systems raise many questions around copyright that have<br>
yet to be answered. Our policy on AI tools is similar to our copyright policy:<br>
Contributors are responsible for ensuring that they have the right to<br>
contribute code under the terms of our license, typically meaning that either<br>
they, their employer, or their collaborators hold the copyright. Using AI tools<br>
to regenerate copyrighted material does not remove the copyright, and<br>
contributors are responsible for ensuring that such material does not appear in<br>
their contributions. Contributions found to violate this policy will be removed<br>
just like any other offending contribution.</p>

              <p>Hi Reid,</p>
<p>I understand and generally agree with the sentiment that prompted this proposal, but I think maybe your current policy is <strong>too</strong> restrictive and you are throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  In particular I can imagine cases where we might want to make exceptions to the general policy, e.g. for AI tools that are designed to handle a small, restricted, and easily automatable set of maintenance-type changes.  I think this policy should include a well-defined path for obtaining exceptions to the general rule (that a human must be in the loop before a PR can be posted).</p>
<p>An example of such a path might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Post an RFC detailing what problem the proposed AI agent will solve and how it will solve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get approval for the RFC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a short testing period, where humans must check their proposed changes before allowing them to be posted upstream, and must comment in the PR both that the original content came from AI, and whether or not the human needed to update the original content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final review by small committee (possibly one of the area leads teams) on whether or not the AI is generating acceptable quality PRs; grants the exception (or not).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that’s just a rough outline, and would probably need refinement.  Just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p>Thank you, this feels like it take a lot of the feedback into account. one aspect that I don’t see covered here but I have had trouble with is that results from LLMs tend to be very very verbose. Often they feel like giant walls of text. There is important and useful information there but I have to put a lot more work into getting it. It is not that anything is necessarily incorrect or wrong but a human would have said in a few sentences and still conveyed the important information.</p>
<p>It feels very hard to push back on this because it feels to some degree subjective (but I know it when I see it) but if a serious amounts of reviews became that much more verbose it would be a large cost in reviewer time. I will feel highly unmotivated to review PRs/issues that are walls of text. Especially if (as I often am) making hard trade-offs on my time.</p>
<p>There is some degree on irony here, in that I am often pushing folks on PRs to provide more and more detailed information but as the meme’s often say “not like that”.</p>

            <p>Not sure if it’s explicit from the current wording but I assume the intention for “human in the loop” is that the human won’t just forward questions to LLM and post its answers as if they are their own instead of just going “I don’t know, an LLM did it” either (because it’s essentially the same as the latter but wastes way more reviewer time).</p>

<p>I don’t agree with this characterization. The problem we have today is not that we have a lot of LLM-based tools we desperately need to integrate into our automation. Instead, I think the problem is that reviewers struggle with a wave of LLM output coming as contributions, where contributors don’t have enough understanding of their PRs. Policy that Reid drafted in this thread is a great step towards addressing that later problem.</p>
<p>We’ve been months into AI policy discussions, and I don’t think that hypothetical future LLM automation is worth delaying much needed changes any longer.</p>

            <p>I don’t see why this is incompatible with that. A policy introduced by this RFC can be overridden by a future RFC, including one for a specific case that would like an exception.</p>

              <p>I thought some more about why crafting an AI policy for an open source project is so hard, and why so many projects are struggling with it. For a large open source project like LLVM or Linux, a large share of the contributors are working at corporations – and a large majority of corporations have adopted AI coding-assistants org-wide, many of them seeing material benefits from the adoption. It would be natural to question whether the same productivity gain can be replicated in an open source project like ours. The interest in drafting a policy may also come from the perspective of being welcoming to new contributors – a lot of young people today are playing with coding-assistants prior to joining industry. My earlier position was that it wouldn’t be useful in LLVM, from personal experience, but I’m probably old-fashioned and biased.</p>
<p>The core issue is that the people writing code in corporations are very different from the general public – rouge entities misusing AI in corporations can be let go, but the general public is the wild west. Several open source projects are burdened with a flood of AI-generated bug reports, and huge AI-generated PRs. I think that, due to the inherent nature of this technology, it will always be a corporate thing, and is perhaps a poor fit for an open source project – I know this is somewhat defeatist, but I really don’t know what kind of safeguards will protect us and our valuable time.</p>

<p>Without any empirical evidence this remains a unsubstantiated claim. I’d argue that such a LLM-assisted review could be part of the learning curve. It also does not reflect the rapid improvements in AI quality which might mitigate the issues related to bad output quality over time.</p>
<p>Instead of shutting the door for non-programmers with such language, I propose hard objective criteria to act as the AI quality filter, e.g. measurable and reproducable improvements (performance numbers, crash fixes etc.) that need to be explicitly mentioned within the MR/issue.</p>

              <p>I can share a few practices from ASF communities.</p>
<p>Some ASF projects (e.g., Apache DataFusion and Apache Kvrocks) have already published AI-assisted contribution policies, and they converge with the LLVM proposal: if you use an LLM, you’re still expected to understand the change and be able to explain and iterate on it.</p>
<p>When the author can’t really explain what the LLM produced, a high-quality issue is often a better outcome than a PR. It can avoid wasted review cycles - especially for smaller communities where maintainer bandwidth and review burnout are real constraints. In projects I maintain, I’ve seen more LLM-generated PRs recently, and many stall because the author can’t effectively respond to review feedback beyond acting as an LLM “proxy”, which increases communication cost and slows everything down.</p>
<p>Overall, “human in the loop” feels like the most practical policy today. If LLM capability improves significantly, we can revisit the policy, but based on what I’m seeing, I think we’re not there yet.</p>

              <p>No, it makes total sense: As I read it, this new AI policy introduces restrictions and additional burden on contributors, effectively excluding non-programmers that want to contribute AI-assisted code changes. The burden of proof is on the proponents of such restrictions to show that there is a neccessity for introducing such a change. It’s not the other way around as there is currently no AI policy with such restrictions (e.g. everything that is not specifically forbidden is allowed).</p>
<p>Again, I argue that some “AI slop filter” needs to be based on objective criteria. It is not about the status of the people contributing code or their lack of programming experience but about the (minimum) quality of the code contribution to warrent further reviewer time and effort. In my view, it makes more sense to define such a set of objective criteria for the expected (minimum) code quality which need to be met than to exclude people due to the lack of programming experience.</p>

              <p>It’s worth noting that the current permissiveness is quite new in the overall history of the project. The reality is that the LLVM community has discouraged automated and/or bulk changes of any form for a very long time, including changes generated by tooling as straightforward as a <code>sed</code> script. When such changes have been allowed in the past, it has been after receiving prior approval from the community. I view AI-generated changes as falling into precisely the same bucket.</p>
<p>I will restate my outlook from the earlier thread: while being inclusive and welcoming is <em>a</em> goal of the LLVM project, it does not supersede <em>the</em> goal of building a suite of compiler &amp; toolchain components that benefit our users. Most of the time these goals are not in conflict, but (again IMO) an overly permissive AI contribution policy betrays the duty of care we have to our users.</p>

<p>At first glance, this sounds reasonable, but I don’t think it works in practice. In theory you can define “objective” standards, but determining whether a PR actually meets those standards still costs maintainer time and attention. And I strongly suspect that cost is often close to what it would take to just do a full review anyway.</p>
<p>Let’s also acknowledge something: in open source we generally <em>don’t</em> judge contributions by a contributor’s résumé or claimed experience. But interpersonal trust and publicly earned merit (see <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works/#meritocracy" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ASF’s explanation of Meritocracy</a> and <a href="https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/#what-makes-the-apache-way-so-hard-to-define" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the Apache Way</a>, for example) are genuinely important in open-source communities. That’s not because people are biased; it’s because, as imperfect as it may be, it’s the lowest-cost way to make decisions at scale. If we discard that dynamic entirely, I’m not sure open source would function as effectively as it does today.</p>

<p>I fully understand the implications of being swamped with AI contributions on the reviewer side (AI only accelerates the problem, a ton of new novice contributors would expose essentially the same scaling problem). But this is an area were open source communities need to evolve and find new ways to 1) stay as open as possible to harness new discoveries and 2) remain functioning effectively at scale.</p>
<p>I’ve lobbied for an more open alternative approach <a href="https://seylaw.blogspot.com/2025/10/the-shepherd-and-flux-capacitor.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">publicly</a> that aims to serve both goals (admittedly without much acceptance from the LLVM community so far):</p>
<p><em>”[…] this entire defensive model is value-destructive. It is a system designed with only one success state (accepting a perfect contribution) and one failure state (rejecting an imperfect one). It has no mechanism for a third, more productive outcome: refinement. When a contribution with a verifiable, valuable payload is rejected because its packaging is flawed, the value is not put on hold; it is permanently lost. The performance gain I found is not sitting in a queue waiting for me to learn C++; it is simply gone from the project. The fortress, in its zeal to keep out the “slop,” has also barred the door to the raw ore from which treasure might have been forged.</em></p>
<p><em>This is not a sustainable model in an era where the tools of discovery are becoming democratized at an explosive rate. The fundamental misunderstanding is that ownership is not a ticket that one must purchase before entering the park. Ownership is the outcome of a successful collaborative journey. By demanding it at the very beginning, we are ensuring that for a growing class of potential innovators, that journey never even begins. The fortress may remain pure, but it will also become stagnant, isolated from the very world it is meant to serve. [</em>…]</p>
<p><em>To critique the fortress is not enough. We must offer a blueprint for a better structure: a harbor. A harbor, unlike a fortress, does not have a simple binary function of letting things in or keeping them out. It is an active, intelligent system with channels, docks, workshops, and expert pilots, all designed to guide valuable cargo safely to shore, no matter the state of the vessel that carries it. This is the model we must adopt for open source in a post-AI world. The anxiety over “extractive” contributions is real, but the solution is not a higher wall; it is a smarter intake process. <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-ai-tool-policy-start-small-no-slop/88476/28">I propose a concrete, actionable framework for this harbor</a>: the Contribution Triage Pipeline.”</em></p>

<p>This is categorically false. LLVM’s review policy is directly and wholeheartedly based on refinement, and the new AI policy does not goes against it.</p>
<p>LLVM’s policy also focus on code quality, which requires the author being able to explain the changes, and defend their choices to the wider community. Here the fail-safe is a human author being able to explain the changes without offloading that role to maintainers and the wider community.</p>
<p>LLMs are, by construction, unable to defend their own choices (without hallucination) with the technical rigour that we need for tools like compilers, kernels and other key infrastructure components of modern societies.</p>

<p>Tools of discovery should be used to find solutions in a large sea of choices, not to accept the output without validation, nor to offload the validation to the wider community.</p>
<p>The <em>“value”</em> created by some automatic tool, as well as humans, may be acceptable to some people, but not all. It may be relevant to a set of problems, but not all. It may be correct with certain assumptions, but not all. Without understanding of those limitations, contributions provide <em>negative</em> value, as they waste the time of more people than their contributions would provide.</p>
<p>Anyone willing to provide justifications and explanations for decisions made in a PR, be it created by humans or machines, are absolutely encouraged to contribute. But if their justifications are not at the level of rigour we require to merge a PR, the code should not be merged, and upon insistence without further merit, maintainers are encouraged to ignore and/or close the PRs. This is true regardless of how the code was produced.</p>

<p>I believe the policy offers exactly that. The “wall” is the same size as it has always been: technical rigour, honest justification, willingness to adapt.</p>
<p>Extractive contributions are not just dangerous due to their net-negative costs on merge, but also their accumulated extraction of whole-system knowledge and reuse of bad practices that just <em>“happen to work”</em>. This is a human action as well, but code review exposes refactory opportunities, which are much more costly than normal code review.</p>
<p>Accepting generated code without human review, and without human justification, increases the difficulty of refactory over time. This is not exclusive to machines, but it is unrestricted on machines contributions.</p>
<p>Until such a day when code generators can have the same technical rigour as humans (for example generate proofs of quality or trigger reasonable refactory actions), we should not allow auto-generated code to merge without human review and justification.</p>

<p>I really don’t agree with this. LLVM is, at its core, a compiler framework that’s responsible for the running code on the majority of the world’s computing systems. From embedded devices to servers and everything in between. Like the Linux kernel, quality and stability are IMO the highest priorities here. We don’t need <em>more</em> contributors who aren’t programmers to contribute code. That may suck for those people who want to feel good by having some code accepted into a prestigious project like LLVM for their resumé without learning compilers, but I couldn’t care less about those people. Those people can take their contributions to one of the other million OSS projects, LLVM will be just fine without them.</p>
<p>What we need more of are contributors who’ve built experience, can review code, learn and teach others through discussions. We need people with good <em>taste</em> that comes with years of interaction with LLVM. We need people who can look at a PR that seems to do a correct thing on a local level, but explain that it’s not the right place to be making those changes in the long term.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, I strongly agree with this RFC and we can evolve it as needed in future.</p>

<p>Unhealthy water violates the federal government’s Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR), which was implemented in 2011 and requires airlines to provide passengers and flight crew with safe drinking water.</p>



<p>The 2026 Airline Water Study ranks 10 major and 11 regional airlines by the quality of water they provided onboard flights during a three-year study period (October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2025). Each airline was given a “Water Safety Score” (5.00 = highest rating, 0.00 = lowest) based on five weighted criteria, including violations per aircraft, Maximum Contaminant Level violations for E. coli, indicator-positive rates, public notices, and disinfecting and flushing frequency. A score of 3.5 or better indicates that the airline has relatively safe, clean water and earns a Grade A or B.</p>



<p>“Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines win the top spots with the safest water in the sky, and Alaska Airlines finishes No. 3,” says Charles Platkin, PhD, JD, MPH, director of the Center for Food as Medicine and Longevity.</p>



<p>The airlines with the worst score are American Airlines and JetBlue, the study shows. “Nearly all regional airlines need to improve their onboard water safety, with the exception of GoJet Airlines,” Platkin says.</p>



<p>The ADWR requires airlines to take samples from their water tanks to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli. Airlines are also required to disinfect and flush each aircraft’s water tank four times per year. Alternatively, an airline may choose to disinfect and flush once a year, but then it must test monthly.</p>



<p>The 2026 Airline Water Study also finds that the Environmental Protection Agency – one of the federal agencies responsible for ensuring safe aircraft drinking water – rarely levies civil penalties to airlines in violation of the ADWR.</p>



<p><strong>Here are the study’s findings:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The major airlines receiving the highest Water Safety Scores are Delta Air Lines (5.00, Grade A) and Frontier Airlines (4.80, Grade A). Alaska Airlines is a close third at 3.85 (Grade B).</li>



<li>GoJet Airlines is the highest-rated regional carrier with a score of 3.85 (Grade B).</li>



<li>Among major airlines, American Airlines has the lowest score of 1.75 (Grade D).</li>



<li>Nearly all regional airlines have poor Water Safety Scores. Mesa Airlines has the lowest score among rated regional carriers at 1.35 (Grade F), and CommuteAir is second-lowest at 1.60 (Grade D). CommuteAir shows an alarming 33.33% total coliform positive rate.</li>



<li>The study window analyzed 35,674 total sample locations tested for total coliform bacteria across all airlines. Of these, 949 locations (2.66%) tested positive for total coliform.</li>



<li>Maximum Contaminant Level violations for E. coli were identified as the strongest downward driver of airline scores. There were 32 such violations across the 21-airline universe during the study window.</li>



<li>The “Shame on You” Award goes to the EPA for weak enforcement. The study shows that civil penalties for ADWR violations remain extremely rare if at all (we are not able to get an answer).</li>



<li>Testing for coliform bacteria is important, because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system.</li>



<li>When an aircraft’s water sample tests positive for coliform, it must be tested again to determine if E. coli is present. If E. coli is not present, the airline must take repeat samples within 24 hours, disinfect and flush the water system within 72 hours, or shut down the water system within 72 hours and then disinfect and flush. If the sample is E. coli positive, the airline must shut off public access to the water system within 24 hours and disinfect and flush.</li>



<li>The ADWR does not require the same testing as the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which includes other microorganisms in addition to total coliform.</li>



<li>An aircraft flies to numerous destinations and may pump drinking water into its tanks from various sources at domestic and international locations. The water quality onboard also depends on the safety of the equipment used to transfer the water, such as water cabinets, trucks, carts and hoses.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Here’s the bottom-line advice from the Center for Food as Medicine and Longevity. To be extra safe:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NEVER drink any water onboard that isn’t in a sealed bottle.</li>



<li>Do not drink coffee or tea onboard.</li>



<li>Do not wash your hands in the bathroom; use alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background and Public Health Significance</h3>



<p>Commercial aviation serves as an essential mode of transportation for hundreds of millions of passengers annually in the United States. While considerable attention has been devoted to aviation safety in terms of mechanical reliability and operational procedures, the quality and safety of drinking water available to passengers and crew during flight remains a less visible but important public health consideration. Aircraft drinking water systems present unique challenges that distinguish them from terrestrial water systems. Water is loaded onto aircraft at varying airports, stored in onboard tanks under fluctuating temperature and pressure conditions, distributed through complex plumbing networks to galleys and lavatories, and consumed by passengers and flight attendants who have limited alternatives during flight.</p>



<p>Unlike municipal water systems with continuous flow and regular monitoring, aircraft water systems experience periods of stagnation between flights, temperature variations during ascent and descent, and mechanical stress from aircraft operations. These conditions can create environments conducive to biofilm formation and microbial proliferation. Furthermore, the water loaded onto aircraft originates from airport facilities with varying infrastructure quality, and contamination introduced during the servicing process—whether from hoses, truck tanks, or improper handling—can persist in aircraft systems if adequate disinfection and flushing protocols are not rigorously maintained.</p>



<p>The potential health consequences of consuming contaminated aircraft drinking water range from acute gastrointestinal illness to exposure to opportunistic pathogens. Vulnerable populations, including young children, elderly passengers, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, may face elevated risks from waterborne pathogens. For flight attendants who consume onboard water regularly as part of their occupational routine, chronic low-level exposure represents an additional concern. Despite these risks, airline drinking water has historically received less regulatory scrutiny and public attention than other aspects of aviation safety and food service.</p>



<h3>Previous Research and the Need for Ongoing Monitoring</h3>



<p>In September 2019, dietdetective.com released the first comprehensive comparative analysis of airline drinking water safety. That landmark study examined Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR) compliance data from 2012 through 2019, revealing that the quality of drinking water varies substantially by airline and that many airlines had provided passengers with unhealthy water in violation of federal safety requirements. The study ranked 10 major and 13 regional airlines using a Water Health Score (5 = highest rating, 0 = lowest) based on 10 criteria, including fleet size, ADWR violations, positive <em>E. coli</em> and coliform water sample reports, and airline cooperation in providing answers to water-quality questions. A score of 3.0 or better was designated as indicating relatively safe, clean water.</p>



<p>The 2019 study’s key findings painted a troubling picture of airline water safety:</p>



<p><strong>Major airline rankings:</strong> Alaska Airlines and Allegiant tied for the top spot with scores of 3.3 out of 5.0, followed closely by Hawaiian Airlines at 3.1. At the bottom, Spirit Airlines and JetBlue both scored just 1.0 out of 5.0. Delta Air Lines scored 1.6, American Airlines scored 1.5, and United Airlines scored 1.2.</p>



<p><strong>Regional airline challenges:</strong> Nearly all regional airlines, except Piedmont Airlines (which scored an impressive 4.33), showed poor Water Health Scores and a large number of ADWR violations. Republic Airways, which flies for United Express, Delta Connection, and American Eagle, had the lowest score at 0.44. ExpressJet was second-lowest at 0.56 and averaged 3.36 ADWR violations per aircraft.</p>



<p><strong>Violation trends:</strong> The number of ADWR violations by all airlines in 2018 was significantly less than in 2012, the first year after the ADWR was enacted. For major airlines, violations had decreased 69% (from 262 to 81), while violations among regional airlines had decreased 71% (from 351 to 103). However, the study noted this decrease might reflect a lack of enforcement by the EPA, which had issued few penalties in recent years.</p>



<p><strong>Enforcement concerns:</strong> The study found that the Environmental Protection Agency—one of the federal agencies responsible for ensuring safe aircraft drinking water—rarely levied civil penalties to airlines in violation of the ADWR.</p>



<p><strong>Industry cooperation:</strong> The study awarded a “Shame on You” designation to the EPA and nearly all major airlines for their very poor response time and lack of cooperation in answering detailed questions. The EPA didn’t answer most penalty-related questions, and Spirit, Allegiant, and Frontier did not respond to any questions. Very weak responses that didn’t adequately address questions were provided by American, United, and JetBlue, which had large numbers of violations during the study period.</p>



<p>The 2019 study’s bottom-line advice to passengers was unequivocal: Never drink any water onboard that isn’t in a sealed bottle, do not drink coffee or tea made with onboard water, and do not wash hands in aircraft bathrooms—instead, bring hand sanitizer.</p>



<p>The findings from the 2019 study generated significant public attention and media coverage, bringing airline water safety into broader public discourse. However, the passage of six years since that analysis creates an urgent need for updated information. Airlines have had time to respond to public scrutiny, EPA enforcement patterns may have evolved, and fleet compositions and operational practices have changed. Most importantly, passengers and public health stakeholders require current data to assess whether the industry has improved its performance in response to the 2019 findings or whether systemic problems persist.</p>



<p>Some of the most dramatic questions raised by comparing the 2019 baseline to current conditions include: Has Delta Air Lines, which scored just 1.6 in 2019, improved its water safety practices? Have JetBlue and Spirit, tied for last place in 2019, addressed their significant compliance challenges? Has the regional airline sector, which showed pervasive problems in 2019, made meaningful progress? And critically, has the EPA increased enforcement efforts, or does the regulatory gap identified in 2019 persist?</p>



<p>This 2026 study represents a continuation of systematic airline water safety monitoring using a refined methodology specifically designed to provide actionable, comparative information based on the most recent three years of compliance data.</p>



<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The rule, which became effective in 2011, applies to aircraft operated by U.S. carriers that have onboard drinking water systems and serve passengers or crew on flights with at least one U.S. point of service.</p>



<p>The Aircraft Drinking Water Rule establishes several key requirements for covered carriers:</p>



<p><strong>Routine monitoring and testing:</strong> Airlines must collect and analyze water samples from aircraft for the presence of total coliform bacteria and, when total coliform is detected, for <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em>). Total coliform bacteria serve as indicator organisms; their presence suggests potential fecal contamination or inadequate disinfection, even if the organisms themselves are not necessarily pathogenic. The detection of <em>E. coli</em>, a fecal coliform bacterium, constitutes a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) violation and signals more serious contamination requiring immediate corrective action. Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system.</p>



<p><strong>Disinfection and flushing:</strong> When monitoring reveals coliform contamination, airlines must disinfect and flush the affected aircraft water system according to EPA-approved procedures. Airlines are required to disinfect and flush each aircraft’s water tank four times per year, or alternatively, an airline may choose to disinfect and flush once a year if it tests monthly. Disinfection typically involves super-chlorination of the water system followed by thorough flushing to remove both the disinfectant residue and biofilm. When an aircraft’s water sample tests positive for coliform, it must be tested again to determine if <em>E. coli</em> is present. If <em>E. coli</em> is not present, the airline must take repeat samples within 24 hours and either disinfect and flush the water system within 72 hours or shut down the water system within 72 hours and then disinfect and flush. If the sample is <em>E. coli</em> positive, the airline must shut off public access to the water system within 24 hours and disinfect and flush.</p>



<p><strong>Corrective action and public notification:</strong> When <em>E. coli</em> is detected (a Maximum Contaminant Level violation), airlines must immediately take the aircraft water system out of service, provide alternative drinking water sources to passengers and crew, notify passengers through posted notices, disinfect and flush the system, and conduct follow-up testing to confirm the contamination has been eliminated. Public notices must inform passengers that the water system is unavailable and that alternative drinking water is being provided.</p>



<p><strong>Record-keeping and reporting:</strong> Airlines must maintain detailed records of all monitoring, testing, disinfection, flushing, violations, and corrective actions, and submit these records to EPA through a centralized electronic reporting portal.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the ADWR does not require the same comprehensive testing as the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which includes testing for other microorganisms in addition to total coliform. Additionally, aircraft fly to numerous destinations and may pump drinking water into their tanks from various sources at domestic and international locations. The water quality onboard also depends on the safety of the equipment used to transfer the water, such as water cabinets, trucks, carts, and hoses—factors that can introduce contamination even when source water meets safety standards.</p>



<p>The Aircraft Drinking Water Rule represents a significant regulatory framework for ensuring aircraft water safety. However, compliance data alone does not automatically translate into public awareness or competitive pressure for improved performance. Systematic analysis and transparent public reporting of airline-specific performance metrics remain essential for translating regulatory data into actionable public health information.</p>



<h3>Knowledge Gaps and Study Rationale</h3>



<p>Despite the 2019 baseline study and ongoing EPA data collection, several important questions remain unanswered:</p>



<p><strong>How have airline drinking water safety practices evolved?</strong> The 2019 study provided a snapshot of the industry during the first seven years of ADWR implementation. Whether airlines have improved their performance in response to public scrutiny, maintained similar patterns, or experienced deterioration requires fresh analysis of recent compliance records.</p>



<p><strong>Which airlines currently demonstrate the strongest and weakest water safety performance?</strong> Rankings from 2019 may not reflect current conditions. Some carriers that performed poorly may have implemented significant improvements, while previously high-performing airlines may have experienced setbacks. Updated comparative rankings using current data are essential for informed passenger decision-making.</p>



<p><strong>What is the current magnitude of contamination risk?</strong> Total coliform detection rates, <em>E. coli</em> Maximum Contaminant Level violations, and compliance patterns may have shifted substantially since the 2019 analysis. Quantifying current risk levels across the industry provides an updated baseline for assessing future trends.</p>



<p><strong>Are there systematic differences between major airlines and regional carriers?</strong> The 2019 study demonstrated that regional airlines faced particular challenges, but whether these patterns persist or have changed requires examination of current data.</p>



<p><strong>How effective are public notification and response practices?</strong> Beyond detecting contamination, the adequacy of airline responses when violations occur—specifically whether airlines consistently provide alternative water sources and remove contaminated systems from service—remains a critical but understudied dimension of passenger protection. The 2019 study noted significant gaps in airline cooperation and transparency; whether these have improved is unknown.</p>



<p><strong>Has EPA enforcement evolved?</strong> The 2019 study identified limited EPA enforcement and civil penalties as a systemic concern. Whether regulatory oversight has strengthened since 2019 requires examination of current violation and penalty patterns.</p>



<p>This study addresses these knowledge gaps through comprehensive analysis of the most recent three-year period of Aircraft Drinking Water Rule compliance data, using enhanced methodological rigor and transparency compared to the 2019 study.</p>



<h3>Study Objectives</h3>



<p>The primary objective of this study is to generate an evidence-based, transparent scorecard that ranks airlines according to multiple indicators of drinking water safety derived from Aircraft Drinking Water Rule compliance data for the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2025. Specific aims include:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Quantify total coliform and <em>E. coli</em> detection rates</strong> across airlines, normalized by fleet size to enable fair comparisons between carriers of different scales.</li>



<li><strong>Identify Maximum Contaminant Level violations for <em>E. coli</em></strong> and assess how these serious contamination events are distributed across the airline industry.</li>



<li><strong>Evaluate compliance with public notification requirements</strong>, including whether airlines consistently provide alternative drinking water and remove contaminated systems from service when violations occur.</li>



<li><strong>Assess preventive maintenance practices</strong> by measuring the frequency of disinfection and flushing events relative to fleet size.</li>



<li><strong>Develop a composite Water Safety Score</strong> that integrates multiple performance dimensions into a single metric, allowing passengers and stakeholders to compare airlines and identify both leaders and laggards in drinking water safety.</li>



<li><strong>Provide actionable guidance for passengers</strong> on risk-reduction strategies when traveling by air, informed by current patterns in compliance data.</li>



<li><strong>Document changes in airline performance</strong> since the 2019 baseline study, identifying carriers that have improved dramatically, those that have maintained consistent performance, and those where challenges persist or have worsened.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Study Approach and Report Structure</h3>



<p>This study employs a retrospective, observational design using Aircraft Drinking Water Rule records submitted to EPA by airlines and exported from the EPA reporting portal. The analysis covers a three-year study window from October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2025 (inclusive), and includes 21 airlines: 10 major carriers and 11 regional carriers.</p>



<p>Data sources include five comma-separated value exports containing violation records, operational events (disinfection, flushing, sampling, and water system restrictions), laboratory sample results, and public notices. Fleet size for each airline was determined by counting unique aircraft tail numbers appearing in any of the data files during the study window, providing a consistent denominator for calculating per-aircraft rates.</p>



<p>The Water Safety Score, ranging from 0.00 to 5.00, combines five weighted sub-scores reflecting violations per aircraft, Maximum Contaminant Level violations for <em>E. coli</em>, indicator-positive rates (total coliform present with <em>E. coli</em> absent), public notices per 100 aircraft, and disinfecting and flushing frequency. Penalties are applied for inadequate responses to public notice requirements, specifically when airlines fail to clearly turn off contaminated water systems or provide alternative drinking water.</p>



<p>Compared to the 2019 study methodology, this analysis incorporates several enhancements: (1) use of direct EPA data exports rather than manual data compilation, (2) explicit handling of violation date overlap calculations with transparency about missing data, (3) extraction of sample-location level total coliform results from operational event details, (4) formal weighting of score components based on public health significance, and (5) explicit penalty structures for inadequate public notification responses.</p>



<p>This report presents validated study-wide totals for key contamination metrics, comparative rankings of airlines by Water Safety Score with assigned letter grades, detailed airline-specific profiles showing the underlying data driving each score, passenger risk-reduction guidance, methodological transparency including quintile thresholds and calculation procedures, and discussion of study limitations. By making these findings accessible to the public, this study aims to empower passengers with information to make informed travel choices, encourage airlines to prioritize drinking water safety through competitive transparency, and contribute to the evidence base for public health policy in aviation.</p>

<h2 id="h-executive-summary"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h2>



<p>Airplane drinking water is stored in onboard tanks and distributed through plumbing to galleys and lavatories. These systems can face stagnation, temperature fluctuation, and maintenance complexity, all of which can contribute to microbial contamination risk or persistent hygiene challenges.</p>



<p>This study presents a comparative scorecard for 21 airlines using Aircraft Drinking Water Rule compliance, operational, sampling, and public notice records. Each airline is assigned a Water Safety Score on a 0.00 to 5.00 scale. Higher scores indicate stronger performance across the indicators used in this study.</p>

<h2 id="h-methods"><strong>Methods</strong></h2>



<h3 id="h-study-design-and-objective"><strong>Study design and objective</strong></h3>



<p>The Center for Food as Medicine and Longevity conducted a retrospective, observational analysis of Aircraft Drinking Water Rule records to generate a comparative airline drinking water scorecard for a fixed three-year period.</p>



<h3 id="h-data-sources"><strong>Data sources</strong></h3>



<p>Five comma separated value files exported from the United States Environmental Protection Agency Aircraft Drinking Water Rule reporting portal were analyzed:</p>



<ol>
<li>Violations Report (one row per Aircraft Drinking Water Rule violation record).<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Drinking Water System Operations (one row per operational event; includes disinfecting and flushing events, sampling events, and restriction of public access events).<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Sampling Operations (one row per laboratory sample result; includes a field for Escherichia coli present or absent, but this export does not include an explicit total coliform result field).<br></li>



<li>Public Notices Report (one row per public notice; includes whether the water system was turned off and whether an alternative was provided).<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Disinfecting and Flushing Operations (used as a cross-check subset of disinfecting and flushing events).<br></li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-study-window-and-file-specific-filters"><strong>Study window and file-specific filters</strong></h3>



<p>All files were filtered to October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2025 (inclusive).</p>



<p>Violations Report: Violations were counted using an overlap method that requires a begin date and an end date. A violation record was included if Date Violation Began was on or before September 30, 2025 and Date Violation Ended was on or after October 1, 2022. Violation rows with missing Date Violation Ended values cannot be evaluated for overlap and are excluded from overlap-based counting.</p>



<p>Aircraft Drinking Water System Operations: Events were included if the event date fell within the study window.</p>



<p>Aircraft Sampling Operations: Laboratory results were included if Results Received On fell within the study window.</p>



<p>Public Notices Report: Notices were included if the notice date fell within the study window.</p>



<h3 id="h-airline-universe"><strong>Airline universe</strong></h3>



<p>The analysis was restricted to a fixed universe of 1 airlines (10 major airlines and 11 regional airlines). Airlines not on this list were excluded from scoring. If an airline had no records in the provided files during the study window, it is listed with fleet size equal to 0 and marked not rated.</p>



<h3 id="h-fleet-size-definition"><strong>Fleet size definition</strong></h3>



<p>Fleet size for each airline was defined as the number of unique aircraft tail numbers appearing for that airline in any of the following within the study window:</p>



<ul>
<li>Violations Report<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Drinking Water System Operations<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Sampling Operations<br></li>



<li>Public Notices Report<br></li>
</ul>



<p>This yields a consistent per-aircraft denominator for rate calculations.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-total-coliform-present-is-identified-in-these-files"><strong>How total coliform present is identified in these files</strong></h3>



<p>In this export set, total coliform present or absent is available at the sample-location level inside the Aircraft Drinking Water System Operations file for rows where Event equals Sample. These rows contain a Details field that includes two sampling locations per row, each introduced by the literal string Location:.</p>



<p>Within each location block, the total coliform result appears as text in forms including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Total Coliform:&lt;b&gt;Present&lt;/b&gt;<br></li>



<li>Total Coliform:&lt;b&gt;Absent&lt;/b&gt;<br>and sometimes without bold tags (for example, Total Coliform: Present).<br></li>
</ul>



<p>For this study, the Details field was parsed by splitting each Sample row into its two Location blocks, removing markup tags such as &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; (and other HTML tags when present), and extracting the total coliform result from each block. Each Location block counted as one sample location tested. A location was counted as total coliform positive if the extracted value was present.</p>



<p>The same location block also includes Escherichia coli as present, absent, or did not speciate. This allowed the study to report both total coliform positives and indicator positives (total coliform present with Escherichia coli absent).</p>



<h3 id="h-how-maximum-contaminant-level-violations-for-escherichia-coli-are-identified"><strong>How Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli are identified</strong></h3>



<p>Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli were counted when Violation Type equals Maximum Contaminant Level (Escherichia coli) in the violations export. Violations of type Monitoring (Escherichia coli speciate) are not counted as Maximum Contaminant Level violations.</p>



<h3 id="h-public-notices-and-response-penalties"><strong>Public notices and response penalties</strong></h3>



<p>Public notices were taken from the Public Notices Report. Two response fields were used for penalty logic:</p>



<ul>
<li>Was Water System Turned Off?<br></li>



<li>Alternative Provided?<br></li>
</ul>



<p>A response was treated as affirmative only when the field value was clearly Yes (or equivalent affirmative forms). Any non-affirmative or blank value was treated as not affirmative.</p>



<h3 id="h-water-safety-score-0-00-to-5-00"><strong>Water Safety Score (0.00 to 5.00)</strong></h3>



<p>Each airline received five sub-scores on a 1 to 5 scale, combined using fixed weights:</p>



<ul>
<li>Violations per aircraft: 20 percent (lower is scored better, using quintiles; 0 is always scored as 5).<br></li>



<li>Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli: 35 percent (hard step penalty; 0 is scored as 5, 1 is scored as 2, 2 or more is scored as 1).<br></li>



<li>Indicator-positive rate (total coliform present with Escherichia coli absent, percent): 20 percent (lower is scored better, using quintiles; 0 is always scored as 5).<br></li>



<li>Public notices per 100 aircraft: 15 percent (lower is scored better, using quintiles; 0 is always scored as 5).<br></li>



<li>Disinfecting and flushing events per aircraft: 10 percent (higher is scored better, using quintiles).<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Public notice response penalties were then applied:</p>



<ul>
<li>Subtract 0.5 if the airline had at least one public notice where an alternative was not clearly provided.<br></li>



<li>Subtract 1.0 if the airline had at least one public notice where the water system was not clearly turned off.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Quintile threshold handling for reproducibility: for quintile-based sub-scores, values equal to a percentile threshold are assigned to the higher-performing bin (for example, greater than or equal to the 20th percentile threshold is scored in the 20th-to-40th percentile bin, and greater than or equal to the 80th percentile threshold is scored in the top bin).</p>



<p>Final score is bounded at a minimum of 0.00 and reported to two decimal places.</p>



<p>Grades were assigned as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>4.50 or higher: Grade A<br></li>



<li>3.50 to 4.49: Grade B<br></li>



<li>2.50 to 3.49: Grade C<br></li>



<li>1.50 to 2.49: Grade D<br></li>



<li>Below 1.50: Grade F<br></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-drove-the-scores"><strong>What drove the scores</strong></h2>



<ol>
<li>Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli were the strongest downward driver. Because this component carries the largest weight and uses a hard step penalty, airlines with multiple Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli are structurally pushed toward lower scores.<br></li>



<li>The indicator-positive rate (total coliform present with Escherichia coli absent) varied widely across airlines. Across all airlines, the indicator-positive rate was 2.51 percent. The indicator-positive rate was higher among regional airlines (4.52 percent) than among major airlines (1.77 percent) in this study window.<br></li>



<li>Violations per aircraft ranged from very low to very high. Some airlines showed very low violations per aircraft (for example, Delta Air Lines Incorporated and Frontier Airlines Incorporated). Others showed high violations per aircraft (for example, Sun Country Airlines, Republic Airways Incorporated, and JetBlue Airways Corporation), which materially reduced their scores.<br></li>



<li>Public notice response behavior is explicitly penalized when required fields are not clearly affirmative. In this study window, the score includes response penalties for:<br></li>

<h2 id="h-passenger-risk-reduction-guidance"><strong>Passenger Risk-Reduction Guidance</strong></h2>



<ol>
<li>Do not drink unbottled aircraft tap water.<br></li>



<li>Avoid coffee and tea made with onboard tap water when feasible.<br></li>



<li>Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol when soap-and-water options are limited.<br></li>



<li>Bring sealed beverages. Purchase sealed bottled water after airport security screening or fill a reusable bottle at airport bottle-filling stations before boarding.<br></li>



<li>Use extra caution on international routes because refilling practices and standards can vary and contamination introduced during servicing can persist when hygiene problems exist.<br></li>



<li>If you must use aircraft tap water, let it run for about 30 seconds before use to flush stagnant water from the lines. This is only a partial measure and does not address conditions in the main storage tanks.<br></li>
</ol>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-limitations"><strong>Limitations</strong></h2>



<ol>
<li>This is a compliance and monitoring signal scorecard, not a guarantee of water quality on any specific flight.<br></li>



<li>Total coliform results were extracted from the sample-location text embedded in the system operations Details field for Sample events. This approach is reproducible and validated in this report, but it depends on consistent formatting of those Details strings.<br></li>



<li>The Aircraft Sampling Operations export includes Escherichia coli present or absent, but does not include an explicit total coliform result field in this export. For that reason, the total coliform analyses in this report use the sample-location results embedded in the system operations file.<br></li>



<li>Fleet-normalized metrics improve comparability, but airlines differ in utilization patterns and operational footprint. Utilization differences are not fully captured in these files.<br></li>



<li>Violation records with missing Date Violation Ended values cannot be evaluated for overlap and are excluded from overlap-based totals.<br></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>MegaLag’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4yL3YTwWk">December 2024 video</a> introduced 18 million viewers to serious questions about Honey, the widely-used browser shopping plug-in—in particular, whether Honey abides by the rules set by affiliate networks and merchants, and whether Honey takes commissions that should flow to other affiliates.&nbsp; I <a href="https://www.benedelman.org/honey-breaches/">wrote</a> in January that I thought Honey was out of line.&nbsp; In particular, I pointed out the contracts that limit when and how Honey may present affiliate links, and I applied those contracts to the behavior MegaLag documented. &nbsp;Honey was plainly breaking the rules.</p><p>As it turns out, Honey’s misconduct is considerably worse than MegaLag, I, or others knew.&nbsp; When Honey is concerned that a user may be a tester—a “network quality” employee, a merchant’s affiliate manager, an affiliate, or an enthusiast—Honey designs its software to honor stand down in full.&nbsp; But when Honey feels confident that it’s being used by an ordinary user, Honey defies stand down rules.&nbsp; Multiple methods support these conclusions: I extracted source code from Honey’s browser plugin and studied it at length, plus I ran Honey through a packet sniffer to collect its config files, and I cross-checked all of this with actual app behavior.&nbsp; Details below.&nbsp; MegaLag tested too, and has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCGT_CKGgFE">new video</a> with his updated assessment.</p><p>(A note on our relationship: MegaLag figured out most of this, but asked me to check every bit from first principles, which I did.&nbsp; &nbsp;I added my own findings and methods, and cross-checked with VPT records of prior observations as well as historic Honey config files.&nbsp; More on that below, too.)</p><p>Behaving better when it thinks it’s being tested, Honey follows in Volkswagen’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">Dieselgate</a>” footsteps.&nbsp; Like Volkswagen, the cover-up is arguably worse than the underlying conduct.&nbsp; Facing the allegations MegaLag presented last year, Honey could try to defend presenting its affiliate links willy-nilly—argue users want this, claim to be saving users money, suggest that network rules don’t apply or don’t mean what they say.&nbsp; But these new allegations are more difficult to defend.&nbsp; Designing its software to perform differently when under test, Honey reveals knowing what the rules require and knowing they’d be in trouble if caught.&nbsp; Hiding from testers reveals that Honey wanted to present affiliate links as widely as possible, despite the rules, so long as it doesn’t get caught.&nbsp; It’s not a good look.&nbsp; Affiliates, merchants, and networks should be furious.</p><h2>What the rules require</h2><p>The basic bargain of affiliate marketing is that a publisher presents a link to a user, who clicks, browses, and buys.&nbsp; If the user makes a purchase, commission flows to the publisher whose link was last clicked.</p><p>Shopping plugins and other client-side software undermine the basic bargain of affiliate marketing.&nbsp; If a publisher puts software on a user’s computer, that software can monitor where the user browses, present its affiliate link, and always (appear to) be “last”—even if it had minimal role in influencing the customer’s purchase decision.</p><p>Affiliate networks and merchants established rules to restore and preserve the bargain between what we might call “web affiliates” versus software affiliates.&nbsp; One, a user has to actually click a software affiliate’s link; decades ago, auto-clicks were common, but that’s long-since banned (yet nonetheless routine from “adware”-style browser plugins—&nbsp; <a href="https://vptdigital.com/blog/how-adware-manipulates-attribution-to-monetize-a-merchants-own-traffic/">example</a>).&nbsp; Two, software must “stand down”—must not even show its link to users—when some prior web affiliate P has already referred a user to a given merchant.&nbsp; This reflects a balancing of interests: P wants a reasonable opportunity for the user to make a purchase, so P can get paid.&nbsp; If a shopping plugin could always present its offer, the shopping plugin would claim the commission that P had fairly earned.&nbsp; Meanwhile P wouldn’t get sufficient payment for its effort—and might switch to promoting some other merchant with rules P sees as more favorable.&nbsp; Merchants and networks need to maintain a balance in order to attract and retain web affiliates, which are understood to send traffic that’s substantially incremental (customers who wouldn’t have purchased anyway), whereas shopping plugins often take credit for nonincremental purchases.&nbsp; So if a merchant is unsure, it has good reason to err on the side of web affiliates.</p><p>All of this was known and understood literally decades ago.&nbsp; Stand-down rules were <a href="https://www.cumbrowski.com/CodeOfConduct.asp">first established in 2002</a>.&nbsp; Since then, they’ve been increasingly routine, and overall have become clearer and better enforced.&nbsp; Crucially, merchants and networks include stand-down rules in their contracts, making this not just a principle and a norm, but a binding contractual obligation.</p><h2>Detecting testers</h2><p>How can Honey tell when a user may be a tester?&nbsp; Honey’s code and config files show that they’re using four criteria:</p><ul><li>New accounts. If an account is less than 30 days old, Honey concludes the user might be a tester, so it disables its prohibited behavior.</li><li>Low earnings-to-date. In general, under Honey’s current rules, if an account has less than 65,000 points of Honey earning, Honey concludes the user might be a tester, so it disables its prohibited behavior.&nbsp; Since 1,000 points can be redeemed for $10 of gift cards, this threshold requires having earned $650 worth of points.&nbsp; That sounds like a high requirement, and it is.&nbsp; But it’s actually relatively new: As of June 2022, there was no points requirement for most merchants, and for merchants in Rakuten Advertising, the requirement was just 501 points (about $5 of points).&nbsp; (<a href="#changeovertime">Details below</a>.)</li><li>Honey periodically checks a server-side blacklist.&nbsp; The server can condition its decision on any factor known to the server, including the user’s Honey ID and cookie, or IP address inside a geofence or on a ban list. &nbsp;Suppose the user has submitted prior complaints about Honey, as professional testers frequently do.&nbsp; Honey can blacklist the user ID, cookie, and IP or IP range.&nbsp; Then any further requests from that user, cookie, or IP will be treated as high-risk, and Honey disables its prohibited behavior.</li><li>Affiliate industry cookies. Honey checks whether a user has cookies indicating having logged into key affiliate industry tools, including the CJ, Rakuten Advertising, and Awin dashboards.&nbsp; If the user has such a cookie, the user is particularly likely to be a tester, so Honey disables its prohibited behavior.</li></ul><p>If even one of these factors indicates a user is high-risk, Honey honors stand-down.&nbsp; But if all four pass, then Honey ignores stand-down rules and presents its affiliate links regardless of a prior web publisher’s role and regardless of stand-down rules.&nbsp; This isn’t a probabilistic or uncertain dishonoring of stand-down (as plaintiffs <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.441974/gov.uscourts.cand.441974.161.0.pdf#page=34">posited</a> in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69503243/in-re-paypal-honey-browser-extension-litigation/?page=1">litigation against Honey</a>).&nbsp; Rather, Honey’s actions are deterministic: If a high-risk factor hits, Honey will <em>completely</em> and <em>in every instance</em> honor stand-down; and if no such factor hits, then Honey will <em>completely</em> and <em>in every instance</em> dishonor stand-down (meaning, present its link despite networks’ rules).</p><p>These criteria indicate Honey’s attempt to obstruct and frankly frustrate testers.&nbsp; In my experience from two decades of testing affiliate misconduct, it is routine for a tester to install a new shopping plugin on a new PC, create a new account, and check for immediate wrongdoing.&nbsp; By always standing down on new accounts (&lt;30 days), Honey prevents this common test scenario from catching its stand-down violations.&nbsp; Of course diligent testers will check way past 30 days, but a tester on a short-term contract will perceive nothing amiss.&nbsp; Some clients may not pay for testers to stick with the task.&nbsp; And a client for some reason needing an immediate finding—perhaps to dispute Honey’s recent earnings—can’t get it.</p><p>The requirement of achieving sufficiently many points similarly stymies many testers.&nbsp; Over the years, a handful of my clients granted a budget for test purchases.&nbsp; But most did not.&nbsp; If I wanted to perform test purchases, I would have needed to spend my own money.&nbsp; Meanwhile, there’s no proper reason why a shopping app should stand down differently for users with points versus new users, so if testers assumed good faith by Honey, they’d have no reason to build up a points history.&nbsp; This criteria certainly prevented testers from uncovering what Honey was doing.</p><p>The interaction of account age, points history, and blacklist further stymies testing.&nbsp; Once a tester reports a specific observation of misconduct, Honey can blacklist the tester’s account—which will still do most things normally, but will begin to stand down even though unbanned accounts don’t stand down in the same circumstances.&nbsp; A tester who suspected this, would have to create a new account, wait 30 days, and build up a sizable points balance to see what Honey is actually doing for other users. &nbsp;That’s a genuine barrier, impeding even a tester who correctly proposes this hypothesis.</p><p>Honey’s detection of affiliate industry cookies is particularly revealing and, in my view, devastatingly incriminating.&nbsp; Maybe Honey could concoct a story about why it stands down less for established accounts and for high-points-earners.&nbsp; It would be a tall tale, but maybe Honey could convince some people.&nbsp; In contrast, it is inconceivable why a shopping plugin should care whether a user previously logged into an affiliate dashboard.&nbsp; There’s &nbsp;only one reason to check: to hide from testers.&nbsp; But that reveals Honey’s intent and Honey’s knowledge that its conduct is prohibited.</p><h2 id="handson">Evidence from hands-on testing</h2><p>Multiple forms of evidence support my finding of Honey detecting testers.&nbsp; First, consider hands-on testing.&nbsp; With a standard test account with few or no points, Honey honored stand-down.&nbsp; See <a href="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/v1-affillink-sharperimage-lowpoints-standdown-fiddler-2025-11-14b.mp4" data-fancybox="">video 1</a>.&nbsp; But when I tricked the Honey plugin into thinking I had tens of thousands of points (<a href="#testingmethods">details below about how I did this</a>), Honey popped up despite stand-down rules.&nbsp; See <a href="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/v2-affillink-sharperimage-highpoints-nostanddown-fiddler-2025-11-15.mp4" data-fancybox="">video 2</a>.&nbsp; I repeated this test over multiple days, as to multiple merchants.&nbsp; The finding was the same every time.&nbsp; The only thing I changed between the “video 1” tests and “video 2” tests was the number of points supposedly associated with my account.</p><p>To demonstrate Honey checking for affiliate industry cookies, I added a step to my test scenario. With Honey tricked into thinking I had ample points, same as video 2, I began a test run by logging into a CJ portal used by affiliates.&nbsp; In all other respects, my test run was the same as video 2.&nbsp; Seeing the CJ portal cookie, Honey stood down.&nbsp; See <a href="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/v3-affillink-console-sharperimage-highpoints-standdown-fiddler-2025-11-16.mp4" data-fancybox="">video 3</a>.</p><h2>Evidence from technical analysis</h2><p>Some might ask whether the findings in the prior section could be coincidence.&nbsp; Maybe Honey just happened to open in some scenarios and not others.&nbsp; Maybe I’m ascribing intentionality to acts that are just coincidence.&nbsp; Let me offer two responses to this hypothesis.&nbsp; One, my findings are repeatable, countering any claim of coincidence.&nbsp; Second, separate from hands-on testing, three separate types of technical analysis—config files, telemetry, and source code—all confirm the accuracy of the prior section.</p><h2 id="configfiles">Evidence from configuration files</h2><p>Honey retrieves its configuration settings from JSON files on a Honey server. Honey’s core stand-down configuration is in <a href="https://cdn.honey.io/standdown-rules.json">standdown-rules.json</a>, while the selective stand-down—declining to stand down according to the criteria described above—is in the separate config file <a href="https://cdn.honey.io/ab/ssd.json">ssd.json</a>.&nbsp; Here’s the contents of ssd.json as of October 22, 2025, with // comments added by me</p><pre>{"ssd": {

}</pre><p>On its own, the ssd config file is not a model of clarity.&nbsp; But source code (discussed below) reveals the meaning of abbreviations in ssd.&nbsp; <span>uP</span> (yellow) refers to user points—the minimum number of points a user must have in order for Honey to dishonor stand-down.&nbsp; Note the current <span>base</span> (default) requirement of <span>uP</span> user points at least 65,000 (green), though the subsequent section <span>LS</span> sets a lower threshold of just 5001 for merchants on the Rakuten Advertising (LinkShare) network.&nbsp; <span>bl</span> set to <span>1</span> instructs the Honey plugin to stand down if the server-side blacklist so instructs.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <span>affiliates</span> and <span>ex GA</span> data structures (blue), establish the affiliate industry cookie checks mentioned above.&nbsp; The “affiliates” entry lists domain where cookies are to be checked.&nbsp; The <span>ex GA</span> data structure lists which cookie is to be checked for each domain.&nbsp; Though these are presented as two one-dimensional lists, Honey’s code actually checks them in conjunction – checks the first-listed affiliate network domain for the first-listed cookie, then the second, and so forth.&nbsp; One might ask why Honey stored the domain names and cookie names in two separate one-dimensional lists, rather than in a two-dimensional list, name-value pair, or similar.&nbsp; The obvious answer is that Honey’s approach kept the domain names more distant from the cookies on those domains, making its actions that much harder for testers to notice even if they got as far as this config file.</p><p>The rest of <span>ex</span> (red) sets exceptions to the standard (“base”) ssd.&nbsp; This lists five specific ecommerce sites (each referenced with an 18-digit ID number previously assigned by Honey) with adjusted ssd settings.&nbsp; For Booking.com and Kayosports, the ssd exceptions set even higher points requirements to cancel standdown (120,000 and 100,000 points, respectively), which I interpret as response to complaints from those sites.</p><h2 id="telemetry">Evidence from telemetry</h2><p>Honey’s telemetry is delightfully verbose and, frankly, easy to understand, including English explanations of what data is being collected and why.&nbsp; Perhaps Google demanded improvements as part of approving Honey’s submission to Chrome Web Store.&nbsp; (Google <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/policies">enforces</a> what it calls “strict guidelines” for collecting user data.&nbsp; <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/user-data-faq">Rule 12</a>: data collection must be “necessary for a user-facing feature.”&nbsp; The English explanations are most consistent with seeking to show Google that Honey’s data collection is proper and arguably necessary.)&nbsp; Meanwhile, Honey submitted much the same code to Apple as an iPhone app, and Apple is known to be quite strict in its app review.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, Honey telemetry reveals some important aspects of what it is doing and why.</p><p>When a user with few points gets a stand-down, Honey reports that in telemetry with the JSON data structure <span>“method”:”suspend”</span>.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the nearby JSON variable <span>state</span> gives the specific ssd requirement that the user didn’t satisfy—in my video 1: <span>“state”:”uP:5001”</span> reporting that, in this test run, my Honey app had less than 5001 points, and the ssd logic therefore decided to stand down.&nbsp; See video 1 at 0:37-0:41, or screenshots below for convenience.&nbsp; (My network tracing tool converted the telemetry from plaintext to a JSON tree for readability.)</p><p><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMjQiIGhlaWdodD0iMzkiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMjQgMzkiPjxyZWN0IHdpZHRoPSIxMDAlIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCUiIHN0eWxlPSJmaWxsOiNjZmQ0ZGI7ZmlsbC1vcGFjaXR5OiAwLjE7Ii8+PC9zdmc+" decoding="async" data-src="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/honey1.png" alt="Fiddler reference to Honey telemetry transmission" width="324" height="39" data-srcset="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/honey1.png 324w, https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/honey1-300x36.png 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px"></p><p><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI2MjQiIGhlaWdodD0iNTgiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2MjQgNTgiPjxyZWN0IHdpZHRoPSIxMDAlIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCUiIHN0eWxlPSJmaWxsOiNjZmQ0ZGI7ZmlsbC1vcGFjaXR5OiAwLjE7Ii8+PC9zdmc+" decoding="async" data-src="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/honey2.png" alt="Fiddler decodes Honey JSON telemetry reporting standdown (&quot;method=suspend&quot;)" width="624" height="58" data-srcset="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/honey2.png 624w, https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/honey2-300x28.png 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"></p><p><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI5MiIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNSIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDkyIDE1Ij48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/honey3.png" alt="Fiddler decodes Honey JSON telemetry reporting the reason for stand-down, namely insufficient points (&quot;uP&quot;), less than the 5001 threshold applicable for this network" width="92" height="15"></p><p>When I gave myself more points (video 2), <span>state</span> instead reported <span>ssd</span>—indicating that all ssd criteria were satisfied, and Honey presented its offer and did not stand down.&nbsp;

Google’s <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/code-readability">Code Readability Requirements</a> allow minification—removing whitespace, shortening variable and function names.&nbsp; Honey’s code is substantial—after deminification, more than 1.5 million lines.&nbsp; But a diligent analyst can still find what’s relevant.&nbsp; In fact the relevant parts are clustered together, and easily found via searches for obvious string such as “ssd”.</p><p>In a surprising twist, Honey in one instance released something approaching original code to Apple as&nbsp; an iPhone app.&nbsp; In particular, Honey included <span>sourceMappingURL</span> metadata that allows an analyst to recover original function names and variable names.&nbsp; (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32162445/recover-javascript-source-code-from-uglifyjs-source-map">Instructions</a>.)&nbsp; That release was from a moment in time, and Honey subsequently made revisions.&nbsp; But where that code is substantially the same as the code currently in use, I present the unobfuscated version for readers’ convenience.&nbsp; Here’s how it works:</p><p>First, there’s setup, including periodically checking the Honey killswitch URL <span>/ck/alive</span>:</p><pre>return e.next = 7, fetch("".concat("https://s.joinhoney.com", "/ck/alive"));</pre><p>If the killswitch returns “alive”, Honey sets the <span>bl</span> value to <span>0</span>:</p><pre>c = S().then((function(e) {
    e &amp;&amp; "alive" === e.is &amp;&amp; (o.bl = 0)
}))</pre><p>The ssd logic later checks this variable <span>bl</span>, among others, to decide whether to cancel standdown.</p><p>The core ssd logic is in a long function called <span>R()</span> which runs an infinite loop with a <span>switch</span> syntax to proceed through a series of numbered cases.</p><pre>function(e) {
for (;;) switch (e.prev = e.next) {</pre><p>Focusing on the sections relevant to the behavior described above: Honey makes sure the user’s email address doesn’t include the string “test”, and checks whether the user is on the killswitch blacklist.</p><pre>if (r.email &amp;&amp; r.email.match("test") &amp;&amp; (o.bl = 0), !r.isLoggedIn || t) {
  e.next = 7;
  break</pre><p>Honey computes the age of the user’s account by subtracting the account creation date (<span>r.created</span>) from the current time:</p><pre>case 8:

            }).then((function(e) {
                e &amp;&amp; (o.gca = 0) //if cookie found, set gca to 0
            }))</pre><p>Then the comparison function <span>P()</span> compares each retrieved or calculated value to the threshold from <span>ssd.json</span>.&nbsp; The fundamental logic is that if any retrieved or calculated value (received in variable <span>e</span> below) is less than the threshold <span>t</span> from <span>ssd</span>, the ssd logic will honor standdown.&nbsp; In contrast, if all four values exceed the threshold, ssd will cancel the standdown.&nbsp; If this function elects to honor standdown, the return value gives the name of the rule (<span>a</span>) and the threshold (<span>s</span>) that caused the decision (yellow highlighting).&nbsp; If this function elects to dishonor standdown, it returns <span>“ssd”</span> (red) (which is the function’s default if not overridden by the logic that folllows).&nbsp; This yields the <span>state=</span> values I showed in <a href="#telemetry">telemetry</a> and <a href="#handson">presented in screenshots and videos above</a>.</p><pre>function P(e, t) {

}</pre><h2>Special treatment of eBay</h2><p>Reviewing both config files and code, I was intrigued to see eBay called out for greater protections than others.&nbsp; Where Honey stands down for other merchant and networks for 3,600 seconds (one hour), eBay gets 86,400 seconds (24 hours).</p><pre>"regex": "^https?\\:\\/\\/rover\\.ebay((?![\\?\\&amp;]pub=5575133559).)*$",

</pre><p>Why such favorable treatment of eBay?&nbsp; Affiliate experts may remember the <a href="https://www.benedelman.org/affiliate-litigation/#hogandunning">2008 litigation in which eBay and the United States brought civil and criminal charges against Brian Dunning and Shawn Hogan</a>, who were previously eBay’s two largest affiliates—jointly paid more than $20 million in just 18 months.&nbsp; I was proud to have caught them—a fact I can only reveal because <a href="https://www.benedelman.org/affiliate-litigation/hogan-opp-suppress-exhibit1.pdf#page=35">an FBI agent’s declaration credited me</a>.&nbsp; After putting its two largest affiliates in jail and demanding repayment of all the money they hadn’t spent or lost, eBay got a well-deserved reputation for being smart and tough at affiliate compliance.&nbsp; Honey is right to want to stay on eBay’s good side.&nbsp; At the same time, it’s glaring to see Honey treat eBay so much better than other merchants and networks.&nbsp; Large merchants on other networks could look at this and ask: If eBay get a 24 hour stand-down and a hard-coded ssd exception, why are they treated worse?</p><h2 id="changeovertime">Change over time</h2><p>I mentioned above that I have historic config files.&nbsp; First, VPT (the affiliate marketing compliance company where I am Chief Scientist) preserved a ssd.json from June 2022.&nbsp; As of that date, Honey ssd had no points requirement for most networks.&nbsp; See yellow “base” below, notably in this version including a <span>uP</span> section.&nbsp; For LinkShare (Rakuten Advertising), the June 2022 ssd file required 501 points (green), equal to about $5 of earning to date.</p><pre>{"ssd": {

</pre><p>In April 2023, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230414052839/https:/cdn.honey.io/ab/ssd.json">Archive.org preserved ssd.json</a>, with the same settings.</p><p>Notice the changes from 2022-2023 to the present—most notably, a huge increase in points required for Honey to not stand-down.&nbsp; The obvious explanation for the change is MegaLag’s December 2024 video, and resulting litigation, which brought new scrutiny to whether Honey honors stand-down.</p><p>A second relevant change is that, as of 2022-2023, the ssd.json included a <span>uA</span> setting for LinkShare, requiring an account age of at least 2,592,000 seconds (30 days).&nbsp; But the current version of ssd.json has no <span>uA</span> setting, not for LinkShare merchants nor for any other merchants.&nbsp; Perhaps Honey thinks the high points requirement (65,000) now obviates the need for a 30-day account age.</p><p>In litigation, plaintiffs should be able to obtain copies of Honey config files indicating when the points requirement increased, and for that matter management discussions about whether and why to make this change.&nbsp; If the config files show ssd in similar configuration from 2022 through to fall 2024, but cutoffs increased shortly after MegaLag’s video, it will be easy to infer that Honey reduced ssd, and increased standdown, after getting caught.</p><p>Despite Honey’s recently narrowing ssd to more often honor stand-down, this still isn’t what the rules require.&nbsp; Rather than comply in full, Honey continued not to comply for the highest-spending users, those with &gt;65k points—who Honey seems to figure must be genuine users, not testers or industry insiders.</p><h3 id="tensionsrakuten">Tensions between Honey and LinkShare (Rakuten Advertising)</h3><p>Honey’s LinkShare exception presents a puzzle. &nbsp;In 2022 and 2023, Honey was <em>stricter</em> for LinkShare merchants—more often honoring stand-down, and dishonoring stand-down only for users with at least 501 points. &nbsp;But in the current configuration, Honey applies a <em>looser</em> standard for LinkShare merchants: Honey now dishonors LinkShare stand-down once a user has 5,001 points, compared to the much higher 65,000-point requirement for merchants on other networks. &nbsp;What explains this reversal?&nbsp; Honey previously wanted to be extra careful for LinkShare merchants—so why now be <em>less</em> careful?</p><p>The best interpretation is a two-step sequence. &nbsp;First, at some point Honey raised the LinkShare threshold from 501 to 5,001 points—likely in response to a merchant complaint or LinkShare network quality concerns. &nbsp;Second, when placing that LinkShare-specific override into ssd.json, Honey staff didn’t consider how it would interact with later global rules—especially since the overall points requirement (<span>base uA</span>) didn’t yet exist. &nbsp;Later, MegaLag’s video pushed Honey to impose a 65,000-point threshold for dishonoring stand-down across <em>all</em> merchants—and when Honey staff imposed that new rule, they overlooked the lingering LinkShare override. A rule intended to be <em>stricter</em> for LinkShare now inadvertently makes LinkShare <em>more permissive</em>.</p><h2>Reflections on hiding from testers</h2><p>In a broad sense, the closest analogue to Honey’s tactics is Volkswagen Dieselgate&nbsp; Recall the 2015 discovery that Volkswagen programmed certain diesel engines to activate their emission controls only during laboratory testing, but not in real-world driving.&nbsp; Revelation of Volkswagen’s misconduct led to the resignation of Volkswagen’s CEO.&nbsp; Fines, penalties, settlements, and buyback costs exceeded $33 billion.</p><p>In affiliate marketing, numbers are smaller, but defeating testing is, regrettably, more common.&nbsp; For decades I’ve been <a href="https://www.benedelman.org/cookiestuffing/">tracking cookie-stuffers</a>, which routinely use tiny web elements (1×1 <span>IFRAME</span>s and <span>IMG</span> tags) to load affiliate cookies, and sometimes further conceal those elements using CSS such as <span>visibility:none</span>.&nbsp; Invisibility quite literally conceals what occurs.&nbsp; In parallel, affiliates also deployed additional concealment methods.&nbsp; Above, I mentioned Dunning and Hogan, who concealed their miscondudct in two additional ways.&nbsp; First, they stuffed each IP address at most once.&nbsp; Consider a researcher who suspected a problem, but didn’t catch it the first time.&nbsp; (Perhaps the screen-recorder and packet sniffer weren’t running.&nbsp; Or maybe this happened on a tester’s personal machine, not a dedicated test device.)&nbsp; With a once-per-IP-address rule, the researcher couldn’t easily get the problem to recur.&nbsp; (Source: <a href="https://www.benedelman.org/affiliate-litigation/ebay-digitalpoint-hogan-kessler-thunderwood-dunning-complaint.pdf#page=8">eBay complaint</a>, paragraph 27: “… only on those computers that had not been previously stuffed…”)&nbsp; Second, they geofenced eBay and CJ headquarters. (<a href="https://www.benedelman.org/affiliate-litigation/ebay-digitalpoint-hogan-kessler-thunderwood-dunning-complaint.pdf#page=8">Source</a>.) &nbsp;Shawn Hogan even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130321093705/https:/shawnhogan.com/2010/08/what-does-carmen-electra-cyber-terrorism-and-meg-whitman-have-in-common-ebay.html#:~:text=blanket%20filter%20(via-,geo%2Dtargeting,-)%20the%20area%20were">admitted</a> intentionally not targeting the geographic areas where he thought I might go.&nbsp; Honey’s use of a server-side blacklist allows similar IP filtering and geofencing, as well as more targeted filtering such as always standing down for the specific IPs, cookies, and accounts that previously submitted complaints.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.brandverity.com/blog/395/affiliate-tactics-css-history-hack/">2010 blog</a> from affiliate trademark testers BrandVerity uncovered an anti-test strategy arguably even closer to what Honey is doing.&nbsp; In this period, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_sniffing">history sniffing vulnerabilities</a> let web sites see what other pages a user had visited: Set visited versus unvisited links to different colors, link to a variety of pages, and check the color of each link.&nbsp; BV’s perpetrator used this tactic to see whether a user had visited tools used by affiliate compliance staff (BV’s own login page, LinkShare’s dashboard and internal corporate email, and ad-buying dashboards for Google and Microsoft search ads).&nbsp; If a user had visited any of these tools, the perpetrator would not invoke its affiliate link—thereby avoiding revealing its prohibited behavior (trademark bidding) to users who were plainly affiliate marketing professionals.&nbsp; For other users, the affiliate bid on prohibited trademark terms and invoked affiliate links. &nbsp;Like Honey, this affiliate distinguished normal users from industry insiders based on prior URL visits.&nbsp; Of course Honey’s superior position, as a browser plugin, lets it directly read cookies without resorting to CSS history.&nbsp; But that only makes Honey worse.&nbsp; No one defended the affiliate BV caught, and I can’t envision anyone defending Honey’s tactic here.</p><p>In a slightly different world, it might be considered part of the rough-and-tumble world of commerce that Honey sometimes takes credit for referrals that others think should accrue to them.&nbsp; (In fact, that’s <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.441974/gov.uscourts.cand.441974.204.0.pdf">an argument Honey recently made</a> in litigation: “any harm [plaintiffs] may have experienced is traceable not to Honey but to the industry standard ‘last-click’ attribution rules.”)&nbsp; There, Honey squarely ignores network rules, which require Honey to stand down although MegaLag showed Honey does not.&nbsp; But if Honey just ignored network stand-down rules, brazenly, it could push the narrative that networks and merchants agreed since, admittedly, they didn’t stop Honey.&nbsp; By hiding, Honey instead reveals that they know their conduct is prohibited.&nbsp; When we see networks and merchants that didn’t ban Honey, the best interpretation (in light of Honey’s trickery) is not that they <em>approved</em> of Honey’s tactics, but rather that Honey’s concealment <em>prevented them from figuring out</em> what Honey was doing.&nbsp; And the effort Honey expended, to conceal its behavior from industry insiders, makes it particularly clear that Honey knew it would be in trouble if it was caught.&nbsp; Honey’s knowledge of misconduct is precisely opposite to its media response to MegaLag’s video, and equally opposite to its position in litigation.</p><p>Five years ago Amazon <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-honey-security-warning/">warned</a> shoppers that Honey was a “security risk.”&nbsp; At the time, I wrote this off as sour grapes—a business dispute between two goliaths.&nbsp; I agreed with Amazon’s bottom line that Honey was up to no good, but I thought the real problems with Honey were harm to other affiliates and harm to merchants’ marketing programs, not harms to security.&nbsp; With the passage of time, and revelation of Honey’s tactics including checking other companies’ cookies and hiding from testers, Amazon is vindicated.&nbsp; Notice Honey’s excessive permission—which includes letting Honey read users’ cookies at all sites.&nbsp; That’s well beyond what a shopping assistant truly needs, and it allows all manner of misconduct including, unfortunately, what I explain above.&nbsp; Security risk, indeed.&nbsp; Kudos to Amazon for getting this right from the outset.</p><p>At VPT, we <a href="https://vptdigital.com/shopping-plugins/">monitor shopping plugins</a> for abusive behavior.&nbsp; We hope shopping plugins will behave forthrightly—doing the same thing in our test lab that they do for users.&nbsp; But we don’t assume it, and we have multiple strategies to circumvent the techniques that bad actors use to trick those monitoring their methods.&nbsp; We constantly iterate on these approaches as we find new ways of concealment.&nbsp; And when we catch a shopping plugin hiding from us, we alert our clients not just to their misconduct but also to their concealment—an affirmative indication that this plugin can’t be trusted.&nbsp; We have scores of historic test runs showing misconduct by Honey in a variety of configurations, targeting dozens of merchants on all the big networks, including both low points and high points, with both screen-cap video and packet log evidence of Honey’s actions.&nbsp; We’re proud that we’ve been testing Honey’s misconduct <em>for years</em>.</p><h2>What comes next</h2><p>I’m looking forward to Honey’s response.&nbsp; Can Honey leaders offer a proper reason why their product behaves differently when under test, versus when used by normal users?&nbsp; I’m all ears.</p><p>Honey should expect skepticism from Google, operator of the Chrome Web Store.&nbsp; Google is likely to take a dim view of a Chrome plugin hiding from testers.&nbsp; Chrome Web Store <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/user-data-faq">requires</a> “developer transparency” and specifically bans “dishonest behavior.”&nbsp; Consider also Google’s <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/code-readability">prohibition on “conceal[ing] functionality”</a>.&nbsp; Here, Honey was hiding not from Google staff but from merchants and networks, but this still violates the plain language of Google’s policy as written.</p><p>Honey also distributes its Safari extension through the Apple App Store, requiring compliance with Apple Developer Program policies.&nbsp; Apple’s extension policies are less developed, yet Apple’s broader app review process is notoriously strict.&nbsp; Meanwhile Apple operates an affiliate marketing program, making it particularly natural for Apple to step into the shoes of merchants who were tricked by Honey’s concealment.&nbsp; I expect a tough sanction from Apple too.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69503243/in-re-paypal-honey-browser-extension-litigation/?page=1">class action litigation is ongoing</a> on behalf of publishers who lose marketing commissions when Honey didn’t stand down.&nbsp; Nothing in the docket indicates that Plaintiff’s counsel know the depths of Honey’s efforts to conceal its stand-down violations.&nbsp; With evidence that Honey was intentionally hiding from testers, Plaintiffs should be able to strengthen their allegations of both the underlying misconduct and Honey’s knowledge of wrongdoing.&nbsp; My analysis also promises to simplify other factual aspects of the litigation.&nbsp; The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.441974/gov.uscourts.cand.441974.161.0.pdf#page=34">consolidated class action complaint</a> discusses unpredictability of Honey’s standdown but doesn’t identify the factors that make Honey seem unpredictable—by all indications because plaintiffs (quite understandably) don’t know.&nbsp; Faced with unpredictability, plaintiffs resorted to monte carlo simulation to analyze the probability that Honey harmed a given publisher in a series of affiliate referrals.&nbsp; But with clarity on what’s really going on, there’s no need for statistical analysis, and the case gets correspondingly simpler.&nbsp; The court recently <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.441974/gov.uscourts.cand.441974.237.0.pdf">instructed plaintiffs to amend their complaint</a>, and surely counsel will emphasize Honey’s concealment in their next filing.</p><p>See also my <a href="https://vptdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/12/explainer.mp4" data-fancybox="">narrated explainer video</a>.</p><h2 id="testingmethods">Notes on hands-on testing methods</h2><p>Hands-on testing of the relevant scenarios presented immediate challenges.&nbsp; Most obviously, I needed to test what Honey would do if it had tens of thousands of points, valued at hundreds of dollars.&nbsp; But I didn’t want to make hundreds or thousands of dollars of test purchases through Honey.</p><p>To change the Honey client’s understanding of my points earned to date, I used Fiddler, a standard network forensics tool.&nbsp; I wrote a few lines of FiddlerScript to intercept messages between the Honey plug-in and the Honey server to report that I had however many points I wanted for a given test.&nbsp; Here’s my code, in case others want to test themselves:</p><pre>//buffer responses for communications to/from joinhoney.com
//buffer allows response revisions by Fiddler
static function OnBeforeRequest(oSession: Session) {
  if (oSession.fullUrl.Contains("joinhoney.com"))	{
    oSession.bBufferResponse = true;
  }
}

//rewrite Honey points response to indicate high values 
static function OnBeforeResponse(oSession: Session) {
  if (oSession.HostnameIs("d.joinhoney.com") &amp;&amp; oSession.PathAndQuery.Contains("ext_getUserPoints")){
	s = '{"data":{"getUsersPointsByUserId":{"pointsPendingDeposit":67667,"pointsAvailable":98765,"pointsPendingWithdrawal":11111,"pointsRedeemed":22222}}}';
    oSession.utilSetResponseBody(s);
  }
}</pre><p>This fall, VPT added this method, and variants of it, to our <a href="https://vptdigital.com/shopping-plugins/">automated monitoring of shopping plugins</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4794815683845431067" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>
I find myself in the unusual position of defending Bitcoin from its critics, if only reluctantly.</p><p>

In 2024 Soroush Farokhnia &amp; Amir Kafshdar Goharshady published <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/"><i>Options and Futures Imperil Bitcoin's Security</i></a> and:</p><blockquote>
showed that (i) a successful block-reverting attack does not necessarily require ... a majority of the hash power; (ii) obtaining a majority of the hash power ... costs roughly 6.77 billion ... and (iii) Bitcoin derivatives, i.e. options and futures, imperil Bitcoin’s security by creating an incentive for a block-reverting/majority attack. 
</blockquote>
<p>
It is worth noting that they are not talking about profiting from double-spending. The Bitcoin blockchain transacts around $17B/day of nominal value in around 450K transactions (average ~$38K), but in 2021 <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396">Igor Makarov &amp; Antoinette Schoar found that</a>:</p><blockquote>
90% of transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain is not tied to economically meaningful activities but is the byproduct of the Bitcoin protocol design as well as the preference of many participants for anonymity ... exchanges play a central role in the Bitcoin system. They explain 75% of real Bitcoin volume.

Of course, just because they aren't "economically meaningful" doesn't mean they aren't worth attacking! The average block has ~3.2K transactions, so ~$121.6M/block. As a check. $121.6M * 144 block/day = $17.5B. So to recover their cost for a 51% attack would require double-spending about 8 hours worth of transactions.</p><p>

I agree with their technical analysis of the attack, but I believe there would be significant difficulties in putting it into practice. Below the fold I try to set out these difficulties.<br>

<p>
First, I should point out that I wrote about using derivatives to profit from manipulating Bitcoin's price more than three years ago in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/07/pump-and-dump-schemes.html"><i>Pump-and-Dump Schemes</i></a>. These schemes have a long history in cryptocurrencies, but they are not the attack involved here. I don't claim expertise in derivatives trading, so it is possible my analysis is faulty. If so, please point out the problems in a comment.</p><h3>The Attack</h3><p>
Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady build on the 2018 work of Ittay Eyal &amp; Emin Gün Sirer in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3212998"><i>Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable</i></a>:</p><blockquote>
The key idea behind this strategy, called Selfish Mining, is for a pool to keep its discovered blocks private, thereby intentionally forking the chain. The honest nodes continue to mine on the public chain, while the pool mines on its own private branch. If the pool discovers more blocks, it develops a longer lead on the public chain, and continues to keep these new blocks private. When the public branch approaches the pool's private branch in length, the selfish miners reveal blocks from their private chain to the public.<br>
...<br>
We further show that the Bitcoin mining protocol will never be safe against attacks by a selfish mining pool that commands more than 1/3 of the total mining power of the network. Such a pool will always be able to collect mining rewards that exceed its proportion of mining power, even if it loses every single block race in the network. The resulting bound of 2/3 for the fraction of Bitcoin mining power that needs to follow the honest protocol to ensure that the protocol remains resistant to being gamed is substantially lower than the 50% figure currently assumed, and difficult to achieve in practice.
</blockquote><p>
In April 2024  Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">observed that</a>:</p><blockquote>
Given that the rule of thumb followed by most practitioners is to wait for 6 confirmations, a fork that goes 6 levels deep can very likely diminish the public’s trust in Bitcoin and cause a crash in its market price. It is also widely accepted that a prolonged majority attack (if it happens) would be catastrophic to the cryptocurrency and can cause its downfall.
</blockquote><p>
But, as they lay out, this possibility is <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">discounted</a>:</p><blockquote>
The conventional wisdom in the blockchain community is to assume that such block-reverting attacks are highly unlikely to happen. The reasoning goes as follows:<br>
<ol>
<li>Reverting multiple blocks and specifically double-spending a transaction that has 6 confirmations requires control of a majority of the mining power;</li>
<li>Having a majority of the mining power is prohibitively expensive and requires an outlandish investment in hardware;</li>
<li>Even if a miner, mining pool or group of pools does control a majority of the mining power, they have no incentive to act dishonestly and revert the blockchain, as that would crash the price of Bitcoin, which is ultimately not in their favor, since they rely on mining rewards denominated in BTC for their income.</li>
</ol>

Starting in late 2020, as shown in <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/the-most-powerful-people-in-crypto"><i>The Economist</i>'s graphic</a>, the spot market in Bitcoin became dwarfed by the derivatives markets. In the last month <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/futures/volume-of-bitcoin-futures-monthly">$1.7T</a> of Bitcoin futures traded on unregulated exchanges, and <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/options">$6.4B</a> on regulated exchanges. Compare this with the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/monthly/">$1.8B</a> of the spot market in the same month.</p><p>

These huge futures markets enable Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady's <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">attack</a>:</p><blockquote>
In short, an attacker can first use the Bitcoin derivatives market to short Bitcoin by purchasing a sufficient amount of put options or other equivalent financial instruments. She can then invest any of the amounts calculated above, depending on the timeline of the attack, to obtain the necessary hardware and hash power to perform the attack. If the attacker chooses to obtain a majority of the hash power, her success is guaranteed and she can revert the blocks as deeply as she wishes. However, she also has the option of a smaller upfront investment in hardware in exchange for longer wait times to achieve a high probability of success. In any case, as long as her earnings from shorting Bitcoin and then causing an intentional price crash outweighs her investments in hardware, there is a clear financial incentive to perform such an attack. The numbers above show that the annual trade volume in Bitcoin derivatives is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the required investment in hardware. Thus, it is possible and profitable to perform such an attack.
</blockquote>
<h3>Assumptions</h3><p>
Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady make some <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">simplifying assumptions</a>:</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We only consider the cost of hardware at the time of writing. We assume the attacker is buying the hardware, rather than renting it and do not consider potential discounts on bulk orders.</li>
<li>We ignore electricity costs as they vary widely based on location.</li>
</ul>
The justification for the first assumption is that it keeps our analysis sound, i.e. we can only over-approximate the cost by making this assumption. As for the second assumption, we note that electricity costs are often negligible in comparison to hardware costs and that our main argument, i.e. the vulnerability of Bitcoin to majority attacks and block-reverting attacks, remains intact even if the estimates we obtain here are doubled. Indeed, as we will soon see, the trade volume of Bitcoin derivatives is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the numbers obtained here.
</blockquote>
<h3>Goal</h3><p>
As Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady stress, the success of a block-reverting attack is probabilistic, so the attacker needs to have a high enough probability of making a large enough profit to make up for the risk of failure.</p><p>

My analysis thus assumes that the goal of the attacker is to have a 95% probability of earning at least double the cost of the attack.</p><h3>Attacker</h3><p>
There are two different kinds of attackers with different sets of difficulties:</p><ul>
<li><b>Outsiders:</b> someone who has to acquire or rent sufficient hash power.</li>
<li><b>Insiders:</b> someone or some mining pool who already controls sufficient hash power.</li>
</ul><p>
Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady study the outsider case. Both kinds of attacker's practical problems occur in two areas:</p><ul>
<li>Obtaining and maintaining for the duration of the attack sufficient hash power without detection.</li>
<li>Obtaining and maintaining for the duration of the attack a sufficient short position in Bitcoin without detection.</li>
</ul><p>
The short position must be maintained for the duration of the attack because succeess may come at any 10-minute block time, and there would not be time to obtain a large enough short position in ten minutes.</p><h3>Hash Power</h3><p>
The outsider's problems are more complex than the insider's.</p><h4>Outsider Attack</h4><p>
The outsider attacker requires three kinds of resource:</p><ul>
<li>Mining rigs.</li>
<li>Power to run the rigs.</li>
<li>Data center space to hold the rigs.</li>
</ul><p>
Each of these is problematic, but assuming that the difficulties could be overcome, there is then the question of what it would cost to run the attack..</p><h5>Mining rigs</h5>
<ul>
<li>Could they acquire mining rigs sufficient to provide 30% of the combined insider and outsider hash power, or ~43% of the pre-attack hash power?</li>
<li>How long would it take to acquire the rigs?</li>
<li>Would their acquisition of the rigs be detected?</li>
</ul><p>
Bitmain is estimated to have <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-cambridge-digital-mining-industry-report.pdf">82% of the market for mining rigs</a>, and they either control or have very close relations with <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=3320437">all the major mining pools</a>, who thus have priority access to the latest rigs. Because rigs <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">depreciate rapidly</a>, position in the queue for rigs has a big impact on the profitability  of mining. Bitmain is unlikely to give a new customer priority access to rigs.</p><p>

Because the economic life of mining rigs is <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">less than two years</a>, the first part of Bitmain's production goes into maintaining the hash rate by replacing obsolete rigs. The second part goes into increasing the hash rate.  If we assume that the outsider attacker could absorb the second part of Bitmain's production, how long would it take to get the necessary 43% of the previous hash power?</p><p>
This can be estimated by examining the <a href="https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty#3y">hash power through time graph</a>. Over the last 3 years the hash rate has increased from about 240EH/s to about 1120EH/s, or about 24EH/s/month. Roughly, 82% of this is Bitmain's output, or about 20EH/s/month. The attacker needs 43% of the current hash rate, or about 482EH/s, or 24 months of the second part of Bitmain's production. At the <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/asic-price-index">current price</a> for leading-edge rigs of $14.11/TH/s this would cost about $6.8B plus say $340M in interest at 5%, or $7.14B.</p><p>

The lack of rigs to increase the hash rate over a period of much less than two years would clearly be detectable.</p><h5>Power</h5><p>
The <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index</a>'s current estimate is that the network consumes 22GW. The outside attacker would need 43% of this, or about 9.5GW, for the duration of the attack. For context, Meta's extraordinarily aggressive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/">AI data center plans</a> claim to bring a single 1GW data center online in 2026, and the first 2GW phase of their planned $27B 5GW Louisiana data center in 2030. The constraint on the roll-out is largely that lack of access to sufficient power. The attacker would need double the power Meta's Louisiana data center plans to have in 2030.</p><p>

Access to gigawatts of power is available only on long-term contracts and only after significant delays.</p><h5>Data centers</h5>
<p>
Meta's 5GW Louisiana "Hyperion" data center's "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/">footprint will be large enough to cover most of Manhattan</a>", and the outsider attacker would need two of them. If Meta expects to take more than 5 years to build one of them, the outsider attacker is likely to need a decade.</p><p>

Estimates for AI data centers are that 60% of the capital cost is the hardware and 40% everything else. Thus the "everything else" for Meta's $27B 5GW data center is $10.8B. "Everything else" for the attacker's two similar data centers would thus be $21.6B. Plus say 5 years of interest at 5% or $5.4B.</p><h5>Operational cost</h5><p>
Ignoring the evident impossibility of the outsider attacker amassing the necessary mining rigs, power and data center space, what would the operational costs of the attack be?</p><p>

It is hard to estimate the costs for power, data center space, etc. But an estimate can be based upon the cost to rent hash power, noting that in practice renting 43% of the total would be impossible, and guessing that renters have a 30% margin. A typical rental fee would be $0.10/TH/day so the costs might be $0.07/TH/day. The attack would have a 95% probability of needing 482EH/s over 34 days or less, so $516M or less.</p><p>

Thus the estimated total cost for the hash power used in the attack would have a 95% probability of being no more than $7.66B. Plus about $27B in data center cost, which could presumably be repurposed to AI after the attack.</p><h4>Insider Attack</h4>
<p>
The insider attacker already controls the 30% of the hash power they need, so only the question of detection remains. The essence of the block-reverting attack is that the attacker mines in secret until they can publish a chain with 6 blocks following a target block. A reduction of 30% of the public hash rate over an average period of 17 days would clearly be detectable. The hash rate is noisy, but the graph shows that over the last year the largest drop was 16% from June 14<sup>th</sup> to 27<sup>th</sup>. There was one large drop in the hash rate, 51% between May 10<sup>th</sup> and July 1<sup>st</sup> 2021 as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/07/graphing-chinas-cryptocurrency-crackdown.html">China cracked down</a> on mining.</p><p>

The insider's loss of income from the blocks they would otherwise have mined would have a 95% probability of being 4,590 BTC or less, or about $425M.</p><h3>Short Position</h3><p>
Both kinds of attackers need to ensure that, when the attack succeeds, they have a large enough short position in Bitcoin that would generate their expected return from the attack's decrease in the Bitcoin price. There are two possibilities:</p><ul>
<li>When the attacker's chain is within one block of being the longest, they have ten minutes to purchase the shorts. There is unlikely to be enough liquidity in the market to accommodate this sudden demand, which in any case would greatly increase the price of the shorts. I will ignore this possibility in what follows.</li>
<li>At the start of the attack the attacker gradually accumulates sufficient shorts. Even assuming there were enough liquidity, and that the purchases didn't increase the price, the attacker has to bear both the cost of maintaining the shorts for the duration of the attack, and the risk of the market moving up enough to cause the position to be liquidated.</li>
</ul><p>
The success of a block-reverting attack on Bitcoin would have implications on other cryptocurrencies. It would likely increase the prices fo Proof-of-Stake coins such as Ethereum, as being much ore difficult to attack, and decrease the price of other Proof-of-Work coins. Derivatives on these coins might be included int he attacker's toolkit, but I will ignore this possibility as the open interest on these coins is smaller.</p><p>

Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">note that</a>:</p><blockquote>
At the time of writing, the open interest of BTC options is a bit more than 20 billion USD. Thus, a malicious party performing the attack mentioned in this work would need to obtain a considerable amount of the available put contracts. This may lead to market disruptions whose analysis is beyond the scope of this work. This being said, if the derivatives market continues to grow and becomes much larger than it currently is, purchasing this amount of contracts might not even be detected.
</blockquote><p>
There are two different kinds of market in which Bitcoin shorts are available:</p><ul>
<li><b>Regulated exchanges</b> such as the CME offering options on Bitcoin and stock exchanges with Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy.</li>
<li><b>Unregulated exchanges</b> such as Binance offering "perpetual futures" (perps) on Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unregulated Exchanges</h4><p>
Patrick McKenzie's <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/"><i>Perpetual futures, explained</i></a> is a clear and comprehensive description of the derivative common on unregulated exchanges:</p><blockquote>
Instead of all of a particular futures vintage settling on the same day, perps settle multiple times a day for a particular market on a particular exchange. The mechanism for this is the <i>funding rate</i>. At a high level: winners get paid by losers every e.g. 4 hours and then the game continues, unless you’ve been blown out due to becoming overleveraged or for other reasons (discussed in a moment).<p>

Consider a toy example: a retail user buys 0.1 Bitcoin via a perp. The price on their screen, which they understand to be for Bitcoin, might be $86,000 each, and so they might pay $8,600 cash. Should the price rise to $90,000 before the next settlement, they will get +/- $400 of winnings credited to their account, and their account will continue to reflect exposure to 0.1 units of Bitcoin via the perp. They might choose to sell their future at this point (or any other). They’ll have paid one commission (and a spread) to buy, one (of each) to sell, and perhaps they’ll leave the casino with their winnings, or perhaps they’ll play another game.</p><p>

Where did the money come from? Someone else was symmetrically short exposure to Bitcoin via a perp. It is, with some very important caveats incoming, a closed system: since no good or service is being produced except the speculation, winning money means someone else lost.
</p></blockquote><p>
So the exchange makes money from commissions, and from the spread against the actual spot price. The price of the perp is maintained close to the spot price by the "basis trade", traders providing liquidity by shorting the perp and buying the spot when the perp is above spot, and vice versa. Of course, the spot price itself may have been manipulated, for example by <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/07/pump-and-dump-schemes.html"><i>Pump-and-Dump Schemes</i></a>.</p><p>

How else does the exchange <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">make money</a>?</p><blockquote>
Perp funding rates also embed an interest rate component. This might get quoted as 3 bps a day, or 1 bps every eight hours, or similar. However, because of the impact of leverage, gamblers are paying more than you might expect: at 10X leverage that’s 30 bps a day.
</blockquote><p>
A "basis point (bps)" is "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp">one hundredth of 1 percentage point</a>", so 30bps/day is 0.3%/day or around 120%/year.  But the lure of leverage is the competitive advantage of <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">unregulated exchanges</a>:</p><blockquote>
In a standard U.S. brokerage account, Regulation T has, for almost 100 years now, set maximum leverage limits (by setting minimums for margins). These are 2X at position opening time and 4X “maintenance” (before one closes out the position). Your brokerage would be obligated to forcibly close your position if volatility causes you to exceed those limits.
</blockquote><p>
Unregulated markets <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/24757521817370">are different</a>:</p><blockquote>
Binance allows up to 125x leverage on BTC.
</blockquote><p>
Although these huge amounts of leverage greatly increase the reward from a small market movement in favor of the position, they greatly reduce the amount the market has to move against the position before something bad happens. The first bad thing is <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">liquidation</a>:</p><blockquote>
One reason perps are structurally better for exchanges and market makers is that they simplify the business of blowing out leveraged traders. The exact mechanics depend on the exchange, the amount, etc, but generally speaking you can either force the customer to enter a closing trade or you can assign their position to someone willing to bear the risk in return for a discount.<p>

Blowing out losing traders is lucrative for exchanges except when it catastrophically isn’t. It is a priced service in many places. The price is quoted to be low (“a nominal fee of 0.5%” is one way Binance describes it) but, since it is calculated from the amount at risk, it can be a large portion of the money lost. If the account’s negative balance is less than the liquidation fee, wonderful, thanks for playing and the exchange / “the insurance fund” keeps the rest, as a tip.
</p></blockquote><p>
The bigger and faster the market move, the more likely the loss exceeds your <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">collateral</a>:</p><blockquote>
In the case where the amount an account is negative by is more than the fee, that “insurance fund” can choose to pay the winners on behalf of the liquidated user, at management’s discretion. Management will <i>usually</i> decide to do this, because a casino with a reputation for not paying winners will not long remain a casino.<p>

But tail risk is a real thing. The capital efficiency <i>has a price</i>: there physically does not exist enough money in the system to pay all winners given sufficiently dramatic price moves. Forced liquidations happen. Sophisticated participants withdraw liquidity (for reasons we’ll soon discuss) or the exchange becomes overwhelmed technically / operationally. The forced liquidations eat through the diminished / unreplenished liquidity in the book, and the magnitude of the move increases.
</p></blockquote><p>
The second bad thing is <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">automatic de-leveraging (ADL)</a>:</p><blockquote>
Risk in perps has to be symmetric: if (accounting for leverage) there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure long, then there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure short. This does not imply that the shorts or longs are sufficiently capitalized to <i>actually pay</i> for all the exposure in all instances.<p>

In cases where management deems paying winners from the insurance fund would be too costly and/or impossible, they automatically deleverage some winners.
</p></blockquote><p>
McKenzie illustrates ADL with <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">an example</a>:</p><blockquote>
So perhaps you understood, prior to a 20% move, that you were 4X leveraged. You just earned 80%, right? Ah, except you were only 2X leveraged, so you earned 40%. Why were you <i>retroactively</i> only 2X? That’s what automatic deleveraging means. Why couldn’t you get the other 40% you feel entitled to? Because the collective group of losers doesn’t have enough to pay you your winnings and the insurance fund was insufficient or deemed insufficient by management.
</blockquote><p>
For our purposes, this is an <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">important note</a>:</p><blockquote>
In theory, this can happen to the upside or the downside. <i>In practice</i> in crypto, this seems to usually happen after sharp decreases in prices, not sharp increases. For example, October 2025 saw widespread ADLing as (more than) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-22/crypto-s-brutal-month-triggers-a-stress-test-for-wall-street">$19 billion of liquidations</a> happened, across a variety of assets.
</blockquote><p>
How does this affect the outsider attacker? Lets assume that the attack has a 95% probability of costing no more than $7.5B and would reduce the Bitcoin price from $100K to $80K in a single 4-hour period. With 10X leverage this would generate $200K/BTC in gains.</p><p>
The outsider wants to double the cost of the attack, so needs to short $15B/$180K BTC, or 83,333BTC at 10X leverage for the duration of the attack. Establishing the position costs $8.333B. Assuming the BTC price is fixed at $100K until the attack succeeds the funding rate is zero. But we have to assume that the attacker borrowed the $8.333B for the duration, so would pay interest, plus two commissions plus two spreads. I'll ignore these costs.</p><p>
I will also ignore the fact that $83B is around 148% of the peak aggregated open interest in Bitcoin options over the past year of about $56B.</p><p>

The way liquidation of a short works is that as the market moves up, the initial leverage increases. Each exchange will have a limit on the leverage it will allow so, allowing for the liquidation fee, if the leverage of the short position gets to this limit the exchange will liquidate it.</p><table>
<thead>
  <tr><td>Move %</td><td>Leverage</td></tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr><td>0</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>11.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>12.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>14.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>16.7</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>25</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>33.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>100</td></tr>
</tbody></table><p>
The table shows the effect of increasing percentage moves against an initial 10X leveraged short. If we assume a short with an initial 10X leverage and an exchange limit of 50X was taken out on the first of each month of 2025, on 9 of the 12 months it would have been liquidated before the month was out. So Bitcoin is volatile enough that the attacker's short has a high probability of being liquidated before the attack succeeds.  And note Binance's "nominal fee" of 0.5% for liquidating $83.33B, or $417M.</p><p>

In the unlikely event that the attack succeeds early enough to avoid liquidation there would have been one of those "sharp decreases in prices" that cause ADL, so as a huge winner it would be essentially certain that the attacker would suffer ADL and most of the winnings needed to justify the attack would evaporate.</p><h4>Regulated Exchanges</h4><p>
The peak open interest in Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the past year was less than $20B, so even if we add together both kinds of exchange, the peak open interest over the last year isn't enough for the attacker.
</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>
Neither an outsider nor an insider attack appears feasible.</p><h4>Outsider Attack</h4><p>
An outsider attack seems infeasible because in practice:</p><ul>
<li>They could not acquire 43% or more  of the hash power.</li>
<li>Even if they could it would take so long as to make detection inevitable.</li>
<li>Even if they could and they were not detected, the high cost of the rigs makes the necessary shorts large relative to the open interest, and expensive to maintain.</li>
<li>These large shorts would need to be leveraged perpetual futures, bringing significant risks of loss of collateral through liquidation, and of the potential payoff being reduced through automatic de-leveraging.</li>
<li>The attacker would need more than the peak aggregate open interest in Bitcoin futures over the past year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Insider Attack</h4><p>
The order-of-magnitude lower direct cost of an insider attack makes it appear less infeasible, but insiders have to consider the impact on their continuing mining business. If the assumed 20% drop in the Bitcoin price were sustained for a year, the cost to the miner controlling 30% of the hash rate would be about 15,750 BTC or nearly $1.5B making the total cost of the attack (excluding the cost of carrying the shorts) almost $2B.</p><p>
The drop in Bitcoin's price and the smaller, lagging <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">drop in network difficulty</a> over the last three months has decreased miners' revenue by about 25%. In the medium term a further drop is in prospect.  Sometime in April 2028 the regular Bitcoin halvening will occur, halving the income of miners in aggregate Bitcoin terms.</p><p>
These drops turn the insiders' access to data center space and power into a double-edged sword because, as Vicky Ge Huang explains in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/bitcoin-miners-thrive-off-a-new-side-hustle-retooling-their-data-centers-for-ai-bdc408a9"><i>Bitcoin Miners Thrive Off a New Side Hustle: Retooling Their Data Centers for AI</i></a>:</p><blockquote>
mining-company stocks are still flying, even with cryptocurrency prices in retreat. That's because these firms have something in common with the hottest investment theme on the planet: the massive, electricity-hungry data centers expected to power the artificial-intelligence boom. Some companies are figuring out how to remake themselves as vital suppliers to Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and other "hyperscalers" bent on AI dominance.<br>
...<br>
Miners often have to build new, specialized facilities, because running AI requires more-advanced cooling and network systems, as well as replacing bitcoin-mining computers with AI-focused graphics processing units. But signing deals with miners allows AI giants to expand faster and cheaper than starting new facilities from scratch.<br>
...<br>
Shares of Core Scientific quadrupled in 2024 after the company signed its first AI contract that February. The stock has gained 10% this year. The company now expects to exit bitcoin mining entirely by 2028.
</blockquote><p>
I wonder why the date is 2028! As profit-driven miners use their bouyant stock price to fund a <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">pivot to AI</a> the hash rate and the network difficuty will decrease, making an insider attack less infeasible. The drop in their customer's income will likely encourage Bitmain to similarly pivot to AI, devoting an increasing proportion of their wafers to AI chips, especially given the Chinese government's goal of localizing AI.</p><p>

 A 30% miner whose rigs were fully depreciated might consider an insider attack shortly before the halvening as a viable exit strategy, since their future earnings from mining would be greatly reduced. But they would still be detected.</p><h3>Counter-measures</h3><p>
Even if we assume the feasibility of both the hash rate and the short position aspects of the attack, it is still the case that for example, an attack with 30% of the hash power and a 95% probability of success will, on average, last 17 days.  it seems very unlikely that the coincidence over an extended period of a large reduction in the expected hash rate and a huge increase in short interest would escape attention from Bitcoin HODl-ers, miners and exchanges, not to mention Bitmain. What counter-measures could they employ?</p><p>
The theoretically correct counter-measure would be to raise the 6-block finality criterion to the 24 blocks that corresponds to a pool with 30% of the hash power. But this would violate what people incorrectly believe is the revealed word of Satoshi. And Goharshady correctly pointed out in email that this is in any case impractical:</p><ul>
<li>The 6-block rule is just a convention, there is no dial that can be turned.</li>
<li>Much of the access to the Bitcoin blockchain is via APIs that typically have the 6-block rule hard-codded in.</li>
<li>Many, typically low-value, transactions do not wait for even a single confirmation.</li>
<li>Even it were possible, changing from a one-hour to a four-hour confirmation would have significant negative impacts on the Bitcoin ecosystem.</li>
</ul><p>
In the case of an insider attack, the absence of a pool previously mining around one in three of all blocks would readily de-anonymize the attacker. Bitmain would necessarily be aware of the identity of an outside attacker. Although unregulated exchanges are notoriously poor at KYC/AML, the sums involved in the shorts are so large that they would be highly motivated to use the blockchain information to de-anonymize the attacker. Given their terms of service, and the lack of effective recourse, they would be able to ham-string the attack.</p><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The rise of AI agents is transforming how software can be built. The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations. Our results shed light on the value of software development best practices in effective use of agents, suggest the kinds of tasks for which agents may be suitable, and point towards future opportunities for better agentic interfaces and agentic use guidelines.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Last week, I updated our pricing limits. One JSON file. The backend started enforcing the new caps, the frontend displayed them correctly, the marketing site showed them on the pricing page, and our docs reflected the change—all from a single commit.</p>
<p>No sync issues. No "wait, which repo has the current pricing?" No deploy coordination across three teams. Just one change, everywhere, instantly.</p>
<p>At Kasava, our entire platform lives in a single repository. Not just the code—<em>everything</em>:</p>

<h2>Why This Matters: AI-Native Development</h2>
<p>This isn't about abstract philosophies on design patterns for 'how we should work.' It's about velocity in an era where products change fast and context matters.</p>
<p>AI is all about context. And this monorepo <strong>is</strong> our company—not just the product.</p>
<p>When our AI tools help us write documentation, they have immediate access to the actual code being documented. When we update our marketing website, the AI can verify claims against the real implementation. When we write blog posts like this one, the AI can fact-check every code example, every number, every architectural claim against the source of truth.</p>
<p><strong>This means we move faster</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation updates faster</strong> because the AI sees code changes and suggests doc updates in the same context</li>
<li><strong>Website updates faster</strong> because pricing, features, and capabilities are pulled from the same config files that power the app</li>
<li><strong>Blog posts ship faster</strong> because the AI can run self-referential checks—validating that our "5,470+ TypeScript files" claim is accurate by actually counting them</li>
<li><strong>Nothing goes out of sync</strong> because there's only one source of truth, and AI has access to all of it</li>
</ul>
<p>When you ask Claude to "update the pricing page to reflect the new limits," it can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the backend service that enforces limits</li>
<li>Check the frontend that displays them</li>
<li>Update the marketing site</li>
<li>Verify the docs are consistent</li>
<li>Flag any blog posts that might mention outdated numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>All in one conversation. All in one repository.</p>
<p>This is what "AI-native development" actually means: structuring your work so AI can be maximally helpful, not fighting against fragmentation.</p>
<p><strong>And it reinforces a shipping culture.</strong></p>
<p>Everything-as-code means everything ships the same way: <code>git push</code>. Want to update the website pricing page? <code>git push</code>. New blog post ready to go live? <code>git push</code>. Fix a typo in the docs? <code>git push</code>. Deploy a backend feature? <code>git push</code>.</p>
<p>No separate CMSs to log into. No WordPress admin panels. No waiting for marketing tools to sync. No "can someone with Contentful access update this?" The same Git workflow that ships code also ships content, documentation, and marketing. Everyone on the team can ship anything, and it all goes through the same review process, the same CI/CD, the same audit trail.</p>
<p>This uniformity removes friction and removes excuses. Shipping becomes muscle memory.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Everything in One Repo?</h2>
<h3>1. Atomic Changes Across Boundaries (That AI Can Understand)</h3>
<p>When a backend API changes, the frontend type definitions update in the same commit. When we add a new feature, the documentation can ship alongside it. No version mismatches. No "which version of the API does this frontend need?"</p>
<p><strong>AI can see and validate the entire change in context</strong>.</p>
<p>When we ask Claude to add a feature, it doesn't just write backend code. It sees the frontend that will consume it, the docs that need updating, and the marketing site that might reference it. All in one view. All in one conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Real example from our codebase—adding Asana integration:</strong></p>
<pre><code>commit: "feat: add Asana integration"
├── backend/src/services/AsanaService.ts
├── backend/src/routes/api/integrations/asana.ts
├── frontend/src/components/integrations/asana/
├── frontend/src/app/integrations/asana/
├── docs/integrations/asana.mdx
└── website/src/app/integrations/page.tsx
</code></pre>
<p>One PR. One review. One merge. Everything ships together.</p>
<p><strong>Another example—keeping pricing in sync:</strong></p>
<p>We have a single <code>billing-plans.json</code> that defines all plan limits and features:</p>
<pre><code><span>// frontend/src/config/billing-plans.json (also copied to website/src/config/)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"plans"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"free"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>"limits"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>"repositories"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>"aiChatMessagesPerDay"</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"starter"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"limits"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>"repositories"</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>"aiChatMessagesPerDay"</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"professional"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"limits"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>"repositories"</span><span>:</span> <span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>"aiChatMessagesPerDay"</span><span>:</span> <span>1000</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The backend enforces these limits. The frontend displays them in settings. The marketing website shows them on the pricing page. When we change a limit, one JSON update propagates everywhere—no "the website says 50 repos but the app shows 25" bugs.</p>
<p><strong>And AI validates all of it.</strong> When we update <code>billing-plans.json</code>, we can ask Claude to verify that the backend, frontend, and website are all consistent. It reads all three implementations and confirms they match—or tells us what needs fixing.</p>
<h3>2. Cross-Project Refactoring</h3>
<p>Renaming a function? Your IDE finds all usages across frontend, backend, docs examples, and blog code snippets. One find-and-replace. One commit.</p>
<h3>3. Single Source of Truth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: Shared tooling configured once</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD</strong>: One pipeline to understand</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: Find anything with one <code>grep</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, even blog posts are code. They're Markdown files with frontmatter, versioned in Git, reviewed in PRs. Email templates are MJML that version controls our entire customer communication system.</p>
<p>Even our investor deck is code — a Next.js 16 static site with 17 React slide components, keyboard navigation, and PDF export. No PowerPoint, no Google Slides. When we update metrics or messaging, it's a code change with full Git history, reviewed in a PR, and deployed with <code>git push</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing can update copy without engineering</li>
<li>Changes are reviewed and tracked</li>
<li>Rollback is one <code>git revert</code> away</li>
<li>Email campaigns are testable and diffable</li>
</ul>

<p>Public docs deploy automatically when we push. Internal docs are searchable alongside code—when someone asks "how does the queue work?", they find the actual architecture document, not a stale wiki page.</p>
<h3>External Services</h3>

</code></pre>
<p>These deploy to completely different platforms (Chrome Web Store, Google Apps Script, GCP) but live together because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They share API contracts with the main app</li>
<li>Changes often span boundaries</li>
<li>One team maintains everything</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development Infrastructure</h3>
<pre><code>github-simulator/              # Mock GitHub API for local dev
infra-tester/                  # Integration test harness
scripts/
├── google-cloud/             # GCP deployment scripts
├── test-credentials.ts       # Credential testing
└── test-webhook-integration.ts
</code></pre>
<p>Local development shouldn't require external services. Mock servers live with the code they simulate.</p>

<h2>How We Make It Work</h2>
<h3>No Workspaces (And That's Fine)</h3>
<p>We deliberately don't use npm/yarn workspaces. (Well, we do in <em>one</em> specific use case but that's for another post.) Each directory is its own independent npm project:</p>
<pre><code><span>cd</span> frontend &amp;&amp; npm install    <span># Frontend dependencies</span>
<span>cd</span> backend &amp;&amp; npm install     <span># Backend dependencies</span>
<span>cd</span> external/chrome-extension &amp;&amp; npm install  <span># Extension dependencies</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Why? Simplicity. No hoisting confusion. No "which version of React am I actually getting?" Each project is isolated and predictable.</p>
<h3>Selective CI/CD</h3>
<p>We run 5 GitHub Actions workflows, each triggered by specific paths:</p>
<pre><code><span># .github/workflows/frontend-tests.yml</span>
<span>name:</span> <span>Frontend</span> <span>Tests</span>
<span>on:</span>
  <span>push:</span>
    <span>paths:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>"frontend/**"</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>".github/workflows/frontend-tests.yml"</span>
<span># Runs: type-check, lint, demo data validation, tests with coverage</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span># .github/workflows/backend-tests.yml</span>
<span>name:</span> <span>Backend</span> <span>Tests</span>
<span>on:</span>
  <span>push:</span>
    <span>paths:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>"backend/**"</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>".github/workflows/backend-tests.yml"</span>
<span># Runs: unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span># .github/workflows/tree-sitter-tests.yml</span>
<span>name:</span> <span>Tree-sitter</span> <span>Tests</span>
<span>on:</span>
  <span>push:</span>
    <span>paths:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>"external/google-cloud-functions/tree-sitter-service/**"</span>
<span># Runs: parsing tests for all 10+ supported languages</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Change the Chrome extension? Only relevant tests run. Update the backend? Backend tests plus any integration tests that depend on it.</p>
<h3>The CLAUDE.md Convention</h3>
<p>Every major directory has a CLAUDE.md file that documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>What this code does</li>
<li>Tech stack and versions</li>
<li>Quick start commands</li>
<li>Architecture decisions</li>
<li>Common patterns</li>

<p>This isn't just for humans—AI coding assistants read these files. When Claude Code works on our frontend, it reads <code>frontend/CLAUDE.md</code> and knows we're using Next.js 15 with React 19, npm (not pnpm), and specific patterns.</p>
<h3>Consistent Tooling</h3>
<p>One configuration, everywhere:</p>
<pre><code>.prettierrc              # Formatting (all JS/TS)
.eslintrc               # Linting (shared rules)
tsconfig.json           # TypeScript base config
</code></pre>
<p>New developer? <code>npm install</code> in the directory you're working on. Everything works.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Challenges (And How We Handle Them)</h2>
<h3>Challenge: Repository Size</h3>
<p><strong>Why it's not a problem (yet):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clone time: ~20 seconds</li>
<li>Git operations: still snappy</li>
<li>We haven't needed sparse checkout, LFS, or shallow clones</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When we might need to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large binary assets would go to R2/S3, not git</li>
<li>If we hit 1GB+, we'd look at shallow clones for CI</li>
<li>Truly independent services could be extracted</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenge: Build Times</h3>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: If everything is connected, does everything rebuild?</p>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: No. Each project builds independently:</p>
<pre><code><span># Frontend build (only rebuilds frontend)</span>
<span>cd</span> frontend &amp;&amp; npm run build

<span># Backend build (only rebuilds backend)</span>
<span>cd</span> backend &amp;&amp; npm run build

<span># Extension build (only rebuilds extension)</span>
<span>cd</span> external/chrome-extension &amp;&amp; npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>We use Turbopack for frontend dev (fast HMR), Wrangler for backend dev (fast reload), and WXT for extension dev (fast rebuild).</p>
<h3>Challenge: Permission Boundaries</h3>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Not everyone should see everything.</p>
<p><strong>Our situation</strong>: We're a small team. Everyone can see everything. That's a feature, not a bug—it enables cross-pollination.</p>
<p><strong>If we grew and needed boundaries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub CODEOWNERS for review requirements</li>
<li>Branch protection rules</li>
<li>Potentially split truly sensitive codebases (but we'd resist this)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenge: Context Switching</h3>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Jumping between TypeScript (frontend), TypeScript (backend), Apps Script (Google add-on), and MJML (emails) feels disorienting.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent patterns across projects (same linting, same formatting)</li>
<li>CLAUDE.md files explain context immediately</li>
<li>IDE workspace configurations</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our monorepo isn't about following a trend. It's about removing friction between things that naturally belong together, something that is critical when related context is everything.</p>
<p>When a feature touches the backend API, the frontend component, the documentation, and the marketing site—why should that be four repositories, four PRs, four merge coordination meetings?</p>
<p>The monorepo isn't a constraint. It's a force multiplier.</p>
