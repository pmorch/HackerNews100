<p>It’s an exciting time to build with large language models (LLMs). Over the past year, LLMs have become “good enough” for real-world applications. The pace of improvements in LLMs, coupled with a parade of demos on social media, will fuel an estimated $200B investment in AI by 2025. LLMs are also broadly accessible, allowing everyone, not just ML engineers and scientists, to build intelligence into their products. While the barrier to entry for building AI products has been lowered, creating those effective beyond a demo remains a deceptively difficult endeavor.</p>



<p>We’ve identified some crucial, yet often neglected, lessons and methodologies informed by machine learning that are essential for developing products based on LLMs. Awareness of these concepts can give you a competitive advantage against most others in the field without requiring ML expertise! Over the past year, the six of us have been building real-world applications on top of LLMs. We realized that there was a need to distill these lessons in one place for the benefit of the community.</p>



<p>We come from a variety of backgrounds and serve in different roles, but we’ve all experienced firsthand the challenges that come with using this new technology. Two of us are independent consultants who’ve helped numerous clients take LLM projects from initial concept to successful product, seeing the patterns determining success or failure. One of us is a researcher studying how ML/AI teams work and how to improve their workflows. Two of us are leaders on applied AI teams: one at a tech giant and one at a startup. Finally, one of us has taught deep learning to thousands and now works on making AI tooling and infrastructure easier to use. Despite our different experiences, we were struck by the consistent themes in the lessons we’ve learned, and we’re surprised that these insights aren’t more widely discussed.</p>



<p>Our goal is to make this a practical guide to building successful products around LLMs, drawing from our own experiences and pointing to examples from around the industry. We’ve spent the past year getting our hands dirty and gaining valuable lessons, often the hard way. While we don’t claim to speak for the entire industry, here we share some advice and lessons for anyone building products with LLMs.</p>



<p>This work is organized into three sections: tactical, operational, and strategic. This is the first of three pieces. It dives into the tactical nuts and bolts of working with LLMs. We share best practices and common pitfalls around prompting, setting up retrieval-augmented generation, applying flow engineering, and evaluation and monitoring. Whether you’re a practitioner building with LLMs or a hacker working on weekend projects, this section was written for you. Look out for the operational and strategic sections in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>Ready to <s>dive</s> delve in? Let’s go.</p>



<h2><strong>Tactical</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we share best practices for the core components of the emerging LLM stack: prompting tips to improve quality and reliability, evaluation strategies to assess output, retrieval-augmented generation ideas to improve grounding, and more. We also explore how to design human-in-the-loop workflows. While the technology is still rapidly developing, we hope these lessons, the by-product of countless experiments we’ve collectively run, will stand the test of time and help you build and ship robust LLM applications.</p>



<h3><strong>Prompting</strong></h3>



<p>We recommend starting with prompting when developing new applications. It’s easy to both underestimate <em>and</em> overestimate its importance. It’s underestimated because the right prompting techniques, when used correctly, can get us very far. It’s overestimated because even prompt-based applications require significant engineering around the prompt to work well.</p>



<h4><strong>Focus on getting the most out of fundamental prompting techniques</strong></h4>



<p>A few prompting techniques have consistently helped improve performance across various models and tasks: n-shot prompts + in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and providing relevant resources.</p>



<p>The idea of in-context learning via n-shot prompts is to provide the LLM with a few examples that demonstrate the task and align outputs to our expectations. A few tips: </p>



<ul><li>If n is too low, the model may over-anchor on those specific examples, hurting its ability to generalize. As a rule of thumb, aim for n ≥ 5. Don’t be afraid to go as high as a few dozen.</li><li>Examples should be representative of the expected input distribution. If you’re building a movie summarizer, include samples from different genres in roughly the proportion you expect to see in practice.</li><li>You don’t necessarily need to provide the full input-output pairs. In many cases, examples of desired outputs are sufficient.</li><li>If you are using an LLM that supports tool use, your n-shot examples should also use the tools you want the agent to use.</li></ul>



<p>In chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, we encourage the LLM to explain its thought process before returning the final answer. Think of it as providing the LLM with a sketchpad so it doesn’t have to do it all in memory. The original approach was to simply add the phrase “Let’s think step-by-step” as part of the instructions. However, we’ve found it helpful to make the CoT more specific, where adding specificity via an extra sentence or two often reduces hallucination rates significantly. For example, when asking an LLM to summarize a meeting transcript, we can be explicit about the steps, such as:</p>



<ul><li>First, list the key decisions, follow-up items, and associated owners in a sketchpad.</li><li>Then, check that the details in the sketchpad are factually consistent with the transcript.</li><li>Finally, synthesize the key points into a concise summary.</li></ul>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">some doubt</a> has been cast on whether this technique is as powerful as believed. Additionally, there’s significant debate about exactly what happens during inference when chain-of-thought is used. Regardless, this technique is one to experiment with when possible.</p>



<p>Providing relevant resources is a powerful mechanism to expand the model’s knowledge base, reduce hallucinations, and increase the user’s trust. Often accomplished via retrieval augmented generation (RAG), providing the model with snippets of text that it can directly utilize in its response is an essential technique. When providing the relevant resources, it’s not enough to merely include them; don’t forget to tell the model to prioritize their use, refer to them directly, and sometimes to mention when none of the resources are sufficient. These help “ground” agent responses to a corpus of resources. </p>



<h4><strong>Structure your inputs and outputs</strong></h4>



<p>Structured input and output help models better understand the input as well as return output that can reliably integrate with downstream systems. Adding serialization formatting to your inputs can help provide more clues to the model as to the relationships between tokens in the context, additional metadata to specific tokens (like types), or relate the request to similar examples in the model’s training data. </p>



<p>As an example, many questions on the internet about writing SQL begin by specifying the SQL schema. Thus, you may expect that effective prompting for Text-to-SQL should include structured schema definitions; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371223615_SQL-PaLM_Improved_Large_Language_ModelAdaptation_for_Text-to-SQL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="indeed (opens in a new tab)">indeed</a>.</p>



<p>Structured output serves a similar purpose, but it also simplifies integration into downstream components of your system. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instructor (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/jxnl/instructor" target="_blank">Instructor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Outlines</a> work well for structured output. (If you’re importing an LLM API SDK, use Instructor; if you’re importing Huggingface for a self-hosted model, use Outlines.) Structured input expresses tasks clearly and resembles how the training data is formatted, increasing the probability of better output.</p>



<p>When using structured input, be aware that each LLM family has their own preferences. Claude prefers <code>xml</code> while GPT favors Markdown and JSON. With XML, you can even pre-fill Claude’s responses by providing a <code>response</code> tag like so.</p>



<pre>                                                     <code>&lt;/&gt; python
messages=[     
    {         
        "role": "user",         
        "content": """Extract the &lt;name&gt;, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;price&gt;, and &lt;color&gt; </code>
                   <code>from this product description into your &lt;response&gt;.   
                &lt;description&gt;The SmartHome Mini </code>

   },     
   {         
        "role": "assistant",         
        "content": "&lt;response&gt;&lt;name&gt;"     
   } 
]</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Have small prompts that do one thing, and only one thing, well</strong></h4>



<p>A common anti-pattern/code smell in software is the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="God Object (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object" target="_blank">God Object</a>,” where we have a single class or function that does everything. The same applies to prompts too.</p>



<p>A prompt typically starts simple: A few sentences of instruction, a couple of examples, and we’re good to go. But as we try to improve performance and handle more edge cases, complexity creeps in. More instructions. Multi-step reasoning. Dozens of examples. Before we know it, our initially simple prompt is now a 2,000 token frankenstein. And to add injury to insult, it has worse performance on the more common and straightforward inputs! GoDaddy shared this challenge as their <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/llm-from-the-trenches-10-lessons-learned-operationalizing-models-at-godaddy#h-1-sometimes-one-prompt-isn-t-enough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="No. 1 lesson from building with LLMs (opens in a new tab)">No. 1 lesson from building with LLMs</a>.</p>



<p>Just like how we strive (read: struggle) to keep our systems and code simple, so should we for our prompts. Instead of having a single, catch-all prompt for the meeting transcript summarizer, we can break it into steps to:</p>



<ul><li>Extract key decisions, action items, and owners into structured format</li><li>Check extracted details against the original transcription for consistency</li><li>Generate a concise summary from the structured details</li></ul>



<p>As a result, we’ve split our single prompt into multiple prompts that are each simple, focused, and easy to understand. And by breaking them up, we can now iterate and eval each prompt individually.</p>



<h4><strong>Craft your context tokens</strong></h4>



<p>Rethink, and challenge your assumptions about how much context you actually need to send to the agent. Be like Michaelangelo, do not build up your context sculpture—chisel away the superfluous material until the sculpture is revealed. RAG is a popular way to collate all of the potentially relevant blocks of marble, but what are you doing to extract what’s necessary?</p>



<p>We’ve found that taking the final prompt sent to the model—with all of the context construction, and meta-prompting, and RAG results—putting it on a blank page and just reading it, really helps you rethink your context. We have found redundancy, self-contradictory language, and poor formatting using this method. </p>



<p>The other key optimization is the structure of your context. Your bag-of-docs representation isn’t helpful for humans, don’t assume it’s any good for agents. Think carefully about how you structure your context to underscore the relationships between parts of it, and make extraction as simple as possible.</p>



<h3><strong>Information Retrieval/RAG</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond prompting, another effective way to steer an LLM is by providing knowledge as part of the prompt. This grounds the LLM on the provided context which is then used for in-context learning. This is known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Practitioners have found RAG effective at providing knowledge and improving output, while requiring far less effort and cost compared to finetuning.RAG is only as good as the retrieved documents’ relevance, density, and detail</p>



<h4><strong>The quality of your RAG’s output is dependent on the quality of retrieved documents, which in turn can be considered along a few factors.</strong></h4>



<p>The first and most obvious metric is relevance. This is typically quantified via ranking metrics such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank" target="_blank">Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) (opens in a new tab)">Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)</a>. MRR evaluates how well a system places the first relevant result in a ranked list while NDCG considers the relevance of all the results and their positions. They measure how good the system is at ranking relevant documents higher and irrelevant documents lower. For example, if we’re retrieving user summaries to generate movie review summaries, we’ll want to rank reviews for the specific movie higher while excluding reviews for other movies.</p>



<p>Like traditional recommendation systems, the rank of retrieved items will have a significant impact on how the LLM performs on downstream tasks. To measure the impact, run a RAG-based task but with the retrieved items shuffled—how does the RAG output perform?</p>



<p>Second, we also want to consider information density. If two documents are equally relevant, we should prefer one that’s more concise and has lesser extraneous details. Returning to our movie example, we might consider the movie transcript and all user reviews to be relevant in a broad sense. Nonetheless, the top-rated reviews and editorial reviews will likely be more dense in information.</p>



<p>Finally, consider the level of detail provided in the document. Imagine we’re building a RAG system to generate SQL queries from natural language. We could simply provide table schemas with column names as context. But, what if we include column descriptions and some representative values? The additional detail could help the LLM better understand the semantics of the table and thus generate more correct SQL.</p>



<h4><strong>Don’t forget keyword search; use it as a baseline and in hybrid search.</strong></h4>



<p>Given how prevalent the embedding-based RAG demo is, it’s easy to forget or overlook the decades of research and solutions in information retrieval.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, while embeddings are undoubtedly a powerful tool, they are not the be all and end all. First, while they excel at capturing high-level semantic similarity, they may struggle with more specific, keyword-based queries, like when users search for names (e.g., Ilya), acronyms (e.g., RAG), or IDs (e.g., claude-3-sonnet). Keyword-based search, such as BM25, are explicitly designed for this. And after years of keyword-based search, users have likely taken it for granted and may get frustrated if the document they expect to retrieve isn’t being returned. </p>



<blockquote><p>Vector embeddings <em>do not</em> magically solve search. In fact, the heavy lifting is in the step before you re-rank with semantic similarity search. Making a genuine improvement over BM25 or full-text search is hard. </p><cite>— <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1737886080555446552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Aravind Srinivas, CEO Perplexity.ai</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We’ve been communicating this to our customers and partners for months now. Nearest Neighbor Search with naive embeddings yields very noisy results and you’re likely better off starting with a keyword-based approach.</p><cite>— <a href="https://twitter.com/beyang/status/1767330006999720318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Beyang Liu, CTO Sourcegraph</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Second, it’s more straightforward to understand why a document was retrieved with keyword search—we can look at the keywords that match the query. In contrast, embedding-based retrieval is less interpretable. Finally, thanks to systems like Lucene and OpenSearch that have been optimized and battle-tested over decades, keyword search is usually more computationally efficient.</p>



<p>In most cases, a hybrid will work best: keyword matching for the obvious matches, and embeddings for synonyms, hypernyms, and spelling errors, as well as multimodality (e.g., images and text). <a href="https://www.shortwave.com/blog/deep-dive-into-worlds-smartest-email-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Shortwave shared how they built their RAG pipeline (opens in a new tab)">Shortwave shared how they built their RAG pipeline</a>, including query rewriting, keyword + embedding retrieval, and ranking.</p>



<h4><strong>Prefer RAG over fine-tuning for new knowledge</strong></h4>



<p>Both RAG and fine-tuning can be used to incorporate new information into LLMs and increase performance on specific tasks. Thus, which should we try first?</p>



<p>Recent research suggests that RAG may have an edge. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="One study (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05934" target="_blank">One study</a> compared RAG against unsupervised fine-tuning (a.k.a. continued pre-training), evaluating both on a subset of MMLU and current events. They found that RAG consistently outperformed fine-tuning for knowledge encountered during training as well as entirely new knowledge. In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="another paper (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08406" target="_blank">another paper</a>, they compared RAG against supervised fine-tuning on an agricultural dataset. Similarly, the performance boost from RAG was greater than fine-tuning, especially for GPT-4 (see Table 20 of the paper).</p>



<p>Beyond improved performance, RAG comes with several practical advantages too. First, compared to continuous pretraining or fine-tuning, it’s easier—and cheaper!—to keep retrieval indices up-to-date. Second, if our retrieval indices have problematic documents that contain toxic or biased content, we can easily drop or modify the offending documents.</p>



<p>In addition, the R in RAG provides finer grained control over how we retrieve documents. For example, if we’re hosting a RAG system for multiple organizations, by partitioning the retrieval indices, we can ensure that each organization can only retrieve documents from their own index. This ensures that we don’t inadvertently expose information from one organization to another.</p>



<h4><strong>Long-context models won’t make RAG obsolete</strong></h4>



<p>With Gemini 1.5 providing context windows of up to 10M tokens in size, some have begun to question the future of RAG. </p>



<blockquote><p>I tend to believe that Gemini 1.5 is significantly overhyped by Sora. A context window of 10M tokens effectively makes most of existing RAG frameworks unnecessary—you simply put whatever your data into the context and talk to the model like usual. Imagine how it does to all the startups/agents/LangChain projects where most of the engineering efforts goes to RAG 😅 Or in one sentence: the 10m context kills RAG. Nice work Gemini.</p><cite>— <a href="https://x.com/Francis_YAO_/status/1758935954189115714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Yao Fu</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>While it’s true that long contexts will be a game-changer for use cases such as analyzing multiple documents or chatting with PDFs, the rumors of RAG’s demise are greatly exaggerated.</p>



<p>First, even with a context window of 10M tokens, we’d still need a way to select information to feed into the model. Second, beyond the narrow needle-in-a-haystack eval, we’ve yet to see convincing data that models can effectively reason over such a large context. Thus, without good retrieval (and ranking), we risk overwhelming the model with distractors, or may even fill the context window with completely irrelevant information.</p>



<p>Finally, there’s cost. The Transformer’s inference cost scales quadratically (or linearly in both space and time) with context length. Just because there exists a model that could read your organization’s entire Google Drive contents before answering each question doesn’t mean that’s a good idea. Consider an analogy to how we use RAM: we still read and write from disk, even though there exist compute instances with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/high-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="RAM running into the tens of terabytes (opens in a new tab)">RAM running into the tens of terabytes</a>.</p>



<p>So don’t throw your RAGs in the trash just yet. This pattern will remain useful even as context windows grow in size.</p>



<h3><strong>Tuning and optimizing workflows</strong></h3>



<p>Prompting an LLM is just the beginning. To get the most juice out of them, we need to think beyond a single prompt and embrace workflows. For example, how could we split a single complex task into multiple simpler tasks? When is finetuning or caching helpful with increasing performance and reducing latency/cost? In this section, we share proven strategies and real-world examples to help you optimize and build reliable LLM workflows.</p>



<h4><strong>Step-by-step, multi-turn “flows” can give large boosts.</strong></h4>



<p>We already know that by decomposing a single big prompt into multiple smaller prompts, we can achieve better results. An example of this is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AlphaCodium (opens in a new tab)">AlphaCodium</a>: By switching from a single prompt to a multi-step workflow, they increased GPT-4 accuracy (pass@5) on CodeContests from 19% to 44%. The workflow includes:</p>



<ul><li>Reflecting on the problem</li><li>Reasoning on the public tests</li><li>Generating possible solutions</li><li>Ranking possible solutions</li><li>Generating synthetic tests</li><li>Iterating on the solutions on public and synthetic tests.</li></ul>



<p>Small tasks with clear objectives make for the best agent or flow prompts. It’s not required that every agent prompt requests structured output, but structured outputs help a lot to interface with whatever system is orchestrating the agent’s interactions with the environment.</p>



<p>Some things to try</p>



<ul><li>An explicit planning step, as tightly specified as possible. Consider having predefined plans to choose from (c.f. https://youtu.be/hGXhFa3gzBs?si=gNEGYzux6TuB1del).</li><li>Rewriting the original user prompts into agent prompts. Be careful, this process is lossy!</li><li>Agent behaviors as linear chains, DAGs, and State-Machines; different dependency and logic relationships can be more and less appropriate for different scales. Can you squeeze performance optimization out of different task architectures?</li><li>Planning validations; your planning can include instructions on how to evaluate the responses from other agents to make sure the final assembly works well together.</li><li>Prompt engineering with fixed upstream state—make sure your agent prompts are evaluated against a collection of variants of what may happen before.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Prioritize deterministic workflows for now</strong></h4>



<p>While AI agents can dynamically react to user requests and the environment, their non-deterministic nature makes them a challenge to deploy. Each step an agent takes has a chance of failing, and the chances of recovering from the error are poor. Thus, the likelihood that an agent completes a multi-step task successfully decreases exponentially as the number of steps increases. As a result, teams building agents find it difficult to deploy reliable agents.</p>



<p>A promising approach is to have agent systems that produce deterministic plans which are then executed in a structured, reproducible way. In the first step, given a high-level goal or prompt, the agent generates a plan. Then, the plan is executed deterministically. This allows each step to be more predictable and reliable. Benefits include:</p>



<ul><li>Generated plans can serve as few-shot samples to prompt or finetune an agent.</li><li>Deterministic execution makes the system more reliable, and thus easier to test and debug. Furthermore, failures can be traced to the specific steps in the plan.</li><li>Generated plans can be represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) which are easier, relative to a static prompt, to understand and adapt to new situations.</li></ul>



<p>The most successful agent builders may be those with strong experience managing junior engineers because the process of generating plans is similar to how we instruct and manage juniors. We give juniors clear goals and concrete plans, instead of vague open-ended directions, and we should do the same for our agents too. </p>



<p>In the end, the key to reliable, working agents will likely be found in adopting more structured, deterministic approaches, as well as collecting data to refine prompts and finetune models. Without this, we’ll build agents that may work exceptionally well some of the time, but on average, disappoint users which leads to poor retention.</p>



<h4><strong>Getting more diverse outputs beyond temperature</strong></h4>



<p>Suppose your task requires diversity in an LLM’s output. Maybe you’re writing an LLM pipeline to suggest products to buy from your catalog given a list of products the user bought previously. When running your prompt multiple times, you might notice that the resulting recommendations are too similar—so you might increase the temperature parameter in your LLM requests.</p>



<p>Briefly, increasing the temperature parameter makes LLM responses more varied. At sampling time, the probability distributions of the next token become flatter, meaning that tokens which are usually less likely get chosen more often. Still, when increasing temperature, you may notice some failure modes related to output diversity. For example,Some products from the catalog that could be a good fit may never be output by the LLM.The same handful of products might be overrepresented in outputs, if they are highly likely to follow the prompt based on what the LLM has learned at training time.If the temperature is too high, you may get outputs that reference nonexistent products (or gibberish!)</p>



<p>In other words, increasing temperature does not guarantee that the LLM will sample outputs from the probability distribution you expect (e.g., uniform random). Nonetheless, we have other tricks to increase output diversity. The simplest way is to adjust elements within the prompt. For example, if the prompt template includes a list of items, such as historical purchases, shuffling the order of these items each time they’re inserted into the prompt can make a significant difference. </p>



<p>Additionally, keeping a short list of recent outputs can help prevent redundancy. In our recommended products example, by instructing the LLM to avoid suggesting items from this recent list, or by rejecting and resampling outputs that are similar to recent suggestions, we can further diversify the responses. Another effective strategy is to vary the phrasing used in the prompts. For instance, incorporating phrases like “pick an item that the user would love using regularly” or “select a product that the user would likely recommend to friends” can shift the focus and thereby influence the variety of recommended products.</p>



<h4><strong>Caching is underrated.</strong></h4>



<p>Caching saves cost and eliminates generation latency by removing the need to recompute responses for the same input. Furthermore, if a response has previously been guardrailed, we can serve these vetted responses and reduce the risk of serving harmful or inappropriate content.</p>



<p>One straightforward approach to caching is to use unique IDs for the items being processed, such as if we’re summarizing new articles or <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/amazon-is-using-generative-ai-to-summarize-product-reviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="product reviews (opens in a new tab)">product reviews</a>. When a request comes in, we can check to see if a summary already exists in the cache. If so, we can return it immediately; if not, we generate, guardrail, and serve it, and then store it in the cache for future requests.</p>



<p>For more open-ended queries, we can borrow techniques from the field of search, which also leverages caching for open-ended inputs. Features like autocomplete and spelling correction also help normalize user input and thus increase the cache hit rate.</p>



<h4><strong>When to fine-tune</strong></h4>



<p>We may have some tasks where even the most cleverly designed prompts fall short. For example, even after significant prompt engineering, our system may still be a ways from returning reliable, high-quality output. If so, then it may be necessary to finetune a model for your specific task. </p>



<p>Successful examples include:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Honeycomb's Natural Language Query Assistant (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/introducing-query-assistant" target="_blank">Honeycomb’s Natural Language Query Assistant</a>: Initially, the “programming manual” was provided in the prompt together with n-shot examples for in-context learning. While this worked decently, fine-tuning the model led to better output on the syntax and rules of the domain-specific language.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_DMMlDuJB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ReChat's Lucy (opens in a new tab)">ReChat’s Lucy</a>: The LLM needed to generate responses in a very specific format that combined structured and unstructured data for the frontend to render correctly. Fine-tuning was essential to get it to work consistently.</li></ul>



<p>Nonetheless, while fine-tuning can be effective, it comes with significant costs. We have to annotate fine-tuning data, finetune and evaluate models, and eventually self-host them. Thus, consider if the higher upfront cost is worth it. If prompting gets you 90% of the way there, then fine-tuning may not be worth the investment. However, if we do decide to fine-tune, to reduce the cost of collecting human annotated data, we can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="generate and finetune on synthetic data (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/synthetic/" target="_blank">generate and finetune on synthetic data</a>, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bootstrap on open-source data (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">bootstrap on open-source data</a>.</p>



<h3><strong> Evaluation &amp; Monitoring</strong></h3>



<p>Evaluating LLMs can be a minefield. The inputs and the outputs of LLMs are arbitrary text, and the tasks we set them to are varied. Nonetheless, rigorous and thoughtful evals are critical—it’s no coincidence that technical leaders at OpenAI <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="work on evaluation and give feedback on individual evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1701692908074873036" target="_blank">work on evaluation and give feedback on individual evals</a>. </p>



<p>Evaluating LLM applications invites a diversity of definitions and reductions: it’s simply unit testing, or it’s more like observability, or maybe it’s just data science. We have found all of these perspectives useful. In the following section, we provide some lessons we’ve learned about what is important in building evals and monitoring pipelines.</p>



<h4><strong>Create a few assertion-based unit tests from real input/output samples</strong></h4>



<p>Create <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="unit tests (i.e., assertions) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#level-1-unit-tests" target="_blank">unit tests (i.e., assertions)</a> consisting of samples of inputs and outputs from production, with expectations for outputs based on at least three criteria. While three criteria might seem arbitrary, it’s a practical number to start with; fewer might indicate that your task isn’t sufficiently defined or is too open-ended, like a general-purpose chatbot. These unit tests, or assertions, should be triggered by any changes to the pipeline, whether it’s editing a prompt, adding new context via RAG, or other modifications. This <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="write-up has an example (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#step-1-write-scoped-tests" target="_blank">write-up has an example</a> of an assertion-based test for an actual use case.</p>



<p>Consider beginning with assertions that specify phrases or ideas to either include or exclude in all responses. Also consider checks to ensure that word, item, or sentence counts lie within a range. For other kinds of generation, assertions can look different. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Execution-evaluation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Execution-Based-Evaluation-for-Open-Domain-Code-Wang-Zhou/1bed34f2c23b97fd18de359cf62cd92b3ba612c3" target="_blank">Execution-evaluation</a> is a powerful method for evaluating code-generation, wherein you run the generated code and determine that the state of runtime is sufficient for the user-request. </p>



<p>As an example, if the user asks for a new function named foo; then after executing the agent’s generated code, foo should be callable! One challenge in execution-evaluation is that the agent code frequently leaves the runtime in slightly different form than the target code. It can be effective to “relax” assertions to the absolute most weak assumptions that any viable answer would satisfy.</p>



<p>Finally, using your product as intended for customers (i.e., “dogfooding”) can provide insight into failure modes on real-world data. This approach not only helps identify potential weaknesses, but also provides a useful source of production samples that can be converted into evals.</p>



<h4><strong>LLM-as-Judge can work (somewhat), but it’s not a silver bullet</strong></h4>



<p>LLM-as-Judge, where we use a strong LLM to evaluate the output of other LLMs, has been met with skepticism by some. (Some of us were initially huge skeptics.) Nonetheless, when implemented well, LLM-as-Judge achieves decent correlation with human judgements, and can at least help build priors about how a new prompt or technique may perform. Specifically, when doing pairwise comparisons (e.g., control vs. treatment), LLM-as-Judge typically gets the direction right though the magnitude of the win/loss may be noisy.</p>



<p>Here are some suggestions to get the most out of LLM-as-Judge:</p>



<ul><li>Use pairwise comparisons: Instead of asking the LLM to score a single output on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Likert (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert</a> scale, present it with two options and ask it to select the better one. This tends to lead to more stable results.</li><li>Control for position bias: The order of options presented can bias the LLM’s decision. To mitigate this, do each pairwise comparison twice, swapping the order of pairs each time. Just be sure to attribute wins to the right option after swapping!</li><li>Allow for ties: In some cases, both options may be equally good. Thus, allow the LLM to declare a tie so it doesn’t have to arbitrarily pick a winner.</li><li>Use Chain-of-Thought: Asking the LLM to explain its decision before giving a final preference can increase eval reliability. As a bonus, this allows you to use a weaker but faster LLM and still achieve similar results. Because frequently this part of the pipeline is in batch mode, the extra latency from CoT isn’t a problem.</li><li>Control for response length: LLMs tend to bias toward longer responses. To mitigate this, ensure response pairs are similar in length.</li></ul>



<p>One particularly powerful application of LLM-as-Judge is checking a new prompting strategy against regression. If you have tracked a collection of production results, sometimes you can rerun those production examples with a new prompting strategy, and use LLM-as-Judge to quickly assess where the new strategy may suffer.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#automated-evaluation-w-llms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">simple but effective approach</a> to iterate on LLM-as-Judge, where we simply log the LLM response, judge’s critique (i.e., CoT), and final outcome. They are then reviewed with stakeholders to identify areas for improvement. Over three iterations, agreement with human and LLM improved from 68% to 94%!</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Picture1.png" alt="" width="800" height="229"></figure>



<p>LLM-as-Judge is not a silver bullet though. There are subtle aspects of language where even the strongest models fail to evaluate reliably. In addition, we’ve found that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="conventional classifiers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">conventional classifiers</a> and reward models can achieve higher accuracy than LLM-as-Judge, and with lower cost and latency. For code generation, LLM-as-Judge can be weaker than more direct evaluation strategies like execution-evaluation.</p>



<h4><strong>The “intern test” for evaluating generations</strong></h4>



<p>We like to use the following “intern test” when evaluating generations: If you took the exact input to the language model, including the context, and gave it to an average college student in the relevant major as a task, could they succeed? How long would it take?</p>



<p>If the answer is no because the LLM lacks the required knowledge, consider ways to enrich the context.</p>



<p>If the answer is no and we simply can’t improve the context to fix it, then we may have hit a task that’s too hard for contemporary LLMs.</p>



<p>If the answer is yes, but it would take a while, we can try to reduce the complexity of the task. Is it decomposable? Are there aspects of the task that can be made more templatized?</p>



<p>If the answer is yes, they would get it quickly, then it’s time to dig into the data. What’s the model doing wrong? Can we find a pattern of failures? Try asking the model to explain itself before or after it responds, to help you build a theory of mind. </p>



<h4><strong>Overemphasizing certain evals can hurt overall performance</strong></h4>



<blockquote><p>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” </p><cite>— Goodhart’s Law</cite></blockquote>



<p>An example of this is the Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) eval. The original eval helped quantify model recall as context sizes grew, as well as how recall is affected by needle position. However, it’s been so overemphasized that it’s featured as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Figure 1 for Gemini 1.5's report (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05530" target="_blank">Figure 1 for Gemini 1.5’s report</a>. The eval involves inserting a specific phrase (“The special magic {city} number is: {number}”) into a long document which repeats the essays of Paul Graham, and then prompting the model to recall the magic number.</p>



<p>While some models achieve near-perfect recall, it’s questionable whether NIAH truly reflects the reasoning and recall abilities needed in real-world applications. Consider a more practical scenario: Given the transcript of an hour-long meeting, can the LLM summarize the key decisions and next steps, as well as correctly attribute each item to the relevant person? This task is more realistic, going beyond rote memorization and also considering the ability to parse complex discussions, identify relevant information, and synthesize summaries.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="practical NIAH eval (opens in a new tab)" href="https://observablehq.com/@shreyashankar/needle-in-the-real-world-experiments" target="_blank">practical NIAH eval</a>. Using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="transcripts of doctor-patient video calls (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/wyim/aci-bench/tree/main/data/challenge_data" target="_blank">transcripts of doctor-patient video calls</a>, the LLM is queried about the patient’s medication. It also includes a more challenging NIAH, inserting a phrase for random ingredients for pizza toppings, such as “<em>The secret ingredients needed to build the perfect pizza are: Espresso-soaked dates, Lemon and Goat cheese.</em>” Recall was around 80% on the medication task and 30% on the pizza task.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Picture2.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Tangentially, an overemphasis on NIAH evals can lead to lower performance on extraction and summarization tasks. Because these LLMs are so finetuned to attend to every sentence, they may start to treat irrelevant details and distractors as important, thus including them in the final output (when they shouldn’t!)</p>



<p>This could also apply to other evals and use cases. For example, summarization. An emphasis on factual consistency could lead to summaries that are less specific (and thus less likely to be factually inconsistent) and possibly less relevant. Conversely, an emphasis on writing style and eloquence could lead to more flowery, marketing-type language that could introduce factual inconsistencies.</p>



<h4><strong>Simplify annotation to binary tasks or pairwise comparisons</strong></h4>



<p>Providing open-ended feedback or ratings for model output on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Likert scale (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert scale</a> is cognitively demanding. As a result, the data collected is more noisy—due to variability among human raters—and thus less useful. A more effective approach is to simplify the task and reduce the cognitive burden on annotators. Two tasks that work well are binary classifications and pairwise comparisons.</p>



<p>In binary classifications, annotators are asked to make a simple yes-or-no judgment on the model’s output. They might be asked whether the generated summary is factually consistent with the source document, or whether the proposed response is relevant, or if it contains toxicity. Compared to the Likert scale, binary decisions are more precise, have higher consistency among raters, and lead to higher throughput. This was how <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Doordash setup their labeling queues (opens in a new tab)" href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/08/28/overcome-the-cold-start-problem-in-menu-item-tagging/" target="_blank">Doordash setup their labeling queues</a> for tagging menu items though a tree of yes-no questions.</p>



<p>In pairwise comparisons, the annotator is presented with a pair of model responses and asked which is better. Because it’s easier for humans to say “A is better than B” than to assign an individual score to either A or B individually, this leads to faster and more reliable annotations (over Likert scales). At a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Llama2 meetup (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzR3OrOkM9w" target="_blank">Llama2 meetup</a>, Thomas Scialom, an author on the Llama2 paper, confirmed that pairwise-comparisons were faster and cheaper than collecting supervised finetuning data such as written responses. The former’s cost is $3.5 per unit while the latter’s cost is $25 per unit.</p>



<p>If you’re starting to write labeling guidelines, here are some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="reference guidelines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/labeling-guidelines/" target="_blank">reference guidelines</a> from Google and Bing Search.</p>



<h4><strong>(Reference-free) evals and guardrails can be used interchangeably </strong></h4>



<p>Guardrails help to catch inappropriate or harmful content while evals help to measure the quality and accuracy of the model’s output. In the case of reference-free evals, they may be considered two sides of the same coin. Reference-free evals are evaluations that don’t rely on a “golden” reference, such as a human-written answer, and can assess the quality of output based solely on the input prompt and the model’s response.</p>



<p>Some examples of these are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="summarization evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/evals/#summarization-consistency-relevance-length" target="_blank">summarization evals</a>, where we only have to consider the input document to evaluate the summary on factual consistency and relevance. If the summary scores poorly on these metrics, we can choose not to display it to the user, effectively using the eval as a guardrail. Similarly, reference-free <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="translation evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/evals/#translation-statistical--learned-evals-for-quality" target="_blank">translation evals</a> can assess the quality of a translation without needing a human-translated reference, again allowing us to use it as a guardrail.</p>



<h4><strong>LLMs will return output even when they shouldn’t</strong></h4>



<p>A key challenge when working with LLMs is that they’ll often generate output even when they shouldn’t. This can lead to harmless but nonsensical responses, or more egregious defects like toxicity or dangerous content. For example, when asked to extract specific attributes or metadata from a document, an LLM may confidently return values even when those values don’t actually exist. Alternatively, the model may respond in a language other than English because we provided non-English documents in the context.</p>



<p>While we can try to prompt the LLM to return a “not applicable” or “unknown” response, it’s not foolproof. Even when the log probabilities are available, they’re a poor indicator of output quality. While log probs indicate the likelihood of a token appearing in the output, they don’t necessarily reflect the correctness of the generated text. On the contrary, for instruction-tuned models that are trained to respond to queries and generate coherent response, log probabilities may not be well-calibrated. Thus, while a high log probability may indicate that the output is fluent and coherent, it doesn’t mean it’s accurate or relevant.</p>



<p>While careful prompt engineering can help to some extent, we should complement it with robust guardrails that detect and filter/regenerate undesired output. For example, OpenAI provides a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="content moderation API (opens in a new tab)" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation" target="_blank">content moderation API</a> that can identify unsafe responses such as hate speech, self-harm, or sexual output. Similarly, there are numerous packages for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="detecting personally identifiable information (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/topics/pii-detection" target="_blank">detecting personally identifiable information</a> (PII). One benefit is that guardrails are largely agnostic of the use case and can thus be applied broadly to all output in a given language. In addition, with precise retrieval, our system can deterministically respond “I don’t know” if there are no relevant documents.</p>



<p>A corollary here is that LLMs may fail to produce outputs when they are expected to. This can happen for various reasons, from straightforward issues like long tail latencies from API providers to more complex ones such as outputs being blocked by content moderation filters. As such, it’s important to consistently log inputs and (potentially a lack of) outputs for debugging and monitoring.</p>



<h4><strong>Hallucinations are a stubborn problem.</strong></h4>



<p>Unlike content safety or PII defects which have a lot of attention and thus seldom occur, factual inconsistencies are stubbornly persistent and more challenging to detect. They’re more common and occur at a baseline rate of 5 – 10%, and from what we’ve learned from LLM providers, it can be challenging to get it below 2%, even on simple tasks such as summarization.</p>



<p>To address this, we can combine prompt engineering (upstream of generation) and factual inconsistency guardrails (downstream of generation). For prompt engineering, techniques like CoT help reduce hallucination by getting the LLM to explain its reasoning before finally returning the output. Then, we can apply a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="factual inconsistency guardrail (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">factual inconsistency guardrail</a> to assess the factuality of summaries and filter or regenerate hallucinations. In some cases, hallucinations can be deterministically detected. When using resources from RAG retrieval, if the output is structured and identifies what the resources are, you should be able to manually verify they’re sourced from the input context.</p>

<p>Noise-canceling headphones have gotten very good at creating an auditory blank slate. But allowing certain sounds from a wearer’s environment through the erasure still challenges researchers. The latest edition of Apple’s AirPods Pro, for instance, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/airpods-pro-usb-c-hands-on-adaptive-audio-and-conversation-awareness.html">automatically adjusts sound levels</a> for wearers — sensing when they’re in conversation, for instance — but the user has little control over whom to listen to or when this happens.</p>
<p>A University of Washington team has developed an artificial intelligence system that lets a user wearing headphones look at a person speaking for three to five seconds to “enroll” them. The system, called “Target Speech Hearing,” then cancels all other sounds in the environment and plays just the enrolled speaker’s voice in real time even as the listener moves around in noisy places and no longer faces the speaker.</p>
<p>The team presented <a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/content/147319">its findings</a> May 14 in Honolulu at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. The <a href="https://github.com/vb000/LookOnceToHear">code for the proof-of-concept device</a> is available for others to build on. The system is not commercially available.</p>
<p>“We tend to think of AI now as web-based chatbots that answer questions,” said senior author <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/">Shyam Gollakota</a>, a UW professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering. “But in this project, we develop AI to modify the auditory perception of anyone wearing headphones, given their preferences. With our devices you can now hear a single speaker clearly even if you are in a noisy environment with lots of other people talking.”</p>
<p>To use the system, a person wearing off-the-shelf headphones fitted with microphones taps a button while directing their head at someone talking. The sound waves from that speaker’s voice then should reach the microphones on both sides of the headset simultaneously; there’s a 16-degree margin of error. The headphones send that signal to an on-board embedded<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer"> computer</a>, where the team’s machine learning software learns the desired speaker’s vocal patterns. The system latches onto that speaker’s voice and continues to play it back to the listener, even as the pair moves around. The system’s ability to focus on the enrolled voice improves as the speaker keeps talking, giving the system more training data.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>The team tested its system on 21 subjects, who rated the clarity of the enrolled speaker’s voice nearly twice as high as the unfiltered audio on average.</p>
<p>This work builds on the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/11/09/ai-noise-canceling-headphones/">team’s previous “semantic hearing” research</a>, which allowed users to select specific sound classes — such as birds or voices — that they wanted to hear and canceled other sounds in the environment.</p>
<p>Currently the TSH system can enroll only one speaker at a time, and it’s only able to enroll a speaker when there is not another loud voice coming from the same direction as the target speaker’s voice. If a user isn’t happy with the sound quality, they can run another enrollment on the speaker to improve the clarity.</p>
<p>The team is working to expand the system to earbuds and hearing aids in the future.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo">https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40505310">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google’s search algorithm is perhaps the most consequential system on the internet, dictating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147152/google-search-seo-publishing-housefresh-product-reviews">what sites live and die</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">what content on the web looks like</a>. But how exactly Google ranks websites has long been a mystery, pieced together by journalists, researchers, and people working in search engine optimization.</p><p>Now, an explosive leak that purports to show <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/">thousands of pages of internal documents</a> appears to offer an unprecedented look under the hood of how Search works — and suggests that Google hasn’t been entirely truthful about it for years. So far, Google hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment on the legitimacy of the documents.</p><p>Rand Fishkin, who worked in SEO for more than a decade, says a source shared 2,500 pages of documents with him with the hopes that reporting on the leak would counter the “lies” that Google employees had shared about how the search algorithm works. The documents outline Google’s search API and break down what information is available to employees, according to Fishkin.</p><p>The details shared by Fishkin are dense and technical, likely more legible to developers and SEO experts than the layperson. The contents of the leak are also not necessarily proof that Google uses the specific data and signals it mentions for search rankings. Rather, the leak outlines what data Google collects from webpages, sites, and searchers and offers indirect hints to SEO experts about what Google seems to care about, as SEO expert Mike King <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">wrote</a> in his overview of the documents.</p><p>The leaked documents touch on topics like what kind of data Google collects and uses, which sites Google elevates for sensitive topics like elections, how Google handles small websites, and more. Some information in the documents appears to be in conflict with public statements by Google representatives, according to Fishkin and King. </p><p>“‘Lied’ is harsh, but it’s the only accurate word to use here,” King writes. “While I don’t necessarily fault Google’s public representatives for protecting their proprietary information, I do take issue with their efforts to actively discredit people in the marketing, tech, and journalism worlds who have presented reproducible discoveries.”</p><p>Google has not responded to <em>The Verge’</em>s requests for comment<em> </em>regarding the documents, including a direct request to refute their legitimacy. Fishkin told <em>The Verge </em>in an email that the company has not disputed the veracity of the leak, but that an employee asked him to change some language in the post regarding how an event was characterized.</p><p>Google’s secretive search algorithm has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results">birthed an entire industry</a> of marketers who closely follow Google’s public guidance and execute it for millions of companies around the world. The pervasive, often annoying tactics have led to a general narrative that Google Search results are getting worse, crowded with junk that website operators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23753963/google-seo-shopify-small-business-ai">feel required to produce</a> to have their sites seen. In response to <em>The Verge</em>’s past reporting on the SEO-driven tactics, Google representatives often fall back to a familiar defense: that’s not what the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide">Google guidelines</a> say. </p><p>But some details in the leaked documents call into question the accuracy of Google’s public statements regarding how Search works. </p><p>One example cited by Fishkin and King is whether Google Chrome data is used in ranking at all. Google representatives have <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-chrome-search-usage-15618.html">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://iloveseo.com/seo/google-does-not-use-anything-from-google-chrome-for-ranking/">indicated</a> that it doesn’t use Chrome data to rank pages, but Chrome is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualitySitemapTargetGroup.html#module-attributes">specifically mentioned in sections</a> about how websites appear in Search. In the screenshot below, which I captured as an example, the links appearing below the main vogue.com URL may be created in part using Chrome data, according to the documents.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A Google Search screenshot of the Vogue.com result, with sublinks below the main homepage.

E-E-A-T stands for experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/12/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t">a Google metric used to evaluate the quality of results</a>. Google representatives have <a href="https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1755283334631231514">previously said E-E-A-T isn’t a ranking factor</a>. Fishkin notes that he hasn’t found much in the documents mentioning E-E-A-T by name.</p></div><p>King, however, detailed how Google appears to collect author data from a page and has a field for whether an entity on the page is the author. A portion of the documents shared by King reads that the field was “mainly developed and tuned for news articles... but is also populated for other content (e.g., scientific articles).” Though this doesn’t confirm that bylines are an explicit ranking metric, it does show that Google is at least keeping track of this attribute. Google representatives have <a href="https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1744379351297081637">previously insisted</a> that author bylines are something website owners should do for readers, not Google, because it doesn’t impact rankings.</p><p>Though the documents aren’t exactly a smoking gun, they provide a deep, unfiltered look at a tightly guarded black box system. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates">US government’s antitrust case against Google</a> — which revolves around Search — has also led to internal documentation becoming public, offering further insights into how the company’s main product works. </p><p>Google’s general caginess on how Search works has led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">websites looking the same</a> as SEO marketers try to outsmart Google based on hints the company offers. Fishkin also calls out the publications credulously propping up Google’s public claims as truth without much further analysis.</p><p>“Historically, some of the search industry’s loudest voices and most prolific publishers have been happy to uncritically repeat Google’s public statements. They write headlines like ‘Google says XYZ is true,’ rather than ‘Google Claims XYZ; Evidence Suggests Otherwise,’” Fishkin writes. “Please, do better. If this leak and the DOJ trial can create just one change, I hope this is it.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>
We present a prototype of a programming system called Shadama.
Shadama is designed for writing programs that create, control and visualize large numbers of objects.
The basic execution model follows the tradition of StarLogo and its "turtles and patches" abstraction.

&nbsp; This abstraction has been proven to be effective and easy to use.
The primary goal of the language is to facilitate the writing of scientific simulations by students
at the high school level.

        <p>
The Shadama environment supports <i>liveness</i>.
Once changes to the program are saved, the effect on the running simulation is immediate;
there is no need to restart the simulation.

A prototype of Shadama can be found <a href="http://tinlizzie.org/~ohshima/shadama2">here</a>.
Be aware that Shadama requires WebGL 2 and is affected by the floating point precision provided
by your graphics card. Thus, it only works on certain computer systems.
From our experience, it seems to work better on computers with an AMD Radeon graphics
card and on Chrome or Firefox browsers.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
The computing power available to us today is astounding.  Achieving
one teraflop of performance was a milestone for a building-sized supercomputer in
the late '90s, but now we expect smart phones to reach this same milestone soon.
Computing performance will only continue to increase in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
But what are people using this power for?  Not to be critical, but
people are generally more interested in watching cat videos and
playing games than trying to invent self-piloting personal airplanes
or discover the graviton.

All joking aside, one of the big problems we face today is our
struggle to advance science literacy, even within a
technologically-advanced society.  We need the next
generation to embrace science more, not less.
        </p>
        <p>
We think now is a good time to redouble our efforts to provide
environments where students and even professional
programmers can more easily tap into the computing power that is available.
To this end, we have been working on a prototype of a
programming language intended for high school students to explore
scientific concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
  Science is about making the invisible visible.  One notable example
of an invisible yet important concept is molecules in a gas.  We would
like students to learn about this, not by rote memorization, but
through actual experiments and model-building.  With the help of
computers, students can make a dynamic model and understand it more
deeply.  This kind of environment will help students construct
knowledge by doing, in line with the constructivism philosophy of
education.
        </p>

<section>
        <h2 id="a-science-experiment">A Science Experiment</h2>
        <p>
Before introducing the Shadama programming environment, we first
give an example of a physics experiment that could also be modeled
and simulated on a computer.
</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07D0nB3mgLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>
This movie demonstrates a vacuum cannon.  The cannon is a six foot PVC
pipe connected to a vacuum pump.  We put a ping pong ball inside the pipe,
cover the ends with sturdy but breakable material (such as plastic plates),
and pump the air out.
        </p>
        <p>
The pump reduces the pressure inside the tube to about 20% of full atmospheric pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
When the end near the ping pong ball is broken open by a box cutter, the
air molecules that rush into the pipe move into the
low pressure space and the ping pong ball is pushed out the other end.
Our crude setup can accelerate the ball to a speed of over 200 meters per second
(about 60% of the speed of sound).  Others have built similar setups
that can achieve supersonic speed.
        </p>
        <p>
An interesting point to understand is that it is just movement of
molecules that is causing the ball to shoot out. It is not that the
vacuum is sucking molecules into the pipe.
</p>
<p>
The invisible molecules that cause the ball to shoot out can
be made “visible” in a sense not only through this physical experiment,
but also through a computer simulation that reproduces the same phenomenon.
Creating such simulations is the purpose of our programming environment.
          </p>
</section>

<section>
        <h2 id="language-goals">Language Goals</h2>

<p>
We had the following goals when designing Shadama:
</p><ul>
<li> Easy to learn</li>
<li> Openness</li>
<li> Support for large numbers of particles</li>
<li> Liveness</li>
</ul>


<p>
To make learning Shadama easy, we based our language on StarLogo,
whose turtles and patches approach has proved intuitive to young learners.
In addition, we expect students familiar with Scratch to
learn Shadama easily because of similarites in how object behavior
is programmed and how objects can sense values near them spatially.
</p>

<p>
To encourage openness, we designed Shadama to be capable of implementing
complex behavior in the language itself, with as few primitives as possible.
We think that a learning environment should be open
in the sense that a student should be able to see, change and understand
how the various parts of the system work.
Although many sophisticated scientific software packages and simulation environments
exist, they are presented as immutable black boxes,
which limits understanding and stifles curiousity.
When additional software support is required, it should be provided in the
end-user's programming language, and it should be capable of modification
within the end-user's environment.
</p>

<p>
To support large numbers of particles, we designed the language
to execute on graphics hardware. Graphics processors today
are capable of computing on massive amounts of data.
Unfortunately, this requires a trade-off between ease of use and
high performance because there are fundamental limitations in
the execution model of today's graphics hardware.
Although Shadama has some features to mitigate these limitations,
certain behaviors cannot be implemented.
</p>

<p>
To support liveness, we designed the Shadama environment to show
the effects of code changes immediately. Of course,
a running simulation should not be updated for each and every key stroke.
Instead, the user submits a batch of code changes for the environment
to apply.

Shadama is built on web technologies, including WebGL 2.0 and OpenGL
Shading Language version 3.0.
Our code translator is written in Ohm

<span>
<a href="#ohm">Ohm: A library and language for building parsers, interpreters, compilers, etc.</a>

and generates vertex shader, fragment shader and JavaScript code from the Shadama program.
All the values for a given breed and property are stored in a single OpenGL texture.
These textures are created with the OpenGL type "R32F", to match
their use as an array of floating-point scalar values.
The values for a given patch and property are similarly represented.
</p>
<p>
Shadama static functions are translated to Javascript code that
runs OpenGL shaders derived from the Shadama methods.
For each method, a vertex shader is generated to fetch property values
from textures and perform the computation required for that method.
A generated fragment shader stores the property values back
into textures, using the multiple render targets feature of OpenGL.

The biggest inspiration for Shadama (and Kedama) was Resnick's StarLogo.
As such, it provided the basis for the basic organization of objects in Shadama.
However, StarLogo has certain features that Shadama does not, as mentioned in the introduction.

This environment brings dynamic code swapping and interactive data

although their environment uses a third-party engine that cannot be modified from this same environment.
This is a reflection of their focus on empowering scientific researchers.
Such users are already familiar with the concepts behind the simulation and
value the tight interaction offered by this approach.
While it is possible to rewrite parts of the third-party engine in Extempore,
this is beyond the ability of most users, especially our target audience.

<section>
        <h2 id="conclusions-and-future-work">Conclusions and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
We have presented an early prototype of a language in
which users can make enlightening simulations and intricate visualizations.
The liveliness of the environment encourages an
exploratory style of programming that enables trying out different ideas quickly.
We have also discovered that such an interactive and graphical environment
can be motivating even as bugs appear because of the spectacular
unintentional visual effects that are produced.
        </p>
        <p>
We are considering various improvements to the system.  One major
addition would be to fully support simulations in 3D, not just 2D.
While computation in Shadama only uses scalar values and is agnostic to dimensionality,
the primitives and concepts the system currently provides only work well for 2D applications.
We will need new ideas to manage 3D spatial data.
        </p>
        <p>
We also plan to support more mathematical concepts, such as vectors and matrices.
While first-time users may not initially have use for such abstractions,
we would like them to eventually learn and use these powerful concepts.
Ideally, the environment would gradually introduce the user to new, more difficult approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
We would like to conclude this paper by stressing the importance of
education. Education raises our awareness and enables us to see our world from new perspectives.
In this way, we are empowered with new approaches to solve problems.
For the next generation to solve the challenges of the future, their science literacy
is imperative. Our aim with Shadama is to leverage the power and ubiquity of
computing devices to improve science literacy for high school students by providing an engaging, open
environment in which to explore scientific concepts.

        <h2 id="language">Appendix: A Primer for the Shadama Language</h2>

<p>
The Shadama language uses a turtles and patches abstraction, drawn from the tradition of StarLogo.
</p>

        <h3 id="breeds">Breeds</h3>
<p>
Turtles are organized into
"breeds".  Each breed has its own set of properties.
A breed is declared in a program with the "breed" statement.  For example:
</p>
<pre>breed MyBreed (x, y)
</pre>
<p>
The above creates a breed of turtle called <code>MyBreed</code>, and declares that each
turtle in the breed has individual properties <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
</p>
<p>
Currently, properties in Shadama can only be scalar floating-point numbers.
</p>
<p>
Methods provide turtle behavior. The <code>def</code> statement is used to define
methods, as follows:
</p>
<pre>def move() {
  this.x = this.x + 1;
  this.y = this.y + 1;
}
</pre>
<p>
As expected, when this method is invoked on a turtle, the
turtle's x and y properties are incremented by one.
</p>
<p>
Methods can only be invoked from static functions. Methods calls are made
by first specifying a breed, then the method name.
The method is applied to all turtles in the breed concurrently.
For example:
</p>
<pre>static step() {
  MyBreed.move();
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>step</code> function above calls the <code>move</code> method on all turtles of the <code>MyBreed</code> breed.
</p>

<p>
Shadama provides many built-in features made available through primitive methods:
</p>
<ul>

<li> <pre>aBreed.setCount(count);</pre>
  <span>
  The <code>setCount</code> primitive sets the number of turtles in the breed.
For example:
</span>
<pre>static setup() {
  MyBreed.setCount(10000);
}
</pre>
<span>
Invoking this static function will set the number of <code>MyBreed</code> turtles to 10,000.
In the current implementation, the number of turtles in a breed is limited to
1024 × 1024, or about 1 million.
</span>
</li>

<li> <pre>aBreed.fillRandom(name, min, max);</pre>
<span>
  The <code>fillRandom</code> primitive sets the property specified by <code>name</code>
  to be a random number between <code>min</code>
  (inclusive) and <code>max</code> (exclusive) for each turtle in the breed.
  For example:
</span>
<pre>static setup() {
  MyBreed.setCount(10000);
  MyBreed.fillRandom("x", 0, 100);
}
</pre>
<span>
  The above will set each of the 10,000 turtles <code>x</code> property to be a
  random floating-point number between 0 and 100.
</span>
</li>

<li> <pre>aBreed.fillRandomDir(dxName, dyName);</pre>
<span>
  The <code>fillRandomDir</code> primitive generates random 2D unit vectors.
  This is done for each turtle, and the x and y components of the result are stored
  in the <code>dxName</code> and <code>dyName</code> properties of the turtles.
  For example:
</span>
<pre>static setup() {
  MyBreed.setCount(10000);
  MyBreed.fillRandomDir("dx", "dy");
}
</pre>
<span>
The above sets the <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code> properties of the turtles with the x and y components of the randomly generated unit vectors.
</span>
</li>

<li> <pre>aBreed.fillSpace(xName, yName, xDim, yDim);</pre>
        <span>
The fillSpace primitive first sets the number of turtles in the breed
to be <code>xDim</code> × <code>yDim</code>.  Then, it places the turtles on integral 2D grid points
within the (0..<code>xDim</code>, 0..<code>yDim</code>) area, storing into the <code>xName</code> and <code>yName</code> turtle properties.
For example:
</span>
<pre>static setup() {
  MyBreed.fillSpace("x", "y", 100, 100);
}
</pre>
<span>
The above creates 10,000 turtles of the MyBreed breed, setting the turtle's <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties
to be the integral grid points spanning (0, 0) to (99, 99), inclusive.
</span>
</li>

<li> <pre>aBreed.fillImage(xName, yName, rName, gName, bName, aName, anImageData);</pre>
        <span>
  The fillImage primitive converts a 2D image into a breed of turtles.
  The <code>anImageData</code> argument is a Javascript ImageData object containing the data used
  to populate the breed. The turtle count is set to be <code>anImageData.width</code> × <code>anImageData.height</code>.
  Similar to <code>fillSpace</code>, the turtles are placed on the 2D grid points within the image extent.
  The turtle properties given by <code>rName</code>, <code>gName</code>, <code>bName</code>, and <code>aName</code> are populated with the RGBA
  color component values of the image. Note that while the color components in <code>anImageData</code> range
  from 0 and 255 (integral values), those values in Shadama will be normalized to range from 0.0 and 1.0,
  inclusive (floating-point).
  For example:
<pre>breed MyBreed (x, y, r, g, b, a)
static setup() {
  MyBreed.fillImage("x", "y", "r", "g", "b", "a", anImage);
}
</pre>
</span>
<span>
Static function variables, such as <code>anImage</code>, are described below.
</span>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>

<p>
A patch is a 2D set of cells that store values.
Patches are fixed size, 512 × 512 by default.
The following declares a patch:
</p><pre>patch Field (nx, ny)
</pre>

<p>
Each cell in this patch stores two values, <code>nx</code> and <code>ny</code>.
</p>

<p>
A patch can be manipulated by passing it as an argument to a method on a breed.
As the method is executed for each turtle, turtles can access the patch cell
nearest them. No other patch cells are available to them.
For example:
</p><pre>breed MyBreed (x, y, r, g, b, a)
patch Field (r, g, b, a)

def store(field) {
  field.r = this.r;
}

static setup() {
  MyBreed.fillImage("x", "y", "r", "g", "b", "a", anImage);
  MyBreed.store(Field);
}
</pre>

<p>
The above declares a patch called Field which is used as an argument to <code>store</code>.
When <code>store</code> is executed for each turtle in <code>MyBreed</code>, the turtle's <code>r</code> property
is stored in the <code>r</code> property of the nearest cell in Field.
</p>

<p>
A turtle can read values from patch cells as well.  For example:
</p><pre>def load(field) {
   this.r = field.r;
}
</pre>

<p>
When the above method is executed, each turtle reads the <code>r</code> property of the nearest patch cell
and stores the value into its own <code>r</code> property.
</p>
<p>
Methods can receive multiple patches as arguments.
For example:
</p><pre>patch Field1 (nx, ny, r, g, b, a)
patch Field2 (nx, ny, r, g, b, a)
def transfer(f1, f2) {
  f2.r = f1.r;
  f2.a = f1.a;
}
</pre>

<p>
The following code is also valid, and correctly swaps values between patches.
</p><pre>def swap(f1, f2) {
  f2.r = f1.r;
  f1.r = f2.r
}
</pre>


<h3 id="local-variables">Local Variables</h3>

<p>
The <code>var</code> statement declares a local variable within a method.
The scope of a local variables is the whole method,
regardless of where in the method it is declared.
In the same method, there can be no more than one declaration for a given variable name.
This is in contrast to variable declarations in JavaScript.
For example:
</p><pre>def average() {
  var avg = (this.x + this.y) / 2.0;
  this.x = avg;
  this.y = avg;
}
</pre>
<p>
The above code properly defines and uses a local variable called <code>avg</code>.
However, the following code would raise an error because the variable <code>diff</code> is declared in two places:
</p><pre>def gcd() {
  if (this.a &gt; this.b) {
    var diff = this.a - this.b;
    this.a = diff;
  } else {
    var diff = this.b - this.a;
    this.b = diff;
  }
</pre>

<p>
The variable declaration has to be manually hoisted, as follows:
</p><pre>def gcd() {
  var diff;
  if (this.a &gt; this.b) {
    diff = this.a - this.b;
    this.a = diff;
  } else {
    diff = this.b - this.a;
    this.b = diff;
  }
</pre>


<h3 id="static-function-variables">Static Function Variables</h3>

<p>
Static function variables are declared within static functions, also using the "var" statement.
Static function variables are not available to methods, but are visible to all static functions.
For example:
</p><pre>static setup() {
  var begin = 1;
}

static loop() {
  if (begin) {
    begin = 0;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The two static functions above refer to the same <code>begin</code> variable.
</p>

<p>
Shadama provides the following built-in static function variables:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <code>mousemove</code>:
    An object whose <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties refer to the most recent mouse cursor location.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>mousedown</code>:
    An object whose <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties refer to the most
    recent location where the user pressed the mouse button down.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>mouseup</code>:
    An object whose <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties refer to the most
    recent location where the user lifted the mouse button up.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>time</code>:
    The number of seconds elapsed since the last time the <code>setup</code> function was called (in floating-point).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>width, height</code>:
    The width and height of the Shadama canvas.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Be aware that mouse event objects are JavaScript objects. Thus, they can't be passed to methods because
methods can only take scalar arguments.
</p>

<p>
There is one additional variable called <code>Display</code>
for invoking certain system primitives.

For example:
</p><pre>static loop() {
  Display.clear();
  MyPatch.draw();
}
</pre>
<p>
The above code clears the canvas and then draws <code>MyPatch</code> by calling the <code>draw</code> primitive.  <code>Display</code> has <code>loadProgram</code>, and <code>clear</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="parallelism-considerations">Parallelism Considerations</h3>
<p>
It's possible for two or more nearby turtles to write into the same patch cell.
Which value gets stored in the patch is non-deterministic.
</p>
<p>
Also, updates to turtle properties and patch properties are not visible until after the method is run.
Consider the following method:
</p><pre>def test() {
  if (this.r &gt; 0) {
     this.r = 0;
  } else {
     this.r = 1;
  }
  this.b = this.r;
}
</pre>

<p>
Even though the last line reads <code>this.b = this.r;</code>, the <code>r</code> property and <code>b</code> property will
not be equal after the invocation. This is because the update to the <code>r</code> property seen earlier does not take effect
until after the method call is finished. Thus, the <code>b</code> property will have the previous <code>r</code> value.
</p>

<p>
The properties <code>this.b</code> and <code>this.r</code> can have the same value
through the following use of a local variable:
</p><pre>def test() {
  var r = this.r;
  if (r &gt; 0) {
     r = 0;
  } else {
     r = 1;
  }
  this.r = r;
  this.b = r;
}
</pre>


<p>
A script can be started by calling <code>start</code> on it. Likewise, you can stop it <code>stop</code>, and execute it once with <code>step</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="control-structures">Control Structures</h3>
<p>
The <code>if</code> statement is the only control structure that Shadama supports.
Loops may be supported in a future version of Shadama because the OpenGL shader language version 3.0
does support variable-count loops.
</p>
<h3 id="primitive-functions">Primitive Functions</h3>
<p>

There are a number of primitive functions that can be called from methods.
Most of them actually result in a direct call to a GLSL built-in function.
For example:
</p><pre>def prims(x) {
  var c = cos(x);
  var s = step(0.5, x);
  var a = abs(x);
  var f = fract(x); // the fraction part of x

  this.r = c * s * a * f;
}
</pre>

<p>
The above code uses several primitive functions to compute a contrived value which
is then stored into the turtle's <code>r</code> property.
</p>

<h3 id="method-binding">Method Binding</h3>
<p>
Methods are not defined for any particular breed, but a given
method can only be applied to breeds that have the properties referenced
in the method.
For example:
</p><pre>breed A (x, r)
breed B (x, y, r, g)
breed C (r)

def set() {
  this.r = 1;
  this.x = 0;
}

static test() {
  A.set();
  B.set();
}
</pre>

<p>
The <code>set</code> method above can be called for both breed <code>A</code> and breed <code>B</code>.
This is the not the case for breed C because it does not have an <code>x</code> property, which is
referenced in <code>set</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>
The following are important limitations of the Shadama language.
</p>

<p>
Methods can not take breeds as arguments.
For example, the following code is invalid:
</p><pre>breed A (x, y)
breed B (x, y)

def hit(other) {
  var diff = other.x - this.x;
  ...
}

static step() {
  A.hit(B);
}
</pre>


<p>
The <code>step</code> function passes breed B as an argument to the <code>hit</code> method, which is not allowed.
Even if it were, it is not clear which turtle from breed <code>B</code> should
be bound to the argument <code>other</code>.
</p>

<p>
Another limitation is that a given method can either update the turtle's properties or
the patch's properties, but not both.
For example, the following code is invalid:
</p><pre>def test(field) {
  field.r = 1;
  this.r = 1;
}
</pre>


<p>
This limitation arises from limitations in WebGL itself. Future
versions of WebGL, and thus Shadama, may no longer have this restriction.
In the meantime, a workaround is to split the method into two methods — one
for updating the patch and one for updating the turtle.
It is also possible that a future version of Shadama will automatically
perform this code transformation.

And then GPT4o came out, reclaiming the throne with its multimodal finesse. Today, we’re releasing something to change that: Llama3-V, the first-ever multimodal model built on top of Llama3. As a bonus, we train everything in under $500.</p><p id="9c85">How are the benchmarks you ask? We’ll let the tables speak for themselves. We have a 10–20% boost over Llava, the current SOTA and most popular model for multimodal understanding. Additionally, we fair very comparably to the closed source models of 100x the size on all metrics except MMMU.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="b6f7"><strong>Check us out on:</strong></h2><p id="9871">• 🤗: <a href="https://huggingface.co/mustafaaljadery/llama3v/tree/main" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://huggingface.co/mustafaaljadery/llama3v/</a></p><p id="9c17">• Github: <a href="https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/llama3v" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/llama3v</a></p><h2 id="7795">The rest of the article covers</h2><ul><li id="ce14">Model Architecture</li><li id="422f">Training Framework</li><li id="ca98">Systems Optimizations</li><li id="68e8">Summary</li></ul><h2 id="5f28"><strong>Model Architecture</strong></h2><p id="2a6d">The bulk of our engineering efforts go into making Llama3 understand visual information. To do so, we take an input image and embed it into a series of patch embeddings using the SigLIP model. These embeddings are then aligned with the textual tokens via a projection block, which applies two self-attention blocks to put the textual and visual embeddings in the same plane. Finally, the visual tokens from the projection block are prepended to the textual tokens and the joint representation is passed into Llama3, just as it normally would.</p><figure><figcaption>Llama3-V Architecture: We use SigLIP to embed our input image in patches. Then we train a projection block with two self-attention blocks to align our textual and visual tokens.</figcaption></figure><p id="93cc">The diagram above illustrates at a high-level how everything works. Now, let’s dive into each stage in detail.</p><p id="66fa"><strong>SigLIP</strong>: SigLIP (Sigmoid Loss for Language Image Pre-Training) is an image embedding model that is similar to CLIP as we see in the figure below. However, unlike CLIP which uses a contrastive loss with softmax normalization, SigLIP utilizes a pairwise sigmoid loss, which allows the model to operate independently on each image-text pair, without requiring a global view across all pairs in a batch. At a high-level, SigLIP’s vision encoder splits the image into a sequence of non-overlapping image patches and projects them into a lower-dimensional linear embedding space, producing a sequence of patch embeddings. These patch embeddings then go through a vision encoder, which applies self-attention to capture long-range dependencies and extract higher-level visual features. For our purposes, we directly use the original SigLIP model trained by Google DeepMind.</p><figure><figcaption>Illustration of how SigLIP embeddings work. We train an image and text decoder concurrently but in our case the text encoding module is kept fixed. Unlike CLIP, we minimize a sigmoid loss instead of a softmax loss but most other things stay the same. Image from <a href="https://x.com/mervenoyann/status/1745476609686089800/photo/1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">twitter post </a>by Merve</figcaption></figure><p id="a1f8"><strong>Alignment with textual embeddings: </strong>To save computational resources, we keep SigLIP fixed. However, to align the output image embeddings with the textual embeddings used in Llama3, we use an extra projection module. Unlike Llava, which applies a single linear layer to the original image embeddings, we instead train two self-attention blocks to better capture patterns in the input embeddings, producing the final image embedding vector.</p><p id="fcd5"><strong>Prepending image tokens:</strong> For the textual inputs, we first tokenize the text using a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) vocabulary, producing a sequence of textual tokens. We demarcate these tokens by enclosing them within special &lt;text&gt; and &lt;/text&gt; tags. As for the image embeddings from the projection block, we treat each vector as a separate “visual token” and demarcate them using &lt;image&gt; and &lt;/image&gt; tags. Finally, we prepend the sequence of visual tokens to the sequence of textual tokens, forming the joint input representation that is passed into Llama3 for processing.</p><h2 id="75f6">Inference Optimizations</h2><p id="a1bb">Training these models is expensive. To optimize for computation resources, we make two major optimizations. The first is a simple caching mechanism and the second is on the MPS/MLX front.</p><p id="a391"><strong>Caching: </strong>The SigLIP model is much smaller than Llama3. Therefore, if we run everything serially, we have very little GPU utilization when SigLIP is running. Moreover, we can’t push the utilization up by increasing the batch size up on SigLIP as then Llama runs into OOM errors. Instead we observed that our SigLIP model stays the same and instead pre-compute the image embeddings. Then, for both pre-training and SFT, we directly pass in these precomputed image embeddings instead of re-running the SigLIP module. Not only does this allow us to increase the batch size and maximally use our GPUs for running the SigLIP modules, it also saves us training/inference time as the two parts of the pipeline can occur separately.</p><p id="df3e"><strong>MPS/MLX Optimizations: </strong>Our second optimization was again driven by SigLIP’s smaller size relative to Llama. Specifically, since SigLIP fit on our Macbooks, we ran inference on an MPS optimized SigLIP model, which allowed us to attain a throughput of 32 images/second — allowing our caching step happen relatively quickly.</p><h2 id="8756"><strong>How it was trained</strong></h2><p id="0e19"><strong>Precompute the embeddings from SigLIP: </strong>let’s now dive into the first step of our pre-training process: <em>precomputing the image embeddings via SigLIP</em>. In this step, our goal is to essentially pass in images into the SigLIP embedding model to obtain a vector representation or embedding of the image. One technical detail: due to higher resolutions, we follow the approach taken by LLaVA-UHD and perform image-splitting. The purpose of image-splitting is to divide the image into variable-sized patches or segments for more efficient encoding. These split images are processed concurrently in batches.</p><p id="b746">Now let’s dive into how exactly we use the SigLIP embedding. We first load the SigLIP model and processor/tokenizer. We then preprocess the provided input image using the processor. We then pass the preprocessed image to the model. Following this, the model outputs logits for the image-text pairs. We now proceed to apply the sigmoid activation function to the logits to get the probabilities. We now see that the image embedding is contained within these probabilities. So far this embedding captures the visual information in the image.</p><p id="7ba6">Following the computation of the image embedding via SigLIP, we now proceed to learn a projection matrix — you can also think of this as the <em>projection layer</em>, which is typically a linear or feed-forward layer. As described above in the ingredients section, the projection layer maps the vision embedding from its original space into a joint multimodal embedding space. Specifically, the projection layer applies a learned weight matrix W_v to the vision embedding v to get the projected multimodal vision embedding W_v * v. So after this projection step, the vision and text embeddings are essentially aligned into a common multimodal embedding space, allowing their representations to interact and be combined for multimodal modeling tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, etc. More specifically, the result of the projection layer is the generated “latents.”</p><p id="07a9">Once the latents are computed, we then prepend them as image tokens before the text tokens. The reason for the prepending is that having the image before the text makes it easier for the model to learn during pretraining. Think of it as having tokens representing the actual image and then tokens representing the contents of the image in text: almost like a caption paired with an image. Our architecture is nearly identical to that of LLaVA-UHD (they choose CLIP-ViT while we use SigLIP and they work with Vicuna-13B) so we provide their illustration as reference below:</p><figure></figure><p id="8bdb">Now that we’ve established the data needed for pretraining, we can dive into what that actually looks like. In pre-training, we then use 600,000 examples of prepended images to text. In this step we keep the main weights of the Llama-3 architecture frozen. The key is that we want to only update the gradients of the projection matrix. Crucially, we keep the rest of the weights frozen. And with that, we’ve wrapped up our intuition and process for the pretraining step. The key here was aligning the embedded images (latents) with their text in a joint representation and then pretraining LLaMA-3 to focus on updating the projection matrix based on the examples encountered.</p><p id="7888"><strong>Supervised Finetuning</strong></p><p id="f3f5">Following pretraining, we perform supervised finetuning to enhance the performance of our model. In this step, we are freezing our computed embeddings (from the projection layer) and we keep everything except the vision and projection matrices frozen. In other words, if you look at the image below, the red components are unfrozen while the blue components are frozen. This is meant to serve as “instruction” finetuning — in other words making the model stronger for a multimodal text output. In this stage, we use 1M examples (7M split images).</p><figure></figure><h2 id="f170"><strong>In Summary</strong></h2><ul><li id="4f32">We add a vision encoder to Llama3 8B</li><li id="0665">Our model offers 10–20% performance boosts over Llava the current open-source SOTA vision language model.</li><li id="6423">We offer comparable vision abilities of models close to 100x* larger in size like GPT4v, Gemini Ultra, and Claude Opus.</li><li id="792d">We describe an efficient pipeline to pretrain and instruction finetune the model in under $500.</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        When an user directs their web browser to an HTTP URL, it's a common practice for the service to redirect the
        request to a corresponding HTTPS page. This unencrypted part of the communication flow has its flaws. Third
        parties in shared networks, as well as network intermediaries, could
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniffing_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sniff</a>
        passwords and other secrets from the initial HTTP traffic
        or even impersonate the web server with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITM</a> attack.
        Nevertheless, redirection has been an useful first step in the transition from the largely unencrypted early web
        to the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely encrypted</a> web of today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later techniques tightened the security story further. Servers can now send <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSTS</a> along with the initial HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection response, telling the
        user's browser to use only HTTPS for that domain from
        then on. This limits the window of opportunity for trivial sniffing and MITM attacks to the first request.
        Browsers then added <a href="https://hstspreload.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSTS preload
          lists</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/https-only-prefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTPS-Only modes</a> that allow skipping the initial unencrypted request altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of usability-security tradeoff it all makes sense for user-facing sites. But interestingly,
        the redirection approach also appears to be widely adopted for APIs. APIs are mostly consumed by other software
        so the same usability arguments don't apply there. Moreover, many programmatic API clients don't tend to keep
        browser-like state of things like HSTS headers they have seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post argues that, due to these factors, the common practice of redirecting API calls from HTTP to
        HTTPS should be reconsidered. While the post mostly refers to REST APIs, its points also apply to other styles
        of APIs that use HTTP(S) as a transport mechanism.
      </p>

      <h2>A Simple Typo Is Enugh</h2>
      <p>
        At <a href="https://badrap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work</a>, we were building a new
        integration against a third-party API. The initial code commit contained a mistyped API base URL
        <code>"http://..."</code> instead of <code>"https://..."</code>. A pretty easy mistake to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The error was essentially masked during runtime: The third-party API responded to every request with a 301
        redirect to their HTTPS side. Node.js's built-in <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#fetch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fetch</a>
        happily and <em>quietly</em> followed those redirects to the HTTPS endpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Every single one of our API requests now sent the API keys over the network in plaintext</strong>,
        before then sending them again to the encrypted endpoint. The one letter omission could have exposed the used
        API keys to third parties without us realizing it. As the integration would have worked, there's a good
        chance that code would have leaked any secrets in the API calls for years. In the long run, the
        probabilities for malice tend to accumulate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily we spotted the error during the code review before the error could propagate to production or even
        testing. We also realized that our <em>own</em> API also did similar HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.
      </p>

      <h2>The Fail-fast Principle</h2>
      <p>
        When an API redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS - and the API client silently follows those redirects - it tends to
        hide mistyped URLs like in the case described above. A simple one-letter omission can easily be ignored, end up
        in production, and compromise the entire system's confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, it's better to adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fail-fast principle</a>: unencrypted API calls should fail in a
        spectacular and visible way so that the developer can easily spot and fix the typo as early as possible during
        the development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great solution for failing fast would be to disable the API server's HTTP interface altogether and not even
        answer to connections attempts to port 80. If the initial unencrypted connection is never established then the
        API keys aren't sent, mitigating sniffing attacks and limiting the window of opportunity for MITM attacks to an
        extremely small time window. This approach is viable for APIs hosted under their own domains like
        <code>api.example.com</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our own API was served under the <code>/api</code> path from the same domain as our service's web UI. We
        didn't have the guts to disable the HTTP interface for that domain altogether, so we picked next best
        option: all unencrypted HTTP requests made under <code>/api</code> now return a descriptive error message along
        with the HTTP status code 403. Some initial plaintext requests might be made during development, but they're
        much easier for developers to notice.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Else?</h2>
      <p>
        That took care of our own API. We also pinged the third-party API provider and a couple of friends that they
        might want to check their APIs. And who knows, maybe there were some commonly used APIs that accept API keys (or
        other credentials) and also redirect from HTTP to HTTPS?
      </p>
      <p>
        I listed a bunch of well known APIs from the top of my head and did a little surveys. Several of them returned
        HTTP errors or declined to connections altogether. They're listed here with cURL spells for checking out their
        detailed responses:

      <p>
        I didn't report these findings separately to all of these API providers. There were some outliers not listed
        here that I did contact, with varying results. More on that later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take each individual result with a grain of salt: I had to test some of these APIs without valid
        credentials, or with credentials used in documentation examples. But the overall pattern indicates that the
        habit of APIs redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS is quite widespread. Why is that?
      </p>

      <h2>Best Practices Need Practice Too</h2>
      <p>
        When speaking with people about this topic, many have noted that HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects from APIs have obvious
        downsides - in hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>Redirects for user-facing applications are often mentioned in lists best practices and cheat sheets, <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-tls-for-all-pages" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">like the ones published by OWASP (The Open Worldwide Application
          Security Project)</a>.
        Recommendations specifically aimed for APIs seem rare in contrast. I found just few mentions, for example an
        excellent PDF slideset called <a href="https://owasp.org/www-chapter-belgium/assets/2018/2018-10-23/OWASP_20181023_CommonAPISecurityPitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Common API Security Pitfalls"</a> by <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@PhilippeDeRyck" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Philippe De
          Ryck</a>,
        buried deep within the OWASP website:
      </p>

        <img alt="Slide 8 of &quot;Common API Security Pitfalls&quot;: &quot;API-only endpoints should disable HTTP and only need to support HTTPS.&quot;" src="https://jviide.iki.fi/deryck-slide-8.png">

            section.
          </small>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        My Google-fu might just be bad. But maybe each best practice item recommending HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects
        for user-facing sites should have an explicit caveat attached, prominently advising against such redirects for
        APIs. Therefore I opened <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/1407" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an issue</a> that suggests amending OWASP's Transport Layer Security Cheat Sheet
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <h2>Bonus Round: Popular APIs That Respond In Plaintext</h2>
      <p>
        While reviewing the list of APIs, I bumped into some popular ones that neither redirected nor failed
        unencrypted requests. They just responded to unencrypted HTTP requests with unencrypted HTTP responses, without
        enforcing HTTPS at any stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe they had their reasons, or maybe they had just accidentally misconfigured their reverse proxies.
        Regardless, seeing that they all handle potentially sensitive data, I contacted these API providers through
        their respective security channels and explained the problem. The providers are listed below in the order of
        reporting. I'll unredact their names and details when they've given a definite response, or otherwise after
        a reasonable amount of time has passed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider A</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-17">2024-05-17</time> through their
          vulnerability reporting email address. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider B</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through their HackerOne
          program. Got a prompt triage response, stating that attacks requiring MITM (or physical access to a user's
          device) are outside the scope of the program. Sent back a response explaining that MITM or physical access was
          not required for sniffing. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider C</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through their security
          email address. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li id="virustotal">
          <a href="https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirusTotal
            API</a>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through Google's <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bug Hunters</a> site
          (VirusTotal is owned by a Google subsidiary that got merged into Google Cloud). The
          API responds in plaintext to requests like for example this (where <code>$API_KEY</code> is a valid API key):

          <p>
            <code>curl -i -H 'x-apikey: $API_KEY' http://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/ip_addresses/1.1.1.1</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            The report got promptly triaged. Received a response on <time datetime="2024-05-24">2024-05-24</time>, cited
            in part below:
          </p>

          
          
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS for APIs can be more harmful than helpful due to the nature of APIs. Unlike
        user-facing web pages, APIs are primarily consumed by other software. API clients often follow redirects
        automatically and do not maintain state or support security headers like HSTS. This can lead to silent failures
        where sensitive data in each API request is initially transmitted in plaintext over the network, unencrypted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's adopt a fail-fast approach and disable the HTTP interface entirely or return clear
        error responses for unencrypted requests. This ensures that developers can quickly notice and fix accidental
        use <code>http://</code> URLs to <code>https://</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several well-known and popular APIs also redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. This behavior seems to be
        widespread. Maybe it's time we amend best practices to explicitly recommend that APIs flat our reject
        unencrypted requests.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-ftx-executive-ryan-salame-sentenced-90-months-prison">https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-ftx-executive-ryan-salame-sentenced-90-months-prison</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40504228">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that RYAN SALAME was sentenced today to 90&nbsp;months in prison. &nbsp;SALAME previously pled guilty to conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the Federal Election Commission and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business before U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who imposed today’s sentence.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Ryan Salame agreed to advance the interests of FTX, Alameda Research, and his co-conspirators through an unlawful political influence campaign and through an unlicensed money transmitting business, which helped FTX grow faster and larger by operating outside of the law.&nbsp; Salame’s involvement in two serious federal crimes undermined public trust in American elections and the integrity of the financial system.&nbsp; Today’s sentence underscores the substantial consequences for such offenses.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the filings and statements made during court proceedings:</p>

<p>RYAN SALAME was a high-ranking official at Alameda Research, the quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm founded by Samuel Bankman-Fried, from 2019 to 2021.&nbsp; In or about October 2021, SALAME was named co-CEO of FTX’s Bahamian affiliate FTX Digital Markets Ltd.</p>

<p>While working at Alameda Research and FTX, SALAME conspired with Bankman-Fried and other employees of FTX and Alameda Research to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, unlawfully using FTX, Alameda Research, and an entity called “North Dimension” to transmit FTX customer funds without a license.&nbsp; The conspirators and others at Alameda Research and FTX also made false statements to U.S. banks in order to maintain their unlawful businesses.</p>

<p>Additionally, beginning in or around 2020, SALAME conspired with Bankman-Fried and FTX executive Nishad Singh to donate campaign contributions in a manner that obscured Bankman-Fried’s association with certain of the contributions.&nbsp; These donations were made to improve Bankman-Fried’s personal standing in Washington, D.C., increase FTX’s profile, and curry favor with candidates that could help pass legislation favorable to FTX, Alameda, or Bankman-Fried’s personal agenda. &nbsp;In total, SALAME and his co-conspirators made over 300 political contributions, totaling tens of millions of dollars, that were unlawful because they were made in the name of a straw donor or paid for with corporate funds and caused false information to be reported by campaigns and political action committees to the Federal Election Commission.</p>

<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>In addition to the prison term, SALAME, 30, of Potomac, Maryland, was sentenced to three&nbsp;years of supervised release and ordered to pay more than $6 million in forfeiture and more than $5 million in restitution.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, with assistance from the Office’s Illicit Finance and Money Laundering and Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Units. &nbsp;Assistant U.S. Attorneys Danielle Kudla, Samuel Raymond, Thane Rehn, Nicolas Roos, and Danielle Sassoon are in charge of the prosecution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>Two years ago</span> when “Michael,” an owner of <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a>, contacted Joe Grand to help recover access to about $2 million worth of <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a> he stored in encrypted format on his computer, Grand turned him down.</p><p>Michael, who is based in Europe and asked to remain anonymous, stored the cryptocurrency in a password-protected digital wallet. He generated a password using the RoboForm password manager and stored that password in a file encrypted with a tool called TrueCrypt. At some point, that file got corrupted and Michael lost access to the 20-character password he had generated to secure his 43.6 BTC (worth a total of about €4,000, or $5,300, in 2013). Michael used the RoboForm password manager to generate the password but did not store it in his manager. He worried that someone would hack his computer and obtain the password.</p><p>“At [that] time, I was really paranoid with my security,” he laughs.</p><p>Grand is a famed hardware hacker who in 2022 helped another crypto wallet owner <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/24/22898712/crypto-hardware-wallet-hacking-lost-bitcoin-ethereum-nft">recover access to $2 million in cryptocurrency</a> he thought he’d lost forever after forgetting the PIN to his Trezor wallet. Since then, dozens of people have contacted Grand to help them recover their treasure. But Grand, known by the hacker handle “Kingpin,” turns down most of them, for various reasons.</p><p>Grand is an <a data-offer-url="http://www.grandideastudio.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.grandideastudio.com/&quot;}" href="http://www.grandideastudio.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">electrical engineer</a> who began hacking computing hardware at age 10 and in 2008 cohosted the Discovery Channel’s <em>Prototype This</em> show. He now consults with companies that build complex digital systems to help them understand how hardware hackers like him might subvert their systems. He cracked the Trezor wallet in 2022 using complex hardware techniques that forced the USB-style wallet to reveal its password.</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"><div data-testid="IframeEmbedContainer"><p><iframe height="300px" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin" title="Embedded Frame" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o5IySpAkThg" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p></div></figure><p>But Michael stored his cryptocurrency in a software-based wallet, which meant none of Grand’s hardware skills were relevant this time. He considered brute-forcing Michael’s password—writing a script to automatically guess millions of possible passwords to find the correct one—but determined this wasn’t feasible. He briefly considered that the RoboForm password manager Michael used to generate his password might have a flaw in the way it generated passwords, which would allow him to guess the password more easily. Grand, however, doubted such a flaw existed.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Michael contacted multiple people who specialize in cracking cryptography; they all told him “there’s no chance” of retrieving his money. But last June he approached Grand again, hoping to convince him to help, and this time Grand agreed to give it a try, working with a friend named Bruno in Germany who also hacks digital wallets.</p><p>Grand and Bruno spent months reverse engineering the version of the RoboForm program that they thought Michael had used in 2013 and found that the pseudo-random number generator used to generate passwords in that version—and subsequent versions until 2015—did indeed have a significant flaw that made the random number generator not so random. The RoboForm program unwisely tied the random passwords it generated to the date and time on the user’s computer—it determined the computer’s date and time, and then generated passwords that were predictable. If you knew the date and time and other parameters, you could compute any password that would have been generated on a certain date and time in the past.</p><p>If Michael knew the day or general time frame in 2013 when he generated it, as well as the parameters he used to generate the password (for example, the number of characters in the password, including lower- and upper-case letters, figures, and special characters), this would narrow the possible password guesses to a manageable number. Then they could hijack the RoboForm function responsible for checking the date and time on a computer and get it to travel back in time, believing the current date was a day in the 2013 time frame when Michael generated his password. RoboForm would then spit out the same passwords it generated on the days in 2013.</p><p>There was one problem: Michael couldn’t remember when he created the password.</p><p>According to the log on his software wallet, Michael moved bitcoin into his wallet for the first time on April 14, 2013. But he couldn’t remember if he generated the password the same day or some time before or after this. So, looking at the parameters of other passwords he generated using RoboForm, Grand and Bruno configured RoboForm to generate 20-character passwords with upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and eight special characters from March 1 to April 20, 2013.</p><p>It failed to generate the right password. So Grand and Bruno lengthened the time frame from April 20 to June 1, 2013, using the same parameters. Still no luck.</p><p>Michael says they kept coming back to him, asking if he was sure about the parameters he’d used. He stuck to his first answer.</p><p>“They really annoyed me, because who knows what I did 10 years ago,” he recalls. He found other passwords he generated with RoboForm in 2013, and two of them did not use special characters, so Grand and Bruno adjusted. Last November, they reached out to Michael to set up a meeting in person. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, they will ask me again for the settings.”</p><p>Instead, they revealed that they had finally found the correct password—no special characters. It was generated on May 15, 2013, at 4:10:40 pm GMT.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We ultimately got lucky that our parameters and time range was right. If either of those were wrong, we would have … continued to take guesses/shots in the dark,” Grand says in an email to WIRED. “It would have taken significantly longer to precompute all the possible passwords.”</p><p>Grand and Bruno <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5IySpAkThg">created a video</a> to explain the technical details more thoroughly.</p><p>RoboForm, made by US-based Siber Systems, was one of the first password managers on the market, and <a data-offer-url="https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/&quot;}" href="https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">currently has more than 6 million users</a> worldwide, according to a company report. In 2015, Siber seemed to fix the RoboForm password manager. In a cursory glance, Grand and Bruno couldn’t find any sign that the pseudo-random number generator in the 2015 version used the computer’s time, which makes them think they removed it to fix the flaw, though Grand says they would need to examine it more thoroughly to be certain.</p><p>Siber Systems confirmed to WIRED that it did fix the issue with version 7.9.14 of RoboForm, released June 10, 2015, but a spokesperson wouldn’t answer questions about how it did so. In a <a data-offer-url="https://www.roboform.com/news-windows" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.roboform.com/news-windows&quot;}" href="https://www.roboform.com/news-windows" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> on the company’s website, it mentions only that Siber programmers made changes to&nbsp;“increase randomness of generated passwords,” but it doesn’t say how they did this. Siber spokesman Simon Davis says that “RoboForm 7 was discontinued in 2017.”</p><p>Grand says that, without knowing how Siber fixed the issue, attackers may still be able to regenerate passwords generated by versions of RoboForm released before the fix in 2015. He’s also not sure if current versions contain the problem.</p><p>“I'm still not sure I would trust it without knowing how they actually improved the password generation in more recent versions,” he says. “I'm not sure if RoboForm knew how bad this particular weakness was.”</p><p>Customers may also still be using passwords that were generated with the early versions of the program before the fix. It doesn’t appear that Siber ever notified customers when it released the fixed version 7.9.14 in 2015 that they should generate new passwords for critical accounts or data. The company didn’t respond to a question about this.</p><p>If Siber didn’t inform customers, this would mean that anyone like Michael who used RoboForm to generate passwords prior to 2015—and are still using those passwords—may have vulnerable passwords that hackers can regenerate.</p><p>“We know that most people don't change passwords unless they're prompted to do so,” Grand says. “Out of 935 passwords in my password manager (not RoboForm), 220 of them are from 2015 and earlier, and most of them are [for] sites I still use.”</p><p>Depending on what the company did to fix the issue in 2015, newer passwords may also be vulnerable.</p><p>Last November, Grand and Bruno deducted a percentage of bitcoins from Michael’s account for the work they did, then gave him the password to access the rest. The bitcoin was worth $38,000 per coin at the time. Michael waited until it rose to $62,000 per coin and sold some of it. He now has 30 BTC, now worth $3 million, and is waiting for the value to rise to $100,000 per coin.</p><p>Michael says he was lucky that he lost the password years ago because, otherwise, he would have sold off the bitcoin when it was worth $40,000 a coin and missed out on a greater fortune.</p><p>“That I lost the password was financially a good thing.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>TOKYO (AP) — The operator of Japan’s destroyed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant demonstrated Tuesday how a remote-controlled robot would retrieve tiny bits of melted fuel debris from one of three damaged reactors later this year for the first time since the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-fukushima-quake-tsunami-anniversary-0089f053d670c78dafd9578c242e1fb3">2011 meltdown</a></span>.</p><p>Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings plans to deploy a “telesco-style” extendable pipe robot into Fukushima Daiichi No. 2 reactor to test the removal of debris from its primary containment vessel by October.</p><p>That work is more than two years behind schedule. The removal of melted fuel was supposed to begin in late 2021 but has been plagued with delays, underscoring the difficulty of recovering from the magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011.</p><p>During the demonstration at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ shipyard in Kobe, western Japan, where the robot has been developed, a device equipped with tongs slowly descended from the telescopic pipe to a heap of gravel and picked up a granule.</p>
    

<p>TEPCO plans to remove less than 3 grams (0.1 ounce) of debris in the test at the Fukushima plant.</p><p>“We believe the upcoming test removal of fuel debris from Unit 2 is an extremely important step to steadily carry out future decommissioning work,” said Yusuke Nakagawa, a TEPCO group manager for the fuel debris retrieval program. “It is important to proceed with the test removal safely and steadily.”</p>



<p>About 880 tons of highly radioactive melted nuclear fuel remain inside the three damaged reactors. Critics say the 30- to 40-year cleanup target set by the government and TEPCO for Fukushima Daiichi is overly optimistic. The damage in each reactor is different, and plans must accommodate their conditions.</p>
    
<p>Better understanding the melted fuel debris from inside the reactors is key to their decommissioning. TEPCO deployed four mini drones into the No. 1 reactor’s primary containment vessel earlier this year to capture images from the areas where robots had not reached.</p><h2>___</h2><p>AP video journalist Ayaka McGill contributed to this report.</p>

<p dir="auto">It can be launched via simple:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker pull openkoda/openkoda:latest"><pre><code>docker pull openkoda/openkoda:latest
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Please note that in that case Postgres needs to be already in place and <code>SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL</code>, <code>SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME</code>, <code>SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD</code> env variables needs to be adjusted when running docker (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openkoda/openkoda" rel="nofollow">see Docker Hub for detailed options</a>)</p>

Here is a useful one-liner :</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="incArticle"><p>OpenAI's credibility — and the credibility of its CEO, Sam Altman — is crumbling.</p><p>Last week, amid a surprise string of high-profile executive and safety team departures, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release"><em>V</em><em>ox</em> revealed that</a> the ChatGPT creator had pressured employees into signing draconian non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements by threatening to claw back exiting OpenAI employees' vested equity in the multibillion-dollar AI company.</p><p>Clawing back vested equity — in short, the amount of company ownership that an employee has gained through their months or years of working there — is a highly unusual practice to begin with. This is especially true in the startup-powered Silicon Valley, where tech workers often forgo high salaries in favor of equity agreements based on the hope that they'll get rich later when a successful startup like OpenAI eventually goes public. For OpenAI to play bizarre contractual take-backsies in exchange for narrative control over former employees would be an <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-nda-criticism">awful look</a> for any company — let alone a supposedly "open" venture claiming it's the best one to build the imagined all-knowing AI that OpenAI's leaders say will power humanity's future.</p><p>In response to the <em>Vox</em> report, Altman apologetically took to X-formerly-Twitter to admit that yes, "there was a provision about potential equity cancellation in our previous exit docs." But according to the CEO, though the clause was there, the company never <em>actually&nbsp;</em>clawed anything back. Most importantly, he further <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/sam-altman-nda-superintelligent">claimed</a> that he had no knowledge of the provision.</p><p>"This is on me and one of the few times I've been genuinely embarrassed running OpenAI," Altman continued in a tone that can only be described as sheepish, "I did not know this was happening and I should have."</p><p>But <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/351132/openai-vested-equity-nda-sam-altman-documents-employees">according to <em>Vox's</em> latest follow-up</a>, Altman wasn't in the dark about the equity clauses, as he claimed in his tail-between-legs tweet.</p><p>Documentation reviewed by <em>Vox</em> reveals that several company leaders — including OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon, who reportedly told staffers following the initial <em>Vox </em>report that OpenAI leadership "caught" the provision "~month ago" — signed documents that plainly outlined the stifling clawback provision. The list of executives includes Altman, whose signature, according to <em>Vox</em>'s reporting, is on "incorporation documents" for the holding company that manages OpenAI equity; these documents contain "multiple passages with language that gives the company near-arbitrary authority to claw back equity from former employees" or, if employees choose not to actually return the equity, "block them from selling it" altogether.</p><p>In other words, unless someone forged the CEO's signature, he gave express permission for these clauses to exist. Outside of forgery, there are only two plausible reasons for Altman's alleged lack of knowledge: either he didn't fully read the employment contracts he was signing or he was lying.</p><p>Complicating the denials further is the way employees were reportedly treated on their way out. According to the <em>Vox</em> report, the equity provisions were no secret to OpenAI representatives handling departures, who in some cases gave outgoing employees just seven days to make the incredibly complicated decision about their future — all the while, in instances reviewed by <em>Vox</em>, emphasizing possible clawbacks.</p><p>"We want to make sure you understand that if you don't sign, it could impact your equity," one rep told an outgoing employee, according to <em>Vox</em>. "That's true for everyone, and we're just doing things by the book."</p><p>But again, as the report reiterates, this is <em>not </em>"by-the-book" behavior.</p><p>"For a company to threaten to claw back already-vested equity is egregious and unusual," Chambord Benton-Hayes, a California employment law attorney, told <em>Vox.</em></p><p>When <em>Vox</em> asked OpenAI to explain how the provisions could have possibly wound up in documents signed by Altman without Altman actually knowing about them, Kwon non-answered that "we are sorry for the distress this has caused great people who have worked hard for us."</p><p>"We have been working to fix this as quickly as possible," Kwon — who, again, also signed papers delineating this provision — continued in his statement. "We will work even harder to be better."</p><p>But that's getting harder and harder to believe. Last year, when Altman was briefly forced out of OpenAI in what was pretty much a corporate coup, those who voted to oust the CEO — many of whom departed after losing said coup — claimed that Altman had been "inconsistently candid" in his communications with the board. Altman and OpenAI are also caught up in a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/law-experts-scarlett-johansson-strong-case-openai">brewing legal storm</a> with actress Scarlett Johansson, who claims that Altman copycatted her voice for OpenAI's new "Sky" AI assistant after she had explicitly turned Altman and OpenAI down. (Altman chalked Johansson's allegations up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-scarlett-johansson-voice-defense-sam-altman-washington-post-chatgpt-2024-5">simple miscommunication</a>.)</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-safety-worker-quit-confidence-agi">recent departures</a> have <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-researcher-quits-criticism-superallignment">ground</a> OpenAI's "Superalignment" safety team — the ones tasked with making sure a killer AI doesn't obliterate humankind — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/17/openai-superalignment-sutskever-leike.html">into dust</a>. Great stuff.</p><p>On its website, OpenAI features a "<a href="https://openai.com/charter/">charter</a>" declaring that "OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) — by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work — benefits all of humanity."</p><p>"We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI," it continues, "but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome."</p><p>The document then lists a series of "principles," which the company claims it'll follow to achieve this mission. The word "transparency" is notably absent.</p><p><strong>More on OpenAI: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/sam-altman-openai-scarlett-johansson"><em>Sam Altman Ignoring Scarlett Johansson's Lack of Consent Shows Us Exactly What Type of Person He Really Is</em></a></p><br></section></div>]]></description>

          <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to engage in a mobile ecosystem
outside of the watchful eye of the Big Tech giants and gatekeepers? A system
that includes everything from operating systems, to app stores, to cloud
services, messaging apps, email servers and more? A system that puts your
privacy first, believes in a democratic approach and healthy competition,
and a system that relies on open-source solutions to drive its software?
Welcome to <a href="https://mobifree.org/">Mobifree</a>, a human-centered, ethical
alternative, that champions privacy over profit and believes in
collaboration, sustainability and inclusiveness.</p>

<p>Everyone is locked into a mobile phone ecosystem where the terms are
dictated by a handful of Big Tech companies all located in a single
country.  From end users looking to download and use their favorite apps, to
developers who run into roadblocks when trying to get their solutions
published, to governments who are increasingly using apps as a way to
provide services to their citizens, we are all impacted by the gatekeeping,
data tracking, and railroading Big Tech is imposing on us in the current
mobile ecosystem. A new alternative is required to shape a better
future. And F-Droid is excited to be a part of creating that new mobile
ecosystem, together with our other partners in Mobifree.</p>

<p><img src="https://f-droid.org/assets/icon_dv5EXg0_UTcQ7wK2dYoloypQJfXvPPbhZ9IEg5nxYFw=.png" alt="NGI Mobifree logo"></p>

<p>For an average user, it is difficult to discern how you are being tracked,
where your private information is being saved, how it is being used and who
it is being sold to. As a long-standing champion of user and developer
rights, pushing for privacy over profit, F-Droid has always been committed
to upholding high open-source standards in the technology we create. For
more than 14 years, F-Droid has been developing solutions which act as
pieces of the alternative mobile ecosystem puzzle. So it was a natural fit
for F-Droid to become a contributing partner in the broader Mobifree
project.</p>

<p>Of particular emphasis is the impact this alternative mobile ecosystem will
have on the services governments provide their citizens. Governments at all
levels are providing services through mobile apps. And in many cases, mobile
apps are becoming the preferred way to access important services. These apps
are only available via the Apple App Store or Google Play. And installing
apps from those stores requires agreeing to their Terms of Services. Both
app stores were built on tracking users to sell their data, thereby giving
Apple and Google power over how citizens receive services from their own
governments. Even the governments themselves are beholden to the Big Tech
gatekeepers: citizens and government officials and employees must use apps
that are only published on Apple and Google.</p>

<p>Austria provides a few specific examples of how governments interact with
the current ecosystem at multiple levels. After COVID-19 countermeasures
forced schools to adopt online learning, many public schools required
education apps for their students, parents and teachers in order to stay
connected. Public health insurance providers require a specific app called
“Handy Signatur” to be downloaded in order for citizens to access their
accounts online. People with the Handy Signatur app can sign petitions, and
download vaccination certificates, sometimes required for work or leisure
activities. Without this app, it is much more work and effort and is
borderline impossible in some cases to engage in certain activities.</p>

<p>Governments around the world are taking action to reign in the dominance of
Big Tech. South Africa and the
<a href="https://theplatformlaw.blog/2021/12/17/the-interim-report-of-the-cmas-market-study-on-mobile-ecosystems-a-great-piece-of-work/">UK</a>
have changed their competition policy to include user freedom in what they
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24164204/uk-dmcc-law-big-tech-regulation">regulate</a>.
Japan is working on new laws to <a href="https://content.clearygottlieb.com/antitrust/digital-markets-regulation-handbook/japan/index.html">open
up</a>
their mobile markets. And even the US government and many individual US
states have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/19/1220202154/google-to-pay-700-million-in-case-over-whether-its-app-store-is-an-illegal-monop">sued Big
Tech</a>
to stop monopolistic behaviors.</p>

<p>The EU is also taking a step towards creating distance between its citizens
and Big Tech gatekeepers. They passed a landmark law: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act">Digital Markets
Act</a>, representing a
whole new approach to tackling gatekeeper companies that aim to keep all
sorts of competition out.  It builds upon the successes of the EU’s General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), taking an important step in a more
ethical, democratic and citizens-first direction.  All of these efforts are
helping to open up possibilities for mobile users. And thanks to the
Mobifree partnership, funded by an EU Horizon Europe grant, F-Droid can
share open-source, privacy-driven solutions with a larger audience.</p>

<p>In fact Europe is already seeing significant changes as a result of the
Digital Markets Act (DMA). Google has shut out other app stores by ensuring
that they have a third-class user experience. The DMA means that Google is
now legally forbidden from giving preference to their own app store over
alternatives like F-Droid.  Additionally, Apple has opened up to external
app stores for the first time ever.  And while these are great first steps
in the right direction, regulations and litigation do not build
software. With this in mind, Mobifree is poised to take action on the new
opportunities in the market, to build an unprecedented mobile experience for
users and developers. One that centers around ethical practices, digital
sovereignty, fairness, sustainability and inclusiveness.</p>

<p>F-Droid will play a major role in this project, tasked with creating a
decentralized distribution system for developers to deliver apps to Android
users. The impact will be an opening of the app market for Android,
improving honest competition around app development. And a foundational
guiding principle is to provide privacy controls to users, without locking
anyone out from participating. The app distribution system will focus on a
3-party interaction between app developers, app stores and app users where
every party will have freedom of choice at all points of interaction. The
system will have no terms of service or even user accounts to sign up
for. Developers can publish their own apps, via their own repositories. Any
app store can use those repositories to provide users with a method to
install those apps. And if the app is open source, it can be included in the
main F-Droid.org repository, where it will be reviewed using F-Droid’s
proven ethical review process. Users will be given true choice in terms of
their apps and app store preferences, additional privacy guardrails and
increased transparency into what is happening with their data.</p>

<p>F-Droid is one participating organization who has joined forces to help
create this new mobile ecosystem. However, additional input, expertise,
inspiration and work will be needed in order to break the traditional
framework established by Big Tech. From community outreach to legal support,
from developers, to researchers and end users, we welcome all forms of
support. If you are a curious citizen interested in taking part in the
Mobifree movement, we encourage you to reach out to us at f-droid.org and
see how you can take part in this exciting mobile alternative.</p>

<p>(<em>We will be tracking work under this
<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101135795">grant</a> using the

          <strong>Do you ever think that copywriting has become too self-aware for
            its own good?
          </strong>
          It's like we collectively decided to drop the corporate facade of
          prestige in favor of the <em>"wink wink we're fun too!"</em> brand of
          language. From websites to ads to the back of shipping trucks, it
          feels like every company's identity has become a collection of short
          statements vaguely related to their industry, in pun form, devoid of
          any actual attempt at humor. It's akin to a child trying to formulate
          a joke: clearly understanding the structure and the components of
          comedy, yet missing what makes it funny. I'm not saying this is
          necessarily a good or a bad thing, it's just something that I have
          noticed. It makes sense to do something like that
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx5YqFKjTCY" target="_blank">if you're writing posters for a animated movie</a>, but when it comes to companies valued higher than the GDP of some
          countries it loses all relatability. Let's be real, if this charade of
          a website was an actual startup, we'd probably wear t-shirts that say
          <em>"This isn't a revolution. It's 33<span id="third">⅓</span>
            of them."</em>
          while we'd get articles written about our fun company culture, the Bob
          Dylan quotes graffiti'd on the wall, the meeting rooms named after
          each of the Jackson 5, and the pink neon in the entrance that says
          <em>"Like a record, Baby."</em>. Oh, and while I'm at it what is it
          with the period after each of those taglines? Normally I am not one to
          complain about proper punctuation but at this point it seems more like
          a thinly veiled attempt at recapturing some of that seriousness
          combined with an unwillingness to commit to the bit. Because they
          really want you to know that to them, it's not a joke. it's a
          statement.
        </p>

        <p id="oh">
          On a slightly unrelated note, I made an app that helps you
          <span id="highlight">calibrate your turntable.</span>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="mj">As easy as 1-2-3.</h2>

      <p>
        Do you remember the early days of the iPhone, where every once in a
        while a new app would come out and it would do just one completely new
        thing, and nothing else? There was so much excitement around finding new
        use cases and it was all
        <em>"Oh yeah this is the app I use to pretend I'm shaving my face. And
          this is app I use to see where the ISS is"</em>. I can't remember the last time I genuinely got excited about some
        unitasker app like that and I think that's too bad. That's why Grooved
        tells you your turntable's speed <strong>in just one tap.</strong>

<p>The quality of the air we breathe is among the biggest factors influencing human health and well-being worldwide. Air pollution—from fossil fuel combustion in the power, industrial, residential, and transportation sectors as well as from wildfires, agricultural practices, and many other sources—<a href="https://eos.org/articles/the-complex-relationship-between-hurricanes-air-pollution-and-climate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interacts with the climate</a>, <a href="https://eos.org/articles/wildfire-particulates-raise-cardiopulmonary-health-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exacerbates</a> <a href="https://eos.org/articles/stroke-deaths-rise-life-expectancy-falls-with-polluted-air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless</a> <a href="https://eos.org/articles/air-pollution-linked-to-adverse-mental-health-effects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical</a> <a href="https://eos.org/research-spotlights/establishing-a-link-between-air-pollution-and-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conditions</a>, and is estimated to cause <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of deaths annually</a>.</p>

<p>Safeguarding public health and combating climate change depend on robust impact assessments and eﬀective policymaking with respect to air quality, which in turn require an accurate understanding of air composition and the processes that control how and why it changes.</p>

<p>For decades, scientists have applied multiscale modeling approaches informed by observations to help advance the understanding and predictability of air quality and its interactions with the climate. Such investigations are becoming more in-depth, more capable of revealing details of the processes at play, and more accessible to broader communities.</p>

<p>Key to the continued success of such approaches is that the models used keep up with advances in scientific knowledge, modeling techniques, and the capabilities of Earth-observing systems and that the valuable features of the models are well recognized by the scientists and decisionmakers who interpret their results.</p>

<p>Here we look back on the history of one such influential model, the pioneering Sulfur Transport and Deposition Model (STEM), and we look forward to how it can keep revealing more about air quality, climate, and other societally important issues.</p>

<h3><strong>Sulfur Model Shows the Way</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>Development of the Sulfur Transport and Deposition Model (STEM) started in 1976. At the time, fossil fuel consumption was setting records, and effective technologies for scrubbing sulfur species from emissions were not widely implemented.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Development of STEM started in 1976, much earlier than many other contemporary air quality and atmospheric chemistry models. At the time, fossil fuel consumption was setting records, and effective technologies for scrubbing sulfur species from emissions were not widely implemented. The resulting atmospheric <a href="https://eos.org/research-spotlights/effects-of-acid-rain-climate-change-on-freshwater-lakes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sulfur pollution and acid rain</a> caused increasingly negative impacts on humans, infrastructure, and ecosystems. These impacts also raised awareness that air pollution was not just a local problem: Emissions from one place could affect other places hundreds and even thousands of kilometers downwind. STEM was initially designed to help understand the transport, transformation, and removal processes of atmospheric sulfur and to inform emissions reduction strategies [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(84)90070-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael and Peters</em></a>, 1984].</p>


<p>Since its creation, STEM has evolved to cover a broader set of key air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, which also cause regional and even intercontinental problems [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0960-1686(91)90085-L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 1991; <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2017]. Coupled with widely used meteorological models, including multiple versions of the <a href="https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weather Research and Forecasting</a> and <a href="https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MM5</a> models, STEM has been adopted to study air quality in the United States and regions in the Arctic, Asia, and South America, contributing to hundreds of peer-reviewed publications. These studies have highlighted the usefulness of such models for addressing a wide range of scientific questions related to the atmospheric distributions of chemicals, quantification of these chemicals’ environmental impacts, and evaluation of environmental mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>By answering these science questions, STEM also has demonstrated the capability of models to support the design and deployment of airborne and ground-based ﬁeld experiments, many of which have been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led by NASA</a> or other agencies. For example, during the 2001 NASA Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (<a href="https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/tracep/tracep.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRACE-P</a>) experiment, based out of Hong Kong, STEM forecasts of pollution outflow regions over the Pacific Ocean were used daily to help plan locations for aircraft sampling of air pollutants (Figure 1). Applying STEM in the field by design also enabled its use in interpreting and providing context for collected observations, which in turn helped improve the model [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 2003]. The use of air quality models in such forecast applications has since expanded dramatically, and today these models are used operationally at urban, national, and global scales.</p>

<p>STEM has further served scientific communities by advancing satellite missions, such as <a href="https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aura</a>. It has supported <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2346/background-ozone-a-major-issue-in-us-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novel applications</a> of the main data products from Aura’s onboard sensors [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JD022993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2015], for example, and stimulated development and evaluation of <a href="https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/TES/TL2OCSN_8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new retrieval products</a>. And it has contributed to international multimodel intercomparison experiments, including the <a href="https://www.acap.asia/en/research-main/mics-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(01)00448-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 2002] and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2017]. These experiments helped provide more robust estimates of air pollution source-receptor relationships and environmental impacts, and they helped scientists better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various models compared.</p>

<h3><strong>Simplicity, Stability, and Flexibility</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>The long history and wide applications of STEM have helped shape its main technical strengths.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The long history and wide applications of STEM have helped shape its main technical strengths. These strengths include its structural simplicity, which allows users to make changes to it easily, and its stability, which is built upon decades of tuning with field and laboratory measurements and other information from past applications. In addition, it features ﬂexible tools to generate chemical boundary conditions and other key inputs as well as advanced data assimilation capability. Of particular note is the development of the <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~asandu/Software/Kpp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kinetic PreProcessor</a> software, which allowed for easily changing the chemical mechanisms used in STEM (and other models) and improved its ability to assimilate observational data [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2004.10.011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sandu et al.</em></a>, 2005].</p>

<p>These features have enabled researchers using the model to make notable policy-relevant scientific contributions in both the air quality and climate communities and to train dozens of students and early-career scientists globally. Such contributions include using real-world observations to derive surface-atmosphere ﬂuxes of short- and long-lived climate forcers and their precursors—such as nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and toxic airborne materials including mercury compounds—and to understand the factors controlling them [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1164015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Campbell et al.</em></a>, 2008].</p>

<p>STEM also has helped in attributing the effects of aerosols on air quality and climate to emissions from different source sectors (e.g., energy production, industrial processes, transportation, residential sources, and wildfires) and in identifying sources of air pollution as atmospheric circulation and emissions patterns shift under the changing climate [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ramanathan and Carmichael</em></a>, 2008; <em>Huang et al.</em>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.01.021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2012</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JD022993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017</a>].</p>

<p>These studies based on the STEM model have inspired subsequent research and discussions about new applications. For example, they stimulated discussions on using COS as <a href="https://eos.org/features/assessing-a-new-clue-to-how-much-carbon-plants-take-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a proxy for gross primary productivity</a> because of the link between plants’ uptake of COS and CO<sub>2</sub>, which further led to developing and applying satellite-based data products to track COS.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, researchers are continuing to develop methods to reduce uncertainties in estimating how aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions from different regions and source sectors affect health and climate. In part, these efforts involve integrating Earth observations across multiple disciplines to improve process-level constraints used in making these estimates. Observation-driven analyses are also being advanced to improve estimates of background air pollution levels, information that is relevant for updating air quality standards as the climate changes.</p>

<h3><strong>Keeping Current to Stay Relevant</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>As productive as STEM has been through its history, updating it is necessary to ensure that it remains a robust option for air quality and climate scientists to study our environment and to inform policymaking.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Maintaining and enhancing the diversity of models available for air quality science and management are important because significant uncertainties remain in the predictions (and their implications) from individual models. In addition, as productive as STEM has been through its history, updating it (and similar models) is necessary to ensure that it remains a robust option for air quality and climate scientists to study our environment and to inform policymaking and the design of atmospheric observing systems.</p>

<p>Major updates to STEM are ongoing to improve how the model interfaces with up-to-date and next-generation meteorological and land surface modeling systems. These systems include, for example, the <a href="https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/mpas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model for Prediction Across Scales</a>, which can be run at variable resolutions, and the <a href="https://ral.ucar.edu/model/noah-multiparameterization-land-surface-model-noah-mp-lsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Noah-Multiparameterization land surface model</a>, which can simulate vegetation dynamics under many configurations. Such updates can facilitate improved representations of processes like atmospheric deposition. STEM also will be more closely integrated with regional and global climate models, and it will be applied at progressively finer, satellite-resolved scales of several kilometers or less.</p>

<p>We continue to collect community input on goals and updates for STEM, and suggestions are always welcome. Ideally, STEM (and other chemical transport models) should be adapted to perform on new generations of high-performance supercomputing systems, perhaps in combination with <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/24938/chapter/7#177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commercial cloud computing</a>, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and other technologies.</p>

<p>Additional updates could include capabilities to provide detailed documentation of model elements, features, and steps to execute it, as well as polished postprocessing and visualization routines to help improve the interpretability and communication of model results. Further, models could be updated to support crowdsourced science projects, by integrating data from or feeding data to them, and the design and application of low-cost spaceborne and surface observing systems. User communities should be able to access and contribute easily to synthesized and modernized models and their associated documentation from centralized, open-access platforms.</p>

<p>These updates would allow models like STEM to be implemented over wider spatial and time scales than previously possible and to support studies of emerging topics, such as those <a href="https://eos.org/articles/some-communities-feel-the-effects-of-air-pollution-more-than-others" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">related to environmental justice</a>. Simulations of regional to local air quality as well as of its contributing factors, combined with socioeconomic data, could clarify the picture of <a href="https://eos.org/articles/indias-disadvantaged-groups-face-more-air-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environmental inequity</a> across an area of interest and help evaluate potential solutions involving migration, relocation, or <a href="https://eos.org/science-updates/converging-on-solutions-to-plan-sustainable-cities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urban</a> or <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/video/what-ecosystem-based-adaptation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ecosystem</a> adaptations.</p>

<p>For decades, the STEM model has proven its value by contributing insights into air quality, climate, and the environment to help shape scientific understanding, science-based policymaking, and software design. With the ongoing and envisioned updates, the model’s usefulness for these purposes will continue for many years to come, and its relevance for new applications will grow.</p>

If the area sees periods of extreme drought in highly expansive soil and the drought 'reaches' the bottom of the footer then you'll end up with significant movement as the weight of the foundation and home settles down into the void created by the now dry soil, while the opposite is true during periods of extremely heavy rainfall.</p><p>When you combine periods of extreme drought and heavy rainfall in close succession of each other on highly expansive soils, pretty much any slab that is not supported by bedrock in some way will be at risk of cracking due to the frequent seasonal movement of the surrounding soil.</p><p>This can be mitigated somewhat during periods of drought by 'watering' the areas surrounding the foundation, and during periods of heavy rainfall by having a properly graded home site that routes water away from the home in every direction. Unfortunately these are mitigations that require monitoring by homeowners who may not be aware of these issues at all.</p><p>Ideally prior to building any permanent foundation a core sample would be obtained from the site and analyzed to determine the footer depth necessary to compensate for the 'worst case' rainfall and temperature fluctuation in that region, additionally accounting for local movement due to topography.</p><p>Except most folks building out in my area are just trying to make as much money with as little investment as possible, and thus do just enough to not be liable if any of the above scenarios conspire to create problems for their long-since-forgotten customers.</p></div></td></tr>

We finally got the younger child through to grad school and paid off all our debt, and now we can devote our time to what we want to do. Mostly, anyway - I'd like to be doing coding for pay, but instead I do technical translation.</p><p>But in terms of <i>study</i> - academic work - we're free. She's got a PhD in theoretical physics and has finally had the time to start publishing, including picking up quantum chromodynamics.</p><p>I've picked up my original doctoral work, too, which was on hold for thirty years while I supported the family. I've had no problems whatsoever tackling difficult topics - in fact, I've had less difficulty. I'm calmer, partly because I have to be in order to keep my blood pressure under control. I think I can do less in any given day, but I'm not even sure about that, because when I look back at items checked off over a week or a month, it's about what I wanted to get done.</p><p>So putting off study until you're 55 is not a bad plan. Keep reading about things in the meantime, of course. Take good notes. Keep things where you can find them in ten or twenty years. Write down your daily thoughts.

For example the pattern matching and recursion-based "looping" navigation is just like when I went through my Haskell/Ocaml/Common Lisp/Scheme phase in the mid 2000's, so it was easy to pick up.

So far what's she's written makes perfect sense and would be mostly obvious to anyone who hangs out on HN.

This could be novel technology or logistics and efficiency improvements, but these are things that can augment everyone's ability to do the things they want.</p><p>Socially, there are a lot of things that seem "silly" (euphemistically), and it's a blight on civilization that they are tolerated. That people in my country (USA, but can apply to many countries in the world) are homeless or starving is silly; if you were running a country, ensuring the citizenry have food and shelter might be an obvious top priority. The world can seem really complex at times and our systems become so convoluted that people rationalize why the things that seem obviously silly are too difficult to solve or worthwhile tradeoffs. I think it's generally a good heuristic to avoid doing things that seem obviously silly and fix the things that are (that is, it's often better to be naive about it!).</p><p>This portion of the comment is not a direct answer to the question but a related thought others may have further insights about. Practically, a situation in which you don't need money rarely materializes instantaneously; it usually arises from circumstances that have constituted a great deal of your life and identity. As a consequence of this, I think ego can become a real challenge that prevents people from pursuing possible "ideals". If you've been in a certain kind of position for a long time, there can be psychological barriers to pursuing something in a way in which, e.g., you are a true beginner or have less control. This tends to be something that can dissipate with age but can be especially difficult for people who've achieved financial success well before standard retirement age.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I stopped work at 55 after 40 years in tech, from being a developer right up to CTO. I do very little coding, mainly because there are so many other things I want to do. Having this time really makes you ask yourself what it is you really want to do and for me that means running, particularly in mountains. Like another poster I also watch a ton of stuff on YouTube about DIY and I’m learning how to do stuff on my own house and doing a van conversion (to take to the mountains). I see a lot more of family than I did and I consciously try to spend more time with and in particular give my time to help others. I’m helping my daughter a lot to break into software engineering. Like another poster I have so many things I want to do and just not enough time so I’m journaling a lot and making a lot of notes about ideas I have and these are starting to lead to some ideas about software that would be useful to me and so I expect others. I’m constantly learning what I like to do and I have so many non technical projects on the go.</p>

I'd continue doing what I currently do, but I'd cut out some of the things that come with the job that no sane person would do other than for the pay. For instance, I would still be doing research, which I view as very important, but I'd do more research and wouldn't mess around with the peer review process. I'd be writing open source software that would help others do their research too. I'd write textbooks and give them away for free. I wouldn't be doing administrative work of any kind, and I wouldn't waste time on a lot of the stuff I do at home.</p>

They can make smaller cars with 100 mile range which covers &gt;98%[2] of the trips and anyone who needs more can rent extra batteries from their nearest retailers. Fast chargers don't work, queueing theory explains why: What happens when you add a new teller? [0]. Fast chargers won't work because we have to solve for the peak case, which is a third of US population driving during Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, Spring break, etc. Cars with smaller batteries will be cheaper, lighter and far more importantly we can make 3X the cars from the same battery materials. There will be a lone commenter who will complain that EV doesn't work for him, because he commutes every week from Miami to Seattle, but EVs work for most people's driving habits.</p><p>(2) Convince retailers to build battery banks, they can charge for free (or get paid for charging when electricity prices go negative!) and (a) rent fully charge batteries (b) participate in virtual power plants replacing natural gas, they can make bank[1]. This also increases their foot traffic, most of the big retail chains operate gas stations anyways as loss leaders. Batteries for rent will be extremely profitable, in addition to adding foot traffic.</p><p>(3) Change residential building codes to require 240V outlets in the garage, heat pump water heater, heat pump furnace, induction stove, solar panels, or better yet solar shingles. Solar shingles are coming up, may not be cost effective today, but probably soon? Also make the main panel and circuitry future proof -- home can be powered by vehicle (V2H - no need to generator for emergencies) and also V2G so everyone can participate in VPP.[2] I've already started working on this.</p><p>(4) Change commercial (anything non-residential) building code to require conduit before paving parking lot. Doesn't need to add EV chargers, but that makes the parking lot future proof, can make 10%, 20% or 100% of it EV ready whenever.</p><p>With (3) and (4) all new construction is energy efficient, future proof. People who buy these homes can have zero energy bills as well as make money from VPP.</p><p>(5) Everyone complains about high home prices. We see spirited discussions on HN once or twice a week. Convince builders to build homes to standards (#3 above) that make the old homes entirely undesirable to most people. There can be a huge building boom (builders benefit from this), very low sales of old homes, stopping the growth of home prices. Convince people to stop buying old homes.</p><p>(6) Work with cities on providing free charging at schools, parks, libraries and all city owned infrastructure.</p><p>(7) Work with HOAs/communities to build chargers in HOA managed parks, these are 10 - 100x more than city parks.</p><p>(8) Put shareholder resolutions to make companies either offer (a) fully remote (b) free charging.</p><p>(9) Put shareholder resolutions at Restaurants and Retailers to offer free charging. This is a win-win, they get high quality foot traffic, traffic that stays at least 30 mins.</p><p>I'm in my 40s, I think these are important and solvable problems, nothing more I'd love than working on these. Better yet, teach the younger generation on how to work on these. We can't change the world by thinking about fossil fuel led COP summits, Govts, but we can change by making decisions on where we live, work and shop. Gradually, then suddenly, everything will change for the better.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/10/21/what-happens-when-you-add-a-new-teller/" rel="nofollow">https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/10/21/what-happens-when-...</a>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>After many months of research, development and QA, Wasmi’s most significant update ever is finally ready for production use.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi">Wasmi</a> is an efficient and versatile <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) interpreter with a focus on embedded environments. It is an excellent choice for plugin systems, cloud hosts and as smart contract execution engine.</p><p>Wasmi intentionally mirrors the Wasmtime API on a best-effort basis, making it an ideal drop-in replacement or prototyping runtime.</p><blockquote><p>Install <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmi_cli">Wasmi’s CLI tool</a> via <code>cargo install wasmi_cli</code> or use it as library via the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmi"><code>wasmi</code> crate</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Wasmi v0.32 comes with a new execution engine that utilizes register-based bytecode enhancing its execution performance by a factor of up to 5.
Additionally, its startup performance has been improved by several orders of magnitudes thanks to lazy compilation and other new techniques.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/releases/tag/v0.32.0">changelog for v0.32</a> is huge and the following sections will present the most significant changes.</p><h2 id="startup-performance">Startup Performance</h2><p>Wasmi is a <em>rewriting interpreter</em>, meaning that it rewrites the incoming WebAssembly bytecode into Wasmi’s own internal bytecode that is geared towards efficient execution performance.</p><p>This re-writing is what we call <em>compilation</em> or <em>translation</em> in an interpreter. This is not to be confused with compiling the Wasmi interpreter itself.</p><h3 id="why-is-translation-speed-important-for-wasmi">Why is translation speed important for Wasmi?</h3><p>Fast translation enables a fast startup time which is the time spent until the first instruction is executed.</p><p>As an interpreter, Wasmi is naturally optimized for fast startup times, making it well-suited for translation-intensive workloads where the time required to translate a Wasm binary exceeds the time needed to execute it.<br>Conversely, compute-intensive workloads, where execution time surpasses translation time, are better handled by JIT-based Wasm runtimes such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WAMR</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer">Wasmer</a>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><h3 id="lazy-translation">Lazy Translation</h3><p>Translation can be costly, especially with the new register-based bytecode. To address this, lazy translation has been implemented, translating only the parts of the Wasm binary necessary for execution.</p><p>Wasmi supports 3 different modes of translation:</p><ul><li><code>Eager</code>: Code is eagerly validated and eagerly translated ahead of time.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> This is the default mode for Wasmi v0.32.</li></ul></li><li><code>Lazy</code>: Code is lazily translated and lazily validated.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> One downside is that this allows for partially validated Wasm modules which are controversial within the wider Wasm community. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li></ul></li><li><code>LazyTranslation</code>: Code is lazily translated but eagerly validated.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> While slower than <code>Lazy</code> this fixes the problem with partially validated Wasm modules.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="usage-as-library">Usage as Library</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> c <span>=</span> wasmi::Config::default();
</span></span><span><span>c.compilation_mode(wasmi::CompilationMode::Lazy);
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="usage-in-wasmis-cli">Usage in Wasmi’s CLI</h4><p>Wasmi CLI now supports the command-line option <code>--compilation-mode=&lt;mode&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;mode&gt;</code> is one of <code>eager</code>, <code>lazy</code>, or <code>lazy-translation</code>.</p><h3 id="unchecked-translation">Unchecked Translation</h3><p>Wasmi validates the Wasm binary which accounts for roughly 20-40% of the total time spent during the startup phase.
However, some users might want to skip Wasm validation altogether since they know ahead of time that used Wasm binaries are pre-validated. This is now possible via the <code>unsafe fn Module::new_unchecked</code> API.</p><h3 id="non-streaming-translation">Non-streaming Translation</h3><p>Wasmi v0.31 and earlier always used streaming translation to process their Wasm input. However, in practice most users never even made use of this, so in v0.32 Wasmi uses non-streaming translation by default which gives it yet another nice performance win.</p><blockquote><p>Users who actually want to use streaming translation simply can use the new <code>Module::new_streaming</code> API for their needs.</p></blockquote><h3 id="linker-caching">Linker Caching</h3><p>The Wasmi <code>Linker</code> is used to define the set of host functions that a Wasm binary can use to communicate with the host. Oftentimes, dozens of host functions are defined, which can quickly become costly.</p><p>To address this, Wasmi now offers a <code>LinkerBuilder</code>, which allows to efficiently instantiate new <code>Linker</code>s after the initial setup. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p><p>Benchmarks with 50 defined host functions have demonstrated a 120x speedup using this approach.</p><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>By combining all of the techniques above it is possible to speed up the startup time of Wasmi by several orders of magnitudes compared to the previous Wasmi v0.31.</p><p>The newest versions of all Wasm runtimes have been used at the time of writing this article. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Currently, Winch only supports <code>x86_64</code> platforms and therefore was only tested on those systems.</p></blockquote><h3 id="erc-20---7kb">ERC-20 -

As expected, optimizing JIT-based Wasm runtimes like Wasmtime and Wasmer perform worse in this context. Single-pass JITs, which are designed for fast startup, such as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime-winch">Winch</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmer-compiler-singlepass">Wasmer Singlepass</a>, are also significantly slower. Despite also using lazy translation, <a href="https://github.com/makepad/stitch">Stitch</a>’s translation performance is not ideal. However, it is important to note that both Winch and Stitch are still in an experimental phase of their development and improvements are to be expected.</p><h2 id="execution-speed">Execution Speed</h2><p>For an execution engine, the speed of computation is naturally of paramount importance. Unfortunately, the old Wasmi v0.31 left much to be desired in this regard.</p><h2 id="register-based-bytecode">Register-Based Bytecode</h2><p>The old Wasmi v0.31 internally uses a stack-based intermediate representation (IR) to drive execution. This IR is similar to WebAssembly bytecode and thus allows for fast translation times.</p><p>Stack-based IRs generally use more instructions to represent the same problem as register-based IRs. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> However, the performance of interpreters is mostly dictated by the dispatch of instructions. Hence, it is usually a good tradeoff to execute fewer instructions even if every executed instruction is more complex. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p><p>This is why starting with version 0.32 Wasmi now uses a register-based IR to drive its execution.</p><h2 id="memory-consumption">Memory Consumption</h2><p>The new register-based IR was carefully designed to enhance execution performance and to minimize memory usage.

This is partly because Wasmi v0.31 was already comparatively fast and that the new register-based bytecode favors compute-intense workloads over call-intense ones.

The reason likely is that Stitch encourages the LLVM optimizer to produce tail calls for its instruction dispatch, despite Rust not supporting them.
