<p>The acting head of the US government’s top cybersecurity agency reportedly uploaded sensitive government files into a public version of ChatGPT, triggering internal security alerts and a federal review.</p>



<p>A <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361">Politico</a> investigation claims Madhu Gottumukkala, the interim director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, uploaded contracting documents marked “For Official Use Only” into ChatGPT last summer.</p>



<p>The report says Gottumukkala requested a special exemption to access ChatGPT, which is blocked for other Department of Homeland Security staff.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity monitoring systems then reportedly flagged the uploads in early August. That triggered a DHS-led damage assessment to determine whether the information had been exposed.</p>

<p>Public versions of ChatGPT share user inputs with OpenAI, which raised concerns inside the federal government about sensitive data leaving internal networks.</p>



<h2 id="h-cisa-responds-to-chatgpt-investigation">CISA responds to ChatGPT investigation</h2>



<p>CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy told Politico that Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” adding that the use was “short-term and limited.”</p>



<p>Gottumukkala has served as acting director since May, while the Senate has yet to confirm Sean Plankey as permanent head of the agency.</p>



<p>The ChatGPT incident follows other reported issues during Gottumukkala’s tenure. Politico said he previously failed a counterintelligence polygraph required for access to highly sensitive intelligence. During congressional testimony last week, he rejected that characterization when questioned.</p>



<p>The report lands as the administration of US President Donald Trump continues to push AI adoption across federal agencies.</p>



<p>Trump signed an executive order in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/">December aimed at limiting state-level AI regulation</a>, while the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/12/2003855671/-1/-1/0/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-STRATEGY-FOR-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-WAR.PDF">Pentagon has announced an “AI-first”</a> strategy to expand the military’s use of artificial intelligence.</p><div id="article-note"><h2>Related</h2></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A Waymo robotaxi struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica on January 23, according to the company. Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.</p>

<p>The NHTSA has opened an <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investigation</a> into the accident, and Waymo said in a <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/a-commitment-to-transparency-and-road-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.”</p>







<p>Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at six miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”</p>

<p>“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.</p>

<p>News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probe</a> into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the National Transportation Safety Board opened its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”</p>

<p>The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”</p>

<p>Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.  </p>

		<p><em>(content note: scientific discussion of depression &amp; suicide)</em></p>
<p>
<b>"Too Long; Didn't Read" Summary:</b><br>
Exactly what the title says.
</p>
<p>The "standardised effect size" of antidepressants on depression, vs placebo, is around 0.4. (This is like going from an average <strong>C to a C+</strong>.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the effect size of 1500mg/day of "≥60% EPA" Omega-3 supplements — which are cheaper &amp; have fewer side effects than antidepressants — is a bit higher, around 0.6. (This is like going from a <strong>C to a B–</strong>.)</p>
<p>But, much better: the effect size of 5000mg/day of Vitamin D is around <em>1.8!</em> (This is like going from a <strong>C to an A–</strong>!) It works even for people who <em>don't</em> have a Vitamin D insufficiency, which almost half of American adults <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>Even if you're already taking Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3, you may <em>still</em> not be taking enough. The "official" recommendations <em>are all 3 to 10 times too low</em>. Both these supplements are safe, cheap, and over-the-counter, with <em>positive</em> side-effects (on Covid &amp; cognition).</p>
<p>So, unless you have specific reasons to not take Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3 — (kidney stones, blood thinners, etc) — please try them, for at least a month! They could save your mental health. Maybe even your life.</p>

<h2>A crash course in "effect sizes"</h2>
<p>In Alicetown, the average person has 4 younger cousins.<br>
In Bobtown, the average person has 3 younger cousins.</p>
<p>Alright, not so surprising. You may not even notice a difference.</p>
<p>In Alicetown, the average person has 4 limbs.<br>
In Bobtown, the average person has 3 limbs.</p>
<p>You'd <em>definitely</em> notice.</p>
<p>It's the same absolute difference (4 vs 3) <em>and</em> relative difference (3/4). So what makes limbs more surprising than cousins? Well, partly it's more dramatic &amp; visible, but also because: <em>we expect high variation in the number of someone's younger cousins, but not their number of limbs</em>.</p>
<p>This is why scientists calculate an <strong>"effect size"</strong> or <strong>"standardized mean difference"</strong> ("mean" = average). We take the difference between two groups, then divide by the total amount of variation, <em>to account for how surprising a difference is</em>.</p>
<p>(This is a health article, not a math article, so I'll skip the formulas in this post. If you're curious, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTgouKMz-eI">: check out this 4 min video</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately for laypeople, the effect size is usually just reported as a number, like "+0.74" for <a href="http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/docs/EPR20.pdf">spacing out your studying vs cramming</a>, or "–0.776" for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20438143/">sleep deprivation on attention</a>.</p>
<p>But what's that <em>mean?</em> How can we make these numbers <em>intuitive?</em></p>
<p>Well, a common way for data to be is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">a bell-shaped curve</a> (also called a "normal distribution"). And most of us are, alas, well-acquainted with the bell curve in school grades. ("grading on a curve")</p>
<p>So: school grades give us a useful way to think about standardized effect sizes! We can now convert that number <em>into an actual letter grade:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>F:</strong> -2.0 below average</li>
<li><strong>D:</strong> -1.0 below average</li>
<li><strong>C:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> +1.0 above average</li>
<li><strong>A:</strong> +2.0 above average</li>
</ul>
<p>(see footnote for more precise ranges.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> the units are in "standard deviations", or "sigmas". what's sigma? <s>sigma ba--</s> just a unit of "how far away this is from average, relative to the total variation".)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/bell_grade.png" alt="How to convert effect sizes to letter grades" title="How to convert effect sizes to letter grades"></p>
<p>For example: spacing out your studying, relative to cramming, will on average <em>lift</em> your test scores from a C to a B–. (effect size = +0.74) And short-term sleep deprivation, relative to healthy sleep, will on average <em>tank</em> your ability to pay attention from a C to a D+. (effect size: –0.776)</p>
<p>(Note — when reading about effect sizes, always remember: <em>effect of what, on what, at what dose, for which group, relative to what?</em> See the Data Colada post, <a href="https://datacolada.org/104">Meaningless Means</a>.)</p>
<p>(Note 2 — the standard way of "intuitively" describing effect sizes is Cohen's recommendations: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large. Personally, I prefer the "school grade letter" comparison, since it's more concrete. But hey, you do you.)</p>
<p>But it's not limited to just grades &amp; academic performance. Effect sizes can also help us understand any kind of difference between groups, in observation or in experiments!</p>
<p>For example...</p>
<hr>


<p>Let's use our school grade analogy, to interpret effect sizes on mental health:</p>
<p><strong>What's an "F in mental health"?</strong> By definition of a bell curve, ~2.3% of people are below –2 sigma (an "F"). (See: <a href="https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/normal.html">this bell curve calculator</a>.) <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/suicide-canada-key-statistics-infographic.html">In Canada</a>, ~2.6% of people had suicidal ideation in 2022, while <a href="https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2024/us-national-trends-and-disparities-in-suicidal-ideation-suicide-attempts-and-health-care-use">in the US</a>, it was ~4.9% in 2019. So, it's not too far off to say: "F in mental health = literally suicidal". (Also, reminder that ~4% is 1-in-25 people. You likely know someone, or <em>are</em> someone, who will feel suicidal this year. Please reach out to your friends &amp; loved ones!)</p>
<p><strong>What's a "D in mental health"?</strong> ~16% of people are below –1 sigma (a "D") on a bell curve. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12096700/">The Keyes 2002 study</a> estimated that ~14.1% of adults meet the DSM-III criteria for a major depressive episode. So, D = Depressed.</p>
<p><strong>What's an average "C in mental health"?</strong> ~68% of people are within a sigma of average (a "C") on a bell curve. Same above study found that 56.6 percent had moderate mental health. They were neither "languishing" nor "flourishing". I guess C = Could Be Worse.</p>
<p><strong>What's a "B in mental health"?</strong> ~16% of people are <em>above</em> +1 sigma (a "B") on a bell curve. Same above study found that 17.2% of adults are "flourishing". Good for them! B = Flourishing, life is good.</p>
<p><strong>What's an "A in mental health"?</strong> I don't know who these freaks are. I actually <em>could not</em> find any scientific studies on "the +2 sigma in well-being". In contrast, there's <em>lots</em> of research on suicidal ideation, the –2 sigma in well-being. In the absence of any actual data, I'll just say: A = AWESOME</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/bell_curve_mental_health.png" alt="Bell curve of mental health, mapped to effect size / letter grade." title="Bell curve of mental health, mapped to effect size / letter grade."></p>
<p>So, if an intervention is found to have an effect size of +1.0, that's like going up a letter grade. If something's found to have an effect size of -2.0, that's like going <em>down</em> two letter grades. And so on.</p>
<p>Okay, so how do we get peoples' "mental health grades" up?</p>
<p>Let's look at antidepressants, Omega-3, and Vitamin D, in turn:</p>
<hr>

<h2>Antidepressants</h2>
<p>The good news is they work. The bad news is they don't work as well as you'd think they may work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5889788/">Cipriani et al 2018</a></strong> is a recent meta-analysis (a study collecting lots of previous studies) that investigated 21 different antidepressants. The most effective antidepressant, <em>Amitriptyline</em>, relative to placebo, had an Odds Ratio of 2.13  — <a href="https://www.escal.site/">which converts to</a> a Cohen's d effect size of 0.417 — which is "small-medium" according to Cohen's recommendations. Or, by our school-letter-grade comparison: <strong>the best antidepressant would take your mental health grade from an F to F+, or C to C+.</strong></p>
<p>From Figure 3 of that paper, you can see that Amitriptyline has the highest estimated effect size, while the side effects are no worse than placebo:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/Figure3.jpg" alt="The effect sizes &amp; dropout rates of various antidepressants, vs placebo." title="The effect sizes &amp; dropout rates of various antidepressants, vs placebo."></p>
<p>Sure, "F to F+" <em>can</em> be lifesaving, but… y'know… that's not a lot. And again, this is the effect <em>on average.</em> Some people respond <em>much</em> better to antidepressants… while some respond much worse.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Omega-3</h2>
<p>Keep getting confused on which fat is what? Me too. So, here's a crash course on various fats:</p>
<p>Fatty acids are chains of carbons &amp; hydrogens + two oxygens. They say "OOH" at one end, and "HHH" at the other end:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat1.png" alt="Diagram of a fatty acid, details in main text." title="Diagram of a fatty acid, details in main text."></p>
<p>A saturated fatty acid is one where all the carbons' free spots are filled up with hydrogens. (Hence, "saturated") This makes the molecule stick straight out. This is why <em>long</em> saturated fatty acids — like those found in butter — tend to be solid at room temperature.</p>
<p>(Contrary to popular belief, saturated fats don't <em>literally</em> clog your arteries, like grease in plumbing pipes. What happens is <em>{ha ha I don't actually understand this}</em>. <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000000510">Something about your cholesterol levels &amp; inflammation</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat2.png" alt="Diagram of saturated vs unsaturated fatty acid, details in main text." title="Diagram of saturated vs unsaturated fatty acid, details in main text."></p>
<p>In contrast, <em>unsaturated</em> fatty acids have at least one hydrogen missing. This causes them to have a double-bond "kink" in the molecule. This makes them <em>not</em> stick out, which is why unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature. <em>Mono-unsaturated</em> fatty acids (MUFAs) — like in olive oil — only have one kink. <em>Poly-unsaturated</em> fatty acids (PUFAs) — like in fatty fish — have two or more kinks. Let's be mature adults about this, please.</p>
<p>For completeness: <em>trans fats</em> are unsaturated fats whose "kink" is twisted around, causing them to go straight. That is the worst sentence I've written all month. The twisted kink is caused by the hydrogens being on opposite sides, hence "trans". (And yes, if they're on the same side it's "cis". Latin was a mistake.) The molecule being straight is why trans fats — which margarine <em>used</em> to be full of  — are solid at room temperature, despite being an unsaturated fat.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat3.png" alt="Diagram of how a 'cis' saturated fat becomes a 'trans' fat, details in main text." title="Diagram of how a 'cis' saturated fat becomes a 'trans' fat, details in main text."></p>
<p>It's neat whenever you can trace the history of something right down to its atoms! Margarine was first invented because it's cheaper, and is spreadable straight from the fridge, unlike butter. Margarine (used to be) made by taking <em>unsaturated</em> vegetable oils, which were cheaper than animal fats, then pumping a bunch of hydrogens into it (hence, "hydrogenated oils"). If you <em>completely</em> hydrogenate an oil, it becomes a saturated fat. But they only <em>partially</em> hydrogenated those oils, leading to trans fats, which were cheaper &amp; a spreadable semi-solid at fridge temperature.</p>
<p>In the 1970s &amp; 80s, the US Food &amp; Drug Administration concluded that trans fats were <em>not</em> harmful to humans, and nutritionists <em>promoted</em> margarine over butter, because butter had "unhealthy" saturated fats. <a href="https://www.cspi.org/resource/artificial-trans-fat-timeline">But in the early 1990s</a>, scientists realized that trans fats were <em>even worse</em> for you than saturated fats. Only in the 2010's, did most Western countries start officially banning trans fats. Reminder: policy is often decades behind science.</p>
<p><em>(Hey, what do you call it when you get thiccer on HRT? Trans fat! :D)</em></p>
<p>I need to stop going on infodump tangents. Anyway, Omega-3 is any fatty acid with its first kink at the 3rd carbon from the Omega end ("HHH"), though it can have more kinks later down the chain. (And yes, Omega-6 has its first kink at the 6th carbon, and Omega-9 has its first kink at the 9th carbon. There's nothing <em>physically</em> preventing Omega-4 or Omega-5's from existing, but due to some quirk of evolution, Omega-3, -6, and -9 are the ones biological life uses most. As far as I can tell, there's no specific reason they're all multiples of 3. Probably just a coincidence. There <em>is</em> a less common Omega-7.)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat4.png" alt="Diagram of Omega-3, -6, and -9, details in main text." title="Diagram of Omega-3, -6, and -9, details in main text."></p>
<p><em>Finally</em>, there's three main types of Omega-3: EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid), DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), and ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid). ALA is mostly found in plants like chia seeds &amp; walnuts, while EPA &amp; DHA mostly come from seafood, though there <em>are</em> algae-based vegan sources.</p>
<p><em>(Figure 1.1 from <a href="https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/bitstream/10214/9940/1/Roke_Kaitlin_201609_PhD.pdf">Roke 2016</a>.⤵ Thank you Kaitlin Samantha Roke for drawing this coz I'm too lazy to draw it myself. Note how the first double-bond "kink" for all these molecules is at the 3rd carbon from the Omega end — hence why they're all called Omega-3's.)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat5.png" alt="Diagram of ELA, DHA, &amp; ALA; details in main text." title="Diagram of ELA, DHA, &amp; ALA; details in main text."></p>
<p><strong>EPA &amp; DHA are the focus of this section.</strong> For bio-mechanical reasons I don't understand but I assume someone else does: EPA is the one associated with anti-inflammation, better brain health, and <em>less depression</em>... while DHA isn't. (But DHA is still needed for other stuff, like your neurons' cell walls, so don't cut them out completely!)</p>
<p>(Note: I could not find any <em>experimental</em> trials of ALA on depression, though an <em>observational</em> study in Japan (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212826313001085">Kurotani et al 2014</a>) finds a correlation between higher ALA and lower depression. But reminder, correlation is not <em>necessarily</em> causation.)</p>
<p>All the above info in a Venn (technically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram">Euler</a>) diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat6.png" alt="Diagram of what I infodumped about just now." title="Diagram of what I infodumped about just now."></p>
<p>Okay, enough yap. Time for the actual data:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3534764/">Sublette et al 2011</a></strong> is an older meta-analysis, but it's the only one I could find that tries to estimate the <em>actual "dose-response" curve</em>, which shows: how much effect, for how much treatment. Why is that important? Because one problem with many meta-analyses is they'll do something like: "Study 1 gave patients 1 gram of medicine and saw a +1 improvement in disease, Study 2 gave 10 grams and saw +4 improvement, Study 3 gave 100 grams and saw <em>negative</em> –5 improvement… the average of +1, +4, and –5 is zero... therefore the medicine's effect is zero." ...As mentioned briefly earlier, this is a <a href="https://datacolada.org/104">meaningless mean</a>. That's why we want to know the response <em>at each dose</em>.</p>
<p>So, the Sublette meta-analysis gathered randomized trials studying Omega-3 on depression (vs placebo, of course) and got the following dose-response curve.⤵ Note that the horizontal axis is <em>not</em> just amount of total Omega-3, but specifically <em>the extra amount of "unopposed" EPA, above the amount of DHA.</em> Or in other words, "EPA minus DHA":</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/Omega3.jpg" alt="Diagram of dose-response curve, of EPA minus DHA, on depression." title="Diagram of dose-response curve, of EPA minus DHA, on depression."></p>
<p>The top effect size is <strong>around +0.558, which is like going from an F to D–, or C to B–.</strong> You get this maximum effect around 1 to 2 grams of extra EPA, and <em>too much</em> EPA gets worse results. The meta-analysis finds that Omega-3 supplements that are ~60% EPA (and the rest DHA) are optimal.</p>
<p>This finding is roughly in line with later meta-analyses. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0515-5.pdf">Liao et al 2019</a> also finds that ~1 gram of ≥60% EPA is best, but actually found a much higher effect size: +1.03. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37028202/">Kelaiditis et al 2023</a> also finds 1 to 2g of ≥60% EPA is best, but found a lower effect size of +0.43… which is still <em>as good</em> as the <em>best</em> antidepressant!</p>
<p>Either way, let's boil this down to a recommendation. You want around 1 gram of EPA a day. So if your supplements are 60% EPA, you need 1 gram ÷ 0.6 ~= 1.667 grams = 1667 milligrams. Let's round this down for convenience: <strong>get 1500 mg/day of 60%-EPA Omega-3 supplements.</strong></p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3">most official health organizations recommend</a> "250–500 mg <em>combined</em> EPA and DHA each day for healthy adults." <em>That is over three times too low,</em> at least for optimal effects on depression. Which, as we calculated above, is probably around 1500 mg/day. (The official safe dose is 5000 mg/day)</p>
<p>Finally, a (small) study <em>directly</em> investigating the link between suicide &amp; Omega-3. <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.6.1100">Sublette et al 2006</a>: “Low [DHA] and low Omega-3 proportions [...] predicted risk of suicidal behavior among depressed patients over the 2-year period.” Though keep in mind this is a small study, and it's observational not experimental. Also, weird that contrary to the above studies on depression, <em>DHA</em> predicted suicide but <em>not</em> EPA. Not sure what to make of that.</p>
<p>Bonus: Omega-3 may also boost cognition? <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-16129-8.pdf">Shahinfar et al 2025</a>: “Enhancement of global cognitive abilities was observed with increasing omega-3 dosage up to 1500 mg/day. [effect size = 1.00, like going from a grade of C to B!], followed by downward trend at higher doses.”</p>
<hr>

<h2>Vitamin D</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11650176/">Ghaemi et al 2024</a></strong> is a meta-analysis on Vitamin D on depression. Again, it actually estimates a dose-response curve! Below is Figure 1 + Table 2, showing the effect of Vitamin D dosage on depression vs placebo. The solid line is the average estimated effect, dashed lines are 95% confidence interval. Note the effect size is negative in this figure, because they're measuring <em>reduction</em> in depressive symptoms:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/VitaminD.png" alt="The effect size (with uncertainty) of Vitamin D dosage on depressive symptoms." title="The effect size (with uncertainty) of Vitamin D dosage on depressive symptoms."></p>
<p><strong>The upper range of uncertainty is lowest at 5000 IU (International Units) of Vitamin D a day</strong>, with an estimated effect size of 1.82, with a 95% uncertainty range, from 0.98 to 2.66. <strong>An effect size of 1.82 is like taking your mental health from an F to a C–, or a C to an A–!</strong> And even in the <em>most pessimistic</em> case, 0.98, that's still <em>over twice as effective</em> as the top antidepressant!</p>
<p>(The paper's summary says <em>8000 IU</em> is best, with effect size 2.04, but there's much greater uncertainty there. The paper also finds that longer studies had smaller effects than shorter studies, but this does <em>not</em> necessarily mean Vitamin D's effects are short-lived. Looking at Supplementary Table 4, it seems this is partly because longer studies used <em>lower</em> average daily doses. For example, one 52-week study only gave participants 400 IU a day.)</p>
<p>This meta-analysis includes trials with participants who <em>don't</em> have Vitamin D deficiency. There's still a good effect of Vitamin D on depression for them, even if smaller! Though, you probably <em>are</em> lacking Vitamin D: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29644951/">Liu et al 2018</a> finds that a bit under half of all adults (41.4%) have Vitamin D Insufficiency.</p>
<p>And that's according to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-dosage">the official recommendation</a>, of 400-800 IU a day… which is <em>is too damn low</em>. Even the official <em>maximum safe dose</em> of Vitamin D, of 4000 IU/day, is too low. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30611908/">McCullough et al 2019</a> gave over thousands of patients 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day, for <em>seven years</em>, and there were <em>zero</em> cases of serious side effects. This is in line with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746327/">Billington et al 2020</a>, a 3-year-long double-blinded randomized controlled trial, where they found "the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is similar for doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU/day." (though "<em>mild</em> hypercalcemia" increased from 3% to 9%. IMHO, that's a small cost for reducing the risk of major depression &amp; suicide.)</p>
<p>And it makes sense that 10,000 IU a day <em>should</em> be safe. Your skin, exposed to the Sun's ultraviolet rays, can synthesize up to (the equivalent of) 10,000 IU a day, before plateauing out. Source is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522043763">Vieth 1999</a>: “Because vitamin D is potentially toxic, intake of [1000 IU/day] has been avoided even though the weight of evidence shows that the currently accepted [limit] of [2000 IU/day] is too low by at least 5-fold.” (So why are all the official sources still so paranoid about Vitamin D? Well, unfortunately, official/governmental policy is always a few decades behind the science in <em>any</em> field. See Also: the trans fat debate, everything about educational policy.)</p>
<p>Speaking of the Sun, why take supplements instead of just getting Vitamin D from Sun exposure? Well, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29659012/">skin cancer</a>. But also: because Sun-Skin D varies greatly depending on the season, your latitude, and your skin type. There's less ultraviolet rays from the Sun in winter/fall, and at latitudes further from the equator. And <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10861575/">the darker your skin is, the less Vitamin D your skin makes for the same amount of Sun exposure</a>. As expected from the bio-physics of skin, Black adults have <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075634/">the highest prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency</a> (82.1%!!), followed by Hispanic adults (62.9%). (But hey, at least Black adults have the lowest incidence of skin cancer. You win some you lose some.) The point is: speaking as someone with Southeast Asian skin, who's currently in Canada during winter... even if I stood outside naked for hours, I'd get approximately <em>zero</em> IU/day of Vitamin D from the Sun. Thus: supplements.</p>
<p>Finally, a meta-analysis <em>directly</em> measuring the effect of Vitamin D on suicide rates. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12888-025-06613-w.pdf">Yu et al 2025</a>: “Vitamin D in patients with [suicidal behaviours] were significantly lower than in controls (standardized mean difference: –0.69, or a 'medium' difference)”. Reminder that this paper <em>by itself</em> only measures correlation, not causation — but combined with the above experiments of Vitamin D on depression, I think it's reasonable to guess it's partly causal.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost half of you have a Vitamin D deficiency according to the official recommendation (800 IU/day).</li>
<li>And the official recommendation is <em>way</em> too low. Even the official <em>maximum</em> safe dose (4000 IU/day) is below the optimal Vitamin D for depression (5000 IU/day) or what your body can produce from the Sun in optimal conditions (10,000 IU/day). Recent randomized controlled trials confirm that 10,000 IU/day is, indeed, mostly safe.</li>
<li>Your daily reminder than official policy is often decades behind the science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: Vitamin D supplementation was found in several randomized controlled trials <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39225947/">to reduce mortality from Covid-19</a>! It <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322010274">probably helps guard against influenza</a> too, though the evidence is small &amp; early.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Conclusion: <em>All this time, you lacked the Vitamin?</em></h2>
<p>Scurvy is caused by a lack of Vitamin C. It's a condition that causes your wounds to re-open up &amp; teeth to fall out. Scurvy used to kill <em>almost half(!)</em> of all sailors on major expeditions; it's estimated millions died. It can be cured by eating lemons.</p>
<p>Rickets is mostly caused by a lack of Vitamin D. It's a condition where kids' bones go all soft and deformed. During the Industrial Revolution, up to 80% of kids suffered from it. It can be prevented with cod liver oil.</p>
<p>Goiters is mostly caused by a lack of Iodine. It's a condition where the thyroid gland in your neck swells up painfully, to the size of an apple. During WWI, a <em>third</em> of adult men had goiters. It can be prevented with iodized salt.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/The-Vitamin.png" alt="Tumblr meme: 'All this time, you lacked The Vitamin? And yet you persisted?'" title="Tumblr meme: 'All this time, you lacked The Vitamin? And yet you persisted?'"></p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health">About 1 in 4 people are expected to have clinical depression sometime in their life</a>. Depression is the #1 source of the global "burden from disease" in the mental health category, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease#how-do-different-diseases-and-disabilities-contribute-towards-the-burden-of-disease">and <em>that</em> category is the #6 burden of disease in the world</a>, above Alzheimer's, malaria, and sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p>(But honestly, did you need those stats? This is likely a lived experience for a lot of you reading this.)</p>
<p>The effective altruists are all, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life">"woah for just $3000 you can prevent a child's death from malaria"</a> — and that's great! save them kids! — but where's the fanfare for the accumulating evidence that, "woah with cheap daily supplements we can save millions from suicide &amp; depressed lives"?</p>
<p>Over and over again throughout history, some horrific thing that caused millions to suffer, turned out to be "yeah you were missing this one molecule lol". To be clear: not everything is gonna be <em>that</em> simple, and mental health is <em>not</em> "just" chemistry. Also, all the numbers on this page have with large error bars &amp; uncertainty, more research is needed.</p>
<p>But, as of right now, I feel I can at least confidently claim the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin D and Omega-3 are both <em>at least on par</em> with antidepressants.</li>
<li>The evidence is much stronger for Vitamin D; it's very plausibly at least <em>twice</em> as good as antidepressants.</li>
<li>Both supplements are cheap and safe, so what's the harm of trying? (positive "expected value" for this bet)</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<p><strong>MY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU TO DO A.S.A.P:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to a pharmacy, buy the following supplements over-the-counter, in whatever form you like: (I like the easy-to-swallow gel capsules)</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>
<ul>
<li>🌱 By default, Vitamin D supplements are derived from… (quick web search)… <em>the grease in sheep's wool?</em> Huh. Also fish liver oil. Anyway, if you're vegan, make sure your bottle specifically says "vegan" or "from lichen/mushrooms". (If you're vegetarian, the sheep's-wool Vitamin D is fine, they don't kill the sheep for it.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Omega-3 <em>where EPA is ~60% of the Omega-3 total.</em></strong> For example, my 500mg Omega-3 capsules have 300mg EPA, 200mg DHA.
<ul>
<li>🌱 By default, Omega-3 supplements come from fish. If you're veg(etari)?an, there <em>are</em> plant-based sources of Omega-3, but look carefully: most vegan Omega-3 supplements provide <em>more DHA than EPA</em>, which the above studies suggest fully cancel out the antidepressant effect. <em>Double check the nutritional label to make sure it's ≥60% EPA.</em> For example, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Natures-Way-NutraVege-Plant-Based-Vegetarian/dp/B078T4DC2K?th=1">this one is 300mg EPA + 200mg DHA</a>. (<em>not</em> an affiliate link)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then, every day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take ~5000 IU of Vitamin D</strong>
<ul>
<li>⚠️ be cautious if you have kidney stones, or are on medications that could interact with Vitamin D. "ask your doctor".</li>
<li>4,000 IU is the "official maximum safe dose", if you understandably don't trust a random internet blogger, even though she cited academic sources.</li>
<li>10,000 IU if you're feeling daring / have darker skin / live in less sunny climates.</li>
<li>bonus: may improve immune response to Covid &amp; influenza?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Take ~1500 mg of ≥60%-EPA Omega-3</strong>
<ul>
<li>⚠️ be cautious if you're on blood thinners, or other medications that could interact with Omega-3. again, "ask your doctor".</li>
<li>bonus: may improve cognition?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Don't quit your existing antidepressants if they're net-positive for you!)
<ul>
<li>you may also want to ask your doctor about <em>Amitriptyline</em>, or those other best-effect-size antidepressants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you get these doses of Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3 through whole foods alone, no supplements? Probably, but it'd be expensive &amp; tedious: you'd have to eat something like 2,000 calories of farmed salmon <em>a day</em> to get 5,000 IU/day of Vitamin D. As for Omega-3, eating mostly oily fishes <em>would</em> get you &gt;1000mg of Omega-3, but they'd be <em>more DHA than EPA</em>, which the above studies suggest would cancel out the antidepressant effects.</p>
<p><strong>The effect sizes on depression:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The best antidepressant: <strong>+0.417</strong>
<ul>
<li>like your mental health grade going from F to F+, or C to C+</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1500mg of ≥60%-EPA Omega-3: <strong>+0.558</strong>
<ul>
<li>like your mental health grade going from F to D–, or C to B–</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>(And remember, you can <em>stack</em> any of the above interventions to get an even larger effect! You can't just naively add up the effect sizes, but I'd be surprised if the effect of {vitamin d + omega-3 + bright lamps + cardio + good sleep + meditation} <em>combined</em> ends up being less than +2.00. Two letter grades up means going from D to B, or, theoretically, from clinically depressed to flourishing! For more papers &amp; my working research notes on "best bang for buck on depression", <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjNxJmNjoVktrJDFPtFH1hgzKmGpZkRFQ6Vwf0s7c6w/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.e0blw3xq3cvm">check out this Google Doc</a>.)</p>
<p>Also, remember that all the above estimates are uncertain. And in general, when scientists replicate psychology experiments more rigorously, the effect size usually shrinks by ½. But, I think the overall <em>qualitative</em> picture is still strong: there <em>exist</em> high bang-for-buck ways to reduce depression, which are <em>at least</em> on par with drugs &amp; therapy (possibly 2x to 4x better), that aren't (yet) common knowledge amongst policymakers &amp; the public. And again, they're dirt cheap with minor-to-no adverse side effects. Moderate chance of a big win, for a known tiny cost. That's a positive "expected value" bet right there.</p>
<p>I got onto this research rabbithole a few months ago while borrowing my housemate's ADHD meds, which I may or may not eventually collect into a "JOYMAXXING" informal meta-meta-analysis. (<a href="https://youtu.be/JOj97Edna7k?si=xAUt3Kp54RyfGX50&amp;t=334">: See me yap about it on video as a cartoon cat</a>.) But for this blog post, I wanted to dive deeper into Vitamin D and Omega-3, since their effect sizes are so huge, <em>and</em> they're insultingly cheap &amp; easy, compared to therapy or regular cardio.</p>
<p>Stay safe this winter, keep away the seasonal depression. Get your supplements, and reach out to your friends &amp; loved ones!</p>

<li id="fn2"><p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10039857/">Lee et al 2023</a> reports the following effect sizes. Digital therapy for Insomnia → Sleep = 0.76, and Digital therapy for Insomnia → Depression = 0.42. Assuming the therapy <em>for insomnia specifically</em> affects depression <em>only</em> through better sleep (Digital therapy for Insomnia → Sleep → Depression), we can do an <a href="https://cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu/e240a/ch04iv.pdf">"Instrumental Variable"</a> estimate of the effect of Sleep → Depression = 0.42 / 0.76 = 0.55. <strong>To be precise: this is saying, if you improve your sleep by 1 standard deviation, on average your depression improves by 0.55 standard deviations.</strong></p>
<p>So: how many standard deviations is going from "moderate insomnia" to "healthy sleep"? The standard measure is the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which <a href="https://www.sleepprimarycareresources.org.au/questionnaires/isi">you can take online</a>. A score of 0–7 means no insomnia, 8–14 is subclinical insomnia, 15–21 is clinical insomnia (moderate), 22–28 is clinical insomnia (severe). Let's be conservative and say we're just going from barely clinical to barely healthy: 15 to 7, or a reduction of 8 points. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19689221/">Yang et al 2009</a> says a 6-point reduction is 1.5 standard deviations, which means 4 points is 1 standard deviation. So a reduction of 8 points is 2 standard deviations. <strong>So, if you improve your sleep from insomniac to healthy, you improve by at least 8 points, which is 2 standard deviations, so your depression should improve by 2 × 0.55 standard deviations, or ~1.10.</strong></p>
<p>Reminder that my estimate is <em>full</em> of assumptions upon assumptions &amp; these error bars will compound. But I'd be surprised if the true causal effect of going from insomniac to healthy sleep isn't <em>at least</em> a "large" +0.8 effect. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>

<p>The first images from the Meteosat Third Generation-Sounder satellite have been shared at the European Space Conference in Brussels, showing how the mission will provide data on temperature and humidity, for more accurate weather forecasting over Europe and northern Africa.</p>

<div>
				
		<p>The images from Meteosat Third Generation-Sounder (MTG-S) show a full-disc image of Earth as seen from geostationary orbit, about 36 000 km above Earth’s surface. These images were captured on 15 November 2025 by the satellite’s Infrared Sounder instrument.</p><p>In the ‘temperature’ image (below), the Infrared Sounder used a long-wave infrared channel, which measured Earth’s surface temperature as well as the temperature at the top of clouds. Dark red corresponds to high temperatures, mainly on the warmer land surfaces, while blue corresponds to lower temperatures, typically on the top of clouds.</p><p>As would be expected, most of the warmest (dark red) areas in this image are on the continents of Africa and South America. In the top-centre of the image, the outline of the coast of western Africa is clearly visible in dark red, with the Cape Verde peninsula, home to Senegal’s capital Dakar, visible as among the warmest areas in this image. In the bottom-right of the image, the western coast of Namibia and South Africa are also visible in red beneath a swirl of cold cloud shown in blue, while the northeast coast of Brazil is visible in dark red on the left of the image.</p>

		<p>The ‘humidity’ image (below) was captured using the Infrared Sounder’s medium-wave infrared channel, which measures humidity in Earth’s atmosphere. Blue colours correspond to regions in the atmosphere with higher humidity, while red colours correspond to lower humidity in the atmosphere.</p><p>The outlines of landmasses are not visible in this image. The areas of least atmospheric humidity, shown in dark red, are seen approximately over the Sahara Desert and the Middle East (top of image), while a large area of ‘dry’ atmosphere also covers part of the South Atlantic Ocean (centre of image). Numerous patches of high humidity are seen in dark blue over the eastern part of the African continent as well as in high and low latitudes.</p>	</div>

		<h4>Next-generation weather forecasting</h4><p>MTG is a world-class Earth observation mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) with European partners to address scientific and societal challenges. The mission provides game-changing data for forecasting weather and air quality over Europe.</p><p>The satellite’s geostationary position above the equator means it maintains a fixed position relative to Earth, following the same area on the planet’s surface as we rotate. This enables it to provide coverage of Europe and part of northern Africa on a 15-minute repeat cycle. It supplies new data on temperature and humidity over Europe every 30 minutes, supplying meteorologists with a complete weather picture of the region and complementing data on cloud formation and lightning from the MTG-Imager (MTG-I) satellite.</p>	</div>

		<p>ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said, “Seeing the first Infrared Sounder images from the MTG-Sounder satellite really brings this mission and its potential to life. We expect data from this mission to change the way we forecast severe storms over Europe – and this is very exciting for communities and citizens, as well as for meteorologists and climatologists. As ever, the outstanding work done by our teams in collaboration with long-standing partners, including Eumetsat, the European Commission and dozens of European industry teams, means we now have the ability to predict extreme weather events in more accurate and timely ways than ever before.”</p><h4>A hyperspectral view over Europe</h4><p>The Infrared Sounder instrument on board MTG-S is the first European hyperspectral sounding instrument in geostationary orbit. It is designed to generate a completely new type of data product. It uses interferometric techniques, which analyse miniscule patterns in light waves, to capture data on temperature and humidity, as well as being able to measure wind and trace gases in the atmosphere. The data will eventually be used to generate three-dimensional maps of the atmosphere, helping to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, especially for nowcasting rapidly evolving storms.</p><p>“It’s fantastic to see the first images from this groundbreaking mission,” said James Champion, ESA’s MTG Project Manager. “This satellite has been 15 years in development and will revolutionise weather forecasting and especially nowcasting. The ability to vertically profile the full Earth’s disk with a repeat cycle of only 30 minutes for Europe is an incredible accomplishment!”</p>	</div>

		<p>“I’m excited that we can share these first images from the Infrared Sounder, which showcase just a small selection of the 1700 infrared channels continuously acquired by the instrument as it observes Earth,” said Pieter Van den Braembussche, MTG System and Payload Manager at ESA. “By combining all 1700 channels, we will soon be able to generate three dimensional maps of temperature, humidity and even trace gases in the atmosphere. This capability will offer a completely new perspective on Earth’s atmosphere, not previously available in Europe, and is expected to help forecasters predict severe storms earlier than is possible today.”</p>	</div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine" data-link-name="in body link">Maine</a>’s governor has hailed the life of a woman who spent nearly 100 years fishing for lobsters as “amazing” and expressed hopes that her memory inspires “the next century of hardworking” fishers in the state.</p><p>The subject of Governor Janet Mills’ tribute, Virginia “Ginny” Oliver, died on 21 January at age 105, according to an obituary <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/virginia-oliver-obituary?id=60635890" data-link-name="in body link">published</a> on Monday by her family.</p><p>Some regard stories such as that of Oliver, who came to be known as her state’s “Lobster Lady”, as evidence of the growing number of Americans who extend their working days well past the typical retirement age as the cost of living in the US has soared, wages have stagnated and many therefore have been unable to save.</p><p>Nonetheless, as recently as 2021, Oliver told the Associated Press she fell in love with trapping lobsters from the moment she started in the business at eight years old, alongside her father and older brother.</p><p>“I like doing it – I like being along the water,” she said when discussing her career in the largely male-dominated industry she chose. “And so I’m going to keep on doing it just as long as I can.”</p><p>Oliver would get up before dawn and use small fish colloquially known as poagies to lure lobsters from her boat, the Virginia, which was first owned by her late husband. As she established a remarkable 97-year tenure on the waters, and word of it spread, she became the subject of documentaries, major US television networks’ news stories and children’s books, including one titled The Lobster Lady, her obituary recounted.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-hamill" data-link-name="in body link">Mark Hamill</a>, the famed actor, was among those who joined the following that Oliver developed throughout the years. Hamill, best known for his role as Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars film saga, “celebrated her tenacity on social media”, Oliver’s obituary noted.</p><p>The obituary also said that Oliver at one point earned an honorary invitation to join Great Britain’s Cardiff Royal Naval Association. Mills once presented Oliver with a special recognition on her birthday.</p><p>“Despite her fame, friends and family said she remained humble and spirited,” Oliver’s obituary added. “Her personal aesthetic delighted her fans – she wore lipstick and earrings every day she went out on the boat, because, as she said, ‘you never know who you are going to see.’”</p><p>Lobster evolved from working-class food to a pricey restaurant delicacy over the course of Oliver’s fishing life. Its price per pound swelled from 28 cents when she first started to $6.14 – or 22 times more expensive.</p><p>Oliver fished for lobster until a fall at age 103, said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barbarawalsh.author/posts/i-always-teared-up-when-i-hugged-ginny-goodbye-wondering-if-it-would-be-the-last/1658293695150785/" data-link-name="in body link">a statement</a> from her friend, author and Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Barbara Walsh.</p><p>Walsh joined Mills in paying tribute to Oliver, saying the late fisher “believed in living, laughing and doing what she loved”.</p><p>“She was sassy and spirited, always declaring on land and at sea, ‘I’m the boss,’” Walsh’s tribute statement said. “Sail on, sweet Ginny. May your spirit forever soar above the sea.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Maine</a> Lobster festival, which once designated her the grand marshal of its parade, issued a statement honoring Oliver as “more than a local icon”.</p><p>“Virginia was … a living piece of Maine’s maritime history,” the festival’s statement said.</p><p>Oliver’s survivors include her children and grandchildren, according to her obituary.</p><p><em>Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Diagrams are essential for AI-assisted programming. When you're working with an AI coding assistant, being able to visualize data flows, state machines, and system architecture—directly in your terminal or chat interface—makes complex concepts instantly graspable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://mermaid.js.org/" rel="nofollow">Mermaid</a> is the de facto standard for text-based diagrams. It's brilliant. But the default renderer has problems:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Aesthetics</strong> — Might be personal preference, but wished they looked more professional</li>
<li><strong>Complex theming</strong> — Customizing colors requires wrestling with CSS classes</li>
<li><strong>No terminal output</strong> — Can't render to ASCII for CLI tools</li>
<li><strong>Heavy dependencies</strong> — Pulls in a lot of code for simple diagrams</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We built <code>beautiful-mermaid</code> at <a href="https://craft.do/" rel="nofollow">Craft</a> to power diagrams in <a href="https://agents.craft.do/" rel="nofollow">Craft Agents</a>. It's fast, beautiful, and works everywhere—from rich UIs to plain terminals.</p>
<p dir="auto">The ASCII rendering engine is based on <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderGrooff/mermaid-ascii">mermaid-ascii</a> by Alexander Grooff. We ported it from Go to TypeScript and extended it Thank you Alexander for the excellent foundation! (And inspiration that this was possible.)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>5 diagram types</strong> — Flowcharts, State, Sequence, Class, and ER diagrams</li>
<li><strong>Dual output</strong> — SVG for rich UIs, ASCII/Unicode for terminals</li>
<li><strong>15 built-in themes</strong> — And dead simple to add your own</li>
<li><strong>Full Shiki compatibility</strong> — Use any VS Code theme directly</li>
<li><strong>Live theme switching</strong> — CSS custom properties, no re-render needed</li>
<li><strong>Mono mode</strong> — Beautiful diagrams from just 2 colors</li>
<li><strong>Zero DOM dependencies</strong> — Pure TypeScript, works everywhere</li>
<li><strong>Ultra-fast</strong> — Renders 100+ diagrams in under 500ms</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-body="standard-article"><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0">How much <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/sporting/a61804802/olympic-medalists-pay-explained/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/sporting/a61804802/olympic-medalists-pay-explained/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Olympians get paid" data-node-id="0.1">Olympians get paid</a> depends entirely on the country they compete for. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not give out cash prizes, only a medal, but many countries do award their athletes based on whether or not they won a gold, silver, or bronze. However, if an American athlete competes (and medals) at the Olympics, the U.S. government does not pay them anything.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1">Billionaire financier Ross Stevens is changing that. Starting with the upcoming Milan Cortina Olympics, he will give $200,000 to every U.S. Olympic and Paralympic athlete—even if they don’t win a medal. Per the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/sports/olympics/team-usa-milan-cortina-e131245d?st=Hhm2s6&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.wsj.com/sports/olympics/team-usa-milan-cortina-e131245d?st=Hhm2s6&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wall Street Journal" data-node-id="1.1"><em data-node-id="1.1.0">Wall Street Journal</em></a>, “Half will come 20 years after their first qualifying Olympic appearance or at age 45, whichever comes later. Another $100,000 will be in the form of a guaranteed benefit for their families after they pass away.”</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2">His entire donation to the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC), <a href="https://www.usopc.org/news/2025/march/04/united-states-olympic-paralympic-committee-and-united-states-olympic-paralympic-foundation-announce-100-million-gift-to-support-post-games-financial-security-for-team-usa-athletes" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.usopc.org/news/2025/march/04/united-states-olympic-paralympic-committee-and-united-states-olympic-paralympic-foundation-announce-100-million-gift-to-support-post-games-financial-security-for-team-usa-athletes" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="announced last March" data-node-id="2.1">announced last March</a>, is $100 million—a record breaking gift to the organization. “I do not believe that financial insecurity should stop our nation’s elite athletes from breaking through to new frontiers of excellence,” Stevens said upon the announcement of his gift.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4">This won’t be the only source of income for American Olympic and Paralympic athletes; many receive money from endorsement and sponsorship deals, and the national governing body of each sport financially supports their athletes differently. However, Stevens’ gift looks to their retirement.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6">Called the Stevens Financial Security Awards (Stevens Awards), the gift is intended to provide financial support to those who represent the U.S. on the world stage. “In the heart of every Team USA athlete lies a story of dedication, sacrifice and triumph,” said USOPC Chair Gene Sykes. “These extraordinary individuals have committed their lives to their sport, often at the expense of traditional career paths and financial savings. As they approach the end of their competitive journeys—often as young as 25 or 30—many face a daunting reality: the lack of financial savings to support them and their loved ones in their post-athletic life.”</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7">He added, “Because of Ross’ extraordinary generosity and philanthropic creativity, we can create more than a financial safety net— we can build a springboard that will propel these athletes to even greater heights beyond their Olympic and Paralympic careers.”</p><div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true"><p><span><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/121b4598-31f9-4716-af00-a68368fb7913_1643729378.file?fill=1:1&amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Emily Burack" title="Headshot of Emily Burack" width="100%" height="100%" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></span></p><div><p>Emily Burack (she/her) is the Senior News Editor for Town &amp; Country, where she covers entertainment, celebrities, the royals, and a wide range of other topics.

      <p><i>“[Nvidia <span>CEO</span>] Jensen Huang Is Begging You to Stop Being So Negative About AI” — <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jensen-huang-is-begging-you-to-stop-being-so-negative-about-ai-2000709335">Headline from Gizmodo</a></i></p>
<p>- - </p><p>—</p>
<p>Guys, enough is enough. Bullying is a serious issue, and it’s time for me to speak out. There’s an extremely hurtful narrative going around that my product, a revolutionary new technology that exists to scam the elderly and make you distrust anything you see online, is harmful to society. This slander is totally unwarranted, and I would really appreciate it if everyone would stop being so mean about this thing I just invested a billion dollars in.</p>
<p>As someone who desperately needs this technology to work out, I can honestly say it is the most essential tool ever created in all of human history. Don’t mercilessly ridicule it just because it steals the joy out of your hobbies and creates sexually explicit images of women without their consent. Seriously, please stop! It really hurts my feelings.</p>
<p>It’s easy to throw stones if you think about the job displacement and ecological destruction caused by this pointless technology. But such black-and-white, not-wanting-billionaires-to-get-richer thinking is, quite frankly, cruel. You can’t just measure the value of something in terms of “whether or not it makes everything worse for everyone.” The world is much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>This technology is going to fuel innovation across industries and solve all problems of feminism and equal rights. Yes, it’s expanding the surveillance state, and yes, it’s destroying the education system, and yes, it’s being trained on copyrighted work without permission, and yes, it’s being used to create lethal autonomous weapons systems that can identify, target, and kill without human input, but… I forget my point, but ultimately, I think you should embrace it.</p>
<p>Lately, I feel like I just can’t win with you guys. Please, just use my evil technology. What’s so wrong with that? Just use it. I’m begging you. I want to continue living my immoral technofascist life without any criticism.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>The UK Government recently unveiled its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/free-ai-training-for-all-as-government-and-industry-programme-expands-to-provide-10-million-workers-with-key-ai-skills-by-2030">‘AI Skills Hub’</a>, which wants to provide 10 million workers with AI skills by 2030. The main site was delivered by PwC for the low, low price of.. <a href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/001337-2025">£4.1 million (~$5,657,000).</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mahadk.com/s/v3/fa4d19cdf4b054d4_image.png" alt="Image of the procurement contract"></p>
<p>It is <em>not</em> good. Like, at all - the UI is insanely bad and it’s clear that this was just a vibecoded site (to be fair, this is the <em>AI</em> Skills Hub, but c’mon, where is the pride in your work? I would be ashamed to even release this as a prototype!)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mahadk.com/s/v3/fa0761d06de95286_image.png" alt="Image of the AI Skills Hub"></p>
<p>PwC didn’t even write any of the course content! The only thing the Skills Hub does is link out to external pages, like Salesforce’s free Trailhead learning platform:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mahadk.com/s/v3/9aed674092d49d24_image.png" alt="Screenshot of Salesforce's Trailhead learning platform"></p>
<p>Note that I’m fairly certain this course already existed before the contract was even awarded, so all the site does is.. link out to other sites?</p>
<p>PwC itself also admits that the site does not properly meet accessibility standards:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mahadk.com/s/v3/f346a09eb011342a_image.png" alt="Accessibility policy"></p>
<p>Even for those without a disability, the lack of here in this regard means that the site can be very confusing and buggy as a result.</p>
<h2 id="incorrect-laws">Incorrect laws</h2>
<p>The site has a course on “AI and intellectual property”. One thing it mentions is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mahadk.com/s/v3/1e8f7dc501128b15_image.png" alt="Fair use"></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ednewtonrex/status/2016443895505203379">(credits for the photo)</a></p>
<p>Except that <em>fair use is not a thing in the UK</em> - that’s a US concept! The UK uses what’s known as “fair dealing”, which is more restrictive than fair use, so the details here are plain wrong.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-care-lack-of-craft">Lack of care, lack of craft</h2>
<p>The interface for this website has also not been clearly thought out - one glaring example is the process of actually enrolling in a course.</p>
<p>On the course page, the “Enroll Now” button is <em>tiny</em>, and if you don’t see it and try scrolling down to the bottom, you will find yourself nothing but a comment section!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mahadk.com/s/v3/61dc1d957dc892f8_image.png" alt="Image of the course page"></p>
<p>Then you have other bugs too, like the “Skills &amp; Training Gap Analysis” - which is linked at the top of the site! - apparently being closed off to the public for no reason:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mahadk.com/s/v3/f03c15b9365950ff_image.png" alt="Image of the S&amp;T Gap Analysis page"></p>
<hr>
<p>To be honest, seeing this made me angry.</p>
<p>I’m angry at the sheer <em>wastefulness</em> of the UK Government here. Our public services are collapsing - while £4 million is admittedly chump change for the UK government, there are real people behind these numbers - families waiting months for NHS appointments, children in crumbling schools, vulnerable people not getting the care they need. The waste feels particularly galling when you realise that almost no one will actually use this site!</p>
<p>I’m also angry that the small webdev businesses we have here in the UK were left out of this - for less than 5% of the cost, we’d have a <em>better</em> website and help out small businesses who actually care about their work, instead of handing the project to a multinational company that made nearly $60 billion in revenue in a year and has zero qualms about ripping off the British taxpayer.</p>
<p>Do better.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

"If you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it."</p><p>After the original Roadster, the two models are Tesla's oldest vehicles, and in recent years the company has slashed prices as global competition for electric vehicles has soared. Tesla started selling the Model S sedan in 2012, and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/30/tesla-delivers-model-x-electric-suv-to-take-on-luxury-carmakers.html">Model X SUV</a> three years later. </p><p>On Tesla's website, the Model S currently starts at about $95,000, while the Model X starts at around $100,000</p><p>Tesla's far more popular models are the 3 and Y, which accounted for 97% of the company's 1.59 million <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments" target="_blank">deliveries</a> last year. The Model 3 now starts at about $37,000, and the Model Y is around $40,000. Tesla debuted more affordable versions of the vehicles late last year. </p><p>In its earnings announcement on Wednesday, Tesla reported its first annual revenue decline on record, with sales falling in three of the past four quarters.

            <guid>46801976</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:42:03 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/contributing/llm-policies/">https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/contributing/llm-policies/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46801976">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><h2>Jellyfin LLM/"AI" Development Policy</h2></header>
<p>The rise of LLMs as a useful development tool over the last year or so has been significant. The power and flexibility of tools like Claude Code and ChatGPT have given a lot of functionality both to experienced developers and new developers alike. But there are trade-offs.</p>
<p>The Jellyfin project has, from day one, had a major focus on code quality - readability, simplicity, conciseness. This is a mostly manual effort driven by a dedicated team of individuals, and is motivated by a desire to fix the code Jellyfin is based off of which, without beating a dead horse too much, was extremely fragile, spaghettified, and prone to over-engineered complexity.</p>
<p>We are seeing a precipitous rise in contributors using AI within the Jellyfin ecosystem, both in the server and for clients, as well as a rise in criticism and concern about LLMs generally. At this time we are writing this policy to address exactly what we expect and desire with respect to contributions and interactions within our community that may use LLMs. These rules apply to all of our official projects and community spaces.</p>
<h2 id="general-guidelines">General Guidelines<a href="#general-guidelines" aria-label="Direct link to General Guidelines" title="Direct link to General Guidelines" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LLM output is <strong>expressly prohibited</strong> for any direct communication, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>issues or comments</li>
<li>feature requests or comments</li>
<li>pull request bodies or comments</li>
<li>forum/chat/etc. posts or comments</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, if you are posting <strong>any</strong> of those things, the output must be your own words, explanation, description, etc., not a verbatim dump of an LLM's output. We expect you to understand what you're posting. Violating this rule will result in closure/deletion of the offending item(s).</p>
<p>An exception will be made for <strong>LLM-assisted translations</strong> if you are having trouble accurately conveying your intent in English. Please explicitly note this ("I have translated this from MyLanguage with an LLM") and, if possible, post in your original language as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM code contributions are subject to more granularity below, but the general principle is that "pure 'vibe coding' will be rejected" and "you are responsible for what you commit". We will review in that vein. If the <strong>code looks terrible</strong>, it will be <strong>rejected as such</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="llm-code-contributions-to-official-projects">LLM Code Contributions to Official Projects<a href="#llm-code-contributions-to-official-projects" aria-label="Direct link to LLM Code Contributions to Official Projects" title="Direct link to LLM Code Contributions to Official Projects" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The use of LLMs for code is controversial and open to much interpretation. These guidelines are our best effort attempt to ensure that knowledgeable developers who seek to use these tools as a legitimate aid are not overly-hindered, while also preventing an ongoing flood of slop contributions that violate our core ethos above. These apply to <strong>all official Jellyfin projects</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Contributions should be <strong>concise and focused</strong>. If the PR claims to target X, and is also touching unrelated Y and Z, it will be rejected. This includes incidental changes to unrelated functionality, a hallmark of poorly-worded or too-general prompts. Similarly, a large PR must be <strong>broken into multiple small, manageable commits</strong> for review and history purposes.</li>
<li>Formatting and quality <strong>standards must be upheld</strong>. Excessive unhelpful comments, spaghetti code, spaces on empty lines, etc. will be interpreted as pure LLM output and rejected; you must <strong>clean up the mess</strong> before submitting. Also <strong>do not commit LLM metafiles</strong> (e.g. <code>.claude</code> configs) or any other editor-created non-code files.</li>
<li>You must <strong>review the output</strong> and be able to <strong>explain</strong> in the PR body - <strong>without</strong> LLM output as noted above - <strong>what is being changed and why</strong>. Your PR body (and, if applicable, commit bodies) should be providing context to other developers about why a change was made, and if your name is on it, we want <strong>your</strong> words and explanations, not an LLM's. If <strong>you can't explain</strong> what the LLM did, we are <strong>not interested</strong> in the change.</li>
<li>The changes must be <strong>tested</strong>. The code should build and run correctly, or it will be rejected. You should also <strong>explicitly test the functionality being modified</strong>.</li>
<li>You must be able and willing to <strong>handle review feedback</strong> and implement the suggested change(s) as required. What this means in practice is, if you do not know what has been changed or why (see #3), and thus can't implement suggested changes or discuss them <strong>yourself</strong>, then we are <strong>not interested</strong> in the change. Just dumping reviewer feedback into an LLM and expecting what comes out to be "good enough", is not.</li>
<li><strong>Features or refactors</strong> require <strong>an in-depth level of understanding</strong> about what is being changed and why. It is obvious to our reviewers when changes are made without the developer making them understanding what is happening. These will be rejected. And as noted in #1, the PR must <strong>contain multiple discrete commits</strong>. <em>We</em> will squash commits as deemed appropriate after review. Large changes must also follow our other development policies (discussion, review, implementation, testing process).</li>
<li>The <strong>final discretion always lies with the reviewers</strong>. If your PR is not capable of being reasonably reviewed, for any reason (over-complexity, size, squashed commits, etc.) it will be rejected, and this goes just as much for non-LLM-assisted PRs as it does for LLM-assisted PRs. You will be asked to split such a PR up into multiple PRs that each present a focused, concise set of changes instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>The golden rule is this: <strong>do not just let an LLM loose on the codebase with a vague vibe prompt and then commit the results as-is</strong>. This is lazy development, will <strong>always</strong> result in a <strong>poor-quality contribution</strong> from our perspective, and we are not at all interested in such slop. <strong>Make an effort</strong> or please do not bother. And again, you are free to use LLMs to <strong>assist</strong> you, but not as the sole source of code changes.</p>

<p>You are of course free to do whatever you wish for your own non-official projects. However, we will be enforcing the following rules for any <strong>sharing of such projects within our communities</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Any primarily-LLM-developed projects should be <strong>clearly marked as such</strong>. It is up to users to decide if this is acceptable to them or not. If you used an LLM for secondary assistance (e.g. docs, formatting, etc.) in an obvious way, we would err towards disclosure as well.</li>
<li>You <strong>must</strong> respect and follow licenses. If you are basing your project off of existing code, <strong>following its license is not optional</strong>. You must <strong>credit existing contributors in full</strong> for <strong>all contributions</strong>. Do not <strong>mangle the Git history</strong>, and do not <strong>commit pending 3rd party changes as your own</strong> (i.e. by copying the code and then committing it). Doing so will result in, not just rejection, but a ban from our organization and community. We have a <strong>zero tolerance policy</strong> for code theft and bad-faith attribution attempts.</li>
<li>For members of the community, <strong>do not report</strong> LLM-generated tools, clients, etc. <strong>on that basis alone</strong>, and do not engage in anti-LLM "witch hunts". As mentioned above, this is <strong>permitted</strong> and it is your choice whether to "support" said tool/client/etc. or not.</li>
<li>We, the moderators, are not going to play "LLM police" about 3rd party projects by nitpicking to try to "find LLM contributions" that otherwise follow our rules here; this is tedious and a waste of our time and effort. What this means in practice is that rule #1 is up to the author, and rule #3 must be interpreted in that vein. If you <strong>only suspect</strong> a tool is LLM-generated and violates rule #1, then downvote/ignore it and move on. <strong>Only if</strong> we see <strong>blatant breaking of rule #1</strong> we will enforce it, but again we will not be going through code line by line playing the "was this LLM generated?" game. Rule #2 will always be enforced regardless of LLM-ness or not.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla’s profit fell 46% in 2025 compared to the prior year, as CEO Elon Musk assumed a role in the Trump administration and federal electric vehicle subsidies were killed off by Congress, causing sales to plummet.</p>

<p>The electric vehicle company reported Wednesday that it recorded just $3.8 billion in profit across 2025, its lowest tally in years. Total revenue from car sales fell 11% year-over-year, too. Tesla already revealed that it shipped 1.63 million cars globally across 2025. That marks the second year in a row that its sales have declined, after Musk spent years promising average annual growth of 50%.</p>







<p>Investors largely expected the decline in sales in Tesla’s fourth quarter and full-year results for 2025, and the company beat Wall Street’s estimates for earnings and revenue, sending shares up in after-market trading Wednesday. It’s been largely buoyed by strength in its other industries and investments, including energy capabilities and AI, as Tesla has continued to lure investors’ attention away from its stalled-out automotive business.</p>

<p>The company wrote in its shareholder letter: “2025 marked a critical year for Tesla as we further expanded our mission and continued our transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company.” </p>

<p>The company revealed in the letter that it recently invested $2 billion in Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, part of the latter’s recent <a href="https://x.ai/news/series-e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Series E funding round</a>.</p>

<p>Revenue from Tesla’s solar and energy storage businesses also grew 25% compared to 2024, and services revenue (which includes payments for Full Self-Driving software, insurance, parts, and Supercharging) grew 18%. The company was even able to grow its gross margin compared to prior quarters.</p>

<p>Long-awaited projects like the Tesla Semi (first revealed in 2017) and the Cybercab (which debuted in 2024, but has been teased for years) are supposed to enter production in the first half of this year, according to Tesla.  </p>

<p>Tesla has a <em>lot </em>of other projects on its plate, which were detailed in the shareholder letter. The company has started pilot production at its lithium refinery in Texas.

<p>Apple initially told Patreon that its creators must move to the App Store's in-app purchase system <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/patreon-in-app-purchase-fees/">by November 2025</a>, or else Patreon would risk removal from the App Store, but the deadline was pushed back. Apple considers payments from supporters to creators on Patreon to be digital goods that it is entitled to receive a commission on.</p>
<p>Apple receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases and subscriptions, but this drops to 15% for a subscription that has been ongoing for more than a year.</p>
<p>Patreon gives creators the option to either increase their prices in the iOS app only, or absorb the fee themselves, keeping prices the same across platforms.</p>
<p>On the iPhone and iPad, Patreon users who wish to support a creator can sidestep the App Store's commission by completing their payment via Patreon's website.</p>
<p>Patreon said it is disappointed with how Apple has navigated this policy.</p>
<p>According to <em>TechCrunch</em>, only 4% of Patreon creators are still using the platform's legacy billing system, with the rest having already switched over.</p>
<p>Patreon has <a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/28801582599181-iOS-In-app-Purchases-and-Migrating-to-Subscription-Billing-FAQ">shared a FAQ</a> with more details for creators.</p>
