The topic of the Rust experiment was just discussed at the annual
Maintainers Summit.  The consensus among the assembled developers is that
Rust in the kernel is no longer experimental — it is now a core part of the
kernel and is here to stay.  So the "experimental" tag will be coming off.
Congratulations are in order for all of the Rust for Linux team.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																				
														<p><strong>In its first six months, New York City’s controversial congestion pricing scheme has reduced air pollution by 22% in Manhattan’s toll zone, while improving air quality across the entire metropolitan region, according to new research.</strong></p>
<p>The Cornell University study analysed data from 42 air quality monitors throughout the New York area between January 2024 and June 2025, tracking PM2.5 concentrations before and after the January 2025 launch of the Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg" alt="yellow cab on road during daytime" width="800" height="508" srcset="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg 1600w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-300x191.jpg 300w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-1024x650.jpg 1024w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-768x488.jpg 768w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-1536x975.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><br>
The findings provide the first rigorous evidence that charging drivers to enter Manhattan’s core delivers substantial public health benefits.</p>
<p>Within the CRZ, which covers Manhattan streets at or below 60th Street, average daily peak concentrations of PM2.5 dropped by 3.05 µg/m³. For context, background pollution levels in the region typically hover around 8-9 µg/m³, making this reduction particularly significant for public health.</p>
<p>Notably, the benefits were found to extend far beyond the toll zone itself. Across New York City’s five boroughs, pollution levels fell by an average of 1.07 µg/m³, while the broader metropolitan area saw reductions of 0.70 µg/m³. This refutes claims that congestion pricing merely pushes traffic and its associated pollution to neighboring communities.</p>
<p>The improvements grew stronger over time, suggesting drivers are increasingly adapting their behavior. In the CRZ’s first week, pollution reductions within the toll zone averaged just 0.8 µg/m³. By the 20th week, that figure had grown to 4.9 µg/m³, suggesting commuters were switching to public transit, rescheduling trips or finding alternative routes.</p>
<p>Indeed, traffic data supports this. Between January and June 2025, vehicle entries into the toll zone dropped approximately 11% overall, with heavy-duty truck traffic falling by 18% and passenger cars declining by 9%. The disproportionate reduction in truck traffic appears particularly important, as these vehicles contribute heavily to urban air pollution despite representing a smaller share of total traffic.</p>
<p>The results exceed outcomes from similar programs in European cities. Stockholm’s congestion pricing reduced air pollution by 5-15% over several years, while London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone achieved roughly a 7% citywide decline. The researchers suggest that New York’s comparatively larger impact reflects the city’s exceptional transit infrastructure and the high volume of discretionary trips that drivers can easily shift to subways and buses.</p>
<p>The findings arrive as other American cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, consider implementing their own congestion pricing systems. New York’s experience suggests such programs can deliver rapid environmental benefits while generating revenue for transit improvements – a dual outcome that urban planners have long sought but rarely achieved.</p>
<p>Senior author Oliver Gao said: ‘Our overall conclusion is that congestion pricing in New York City, like many other cities in the world that have implemented it, helped not only improve traffic, but also helped reduce air pollutant concentration, improve air quality and should be good for public health.’</p>
<p>The study’s co-lead author Timothy Fraser added: ‘It’s really exciting to me that air quality improved throughout the entire metro area. This tells us that congestion pricing didn’t simply relocate air pollution to the suburbs by rerouting traffic. Instead, folks are likely choosing cleaner transportation options altogether, like riding public transportation or scheduling deliveries at night. This thins traffic and limits how smog compounds when many cars are on the road.’</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="2025-12-03">2025-12-03</time><img alt="Django 6.0: codename “mosaic”" title="Django 6.0: codename “mosaic”" src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2025-12-03-django-mosaic.webp"><p>Django 6.0 was <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/dec/03/django-60-released/">released today</a>, starting another release cycle for the loved and long-lived Python web framework (now 20 years old!). It comes with a <em>mosaic</em> of new features, contributed to by many, some of which I am happy to have helped with. Below is my pick of highlights from <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/6.0/">the release notes</a>.</p><div id="upgrade-with-help-from-django-upgrade"><h2>Upgrade with help from django-upgrade<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#upgrade-with-help-from-django-upgrade"></a></h2><p>If you’re upgrading a project from Django 5.2 or earlier, please try my tool <a href="https://django-upgrade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-upgrade</a>. It will automatically update old Django code to use new features, fixing some deprecation warnings for you, including five fixers for Django 6.0. (One day, I’ll propose django-upgrade to become an official Django project, when energy and time permit…)</p></div><div id="template-partials"><h2>Template partials<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#template-partials"></a></h2><p>There are four headline features in Django 6.0, which we’ll cover before other notable changes, starting with this one:</p><blockquote>The Django Template Language now supports <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/language/#template-partials">template partials</a>, making it easier to encapsulate and reuse small named fragments within a template file.</blockquote><p>Partials are sections of a template marked by the new <code>{% partialdef %}</code> and <code>{% endpartialdef %}</code> tags. They can be reused within the same template or rendered in isolation. Let’s look at examples for each use case in turn.</p><div id="reuse-partials-within-the-same-template"><h3>Reuse partials within the same template<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#reuse-partials-within-the-same-template"></a></h3><p>The below template reuses a partial called <code>filter_controls</code> within the same template. It’s defined once at the top of the template, then used twice later on. Using a partial allows the template avoid repetition without pushing the content into a separate include file.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>section</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>videos</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{%</span> <span>partialdef</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>%}</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>{{</span> <span>filter_form</span> <span>}}</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{%</span> <span>endpartialdef</span> <span>%}</span>

  <span>{%</span> <span>partial</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>%}</span>

  <span>&lt;</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>{%</span> <span>partial</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>%}</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>section</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>Actually, we can simplify this pattern further, by using the <code>inline</code> option on the <code>partialdef</code> tag, which causes the definition to also render in place:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>section</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>videos</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{%</span> <span>partialdef</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>inline</span> <span>%}</span>

      <span>{{</span> <span>filter_form</span> <span>}}</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{%</span> <span>endpartialdef</span> <span>%}</span>

  <span>&lt;</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{%</span> <span>for</span> <span>video</span> <span>in</span> <span>videos</span> <span>%}</span>

  <span>&lt;/</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>{%</span> <span>partial</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>%}</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>section</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>Reach for this pattern any time you find yourself repeating template code within the same template. Because partials can use variables, you can also use them to de-duplicate when rendering similar controls with different data.</p></div><div id="render-partials-in-isolation"><h3>Render partials in isolation<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#render-partials-in-isolation"></a></h3><p>The below template defines a <code>view_count</code> partial that’s intended to be re-rendered in isolation. It uses the <code>inline</code> option, so when the whole template is rendered, the partial is included.</p><p>The page uses <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, via my <a href="https://django-htmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-htmx package</a>, to periodically refresh the view count, through the <code><span>hx-*</span></code> attributes. The request from htmx goes to a dedicated view that re-renders the <code>view_count</code> partial.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>{%</span> <span>load</span> <span>django_htmx</span> <span>%}</span>

<span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>The relevant code for the two views could look like this:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.shortcuts</span> <span>import</span> <span>render</span>


<span>def</span> <span>video</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>video_id</span><span>):</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>"video.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"video"</span><span>:</span> <span>video</span><span>})</span>


<span>def</span> <span>video_view_count</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>video_id</span><span>):</span>
    <span>...</span>

</pre></div><p>The initial <code>video</code> view renders the full template <code>video.html</code>. The <code>video_view_count</code> view renders just the <code>view_count</code> partial, by appending <code>#view_count</code> to the template name. This syntax is similar to how you’d reference an HTML fragment by its ID in a URL.</p></div><div id="history"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history"></a></h3><p>htmx was the main motivation for this feature, as promoted by htmx creator Carson Gross in <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/">a cross-framework review post</a>. Using partials definitely helps maintain “Locality of behaviour” within your templates, easing authoring, debugging, and maintenance by avoiding template file sprawl.</p><p>Django’s support for template partials was initially developed by Carlton Gibson in the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-template-partials/">django-template-partials package</a>, which remains available for older Django versions. The integration into Django itself was done in a Google Summer of Code project this year, worked on by student Farhan Ali and mentored by Carlton, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36410">Ticket #36410</a>. You can read more about the development process in <a href="https://www.farhana.li/blog/my-gsoc25-journey-django">Farhan’s retrospective blog post</a>. Many thanks to Farhan for authoring, Carlton for mentoring, and Natalia Bidart, Nick Pope, and Sarah Boyce for reviewing!</p></div></div><div id="tasks-framework"><h2>Tasks framework<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#tasks-framework"></a></h2><p>The next headline feature we’re covering:</p><blockquote>Django now includes a built-in Tasks framework for running code outside the HTTP request–response cycle. This enables offloading work, such as sending emails or processing data, to background workers.</blockquote><p>Basically, there’s a new API for defining and enqueuing background tasks—very cool!</p><p>Background tasks are a way of running code outside of the request-response cycle. They’re a common requirement in web applications, used for sending emails, processing images, generating reports, and more.</p><p>Historically, Django has not provided any system for background tasks, and kind of ignored the problem space altogether. Developers have instead relied on third-party packages like <a href="https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/">Celery</a> or <a href="https://django-q2.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Django Q2</a>. While these systems are fine, they can be complex to set up and maintain, and often don’t “go with the grain” of Django.</p><p>The new Tasks framework fills this gap by providing an interface to define background tasks, which task runner packages can then integrate with. This common ground allows third-party Django packages to define tasks in a standard way, assuming you’ll be using a compatible task runner to execute them.</p><p>Define tasks with the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/tasks/#django.tasks.task"><code>@task</code></a> decorator:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.tasks</span> <span>import</span> <span>task</span>


<span>@task</span>
<span>def</span> <span>resize_video</span><span>(</span><span>video_id</span><span>):</span> <span>...</span>
</pre></div><p>…and enqueue them for background execution with the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/tasks/#django.tasks.Task.enqueue"><code>Task.enqueue()</code></a> method:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>example.tasks</span> <span>import</span> <span>resize_video</span>


<span>def</span> <span>upload_video</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>):</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>resize_video</span><span>.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(</span><span>video</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div><div id="execute-tasks"><h3>Execute tasks<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#execute-tasks"></a></h3><p>At this time, Django does not include a production-ready task backend, only two that are suitable for development and testing:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/tasks/#immediate-execution"><code>ImmediateBackend</code></a> - runs tasks synchronously, blocking until they complete.</li><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/tasks/#dummy-backend"><code>DummyBackend</code></a> - does nothing when tasks are enqueued, but allows them to be inspected later. Useful for tests, where you can assert that tasks were enqueued without actually running them.</li></ul><p>For production use, you’ll need to use a third-party package that implements one, for which <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tasks/">django-tasks</a>, the reference implementation, is the primary option. It provides <code>DatabaseBackend</code> for storing tasks in your SQL database, a fine solution for many projects, avoiding extra infrastructure and allowing atomic task enqueuing within database transactions. We may see this backend merged into Django in due course, or at least become an official package, to help make Django “batteries included” for background tasks.</p><p>To use django-tasks’ <code>DatabaseBackend</code> today, first install the package:</p><p><strong>Second,</strong> add these two apps to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>"django_tasks"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"django_tasks.backends.database"</span><span>,</span>
    <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div><p><strong>Third,</strong> configure <code>DatabaseBackend</code> as your tasks backend in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#tasks">new <code>TASKS</code> setting</a>:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>TASKS</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"BACKEND"</span><span>:</span> <span>"django_tasks.backends.database.DatabaseBackend"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p><strong>Fourth,</strong> run migrations to create the necessary database tables:</p><p><strong>Finally,</strong> to run the task worker process, use the package’s <code>db_worker</code> management command:</p><div><pre><span></span>$<span> </span>./manage.py<span> </span>db_worker
Starting<span> </span>worker<span> </span><span>worker_id</span><span>=</span>jWLMLrms3C2NcUODYeatsqCFvd5rK6DM<span> </span><span>queues</span><span>=</span>default
</pre></div><p>This process runs indefinitely, polling for tasks and executing them, logging events as it goes:</p><div><pre><span></span>Task id=10b794ed-9b64-4eed-950c-fcc92cd6784b path=example.tasks.echo state=RUNNING
Hello from test task!
Task id=10b794ed-9b64-4eed-950c-fcc92cd6784b path=example.tasks.echo state=SUCCEEDED
</pre></div><p>You’ll want to run <code>db_worker</code> in production, and also in development if you want to test background task execution.</p></div><div id="history-1"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history-1"></a></h3><p>It’s been a long path to get the Tasks framework into Django, and I’m super excited to see it finally available in Django 6.0. Jake Howard started on the idea for Wagtail, a Django-powered CMS, back in 2021, as they have a need for common task definitions across their package ecosystem. He upgraded the idea to target Django itself in 2024, when he proposed <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0014-background-workers.rst">DEP 0014</a>. As a member of the Steering Council at the time, I had the pleasure of helping review and accept the DEP.</p><p>Since then, Jake has been leading the implementation effort, building pieces first in the separate <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tasks/">django-tasks package</a> before preparing them for inclusion in Django itself. This step was done under <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35859">Ticket #35859</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/18627">a pull request</a> that took nearly a year to review and land. Thanks to Jake for his perseverance here, and to all reviewers: Andreas Nüßlein, Dave Gaeddert, Eric Holscher, Jacob Walls, Jake Howard, Kamal Mustafa, @rtr1, @tcely, Oliver Haas, Ran Benita, Raphael Gaschignard, and Sarah Boyce.</p><p>Read more about this feature and story in <a href="https://theorangeone.net/posts/django-dot-tasks-exists/">Jake’s post celebrating when it was merged</a>.</p></div></div><div id="content-security-policy-support"><h2>Content Security Policy support<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#content-security-policy-support"></a></h2><p>Our third headline feature:</p><blockquote>Built-in support for the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/#security-csp">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> standard is now available, making it easier to protect web applications against content injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS). CSP allows declaring trusted sources of content by giving browsers strict rules about which scripts, styles, images, or other resources can be loaded.</blockquote><p>I’m really excited about this, because I’m a bit of a security nerd who’s been deploying CSP for client projects for years.</p><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP">CSP</a> is a security standard that can protect your site from cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks. You set a <code><span>content-security-policy</span></code> header to declare which content sources are trusted for your site, and then browsers will block content from other sources. For example, you might declare that only scripts your domain are allowed, so an attacker who manages to inject a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag pointing to evil.com would be thwarted, as the browser would refuse to load it.</p><p>Previously, Django had no built-in support for CSP, and developers had to rely on building their own, or using a third-party package like the very popular <a href="https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-csp</a>. But this was a little bit inconvenient, as it meant that other third-party packages couldn’t reliably integrate with CSP, as there was no common API to do so.</p><p>The new CSP support provides all the core features that django-csp did, with a slightly tidier and more Djangoey API. To get started, <strong>first</strong> add <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware"><code>ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware</code></a> to your <code>MIDDLEWARE</code> setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>MIDDLEWARE</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>"django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware"</span><span>,</span>
    <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div><p>Place it next to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware"><code>SecurityMiddleware</code></a>, as it similarly adds security-related headers to all responses. (You <em>do</em> have <code>SecurityMiddleware</code> enabled, right?)</p><p><strong>Second,</strong> configure your CSP policy using the new settings:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#secure-csp"><code>SECURE_CSP</code></a> to configure the <code><span>content-security-policy</span></code> header, which is your actively enforced policy.</li><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#secure-csp-report-only"><code>SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY</code></a> to configure the <code><span>content-security-policy-report-only</span></code> header, which sets a non-enforced policy for which browsers report violations to a specified endpoint. This option is useful for testing and monitoring a policy before enforcing it.</li></ul><p>For example, to adopt the nonce-based strict CSP <a href="https://web.dev/articles/strict-csp">recommended by web.dev</a>, you could start with the following setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.utils.csp</span> <span>import</span> <span>CSP</span>

<span>SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"script-src"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONCE</span><span>,</span> <span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>STRICT_DYNAMIC</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"object-src"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONE</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"base-uri"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONE</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/csp/#django.utils.csp.CSP"><code>CSP</code></a> enum used above provides constants for CSP directives, to help avoid typos.</p><p>This policy is quite restrictive and will break most existing sites if deployed as-is, because it requires nonces, as covered next. That’s why the example shows starting with the report-only mode header, to help track down places that need fixing before enforcing the policy. You’d later change to setting the <code>SECURE_CSP</code> setting to enforce the policy.</p><p>Anyway, those are the two basic steps to set up the new CSP support!</p><div id="nonce-generation"><h3>Nonce generation<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#nonce-generation"></a></h3><p>A key part of the new feature is that <strong>nonce generation</strong> is now built-in to Django, when using the CSP middleware. Nonces are a security feature in CSP that allow you to mark specific <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags as trusted with a <code>nonce</code> attribute:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>/static/app.js</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>module</span> <span>nonce</span><span>=</span><span>55vsH4w7ATHB85C3MbPr_g</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>The nonce value is randomly generated per-request, and included in the CSP header. An attacker performing content injection couldn’t guess the nonce, so browsers can trust only those tags that include the correct nonce. Because nonce generation is now part of Django, third-party packages can depend on it for their <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags and they’ll continue to work if you adopt CSP with nonces.</p><p>Nonces are the recommended way to use CSP today, avoiding problems with previous allow-list based approaches. That’s why the above recommended policy enables them. To adopt a nonce-based policy, you’ll need to annotate your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags with the nonce value through the following steps.</p><p><strong>First,</strong> add the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/api/#django.template.context_processors.csp"><code>csp</code></a> template context processor to your <code>TEMPLATES</code> setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>TEMPLATES</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>"BACKEND"</span><span>:</span> <span>"django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"OPTIONS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"context_processors"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
                <span># ...</span>
                <span>"django.template.context_processors.csp"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>],</span>
        <span>},</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div><p><strong>Second,</strong> annotate your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags with <code><span>nonce="{{</span> csp_nonce }}"</code>:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>-   &lt;script src="{% static 'app.js' %}" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>+   &lt;script src="{% static 'app.js' %}" type="module" nonce="{{ csp_nonce }}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>This can be tedious and error-prone, hence using the report-only mode first to monitor violations might be useful, especially on larger projects.</p><p>Anyway, deploying CSP right would be another post in itself, or even a book chapter, so we’ll stop here for now. For more info, check out <a href="https://web.dev/articles/strict-csp">that web.dev article</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">the MDN CSP guide</a>.</p></div><div id="history-2"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history-2"></a></h3><p>CSP itself was proposed for browsers way back in 2004, and was first implemented in Mozilla Firefox version 4, released 2011. That same year, <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15727">Django Ticket #15727</a> was opened, proposing adding CSP support to Django. Mozilla created <a href="https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-csp</a> from 2010, before the first public availability of CSP, using it on their own Django-powered sites. The first comment on Ticket #15727 pointed to django-csp, and the community basically rolled with it as the de facto solution.</p><p>Over the years, CSP itself evolved, as did django-csp, with <a href="https://rob.cogit8.org/">Rob Hudson</a> ending up as its maintainer. Focusing on the package motivated to finally get CSP into Django itself. He made a draft PR and posted on Ticket #15727 in 2024, which I enjoyed helping review. He iterated on the PR over the next 13 months until it was finally merged for Django 6.0. Thanks to Rob for his heroic dedication here, and to all reviewers: Benjamin Balder Bach, Carlton Gibson, Collin Anderson, David Sanders, David Smith, Florian Apolloner, Harro van der Klauw, Jake Howard, Natalia Bidart, Paolo Melchiorre, Sarah Boyce, and Sébastien Corbin.</p></div></div><div id="email-api-updates"><h2>Email API updates<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#email-api-updates"></a></h2><p>The fourth and final headline feature:</p><blockquote>Email handling in Django now uses Python’s modern email API, introduced in Python 3.6.

The other two methods would leave you with only the old value or the expression object, meaning you’d need to call <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/instances/#django.db.models.Model.refresh_from_db"><code>Model.refresh_from_db()</code></a> to get any updated value if necessary. This was hard to remember and it costs an extra database query.</p><p>Now Django takes advantage of the <code>RETURNING</code> SQL clause to save the model instance and fetch updated dynamic field values in a single query, on backends that support it (SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Oracle). A <code>save()</code> call may now issue a query like:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>UPDATE</span><span> </span><span>"example_video"</span>
<span>SET</span><span> </span><span>"last_updated"</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>NOW</span><span>()</span>

<span>RETURNING</span><span> </span><span>"example_video"</span><span>.</span><span>"last_updated"</span>
</pre></div><p>Django puts the return value into the model field, so you can read it immediately after saving:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>video</span> <span>=</span> <span>Video</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

</pre></div><p>On backends that don’t support <code>RETURNING</code> (MySQL and MariaDB), Django now marks the dynamic fields as deferred after saving. That way, the later access, as in the above example, will automatically call <code>Model.refresh_from_db()</code>.

Django uses this setting to add a primary key field called <code>id</code> to models that don’t explicitly define a primary key field. For example, if you define a model like this:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Video</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div><p>…then it will have two fields: <code>id</code> and <code>title</code>, where <code>id</code> uses the type defined by <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code>.</p><p>The setting can also be overridden on a per-app basis by defining <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.default_auto_field"><code>AppConfig.default_auto_field</code></a> in the app’s <code>apps.py</code> file:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.apps</span> <span>import</span> <span>AppConfig</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ChannelConfig</span><span>(</span><span>AppConfig</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"channel"</span>
    <span>default_auto_field</span> <span>=</span> <span>"django.db.models.BigAutoField"</span>
</pre></div><p>A key motivation for adding the setting was to allow projects to switch from <code>AutoField</code> (a 32-bit integer) to <code>BigAutoField</code> (a 64-bit integer) for primary keys, without needing changes to every model. <code>AutoField</code> can store values up to about 2.1 billion, which sounds large but it becomes easy to hit at scale. <code>BigAutoField</code> can store values up to about 9.2 quintillion, which is “more than enough” for every practical purpose.</p><p>If a model using <code>AutoField</code> hits its maximum value, it can no longer accept new rows, a problem known as <strong>primary key exhaustion</strong>. The table is effectively blocked, requiring an urgent fix to switch the model from <code>AutoField</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code> via a locking database migration on a large table. For a great watch on how Kraken is fixing this problem, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4q0k_FNhw">Tim Bell’s DjangoCon Europe 2025 talk</a>, detailing some clever techniques to proactively migrate large tables with minimal downtime.</p><p>To stop this problem arising for new projects, Django 3.2 made new projects created with <code>startproject</code> set <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code>, and new apps created with <code>startapp</code> set their <code>AppConfig.default_auto_field</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code>. It also added a system check to ensure that projects set <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> explicitly, to ensure users were aware of the feature and could make an informed choice.</p><p>Now Django 6.0 changes the actual default values of the setting and app config attribute to <code>BigAutoField</code>. Projects using <code>BigAutoField</code> can remove the setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>-DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"</span>
</pre></div><p>…and app config attribute:</p><div><pre><span></span>from django.apps import AppConfig

<span> </span>class ChannelConfig(AppConfig):
<span> </span>    name = "channel"
<span>-    default_auto_field = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"</span>
</pre></div><p>The default <code>startproject</code> and <code>startapp</code> templates also no longer set these values. This change reduces the amount of boilerplate in new projects, and the problem of primary key exhaustion can fade into history, becoming something that most Django users no longer need to think about.</p><div id="history-6"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history-6"></a></h3><p>The addition of <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> in Django 3.2 was proposed by Caio Ariede and implemented by Tom Forbes, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31007">Ticket #31007</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>On September 14, 2015, <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=9314793">our first publicly-trusted certificate</a> went live. We were proud that we had issued a certificate that a significant majority of clients could accept, and had done it using <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder">automated software</a>. Of course, in retrospect this was just the first of billions of certificates. Today, Let’s Encrypt is the largest certificate authority in the world in terms of certificates issued, the ACME protocol we helped create and standardize is integrated throughout the server ecosystem, and we’ve become a household name among system administrators. We’re closing in on protecting one billion web sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/"><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/blog/blog-2025-12-09-chart1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In 2023, we marked the <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/tenth-anniversary/">tenth anniversary of the creation of our nonprofit</a>, Internet Security Research Group, which continues to host Let’s Encrypt and other public benefit infrastructure projects. Now, in honor of the tenth anniversary of Let’s Encrypt’s public certificate issuance and the start of the general availability of our services, we’re looking back at a few milestones and factors that contributed to our success.</p>
<h2 id="growth">Growth</h2>
<p>A conspicuous part of Let’s Encrypt’s history is how thoroughly our vision of scalability through automation has succeeded.</p>
<p>In March 2016, we issued our one millionth certificate. Just two years later, in September 2018, we were issuing a million certificates every day. In 2020 we reached a billion total certificates issued and as of late 2025 we’re frequently issuing ten million certificates per day. We’re now on track to reach a billion active sites, probably sometime in the coming year. (The “certificates issued” and “certificates active” metrics are quite different because our certificates regularly expire and get replaced.)</p>
<p>The steady growth of our issuance volume shows the strength of our architecture, the validity of our vision, and the great efforts of our engineering team to scale up our own infrastructure. It also reminds us of the confidence that the Internet community is placing in us, making the use of a Let’s Encrypt certificate a normal and, dare we say, boring choice. But I often point out that our ever-growing issuance volumes are only an indirect measure of value. What ultimately matters is improving the security of people’s use of the web, which, as far as Let’s Encrypt’s contribution goes, is not measured by issuance volumes so much as by the prevalence of HTTPS encryption. For that reason, we’ve always emphasized the graph of the percentage of encrypted connections that web users make (here represented by statistics from Firefox).</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/"><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/blog/blog-2025-12-09-chart2.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(These graphs are snapshots as of the date of this post; a dynamically updated version is found <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/#percent-pageloads">on our stats page</a>.) Our biggest goal was to make a concrete, measurable security impact on the web by getting HTTPS connection prevalence to increase—and it’s worked. It took five years or so to get the global percentage from below 30% to around 80%, where it’s remained ever since. In the U.S. it has been close to 95% for a while now.</p>
<p>A good amount of the remaining unencrypted traffic probably comes from internal or private organizational sites (intranets), but other than that we don’t know much about it; this would be a great topic for Internet security researchers to look into.</p>
<p>We believe our present growth in certificate issuance volume is essentially coming from growth in the web as a whole. In other words, if we protect 20% more sites over some time period, it’s because the web itself grew by 20%.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-milestones">A few milestones</h2>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/blog/">blogged about most of Let’s Encrypt’s most significant milestones</a> as they’ve happened, and I invite everyone in our community to look over those blog posts to see how far we’ve come. We’ve also <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/annual-reports/">published annual reports for the past seven years</a>, which offer elegant and concise summaries of our work.</p>
<p>As I personally think back on the past decade, just a few of the many events that come to mind include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2014/11/18/announcing-lets-encrypt">Telling the world about the project</a> in November 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/09/14/our-first-cert">Our first certificate issuance</a> in September 2015</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2016/03/08/our-millionth-cert">Our one millionth certificate</a> in March 2016, then <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/06/28/hundred-million-certs">our 100 millionth certificate</a> in June 2017, and then <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/02/27/one-billion-certs">our billionth certificate</a> in 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along the way, first issuing one million certificates in a single day (in September 2018), significantly contributed to by the SquareSpace and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2021/09/14/speed-at-scale-shopify">Shopify</a> Let’s Encrypt integrations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just at the end of September 2025, we issued more than ten million certificates in a day for the first time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also periodically rolled out new features such as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2016/10/21/introducing-idn-support">internationalized domain name support</a> (2016), <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018">wildcard support</a> (2018), and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/02/20/first-short-lived-cert-issued">short-lived</a> and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/07/01/issuing-our-first-ip-address-certificate">IP address</a> (2025) certificates. We’re always working on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/upcoming-features/">more new features</a> for the future.</p>
<p>There are many technical milestones like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers">our database server upgrades</a> in 2021, where we found we needed a serious server infrastructure boost because of the tremendous volumes of data we were dealing with. Similarly, our original infrastructure was using Gigabit Ethernet internally, and, with the growth of our issuance volume and logging, we found that our Gigabit Ethernet network eventually became too slow to synchronize database instances! (Today we’re using 25-gig Ethernet.) More recently, we’ve <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/06/11/reflections-on-a-year-of-sunlight">experimented with architectural upgrades</a> to our ever-growing Certificate Transparency logs, and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/08/14/rfc-6962-logs-eol">decided to go ahead with deploying those upgrades</a>—to help us not just keep up with, but get ahead of, our continuing growth.</p>
<p>These kinds of growing pains and successful responses to them are nice to remember because they point to the inexorable increase in demands on our infrastructure as we’ve become a more and more essential part of the Internet. I’m proud of our technical teams which have handled those increased demands capably and professionally.</p>
<p>I also recall the ongoing work involved in <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs">making sure our certificates would be as widely accepted as possible</a>, which has meant managing the original cross-signature from IdenTrust, and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet">subsequently creating and propagating our own root CA certificates</a>. This process has required PKI engineering, key ceremonies, root program interactions, documentation, and community support associated with certificate migrations. Most users never have reason to look behind the scenes at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/">our chains of trust</a>, but our engineers update it as root and intermediate certificates have been replaced. We’ve engaged at the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/B Forum</a>, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>, and in other venues with the browser root programs to help shape the web PKI as a technical leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/28/executive-director-letter">As I wrote in 2020</a>, our ideal of complete automation of the web PKI aims at a world where most site owners wouldn’t even need to think about certificates at all. We continue to get closer and closer to that world, which creates a risk that people will take us and our services for granted, as the details of certificate renewal occupy less of site operators’ mental energy. As I said at the time,</p>
<p>When your strategy as a nonprofit is to get out of the way, to offer services that people don’t need to think about, you’re running a real risk that you’ll eventually be taken for granted. There is a tension between wanting your work to be invisible and the need for recognition of its value. If people aren’t aware of how valuable our services are then we may not get the support we need to continue providing them.</p>
<p>I’m also grateful to our communications and fundraising staff who help make clear what we’re doing every day and how we’re making the Internet safer.</p>
<h2 id="recognition-of-let-s-encrypt">Recognition of Let’s Encrypt</h2>
<p>Our community continually recognizes our work in tangible ways by using our certificates—now by the tens of millions per day—and by <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsor/">sponsoring us</a>.</p>
<p>We were honored to be recognized with awards including the <a href="https://rwc.iacr.org/LevchinPrize/winners.html#certs">2022 Levchin Prize for Real-World Cryptography</a> and the <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/documents/2019-ISRG-Annual-Report-Desktop.pdf">2019 O’Reilly Open Source Award</a>. In October of this year some of the individuals who got Let’s Encrypt started were honored to receive the <a href="https://secdev.ieee.org/2025/awardees/">IEEE Cybersecurity Award for Practice</a>.</p>
<p>We documented the history, design, and goals of the project in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3319535.3363192">an academic paper at the ACM CCS ‘19 conference</a>, which has subsequently been cited hundreds of times in academic research.</p>

<p>Ten years later, I’m still deeply grateful to the five initial sponsors that got Let’s Encrypt off the ground - Mozilla, EFF, Cisco, Akamai, and IdenTrust. When they committed significant resources to the project, it was just an ambitious idea. They saw the potential and believed in our team, and because of that we were able to build the service we operate today.</p>
<h2 id="identrust-a-critical-technical-partner">IdenTrust: A critical technical partner</h2>
<p>I’d like to particularly recognize <a href="https://www.identrust.com/">IdenTrust</a>, a PKI company that worked as a partner from the outset and enabled us to issue publicly-trusted certificates via a cross-signature from one of their roots. We would simply not have been able to launch our publicly-trusted certificate service without them. Back when I first told them that we were starting a new nonprofit certificate authority that would give away millions of certificates for free, there wasn’t any precedent for this arrangement, and there wasn’t necessarily much reason for IdenTrust to pay attention to our proposal. But the company really understood what we were trying to do and was willing to engage from the beginning. Ultimately, IdenTrust’s support made our original issuance model a reality.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m proud of what we have achieved with our staff, partners, and donors over the past ten years. I hope to be even more proud of the next ten years, as we use our strong footing to continue to pursue our mission to protect Internet users by lowering monetary, technological, and informational barriers to a more secure and privacy-respecting Internet.</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt is a project of the nonprofit Internet Security Research Group, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. You can help us make the next ten years great as well by <a href="http://letsencrypt.org/donate">donating</a> or becoming a <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsor/">sponsor</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
					<article>
						
						
						<p>I run a <a href="https://ldnug.org/">.NET user group here in London</a>, and we host a lot of talks from people who are relatively inexperienced presenters. Sometimes they’ve done presentations internally but never spoken before a public audience. Sometimes they’re developers who have been in theatre or played in bands; people with plenty of stage experience but who haven’t presented on technical topics before - and sometimes they’ve never done any kind of public presentations or performance at all. We aim to be a friendly, supportive crowd; public speaking can be daunting, and the first public outing of somebody’s first talk can be… let’s just say that the presenter sometimes learns a lot more than the audience, and leave it at that.</p>

<p>But it can also be a hugely rewarding experience, and as a seasoned tech presenter who’s been doing this for a while, aspiring speakers often ask me for advice on how to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>Before we get into the specifics, there are two things to bear in mind.</p>

<p>One: ask yourself why you want to do this. What does “the next level” mean for you? Are you looking to promote your consultancy, or your training courses, or your software products? Do you want to become a professional speaker and actually get paid to give talks? Are you doing it ‘cos you want to go places and meet people? Figure out what “success” looks like for you.</p>

<p>Two: be realistic about how much work is involved. It took me <em>seven years</em> to go from my first user group lightning talk, back 2008, to my first international conference. If you think you can hack together some code, write a talk about it, stick it on Sessionize and three months later you’re on your way to a major international event like NDC or Yow! or Devoxx… well, no. That’s not how this works. Strap in; it’s a long ride.</p>

<h3 id="year-1-get-good">Year 1: Get Good</h3>

<p>Write the talk. Write a talk nobody else could do; tell a story nobody else can tell. Figure out what your audience is going to learn, and why you’re the best person to teach them that. Then give it at local user group. It might go great. It might be a train wreck. Don’t worry. That’s one of the reasons user groups exist. Learn from the experience. Fix the demos. Fix the slides. If it was too short? Write some more. If it was too long? Cut something. Give it at another user group. Do it again. Do it again. Maybe write a second talk, shop that one around a couple of user groups too.</p>

<p>If you can’t find user groups, look on Meetup.com. Yes, it’s a horrible platform, but it works; search by topic, search by region, find groups that look like a good match for your content, and ask if they’re looking for speakers. They probably are.</p>

<h3 id="year-2-get-seen">Year 2: Get Seen</h3>

<p>After user groups and meetups come the community conferences. Typically small, one-day events, with a few tracks, and usually free (or very cheap) to attend. For me, these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer!/_Developer!/_Developer!#External\_links">the DDD events</a> _(that’s DDD as in Developers! Developers! Developers!, not to be confused with DDD as in Domain Driven Design), _a series of one-day free developer events around the UK, organised by volunteers, usually on a Saturday so people don’t have to take time off work. They bring in a good crowd, they’re a great way to get to know other presenters and people who are involved in tech events, and you’ll almost certainly meet a few people who are on the programme committees for the bigger conferences.</p>

<p>Events like this are your chance to get noticed. Turn up the day before, join the pre-conference dinner and drinks, introduce yourself. Yeah, it’s awkward when you don’t know anybody. There will be other people there who don’t know anybody and will appreciate you making the effort. Enjoy yourself, but don’t end up doing tequila shots in a karaoke bar at 3am. Not now. You’re there to give a talk, remember?</p>

<p>Go to the event. Spend the whole day there, do your talk, watch the other sessions. Communicate with the organisers. You don’t want their memorable impression of you to be a half-hour of panic and missed calls because one of their speakers has gone AWOL and nobody knows where they are.</p>

<p>Figure out how to keep in touch with the people you met. Join the Signal or WhatsApp group chat; if there isn’t one, create one. Follow them on LinkedIn, or Bluesky - be prepared to go where people are; don’t expect folks to join Mastodon just because that’s where you want to talk to them. That’s not how this works. If you really don’t want to play the social media game - and I can’t blame you - there’s always good old-fashioned email. A short email a week later saying “hey, thanks for having me” or “hey, I loved your session at DDD, let’s keep in touch” can pay off in a big way.</p>

<p>Finally, watch out for events that put video of their sessions online. Having a couple of YouTube links of you doing your thing in front of a live, appreciate audience can make all the difference when a programme committee is looking at a handful of talks and can only accept one of them.</p>

<h3 id="year-3-get-accepted">Year 3: Get Accepted</h3>

<p>You’ve got a couple of talks. You’ve delivered then enough times that you know they’re good *(and if they’re not good, make them good - or scrap them and write new ones)*. You know people. People know you. If somebody asks “hey, do we know anybody who could do a good session about $topic”, your name comes up. You’ve got a decent network of connections - group chats, LinkedIn, email addresses.</p>

<p>Now, find all the conferences in your field with an open Call for Papers (CfP), and get submitting. Dave Aronson over at codeasaur.us maintains a really useful <a href="https://www.codosaur.us/speaking/cfps-ending-soon">list of CfPs which are closing soon</a>. Check that regularly. Many events will cover your travel &amp; hotel costs, although with sponsorship budgets drying up right across the industry that’s not as prevalent as it was a few years ago. If not, maybe you can persuade your employer to pay your travel - “hey, boss, if I can get a free ticket to this amazing conference with all these industry experts, do you think the company will pay my air fare &amp; hotel?”</p>

<p>Lean on your network. What are people submitting to? Which events should you look out for? Which topics are getting a lot of traction (and which topics are not?)</p>

<p>Keep your content fresh. Write new talks. Keep giving them at user groups and community events.</p>

<p>Keep your submissions focused. 2-3 talks per event; don’t submit ten wildly different abstracts to the same conference in the hope one of them will get accepted. Every selection committee I’ve been on, if we see that, we assume the presenter hasn’t actually written *any* of them yet and is throwing everything they can think of into the mix and hoping one of them gets chosen. Not a great way to stand out. An open CFP at a big tech conference typically gets 20+ submissions for every available slot, which means if you reduce it to a numbers game, you’re submitting 20 talks for every one that gets accepted. Keep track of the numbers, and be objective about it.</p>

<h3 id="year-4-get-bored">Year 4: Get Bored.</h3>

<p>It’s great fun doing this for a while… but it’s also exhausting. Some people hit it hard for a few years, do all the things, go to all the places, make a lot of great friends and happy memories, and then wake up one day and decide that’s enough. Some people do a few talks, tick it off their bucket list and decide that’s enough for them. Some settle into a gentle routine of 3-4 events they’ll do every year. And yes, some of us end up treating our calendars like a game of Tetris, juggling flights and trains and hotels and meetups and conferences and spending half the year on the road and the other half writing talks and workshops and all the other things it’s hard to do when you’re at the airport.</p>

<p>That’s why you gotta figure out ahead of time what “success” looks like. If you’re doing it for fun, remember to have fun - and if you find you’re not enjoying it any more? Stop. If you’re doing it as promotion or marketing? Track your leads. Make sure it’s actually generating the attention and the revenue it’s supposed to. If you’re doing it for money, be mercenary: no pay, no play. Not every event is the same, of course. In a given year I’ll have some events that are fun, some that are lucrative, some that are running alongside workshops or training engagements. Just make sure you know which is which.</p>

<p>Finally: respect your audience. Whether you’re talking to five people at a meetup, fifty at a community event, or five thousand at a huge international conference: those people are the reason you get to do this. They have given up their time - and often a substantial amount of money - to hear what you have to say. They deserve your best shot, every time. If you find you’re bored, fed up, tired, running talks on autopilot or making mistakes because you just don’t care? It’s time to try something else - and remember, there’s a thousand aspiring speakers out there who would dearly love to take that spot instead of you.</p>

<p>Now get out there. Work hard, have fun, teach us awesome things, and if you ever want me to look over an abstract or a slide deck, drop me a line - <a href="https://dylanbeattie.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8aeef3e6ebe4caeef3e6ebe4e8efebfefee3efa4e4effe"><span data-cfemail="c8acb1a4a9a688acb1a4a9a6aaada9bcbca1ade6a6adbc">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. I’d be happy to help.</p>

Interest rates are high, which has stifled construction and pushed up the cost of mortgages. As a result, more Americans are renting, and roughly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/arh-2024-cost-burden-share">half of those households</a> are spending more than a third of their income on shelter.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This crisis has many causes: restrictive zoning codes, arcane permitting processes, excessive <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/local-government-community-input-housing-public-transportation/629625/">community input</a>, declining construction productivity, expensive labor, and expensive lumber. And, some say, the aggressive entry of private equity into the housing market. Institutional investors have bought up hundreds of thousands of American homes since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, outbidding families and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/housing-crisis-hedge-funds-private-equity-scapegoat/672839/">pushing up rents</a>—a trend lamented by everyone from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://truthout.org/articles/ocasio-cortez-digs-into-private-equity-for-buying-houses-and-jacking-up-rents/">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/14/harris-vance-housing-crisis-00183484">J.

Who’s going to win in a bidding war for a three-bedroom in a suburb of Cincinnati: a single-income family with a scrabbled-together 10 percent down payment or a Wall Street LLC offering cash? Still, housing economists and policy analysts have argued that institutional investors have played at most a bit part. Supply constraints began cropping up on the coasts a generation ago, if not earlier, whereas Wall Street started buying up significant numbers of homes only after the Great Recession and especially after the pandemic. Moreover, even if big investors are purchasing thousands of homes, they don’t own significant numbers of homes compared with small-scale landlords and individuals.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/">Rogé Karma: The secretive industry devouring the U.S. economy</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Yet in some markets, the balance has shifted.

In some communities, they control more than 20 percent of properties.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I figured that big investors might be picking up vacation rentals in Colorado and expensive apartment buildings in the Bay Area and the Acela Corridor. They are, the report’s authors told me. But these investors are pouring the most money into “buy low, rent high” neighborhoods: communities, many of them in the South and the Rust Belt, where large shares of families can’t afford a mortgage.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“They’re pulling all the starter homes off of the market in low-income, high-minority-density neighborhoods,” George McCarthy, the president of the Lincoln Institute, told me—a trend that is intensifying the country’s yawning racial wealth and homeownership gaps. In Cleveland, corporations own 17.5 percent of residential real-estate parcels. In the city’s East Side, which contains many predominantly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://visual.clevelandhistory.org/black-population-suburbs/">Black neighborhoods</a>, just one in five homebuyers in 2021 took out a mortgage. The rest—many investors, presumably—paid in cash or took out a loan from a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://signalcleveland.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cuyahoga-Home-Mortgage-Lending-3-20-23.pdf">non-traditional financier</a>.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/housing-crisis-hedge-funds-private-equity-scapegoat/672839/">Jerusalem Demsas: Meet the latest housing-crisis scapegoat</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In Baltimore’s majority-Black McElderry Park and Ellwood Park/Monument neighborhoods, owner-occupants made just 13 percent of purchases in 2022. In a majority-white neighborhood not far away, owner-occupants bought more than 80 percent of homes that same year, and out-of-state corporations owned less than 1 percent of residential parcels.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The report made me see the country’s real-estate crisis in a different light. Private-equity firms and other deep-pocketed investors aren’t why Seattle and Boston are unaffordable. Those cities have had shortage-driven housing crises that have intensified over decades. The firms aren’t why many towns in the Mountain West have seen jumps in home values and a corresponding increase in homelessness, displacement, and eviction. In those communities, white-collar emigrants from big cities have arrived and outbid locals. But investor money is distorting the housing market in communities with low wages and decent-enough housing supply, pushing thousands of Black and Latino families off the property ladder. Tens of thousands of workers who would like to invest in a home are instead stuck paying rent, and putting up with the associated uncertainty.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">While not all corporate landlords are bad landlords, <em>some </em>are bad landlords. Corporations are more likely to threaten to evict and to actually evict <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/real-problem-corporate-landlords/619244/">their tenants</a>. They are also prone to skimping on maintenance and upkeep. “At the neighborhood level, when more than half of the properties are owned by outside investors—when you’ve now flipped that neighborhood from being primarily homeowner driven to investor driven—that matters, because homeowners behave very differently, politically and otherwise,” McCarthy said. An out-of-state investment firm might be less likely than a longtime resident or a local property manager to plant shade trees and demand safe sidewalks, for instance.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In response to the rising corporate ownership of homes, a variety of politicians have pushed for policy fixes. In New York, Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation barring firms from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/fighting-new-yorkers-governor-hochul-highlights-2025-state-state-proposal-disincentivize">bidding on single-family or two-family homes</a> for the first 75 days they are on the market. Washington State is contemplating capping the number of units that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mynorthwest.com/mynorthwest-politics/washington-bill-4/4040703">corporations can own</a>. Other legislators have suggested revoking <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2224">tax benefits</a> from large-scale owners.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">McCarthy said that caps probably would not work well: Corporations might simply set up multiple entities to get around the rules and keep purchasing properties, for instance. “It’s just not going to fly,” he said. But he supports treating firms that own more than 10 properties in a given jurisdiction as commercial owners rather than residential owners, subjecting them to higher property-tax rates and higher taxes on their capital gains.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If nothing is done, what’s happening to majority-Black communities in Ohio and Virginia and Georgia and Michigan might start happening in communities around the country. Private equity might not be causing the housing crisis, but corporate owners could end up making it a lot worse for everyone.</p></section></div>]]></description>

    <p><strong>Stephen Ramsay</strong></p>
    <p>Or hell, why not do it in <em>x86 assembly?</em></p>
    <p>Let’s get a few things out of the way before I go any
    further with this seemingly impertinent thought, because it’s
    nowhere near as snarky as it sounds.</p>
    <p>First, I don’t particularly <em>like</em> vibe coding. I
    love programming, and I have loved it since I made my first
    tentative steps with it sometime back in the mid-to-late 90s. I
    love programming so much, it always feels like I’m having too
    much fun for it to count as real work. I’ve done it
    professionally, but I also do it as a hobby. Someone apparently
    once said, “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in
    your life.” That’s how I feel about writing code. I’ve also
    been teaching the subject for twenty-five years, and I can
    honestly say I am as excited about the first day of the
    semester now as I was when I first started. I realize it’s a
    bit precious to say so, but I’ll say it anyway: Turning
    non-programmers into programmers is my life’s work. It is the
    thing of which I am most proud as a college professor.</p>
    <p>Vibe coding makes me feel <em>dirty</em> in ways that I
    struggle to articulate precisely. It’s not just that it feels
    like “cheating” (though it does). I also think it takes a lot
    of the fun out of the whole thing. I sometimes tell people
    (like the aforementioned students) that programming is like
    doing the best crossword puzzle in the world, except that when
    you solve it, it actually dances and sings. Vibe coding robs me
    of that moment, because I don’t feel like <em>I</em> really did
    it at all. And even though to be a programmer is to live with a
    more-or-less permanent set of aporias (you don’t
    <em>really</em> understand what the compiler is doing,
    really—and even if you do, you probably don’t <em>really</em>
    understand how the virtual memory subsystem works, really),
    it’s satisfying to understand every inch of my code and
    frustrating—all the way to the borderlands of active
    anxiety—not quite understanding what Claude just wrote.</p>
    <p>But this leads me to my second point, which I must make as
    clearly and forcefully as I can. Vibe coding actually works. It
    creates robust, complex systems that work. You can tell
    yourself (as I did) that it can’t possibly do that, but you are
    wrong. You can then tell yourself (as I did) that it’s good as
    a kind of alternative search engine for coding problems, but
    not much else. You are also wrong about that. Because when you
    start giving it little programming problems that you can’t be
    arsed to work out yourself (as I did), you discover (as I did)
    that it’s awfully good at those. And then one day you muse out
    loud (as I did) to an AI model something like, “I have an idea
    for a program…” And you are astounded. If you aren’t astounded,
    you either haven’t actually done it or you are at some stage of
    grief prior to acceptance. Perfect? Hardly. But then neither
    are human coders. The future? I think the questions answers
    itself.</p>
    <p>But to get to my impertinent question…</p>
    <p>Early on in my love affair with programming, I read <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf"><em>Structure and
    Interpretation of Computer Programs,</em></a> which I now
    consider one of the great pedagogical masterpieces of the
    twentieth century. I learned a great deal about programming
    from that book, but among the most memorable lessons was one
    that appears in the second paragraph of the original preface.
    There, Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman make a point that hits
    with the force of the obvious, and yet is very often
    forgotten:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[W]e want to establish the idea that a computer language
      is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations
      but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing
      ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for
      people to read, and only incidentally for machines to
      execute.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I’ve been repeating some version of this to my students ever
    since. Computers, I remind them, do not need the code to be
    “readable” or “ergonomic” for humans; they only need it to be
    readable and ergonomic for a computer, which is a considerably
    lower bar.</p>
    <p>Every programming language—<em>including assembly
    language</em>—was and is intended for the convenience of humans
    who need to read it and write it. If a language is innovative,
    it is usually not because it has <em>allowed</em> for automatic
    memory management, or concurrency, or safety, or robust error
    checking, but because it has made it easier for humans to
    express and reason about these matters. When we extol the
    virtues of this or that language—Rust’s safety guarantees,
    C++’s “no-cost abstractions,” or Go’s approach to
    concurrency—we are not talking about an affordance that the
    computer has gained, but about an affordance that <em>we</em>
    have gained as programmers of said computer. From our
    standpoint as programmers, object-oriented languages offer
    certain ways to organize our code—and, I think Abelson and
    Sussman would say, our thinking—that are potentially conducive
    to the noble treasures of maintainability, extensibility, error
    checking, and any number of other condign matters. From the
    standpoint of the computer, this little OO kink of ours seems
    mostly to indicate a strange affinity for heap memory.
    “Whatevs!” (says the computer). And pick your poison here,
    folks: functional programming, algebraic data types, dependent
    types, homoiconicity, immutable data structures, brace styles…
    We can debate the utility of these things, but we must
    understand that we are primarily talking about <em>human</em>
    problems. The set of “machine problems” to which these matters
    correspond is considerably smaller.</p>
    <p>So my question is this: Why vibe code with a language that
    has <em>human</em> convenience and ergonomics in view? Or to
    put that another way: Wouldn’t a language designed <em>for vibe
    coding</em> naturally dispense with much of what is convenient
    and ergonomic <em>for humans</em> in favor of what is
    convenient and ergonomic for machines? Why not have it just
    write C? Or hell, why not x86 assembly?</p>
    <p>Now, at this point, you will want to say that the need for
    human understanding isn’t erased entirely thereby. Some version
    of this argument has merit, but I would remind you that if you
    are really vibe coding for real you already don’t understand a
    great deal of what it is producing. But if you look carefully,
    you will notice that it doesn’t struggle with undefined
    behavior in C. Or with making sure that all memory is properly
    freed. Or with off-by-one errors. It sometimes struggles to
    understand what it is that you actually want, but it rarely
    struggles with the actual execution of the code. It’s better
    than you are at keeping track of those things in the same way
    that a compiler is better at optimizing code than you are.
    Perfect? No.&nbsp;But as I said before…</p>
    <p>Is C the ideal language for vibe coding? I think I could
    mount an argument for why it is not, but surely Rust is even
    less ideal. To say nothing of Haskell, or OCaml, or even
    Python. All of these languages, after all, are for people to
    read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. They are
    practically adorable in their concern for problems that AI
    models do not have.</p>
    <p>I suppose what I’m getting at, here, is that <em>if</em>
    vibe coding is the future of software development (and it is),
    then why bother with languages that were designed for people
    who are not vibe coding? Shouldn’t there be such a thing as a
    “vibe-oriented programming language?” VOP. You read it here
    first.</p>
    <p>One possibility is that such a language truly would be
    executable pseudocode beyond even the most extravagant fever
    dreams of the most earnest Pythonistas; it shows you what it’s
    doing in truly pseudo code, but all the while it’s writing
    assembly. Or perhaps it’s something like the apotheosis of
    literate programming. You write a literary document “expressing
    ideas about methodology,” and the AI produces machine code (and
    a kind of literary critical practice evolves around this
    activity, eventually ordering itself into structuralist and
    post-structuralist camps. But I’m getting ahead of myself).
    Perhaps your job as a programmer is mostly running tests that
    verify this machine code (tests which have also been produced
    by AI). Or maybe a VOPL is really a certain kind of language
    that comes closer to natural language than any existing
    programming language, but which has a certain (easily learned)
    set of idioms and expressions that guide the AI more reliably
    and more quickly toward particular solutions. It doesn’t have
    goroutines. It has a “concurrency slang.”</p>
    <p>Now obviously, the reason a large language model focused on
    coding is good at Javascript and C++ is precisely because it
    has been trained on billions of lines of code in those
    languages along with countless forum posts, StackOverflow
    debates, and so on. Bootstrapping a VOPL presents a certain
    kind of difficulty, but then one also suspects that LLMs are
    <em>already</em> being trained in some future version of this
    language, because so many programmers are already groping their
    way toward a system like this by virtue of the fact that so
    many of them are already vibe coding production-level
    systems.</p>
    <p>I don’t know how I feel about all of this (see my first and
    second points above). It saddens me to think of “coding by
    hand” becoming a kind of quaint Montessori-school stage in the
    education of a vibe coder—something like the contour drawings
    we demand from future photoshopers or the balanced equations we
    insist serve as a rite of passage for people who will never be
    without a calculator to the end of their days.</p>
    <p>At the same time, there is something exciting about the
    birth of a computational paradigm. It wasn’t that long ago, in
    the grand scheme of things, that someone realized that rewiring
    the entire machine every time you wanted to do a calculation
    (think ENIAC, circa 1945) was a rather suboptimal way to do
    things. And it is worth recalling that people
    <em>complained</em> when the stored-program computer rolled
    around (think EDVAC, circa 1951). Why? Well, the answer should
    be obvious. It was less reliable. It was slower. It removed the
    operator from the loop. It threatened specialized labor. It was
    conceptually impure. I’m not kidding about any of this. No less
    an authority than Grace Hopper had to argue against the quite
    popular idea that there was no way anyone could ever trust a
    machine to write instructions for another machine.</p>
    <p>Same vibe, as the kids say.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>Today, we’re donating the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) to the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), a directed fund under the <a>Linux Foundation</a>, co-founded by Anthropic, Block and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, and Bloomberg.</p><p>One year ago, we <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">introduced</a> MCP as a universal, open standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. Since then, MCP has achieved incredible adoption:</p><ul><li>Across the ecosystem: There are now more than 10,000 active public MCP servers, covering everything from developer tools to Fortune 500 deployments;</li><li>Across platforms: MCP has been adopted by ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Visual Studio Code, and other popular AI products;</li><li>Across infrastructure: Enterprise-grade infrastructure now exists with deployment support for MCP from providers including AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.</li></ul><div><figure><img alt="Significant Milestone in MCP's first year" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="2500" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa056db8301f67466de34a19181e7428ec6b6e17f-1920x2500.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa056db8301f67466de34a19181e7428ec6b6e17f-1920x2500.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa056db8301f67466de34a19181e7428ec6b6e17f-1920x2500.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><div><p>We’re continuing to invest in MCP’s growth. Claude now has a directory with over 75 <a href="https://claude.com/connectors">connectors</a> (powered by MCP), and we recently launched <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use">Tool Search and Programmatic Tool Calling</a> capabilities in our API to help optimize production-scale MCP deployments, handling thousands of tools efficiently and reducing latency in complex agent workflows.</p><p>MCP now has an official, community-driven <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry">Registry</a> for discovering available MCP servers, and the <a href="https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-25-first-mcp-anniversary/">November 25th</a> spec release introduced many new features, including asynchronous operations, statelessness, server identity, and official extensions. There are also official SDKs (Software Development Kits) for MCP in all major programming languages with 97M+ monthly SDK downloads across Python and TypeScript. </p><p>Since its inception, we’ve been committed to ensuring MCP remains open-source, community-driven and vendor-neutral. Today, we further that commitment by donating MCP to the Linux Foundation.</p></div><h2 id="the-linux-foundation-and-the-agentic-ai-foundation"><strong>The Linux Foundation and the Agentic AI Foundation</strong></h2><p>The <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the growth of sustainable, open-source ecosystems through neutral stewardship, community building, and shared infrastructure.

                                    <br>It was created by <strong>mr.doob</strong> (<a href="https://x.com/mrdoob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">X</a>, <a href="http://github.com/mrdoob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>), followed by hundreds of awesome developers, one of which being Sunag (<a href="https://x.com/sea3dformat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">X</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sunag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>) who added <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TSL</a>, enabling the use of both WebGL and WebGPU, making this portfolio possible.

                                    I’ve been making devlogs since the very start of this portfolio and you can find them on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@BrunoSimon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Youtube channel</a>.
                                    <br>Even though the portfolio is out, I’m still working on the last videos so that the series is complete.

<div><p>To me, the valuable comments are the ones that share the writer's expertise and experiences (as opposed to opinions and hypothesizing) or the ones that ask interesting questions.

<div><p>I guess... That is the point in my opinion.</p><p>If you just say, "here is what llm said" if that turns out to be nonsense you can say something like, "I was just passing along the llm response, not my own opinion"</p><p>But if you take the llm response and present it as your own, at least there is slightly more ownership over the opinion.</p><p>This is kind of splitting hairs but hopefully it makes people actually read the response themselves before posting it.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46206767"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46206767" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46206767&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46206457"></a></center></td><td><br>

But as the AI trade faces increasing scrutiny, that hesitance has gone from a weakness to a strength — and it’s showing up in the stock market.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Through the first six months of 2025, Apple was the second-worst performer among the Magnificent Seven tech giants, as its shares tumbled 18% through the end of June. That has reversed since then, with the stock soaring 35%, while AI darlings like Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. slid into the red and even Nvidia Corp. underperformed. The S&amp;P 500 Index rose 10% in that time, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index gained 13%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Most Read from Bloomberg<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <ul><li> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/nj-suburb-montclair-goes-through-with-school-system-staff-cuts?utm_campaign=bn&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NJ’s Montclair Cuts School Staff and Mulls March Tax-Hike Vote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">NJ’s Montclair Cuts School Staff and Mulls March Tax-Hike Vote</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/how-do-traffic-lights-curb-dangerous-driving-it-s-all-in-the-timing?utm_campaign=bn&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A Bright Idea for Road Safety: Traffic Light Timing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">A Bright Idea for Road Safety: Traffic Light Timing</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/trump-replaces-architect-to-lead-300-million-ballroom-design?utm_campaign=bn&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Trump Replaces Architect to Lead $300 Million Ballroom Design;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Trump Replaces Architect to Lead $300 Million Ballroom Design</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/owner-of-nyc-s-fordham-landing-housing-project-files-bankruptcy?utm_campaign=bn&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Owner of NYC’s Fordham Landing Housing Project Files Bankruptcy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Owner of NYC’s Fordham Landing Housing Project Files Bankruptcy</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-09/democrats-seek-probe-of-trump-officials-dealings-with-immigration-contractors?utm_campaign=bn&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Democrats Want Probe of Trump Officials and Immigration Deals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Democrats Want Probe of Trump Officials and Immigration Deals</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li> </ul>   <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“It is remarkable how they have kept their heads and are in control of spending, when all of their peers have gone the other direction,” said John Barr, portfolio manager of the Needham Aggressive Growth Fund, which owns Apple shares.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <figure data-testid="article-figure-image"><div> <p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==" alt=" " loading="eager" height="555" width="960"></p></div> <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START --> <!-- HTML_TAG_END -->  </figcaption> </figure>   <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As a result, Apple now has a $4.1 trillion market capitalization and the second biggest weight in the S&amp;P 500, leaping over Microsoft and closing in on Nvidia.

The shares are trading for around 33 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, a level they’ve only hit a few times in the past 15 years, with a high of 35 in September 2020. The stock’s average multiple over that time is less than 19 times. Apple is now the second most expensive stock in the Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index, trailing only Tesla Inc.’s whopping valuation of 203 times forward earnings. Apple’s shares climbed about 0.5% in early Tuesday trading.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>    <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“It’s really hard to see how the stock can continue to compound value at a level that makes this a compelling entry point,” said Craig Moffett, co-founder of research firm MoffettNathanson. “The obvious question is, are investors overpaying for Apple’s defensiveness?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain-0-blackhero.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p><strong>Catch your best ideas before they slip through your fingers</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever have flashes of insight or an idea worth remembering? This happens to me 5-10 times every day. If I don’t write down the thought immediately, it slips out of my mind. Worst of all, I <em>remember</em> that I’ve forgotten something and spend the next 10 minutes trying to remember what it is. So I invented external memory for my brain.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing</strong> <strong>Pebble Index 01</strong> - a small ring with a button and microphone. Hold the button, whisper your thought, and it’s sent to your phone. It’s added to your notes, set as a reminder, or saved for later review.</p>
<p>Index 01 is designed to become muscle memory, since it’s always with you. It’s private by design (no recording until you press the button) and requires no internet connection or paid subscription. It’s as small as a wedding band and comes in 3 colours. It’s made from durable stainless steel and is water-resistant. Like all Pebble products, it’s extremely customizable and built with open source software.</p>
<p>Here’s the best part: the battery lasts for years. You never need to charge it.</p>
<p><a href="https://repebble.com/index#buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-order today for $75</a>. After worldwide shipping begins in March 2026, the price will go up to $99.</p>

<h3 id="design"><a href="#design"><span>#</span>Design</a></h3>
<p>Now that I’ve worn my Index 01 for several months, I can safely say that it has changed my life - just like with Pebble, I couldn’t go back to a world without this. There are so many situations each day where my hands are full (while biking or driving, washing dishes, wrangling my kids, etc) and I need to remember something. A random sampling of my recent recordings:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Set a timer for 3pm to go pick up the kids</em></li>
<li><em>Remind me to phone the pharmacy at 11am</em></li>
<li><em>Peter is coming by tomorrow at 11:30am, add that to my calendar</em></li>
<li><em>Jerry recommends reading Breakneck</em></li>
<li><em>Mark wants a Black/Red PT2</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Before, I would take my phone out of my pocket to jot these down, but I couldn’t always do that (eg, while bicycling). I also wanted to start using my phone less, especially in front of my kids.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain-1-2c146dc6-62c0-4079-8f46-56413e3f5ae9.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Initially, we experimented by building this as an app on Pebble, since it has a mic and I’m always wearing one. But, I realized quickly that this was suboptimal - it required me to use my other hand to press the button to start recording (lift-to-wake gestures and wake-words are too unreliable). This was tough to use while bicycling or carrying stuff.</p>
<p>Then a genius electrical engineer friend of mine came up with an idea to fit everything into a tiny ring. It is the perfect form factor! Honestly, I’m still amazed that it all fits.</p>
<p>The design needed to satisfy several critical conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must work reliably 100% of the time. If it didn’t work or failed to record a thought, I knew I would take it off and revert back to my old habit of just forgetting things.</li>
<li>It had to have a physical press-button, with a satisfying click-feel. I want to know for sure if the button is pressed and my thought is captured.</li>
<li>Long battery life - every time you take something off to charge, there’s a chance you’ll forget to put it back on.</li>
<li>Must be privacy-preserving. These are your inner thoughts. All recordings must be processed and stored on your phone. Only record when the button is pressed.</li>
<li>It had to be as small as a wedding band. Since it’s worn on the index finger, if it were too large or bulky, it would hit your phone while you held it in your hand.</li>
<li>Water resistance - must be able to wash hands, shower, and get wet.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve been working on this for a while, testing new versions and making tweaks. We’re really excited to get this out into the world.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favourite things about Index 01:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does one thing really well - it helps me remember things.</li>
<li>It’s discreet. It's not distracting.  It doesn't take you out of the moment.</li>
<li>There’s no AI friend persona and it’s not always recording.</li>
<li>It’s inexpensive. We hope you try it and see if you like it as well!</li>

<li><strong>Cost and availability:</strong> Pre-order price is $75, rises to $99 later. Ships worldwide, beginning in March.</li>
<li><strong>Works with iPhone and Android</strong>: We overcame <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s best efforts</a> to make life terrible for 3rd party accessory makers and have Index 01 working well on iOS and Android.</li>
<li><strong>Extremely private and secure</strong>: Your thoughts are processed by open source speech-to-text (STT) and AI models locally on your phone. You can read the code and see exactly how it works - our <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pebble mobile app</a> is open source. Higher-quality STT is available through an optional cloud service.</li>
<li><strong>No charging:</strong> The battery lasts for up to years of average use. After the end of its life, send your ring back to us for recycling.</li>
<li><strong>On-ring storage:</strong> Recording works even if your phone is out of range. Up to 5 minutes of audio can be stored on-ring, then synced later.</li>
<li><strong>No speaker or vibrating motor:</strong> This is an input device only. There is an RGB LED, but it’s rarely used (to save battery life and to reduce distraction).</li>
<li><strong>Works great with Pebble</strong> or other smartwatches: After recording, the thought will appear on your watch, and you can check that it’s correct. You can ask questions like ‘What’s the weather today?’ and see the answer on your watch.</li>
<li><strong>Raw audio playback</strong>: Very helpful if STT doesn’t work perfectly due to wind or loud background noises.</li>
<li><strong>Actions: W</strong>hile the primary task is remembering things for you, you can also ask it to do things like ’Send a Beeper message to my wife - running late’ or answer simple questions that could be answered by searching the web. You can configure button clicks to control your music - I love using this to play/pause or skip tracks. You can also configure where to save your notes and reminders (I have it set to add to Notion).</li>
<li><strong>Customizable and hackable:</strong> Configure single/double button clicks to control whatever you want (take a photo, turn on lights, Tasker, etc). Add your own voice actions via MCP. Or route the audio recordings directly to your own app or server!</li>
<li><strong>99+ languages:</strong> Speech to text and local LLM support over 99 languages! Naturally, the quality of each may vary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="future-plans"><a href="#future-plans"><span>#</span>Future Plans</a></h3>
<p>Let me be very clear - Index 01 is designed at its core to be a device that helps you remember things. We want it to be 100% reliable at its primary task. But we’re leaving the side door open for folks to customize, build new interactions and actions.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’m thinking about it - a single click-hold + voice input will be routed to the primary memory processing path. Double-click-hold + voice input would be routed to a more general purpose voice agent (think ChatGPT with web search). Responses from the agent would be presented on Pebble (eg ‘What’s the weather tomorrow?’, ‘When’s the next northbound Caltrain?’) or other smartwatches (as a notification). Maybe this could even be an input for something like ChatGPT Voice Mode, enabling you to hear the AI response from your earbuds.</p>
<p>The built in actions, set reminder, create note, alarms, etc, are actually MCPs - basically mini apps that AI agents know how to operate. They run locally in WASM within the Pebble mobile app (no cloud MCP server required). Basically any MCP server can be used with the system, so intrepid folks may have fun adding various actions like Beeper, Google Calendar, weather, etc that already offer MCPs.</p>
<p>Not everything will be available at launch, but this is the direction we are working towards. There will be 3 ways to customize your Index 01:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trigger actions via button clicks - configure a single or double click to do things like take a photo, control your Home Assistant smart home, Tasker function, unlock your car. This will work better on Android since iOS Shortcuts doesn’t have an open API.</li>
<li>Trigger actions via voice input - write an MCP to do….basically anything? This is pretty open ended.</li>
<li>Route your voice recordings and/or transcriptions to your own webhook - or skip our AI processing entirely and send every recording to your own app or webapp.</li>
</ol>
<p>### FAQ</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>People usually wear it on the index finger. Inside the ring is a button, a microphone, a Bluetooth chip, memory, and a battery that lasts for years. Click the button with your thumb, talk into the mic, and it records to internal memory. When your phone is in range, the recording is streamed to the Pebble app. It’s converted to text on-device, then processed by an on-device large language model (LLM) which selects an action to take (create note, add to reminders, etc).</p>
<p><strong>When do I pick my size?</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to pick your ring size and color after placing a pre-order. If you have a 3D printer, you can <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/hardware/tree/main/ring/pebble-index-01/3d-cad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">print our CAD designs</a> to try on. We’re also planning a sizing kit. You can view the <a href="https://repebble.com/index01-carousel/index01-dimensions.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measurements of the inner diameter</a> of each ring size.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain-4-dd455665-61da-4315-b377-e37e90cc57b3.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></p>
<p>Roughly 12 to 15 hours of recording. On average, I use it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. That’s up to 2 years of usage.</p>
<p><strong>Is it secure and private?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, extremely. The connection between ring and phone is encrypted. Recordings are processed locally on your phone in the open-source Pebble app. The app works offline (no internet connection) and does not require a cloud service. An optional cloud storage system for backing up recordings is available. Our plan is for this to be optionally encrypted, but we haven’t built it yet.</p>
<p><strong>Is a paid subscription required?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of battery is inside?</strong></p>
<p>Index 01 uses silver-oxide batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Why can’t it be recharged?</strong></p>
<p>We considered this but decided not to for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You’d probably lose the charger before the battery runs out!</li>
<li>Adding charge circuitry and including a charger would make the product larger and more expensive.</li>
<li>You send it back to us to recycle.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wait, it’s single use?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We know this sounds a bit odd, but in this particular circumstance we believe it’s the best solution to the given set of constraints. Other smart rings like Oura cost $250+ and need to be charged every few days. We didn’t want to build a device like that.  Before the battery runs out, the Pebble app notifies and asks if you’d like to order another ring.</p>
<p><strong>Is it always listening?</strong></p>
<p>No.  It only records while the button is pressed. It’s not designed to record your whole life, or meetings.</p>
<p><strong>What if the speech-to-text processing misses a word or something?</strong></p>
<p>You can always listen to the each recording in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Why no touchpad?</strong></p>
<p>We experimented with a touchpad, but found it too easy to accidentally swipe and press. Also, nothing beats the feedback of a real gosh darn pressable button.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a speaker or vibrating motor?</strong></p>
<p>No. The button has a great click-feel to indicate when you are pressing.</p>
<p><strong>Does it do health tracking like Oura?</strong></p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p><strong>How durable and water-resistant is it?</strong></p>
<p>It’s primarily made from stainless steel 316, with a liquid silicone rubber (LSR) button. It’s water-resistant to 1 meter. You can wash your hands, do dishes, and shower with it on, but we don’t recommend swimming with it.</p>
<p><strong>Does it work with iPhone and Android?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>I love customizing and hacking on my devices. What could I do with Index 01?</strong></p>
<p>Lots of stuff! Control things with the buttons. Route raw audio or transcribed text directly to your own app via webhook. Use <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCPs</a> (also run locally on-device! No cloud server required) to add more actions.</p>
<p><strong>Is this an AI friend thingy or always-recording device?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>How far along is development?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been working on this in the background to watch development. It helps that our Pebble Time 2 partner factory is also building Index 01! We’re currently in the DVT stage, testing pre-production samples. We’ll start a wider alpha test in January with a lot more people. Here’s some shots from the pre-production assembly line:</p>

<p dir="auto">Kaiju is a 2D/3D game engine written in Go (Golang) backed by Vulkan. The goal of the engine is to use a modern, easy, systems level programming language, with a focus on simplicity, to create a new kind of game engine.</p>

<p dir="auto">The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at around 5,400 FPS on the same machine. In fact, a complete game, with audio, custom cursors, real time PBR rendering with real time shadows, UI, and more runs at 2,712 FPS (in "debug" mode) <a href="https://x.com/ShieldCrush/status/1943516032674537958" rel="nofollow">screenshots or it didn't happen</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">I love C, and because I love C and found out that Ken Thompson played a part in designing Go, I gave Go a chance. It has been such a joy to use and work with I decided to port my C game engine to Go. Go is a modern system-level language that allows me to write code the way I want to write code and even have the opportunity to do some crazy things if I want to (no strings attached). Also the simplicity and "just works" of writing Assembly code was a great boost to my happiness.</p>
<p dir="auto">What's more, it's a language that other developers can easily learn and jump right into extending the engine/editor. No need for developers to re-figure out some bespoke macros or crazy templating nonsense. It's flat, easy, straight forward, and the foot-gun is hidden behind some walls, but there if you want it. Furthermore, developers can write their games in Go directly, no need for some alternative language that is different from the engine code (but we'll include Lua for modding).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What about the Garbage Collector?!</h2><a id="user-content-what-about-the-garbage-collector" aria-label="Permalink: What about the Garbage Collector?!" href="#what-about-the-garbage-collector"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I am creating this section because I get asked about it when I mention "Go", possibly not realizing that most public game engines use a garbage collector (GC).</p>
<p dir="auto">The GC is actually a feature I'm happy with (shocker coming from a C guy). Well, the reason is simple, if you're going to make a game engine that the public will use and needs to be stable, you need a garbage collector. Unity has C# (and possibly an internal GC as well), Unreal has a GC (and it could use a tune up if you ask me), Godot has a GC albeit their scripting language or when you use C#. It is actually very important for public engines to have a GC because people are only human and make a lot of mistakes, mistakes they'll blame on you (the engine developer) before they blame themselves.</p>
<p dir="auto">Coincidentally, the overall design I have for the engine plays very well with the GC and last I measured, I have a net-0 heap allocation while running (may need a new review). If you don't abuse the GC, you shouldn't generally feel it, it runs concurrently as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'll be the first to admit, I think the developers of Go can create a better GC than I can, and probably better than Unreal and Unity too.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.corsix.org/content/my-favourite-small-hash-table">https://www.corsix.org/content/my-favourite-small-hash-table</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205461">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I'm the kind of person who thinks about the design and implementation of hash tables. One design which I find particularly cute, and I think deserves a bit more publicity, is Robin Hood open-addressing with linear probing and power-of-two table size. If you're not familiar with hash table terminology, that might look like a smorgasbord of random words, but it should become clearer as we look at some actual code.</p>
<p>To keep the code simple to start with, I'm going to assume:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keys are randomly-distributed 32-bit integers.</li>
<li>Values are also 32-bit integers.</li>
<li>If the key <code>0</code> is present, its value is not <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>The table occupies at most 32 GiB of memory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each slot in the table is either empty, or holds a key and a value. The combination of properties (1) and (2) allows a key/value pair to be stored as a 64-bit integer, and property (3) means that the 64-bit value <code>0</code> can be used to represent an empty slot (some hash table designs also need a special value for representing tombstones, but this design doesn't need tombstones). Combining a key and a value into 64 bits couldn't be easier: the low 32 bits hold the key, and the high 32 bits hold the value.</p>
<p>The structure for the table itself needs a pointer to the array of slots, the length of said array, and the number of non-empty slots. As the length is always a power of two, it's more useful to store <code>length - 1</code> instead of <code>length</code>, which leads to <code>mask</code> rather than <code>length</code>, and property (4) means that <code>mask</code> can be stored as 32 bits. As the load factor should be less than 100%, we can assume <code>count &lt; length</code>, and hence <code>count</code> can also be 32 bits. This leads to a mundane-looking:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> hash_table_t {
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots;
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask;
  <span>uint32_t</span> count;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Property (1) means that we don't need to hash keys, as they're already randomly distributed. Every possible key <code>K</code> has a "natural position" in the slots array, which is just <code>K &amp; mask</code>. If there are collisions, the slot in which a key <em>actually</em> ends up might be different to its natural position. The "linear probing" part of the design means that if <code>K</code> cannot be in its natural position, the next slot to be considered is <code>(K + 1) &amp; mask</code>, and if not that slot then <code>(K + 2) &amp; mask</code>, then <code>(K + 3) &amp; mask</code>, and so on. This leads to the definition of a "chain": if <code>K</code> is some key present in the table, <code>C<sub>K</sub></code> denotes the sequence of slots starting with <code>K</code>'s natural position and ending with <code>K</code>'s actual position. We have the usual property of open-addressing: none of the slots in <code>C<sub>K</sub></code> are empty slots. The "Robin Hood" part of the design then imposes an additional rather interesting property: for each slot <code>S</code> in <code>C<sub>K</sub></code>, <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) ≥ Score(S.Index, K)</code>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>S.Index</code> is the index of <code>S</code> in the <code>slots</code> array (not the index of it in <code>C<sub>K</sub></code>).</li>
<li><code>S.Key</code> is the key present in slot <code>S</code> (i.e. the low 32 bits of <code>slots[S.Index]</code>).</li>
<li><code>Score(Index, Key)</code> is <code>(Index - Key) &amp; mask</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties give us the termination conditions for the lookup algorithm: for a possible key <code>K</code>, we look at each slot starting from <code>K</code>'s natural position, and either we find <code>K</code>, or we find an empty slot, or we find a slot with <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) &lt; Score(S.Index, K)</code>. In either of the latter two cases, <code>K</code> cannot have been present in the table. In the function below, <code>Score(S.Index, K)</code> is tracked as <code>d</code>. In a language with a modern type system, the result of a lookup would be <code>Optional&lt;Value&gt;</code>, but if sticking to plain C, property (3) can be used to make something similar: the 64-bit result is zero if the key is absent, and otherwise the value is in the low 32 bits of the result (which may themselves be zero, but the full 64-bit result will be non-zero). The logic is thus:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>table_lookup</span><span>(hash_table_t* table, <span>uint32_t</span> key)</span> </span>{
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>for</span> (<span>uint32_t</span> d = <span>0</span>;; ++d) {
    <span>uint32_t</span> idx = (key + d) &amp; mask;
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot == <span>0</span>) {
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(key == (<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>slot) </span>{
      <span>return</span> (slot &gt;&gt; <span>32</span>) | (slot &lt;&lt; <span>32</span>);
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(((idx - (<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>slot) &amp; mask) &lt; d) </span>{
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If using a rich 64-bit CPU architecture, many of the expressions in the above function are cheaper than they might initially seem:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>slots[idx]</code> involves zero-extending <code>idx</code> from 32 bits to 64, multiplying it by <code>sizeof(uint64_t)</code>, adding it to <code>slots</code>, and then loading from that address. All this is a single instruction on x86-64 or arm64.</li>
<li><code>key == (uint32_t)slot</code> involves a comparison using the low 32 bits of a 64-bit register, which is a completely standard operation on x86-64 or arm64.</li>
<li><code>(slot &gt;&gt; 32) | (slot &lt;&lt; 32)</code> is a rotation by 32 bits, which again is a single instruction on x86-64 or arm64.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, if using riscv64, things are less good:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>Zba</code> extension is present, <code>sh3add.uw</code> is a single instruction for zero-extending <code>idx</code> from 32 bits to 64, multiplying it by <code>sizeof(uint64_t)</code>, and adding it to <code>slots</code>. If not, each step is a separate instruction, though the zero-extension can be eliminated <a href="https://gist.github.com/corsix/65ffbd66bbd199b3d77e4ec24c3d3724">with a slight reformulation</a> to encourage the compiler to fold the zero-extension onto the load of <code>table-&gt;mask</code> (as riscv64 usually defaults to making sign-extension free, in contrast to x86-64/arm64 which usually make zero-extension free). Regardless, the load is always its own instruction.</li>
<li><code>key == (uint32_t)slot</code> hits a gap in the riscv64 ISA: it doesn't have any 32-bit comparison instructions, so this either becomes a 32-bit subtraction followed by a 64-bit comparison against zero, or promotion of both operands from 32 bits to 64 bits followed by a 64-bit comparison.</li>
<li>If the <code>Zbb</code> extension is present, rotations are a single instruction. If not, they're three instructions, and so it becomes almost worth reworking the slot layout to put the key in the high 32 bits and the value in the low 32 bits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on from lookup to insertion, there are various different options for what to do when the key being inserted is already present. I'm choosing to show a variant which returns the old value (in the same form as <code>table_lookup</code> returns) and then overwrites with the new value, though other variants are obviously possible. The logic follows the same overall structure as seen in <code>table_lookup</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>table_set</span><span>(hash_table_t* table, <span>uint32_t</span> key, <span>uint32_t</span> val)</span> </span>{
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>uint64_t</span> kv = key + ((<span>uint64_t</span>)val &lt;&lt; <span>32</span>);
  <span>for</span> (<span>uint32_t</span> d = <span>0</span>;; ++d) {
    <span>uint32_t</span> idx = ((<span>uint32_t</span>)kv + d) &amp; mask;
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot == <span>0</span>) {
      <span>// Inserting new value (and slot was previously empty)</span>
      slots[idx] = kv;
      <span>break</span>;
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>((<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>kv </span>== (<span>uint32_t</span>)slot) {
      <span>// Overwriting existing value</span>
      slots[idx] = kv;
      <span>return</span> (slot &gt;&gt; <span>32</span>) | (slot &lt;&lt; <span>32</span>);
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>uint32_t</span> d2 = (idx - (<span>uint32_t</span>)slot) &amp; mask;
      <span>if</span> (d2 &lt; d) {
        <span>// Inserting new value, and moving existing slot</span>
        slots[idx] = kv;
        table_reinsert(slots, mask, slot, d2);
        <span>break</span>;
      }
    }
  }
  <span>if</span> (++table-&gt;count * <span>4u</span>ll &gt;= mask * <span>3u</span>ll) {
    <span>// Expand table once we hit 75% load factor</span>
    table_rehash(table);
  }
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To avoid the load factor becoming too high, the above function will sometimes grow the table by calling this helper function:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>table_rehash</span><span>(hash_table_t* table)</span> </span>{
  <span>uint32_t</span> old_mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint32_t</span> new_mask = old_mask * <span>2u</span> + <span>1u</span>;
  <span>uint64_t</span>* new_slots = <span>calloc</span>(new_mask + <span>1u</span>ll, <span>sizeof</span>(<span>uint64_t</span>));
  <span>uint64_t</span>* old_slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>uint32_t</span> idx = <span>0</span>;
  <span>do</span> {
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = old_slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot != <span>0</span>) {
      table_reinsert(new_slots, new_mask, slot, <span>0</span>);
    }
  } <span>while</span> (idx++ != old_mask);
  table-&gt;slots = new_slots;
  table-&gt;mask = new_mask;
  <span>free</span>(old_slots);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Both of <code>table_set</code> and <code>table_rehash</code> make use of a helper function which is very similar to <code>table_set</code>, but doesn't need to check for overwriting an existing key and also doesn't need to update <code>count</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>table_reinsert</span><span>(<span>uint64_t</span>* slots, <span>uint32_t</span> mask, <span>uint64_t</span> kv, <span>uint32_t</span> d)</span> </span>{
  <span>for</span> (;; ++d) {
    <span>uint32_t</span> idx = ((<span>uint32_t</span>)kv + d) &amp; mask;
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot == <span>0</span>) {
      slots[idx] = kv;
      <span>break</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>uint32_t</span> d2 = (idx - (<span>uint32_t</span>)slot) &amp; mask;
      <span>if</span> (d2 &lt; d) {
        slots[idx] = kv;
        kv = slot;
        d = d2;
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>That covers lookup and insertion, so next up is key removal. As already hinted at, this hash table design doesn't need tombstones. Instead, removing a key involves finding the slot containing that key and then shifting slots left until finding an empty slot or a slot with <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) == 0</code>. This removal strategy works due to a neat pair of emergent properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If slot <code>S</code> has <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) != 0</code>, it is viable for <code>S.Key</code> to instead be at <code>(S.Index - 1) &amp; mask</code> (possibly subject to additional re-arranging to fill the gap formed by moving <code>S.Key</code>).</li>
<li>If slot <code>S</code> has <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) == 0</code>, and <code>S</code> is part of some chain <code>C<sub>K</sub></code>, then <code>S</code> is at the very start of <code>C<sub>K</sub></code>. Hence it is viable to turn <code>(S.Index - 1) &amp; mask</code> into an empty slot without breaking any chains.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to the tombstone-free removal function, which follows the established pattern of returning either the old value or zero:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>table_remove</span><span>(hash_table_t* table, <span>uint32_t</span> key)</span> </span>{
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>for</span> (<span>uint32_t</span> d = <span>0</span>;; ++d) {
    <span>uint32_t</span> idx = (key + d) &amp; mask;
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot == <span>0</span>) {
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(key == (<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>slot) </span>{
      <span>uint32_t</span> nxt = (idx + <span>1</span>) &amp; mask;
      --table-&gt;count;
      <span>while</span> (slots[nxt] &amp;&amp; ((slots[nxt] ^ nxt) &amp; mask)) {
        slots[idx] = slots[nxt];
        idx = nxt;
        nxt = (idx + <span>1</span>) &amp; mask;
      }
      slots[idx] = <span>0</span>;
      <span>return</span> (slot &gt;&gt; <span>32</span>) | (slot &lt;&lt; <span>32</span>);
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(((idx - (<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>slot) &amp; mask) &lt; d) </span>{
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The final interesting hash table operation is iterating over all keys and values, which is just an array iteration combined with filtering out zeroes:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>table_iterate</span><span>(hash_table_t* table, <span>void</span>(*visit)</span><span>(<span>uint32_t</span> key, <span>uint32_t</span> val)</span>) </span>{
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint32_t</span> idx = <span>0</span>;
  <span>do</span> {
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot != <span>0</span>) {
      visit((<span>uint32_t</span>)slot, (<span>uint32_t</span>)(slot &gt;&gt; <span>32</span>));
    }
  } <span>while</span> (idx++ != mask);
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>That wraps up the core concepts of this hash table, so now it is time to revisit some of the initial simplifications.</p>
<p>If keys are 32-bit integers but are <em>not</em> randomly-distributed, then we just need an invertible hash function from 32 bits to 32 bits, the purpose of which is to take keys following ~any real-world pattern and emit a ~random pattern. The <code>table_lookup</code>, <code>table_set</code>, and <code>table_remove</code> functions gain <code>key = hash(key)</code> at the very start but are otherwise unmodified (noting that if the hash function is invertible, hash equality implies key equality, hence no need to explicitly check key equality), and <code>table_iterate</code> is modified to apply the inverse function before calling <code>visit</code>. If hardware CRC32 / CRC32C instructions are present (as is the case on sufficiently modern x86-64 and arm64 chips), these can be used for the task, although their inverses are annoying to compute, so perhaps not ideal if iteration is an important operation. If CRC32 isn't viable, <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/hash-prospector/issues/19">one option</a> out of many is:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>u32_hash</span><span>(<span>uint32_t</span> h)</span> </span>{
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>16</span>;
  h *= <span>0x21f0aaad</span>;
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>15</span>;
  h *= <span>0x735a2d97</span>;
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>15</span>;
  <span>return</span> h;
}
</code></pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>u32_unhash</span><span>(<span>uint32_t</span> h)</span> </span>{
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>15</span>; h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>30</span>;
  h *= <span>0x97132227</span>;
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>15</span>; h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>30</span>;
  h *= <span>0x333c4925</span>;
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>16</span>;
  <span>return</span> h;
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>If keys and values are larger than 32 bits, then the design can be augmented with a separate array of key/value pairs, with the design as shown containing a 32-bit hash of the key and the array index of the key/value pair. To meet property (3) in this case, either the hash function can be chosen to never be zero, or "array index plus one" can be stored rather than "array index". It is not possible to make the hash function invertible in this case, so <code>table_lookup</code>, <code>table_set</code>, and <code>table_remove</code> <em>do</em> need extending to check for key equality after confirming hash equality. Iteration involves walking the separate array of key/value pairs rather than the hash structure, which has the added benefit of iteration order being related to insertion order rather than hash order. As another twist on this, if keys and values are variably-sized, then the design can instead be augmented with a separate array of <em>bytes</em>, with key/value pairs serialised somewhere in that array, and the hash structure containing a 32-bit hash of the key and the <em>byte</em> offset (within the array) of the key/value pair.</p>
<p>Of course, a design can only stretch so far. If you're after a concurrent lock-free hash table, look elsewhere. If you can rely on 128-bit SIMD instructions being present, you might instead want to group together every 16 key/value pairs, keep an 8-bit hash of each key, and rely on SIMD to perform 16 hash comparisons in parallel. If you're building hardware rather than software, it can be appealing to have multiple hash functions, each one addressing its own SRAM bank. There is no one-size-fits-all hash table, but I've found the one shown here to be good for a lot of what I do.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Devstral: the next generation of SOTA coding.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral 2 is a 123B-parameter dense transformer supporting a 256K context window. It reaches 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified—establishing it as one of the best open-weight models while remaining highly cost efficient. Released under a modified MIT license, Devstral sets the open state-of-the-art for code agents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral Small 2 scores 68.0% on SWE-bench Verified, and places firmly among models up to five times its size while being capable of running locally on consumer hardware.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Devstral 2 (123B) and Devstral Small 2 (24B) are 5x and 28x smaller than DeepSeek V3.2, and 8x and 41x smaller than Kimi K2—proving that compact models can match or exceed the performance of much larger competitors. Their reduced size makes deployment practical on limited hardware, lowering barriers for developers, small businesses, and hobbyists.hardware.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Built for production-grade workflows.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral 2 supports exploring codebases and orchestrating changes across multiple files while maintaining architecture-level context. It tracks framework dependencies, detects failures, and retries with corrections—solving challenges like bug fixing and modernizing legacy systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The model can be fine-tuned to prioritize specific languages or optimize for large enterprise codebases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We evaluated Devstral 2 against DeepSeek V3.2 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 using human evaluations conducted by an independent annotation provider, with tasks scaffolded through Cline. Devstral 2 shows a clear advantage over DeepSeek V3.2, with a 42.8% win rate versus 28.6% loss rate. However, Claude Sonnet 4.5 remains significantly preferred, indicating a gap with closed-source models persists.</p>

ChatGPT is not "intelligence", so please don't call it "AI".
<p>
I define "intelligence" as being capable of knowing or understanding,
at least within some domain.  ChatGPT cannot know or understand
anything, so it is not intelligence.  It does not know what its
output means.  It has no idea that words can mean anything.
</p><p>
I call it a <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#ArtificialIntelligence">"bullshit generator"</a>
because it <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5">generates output "with indifference to the truth"</a>.
</p><p>
The same applies to many other "generative systems", for the same
reasons
</p><p>
The widespread public error of attributing intelligence to those
systems leads millions of people to a misplaced trust for them.
Please join me in spreading the word that people should not trust
systems that mindlessly play with words to be correct in what those
words mean.
</p><p>
Another reason to reject ChatGPT in particular is that users cannot
get a copy of it.  It is unreleased software -- users cannot get even
an executable to run, let alone the source code.  The only way to use
it is by talking to a server which keeps users at arm's length.
</p><p>
Doing your own computing via software running on someone else's server
inherently <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">trashes your computing freedom</a>.

		<h2>The Renaissance Period</h2>



<p>We are living through a Saturn renaissance. Buckets of titles previously locked away in Japan are seeing new audiences, thanks to the herculean efforts of small but dedicated teams of enthusiast translators, removing the veil of Japanese illiteracy from before our tired eyes. Interestingly, the majority of efforts are being directed at the games with the biggest scripts, and no other genre was as impacted by the language barrier as the text-heavy, story-driven RPG. Over a dozen quality titles are now playable in English. The Saturn is, once again, ascendant…</p>



<h2>Ain’t life Grand?</h2>



<p>Enter <em>Grandia</em>.</p>



<p>What hasn’t been said about <em>Grandia</em>? In the run-up to its late 1997 release, the game enjoyed significant worldwide coverage in the gaming press, not least because some positioned it as the anti-FF7 title. Hot on the heels of the remaster of <em>Lunar: Silver Star Story</em> and hailing from respected software house Game Arts, featuring state of the art fully 3D environments, a score by notable composer Noriyuki Iwadare, sound effects produced by Skywalker Sound… <em>Grandia</em> was indeed shaping up to be one of the premier JRPG experiences of the 5th generation. There was serious talk of bringing the game out West — Working Designs was touted as the favoured house to do the honors, owing to their strong partnership with Game Arts, but the game’s massive script would have meant a late 1998 release by even the speediest conversion standards of the time. By then, the Western Saturn retail market had collapsed, and despite a shrinking but fervently dedicated base of Saturn fans holding on to hope of seeing the title cross the ocean, the game wound up locked away in Japan, forever.</p>

</div>


<h2>NEVER say Forever</h2>



<p>Game Arts subsequently ported <em>Grandia</em> to the PlayStation, dropping it in Japan in the summer of 1999. Sony speedily localized the game for Western release later that same year… but we aren’t going to focus too much on the PlayStation version here because, at the time of writing, PlayStation discs don’t boot on your SEGA Saturn. It’s the Saturn game that we are concerned with. For us Saturn stalwarts, we had to wait to the mid-2020s for <strong>an intrepid team led by TrekkiesUnite113 to <a href="https://segaxtreme.net/resources/grandia-english-patch.67/" data-type="link" data-id="https://segaxtreme.net/resources/grandia-english-patch.67/">transplant the PlayStation’s English script into the Saturn code</a></strong>. By then, the game was decades old, not to mention re-released and ‘re-mastered’ on modern platforms. So, why translate <em>Grandia</em> for the Saturn, when multiple other English options exist?</p>



<p><strong>Because <em>Grandia</em> is Best on Saturn.</strong></p>



<h2>How do you do</h2>



<p>Set in an age of discovery at the dawn of the industrial revolution, <em>Grandia</em> initially tells the tale of young Justin — a 14-year-old fearless adolescent who can’t help but dream of adventure. When he isn’t playing at “hero” with his town friends, he’s dreaming of great expeditions to find the lost civilization of Angelou. He is joined by his friend Sue — an 8-year-old girl whose maturity belies her age, and who tries desperately to keep young Justin in line. Justin’s mom Lily runs the local Seagull Restaurant and does her best to raise Justin into a respectable young man… though in her youth, she was a scrappy pirate herself. In her heart, she knows her audacious spark has passed on to her son, and that <strong>Justin will one day take up the adventurer’s mantle and take off on a grand adventure of his own</strong>, so she does her best to prepare him for when the time comes.</p>



<p><strong>She gives Justin a Spirit Stone</strong> — a remnant of the Angelou civilization and a memento of his long-lost father — and in doing so, helps kick off a fantastic voyage that sees young Justin explore, learn, overcome all manner of obstacles, and ultimately, grow and become the hero that he always imagined himself to be.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002388.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002388.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002388.bmp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The party’s travels take them to the most interesting locations.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>During his quest, Justin encounters fascinating characters, both friend and foe. From quiet folk in sleepy villages to rambunctious youngsters eager for their own slice of adventure; from military platoons led by the most beautiful — but hopelessly shallow — lady sergeants to cunning merchants, towering warriors, alluring mermaids and ferocious dragons… Justin encounters them all, and for good or ill, manages to change the course of their lives in ways both subtle and grand.</p>

<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="126" height="126" data-id="53358" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sue.png?resize=126%2C126&amp;ssl=1" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="126" height="126" data-id="53359" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Feena.png?resize=126%2C126&amp;ssl=1" alt=""></figure>
</figure>



<p>Justin, Sue, and Feena are the first three playable characters in <em>Grandia</em>. Young Sue tries to keep Justin in line, while Feena searches for the true meaning of being an adventurer – with Justin slowly moving from admiring her to showing her the way.</p>



<p>The game is clever in pulling the player in for a ride that for a very long while feels very lighthearted and innocent. Even as Justin’s adventure begins in earnest and the player is exposed to antagonists, mysteries, undercurrents and intrigues, Justin can’t help but distill it back to the <strong>very pure essence of boyhood adventure.</strong> Mysterious tower causing problems for a nearby village for years? No problem, Justin will fix it! A dragon from a nearby volcano terrorizing the locals? Justin’s got this. A ghost ship sailing in to harass a passenger steamer? Justin is the answer, in the same way that, as youngsters, we all knew – we knew! – that <strong>WE were the heroes</strong>, and that WE would save the day, armed only with our courage and our grand imaginations. It was our duty, after all. We had it in us to go forth boldly, and change the world (and naturally, all before being called home for dinner).</p>



<p>This point is driven home by Justin’s insatiable desire to uncover the mystery of his Spirit Stone, and the ancient Angelou civilization. After an unfortunate but entirely predictable mishap in the local museum, followed by a mysterious revelation in the nearby Sult Ruins, Justin’s curiosity is ignited, and his drive for real adventure becomes indomitable. Meanwhile, forces are at work that care not for Justin’s explorations, and inevitably, the lad finds himself pitted against the Garlyle Forces and some of its top commanders. Their aims are complex and their operations span the world, and this scope creates a wonderful juxtaposition with Justin’s innocent demeanor and singular focus.</p>

<h2>On Screen!</h2>



<p>The Fifth Generation of consoles marked the rise of 3D graphics, but some genres made the leap easier than others. This shift was a struggle for RPGs, with many excellent titles continuing to employ 2D visuals, albeit in richer color and more sophisticated detail than seen in previous generations. Early attempts at the 3D RPG (<em>Virtual Hydlide</em>) highlighted how difficult it was to run this style of game on the hardware of the time without wrecking the framerate or keeping textures from looking like a checkerboard mess. Dungeon crawlers (<em>Shining the Holy Ark</em>) were among the first titles to get the 3D right, though the player’s scope of movement was very restricted. Finally, some fantasized that “3D” meant pre-rendered backgrounds and copious FMV clips, with the only real 3D being battle scenes. Ahem!</p>



<p><em>Grandia</em> took the traditional overhead RPG view and transformed the landscapes into <strong>fully realized 3D polygonal playfields</strong> that can be rotated and zoomed at will. Character and enemy sprites are then overlain on the 3D world to make the scenes come to life. The addition of the third dimension affords the use of depth in the environments: hills, cliffs, and valleys; minecar rails that ran higher or lower relative to other tracks, and so on. In this way, the player initially feels right at home with a view that looks comfortably familiar, but must quickly learn to constantly rotate the viewpoint to catch enemies in hiding, spy treasures only visible from certain angles, judge heights, and evaluate other geometric details to plot their best course forward.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002414.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002414.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002414.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Aside from technical achievements, the art direction is fantastic.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p><em>Grandia</em> wastes no time in getting gamers used to this new visual paradigm. One of the game’s first quests sees local frenemy Gantz challenge Justin and Sue to locate the three Legendary Treasures: the fabled helmet (Iron Pot), the storied shield (Pot Lid), and of course, the legendary (Wooden) Sword. The player must traverse all of Parm, climbing down river walkways, checking in enclosed spaces, and chasing down Gantz’s little brother to prove they are up to Gantz’ task — and in the process, get used to the game’s then-new control scheme.</p>



<p>The 3D is very well put together, both technical and artistically. The level of detail is truly phenomenal, from the tiniest objects and details, especially in the ‘in-town’ game sections. Justin is able to interact with some of the innocuous scenery — for example he can knock brooms over, disturb piles of plates, or bump into bells and chimes — just as any real, overly excited 14-year-old might clumsily do as they ran along. Animations, from little weathervanes rotating to laundry fluttering on a clothesline, to puffs of smoke coming up from fires or chimneys, all accentuate the feeling that these are real, living, bustling places. The level of detail, and all of it in 3D, is really special.</p>



<p>The coders at Game Arts made excellent use of the Saturn’s unique hardware when realizing <em>Grandia</em>’s locales. Where appropriate, textured infinite planes are used to draw floors, and they not only look good but also dramatically cut down on the usage of polygons in drawing the scene, leaving that much more in the processing budget to spend on other visual details. In later sections, those infinite planes take on a distortion effect to create some very cool-looking water flows — look for them initially in Parm’s pier, and later in places like the snowy Laine Village or the mysterious Castle of Dreams. The water shimmers as the player rotates their view to create a truly stunning effect.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002409-4.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002409-4.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002409-4.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Slimes are never that tough to dispatch in any RPG.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>The game’s characters and enemies are all represented by sprites that animate quite well and take viewpoints into account as the player rotates the camera. In yet more attention to detail, the sprites darken and then lighten again as the player moves in and out of shadowed areas — an impressive little detail that accentuates the visuals even further.</p>

</figure>



<p>The trio of General Baal, Colonel Mullen, and Leen is introduced in the game’s opening scene, and all three are more than they appear.</p>



<p>The care that Game Arts took in crafting the visuals is commendable and <em>Grandia</em> comes off as one of the very best-looking 3D RPGs for the system, but Game Arts was perhaps a mite too ambitious. There are sections of the game where the framerate really chugs. Now, it must be acknowledged that low framerates were a hallmark of many 3D games in the 32-bit era, so some of this is to be expected, but the more detail Grandia is trying to show you, the more you will feel the Saturn huffing and puffing to get the job done. The game’s 3D framerate is not high at the best of times but it is passable, so it’s somewhat of a relief that the areas where it truly takes a dive aren’t too common.</p>



<h2>Pump up the Jam!</h2>



<p>Game Arts’ attention to detail extends to the sound department. For <em>Grandia</em>, Game Arts commissioned Skywalker Sound to handle the game’s sound effects. The result is <strong>positional sound</strong> — effects like running water, crackling fire, etc. will fade in and out as Justin and co. move closer in or further away from the source. Often, if the effect is important, it will also somewhat dampen the volume of the BGM as it plays out. Additionally, the effects will pan left or right depending on the source, and especially as the player rotates the camera. These effects may be subtle, but they are very well implemented and add to the game’s overall polish.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002421.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002421.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002421.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The game is very colorful.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>The game’s <strong>soundtrack was composed by Noriyuki Iwadare</strong> and is both varied and excellent. Iwadare’s use of instruments appropriate to the on-screen action is uncanny — for example, running around Parm we are treated to an industrial sounding theme, perfect for the town’s motif. The varied use of strings, drums and winds is frankly excellent and lends to the atmosphere, imitating the clang of metal and steel which so permeates the city. Equally impressive is that the music somehow manages to be exciting or somber or poignant without ever sounding overly (excuse the wordplay) grandiose. This keeps the soundtrack in line with the game’s more lighthearted narrative. Of course, where appropriate, the soundtrack does take on that epic quality. The desperate tones that play when the Garlyle forces appear contrast so well with the carefree, upbeat “Off Runs Sue” tune. Mullen’s theme is at once wistful and ambitious, and even the theme from the Sult Ruins dungeon is perfectly mood-setting. Multiple <em>Grandia </em>soundtracks have been released since the game’s debut and the soundtrack is universally praised.</p>

Mullen’s acolytes.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h2>How it Plays Out</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em>’s gameplay, like so many RPGs before it, is split into two major gameplay slices: exposition-laden town sections and combat-focused dungeons.</p>



<p>Players will spend a fair bit of time in the ‘in-town’ sections of the game. Here, you will wander around, take in the scenery, interact with the NPCs of the area, and almost always, find a quest that must be completed. A quick word about the NPCs — there are quite a number of them in each town, and everyone has something interesting to say… and almost always, each NCP has at least two separate conversation sequences to offer, making for a truly large amount of story to soak in. And <strong>it’s all entirely optional!</strong> It’s completely possible to make one’s way through <em>Grandia</em> with only minimal NCP interaction, but the option to enhance the adventure with these extensive NPC interactions is always there, as each character will present a unique view or focused response.</p>

<p>Predictably, the towns are filled with shops, though <em>Grandia</em> keeps things rather simple — there is but one general store which carries weapons, armor, accessories, and even magic all under the same roof. Buy, sell or trade up to the latest gear which gradually increases in the stat boosts it confers to your characters. Additionally, each town typically has one or more important locales, such as mayors’ offices or the chambers of village chiefs.</p>



<p>There is typically an inn or other house where the party can take rest, and at certain points in the game, resting triggers a shared meal scene that sees Justin break bread with his party mates. These meal scenes offer up critical dialogue, which the gamer can extend or keep short at their whim. When the critical conversation has been had, a bedtime icon will appear over Justin’s character sprite, and if the player is quite finished listening to the party chatter, they can select it to end the meal and get some rest. These mealtime conversations serve not only to flesh out what the party must tackle next, but also to offer a glimpse into the inner thoughts of the individual characters as they share their opinions, hopes and fears. Like so much in the game, <em>Grandia</em> implements this character exposition in a way that allows the player to decide how much of it to take in.</p>


<div>

<p><strong>The visuals in the town sections really stand out.</strong> The Saturn manages to shift not only impressive amounts of polygons for the various structures, but also vivid and complex textures. This technical prowess is coupled with lush and imaginative art direction, resulting in each locale feeling complete and distinct. The dense, humid and green surrounds of Luc Village, nestled deep within the Misty Forest and inhabited by humanoid creatures contrasts sharply with the seaside port town of Dight with its cerulean waves gently rolling in onto its sandy shores. Milda’s hometown village of Laine is covered in snow, and the ancient Zil Padon is an architectural wonder with a central fountain in the middle of the Savanna desert. Game Arts very clearly discarded their standard world building cookie cutters, and their efforts shine through.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002486.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002486.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002486.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The world map. The feather icon indicates where you will travel next.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Once a locale has been explored, it will appear as a selectable destination on a gorgeous, hand-drawn high-resolution world map. Exiting an area often brings our party to this world map, and the next destination can be selected.</p>



<p>If the towns serve to heal the party, upgrade equipment, and advance the story, then the dungeons of the game offer treasure hunting, exploration, and of course, combat! Dungeons in <em>Grandia</em> range from literal underground labyrinths to above-ground forest mazes, to even large open plains that Justin et al. must traverse. Some of the more noteworthy settings include scaling a giant wall that keeps the world divided into two separate societies, negotiating the bowels of a ghost ship which appears out of nowhere to molest a transcontinental steamer, and even conquering the inside of an unstable volcano that’s inhabited by an ancient dragon.</p>



<p>Here, the player really must use their L and R buttons to shift the 3D landscape around, to find all the nooks of treasure or paths forward. Some areas feature set pieces that Justin and party can activate — for example, knocking over a loose pillar to bridge a gap. These are usually indicated by an exclamation point icon when the party nears the set piece.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002499.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002499.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002499.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Some of the spells are quite spectacular.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>All the while, treasure both great and small litters the landscape… but so do enemies! Enemies are visible in the dungeons and so can be avoided to an extent, but if Justin and party come in contact with an enemy, combat ensues.</p>



<h3><em>Grandia</em> Grinder Alert!<br>Grind for Experience Points Using Environmental Damage!</h3>



<p>Are YOU a <em>Grandia </em>grinder?? Some sections of the game will deal damage to Justin and party outside of combat. First noticed in the Dom Ruins, rock faces painted into some of the dungeon walls will cause mild HP damage by springing out and poking the party when the party doesn’t want to be poked! The player can then use heal magic and spam this process to quickly increase Water magic levels. Although definitely a grind, it’s much faster than earning those experience points via combat. A few other areas in the game present similar opportunities — such as the basement in the Castle of Dreams.</p>



<h2>A New Kind of Kombat</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> introduced an all-new combat system to the RPG genre, though it could be said to be a variant of other similar RPG battle systems. Essentially, all battle participants have icons that continuously move along a <strong>universal IP Gauge</strong>, until they reach the Command point. Here, the player will enter from a selection of commands which includes attacking, using an item or a spell, guarding, or even retreating. They then wait to reach the very end of the gauge to execute their selected action, and the more experienced the character, the faster that point is reached. <strong>A ton of strategy is introduced here</strong> as during this waiting period between selecting an action and executing it, they are vulnerable to both Cancels and Counterattacks from their opponents. Unlike many contemporary RPGs where the instinct is to simply unleash physical and magical attacks in a turn-based order, <strong>the player can take advantage of these waiting periods</strong> to cancel out incoming enemy attacks and push them back on their IP gauge. The system will take some getting used to, but can be used to devastating effect, especially in the more drawn-out boss battles. It is entirely possible to strategically get in a half-dozen actions by each character and prevent a boss from retaliating during the entire sequence, by carefully timing attacks. This makes combat a lot more involved and exciting.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002528.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002528.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002528.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Cancel culture? Counterculture? Grandia’s got it all.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>There are also advantages to catching an enemy unawares — player characters start much further ahead on their IP Gauge, with the reverse being true if Justin’s party is ambushed.</p>



<p>Players have a range of actions they can take when their IP Gauge is full, from the standard fare of using items, defending, running away, or even inspecting an enemy (is that slug-monster male or female, for example*).</p>

<p>Nana, Saki, and Mio are Mullen’s three she-sergeants. Serving as comedic relief, they are nevertheless quite capable opponents in battle.</p>



<h2>By Your Powers Combined… I Am Captain Planet!</h2>



<p>Earth. Fire. Wind. Water. These are the elemental forces that move the world, and most characters can master them! Learning magic in <em>Grandia</em> first requires that the party finds a <strong>Mana Egg</strong>. These rare items can then be exchanged in a shop for magic for a single character of your choice. That party member then learns the basics of your chosen magic element.</p>



<p>Inside of the four elements, magic spells are further split into levels, from one to three, to indicate their potency. Level 1 spells are your most basic spells and are what a character starts off with should they buy magic with their mana egg. Players that use magic in combat will gain skill points in that particular element, and those skill points are applied to all spells of that element, regardless of spell level — so, use a Level 1 Fire spell, and all levels of your Fire magic gain skill. Spell skill progression is represented by five red stars that fill up like a gauge, turning yellow as they gain experience. Greater experience shortens casting time (which, remember, is a vulnerable time as your spell can be cancelled by an opponent) and at higher levels, allows your character to learn combined element magic spells. All magic spells consume MP making them a limited resource, though a character’s overall MP capacity will grow with experience.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002917.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002917.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002917.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The snowy village of Laine. The water effects are <strong>chef’s kiss</strong>.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Outside of magic, each character can also execute <strong>special attacks</strong> that are unique to them. These attacks are usually more devastating than standard attacks and sometimes require that the character is using a particular weapon class. These, too, gain skill points represented by five red stars that slowly build up to yellow, though special attacks consume SP (skill points). SP works much the same way as MP.</p>



<h3>Grandia Grinder Alert!<br>Rare Enemies Give High XP</h3>



<p>Typically, the game’s monsters do a good job of seeking you out, but there are occasional difficult-to-catch enemies to be found as well. Notice, for instance, the Chameleon enemies in the Virgin Forest. These green creatures are shy and are hard to catch and engage. But persist, and finish them off for a huge load of experience points — well worth a grinding sesh or three.</p>



<h2>Experience Required</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> has a complex (for the time) experience points system, which is cleverly segmented into several categories.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002507.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002507.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002507.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Level up!</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>To start, each playable character has a set of basic stats that slowly increase as they gain experience. Hit Points (HP) are your standard measure of health and these increase at level-ups. SP are your skill points, which increase the speed and potency of your special attacks, as well as unlock new special attacks as you accumulate experience. Finally, the same is true of the more traditional magic points (MP), with the difference between SP and MP being that special attacks are individualized whereas magic attacks are more common amongst party members and can be bought in exchange for Mana Eggs.</p>



<p>As they adventure, Justin and company will occasionally find items that slightly <strong>boost a particular stat on a permanent basis.</strong> These items are rare indeed, but as with life, incremental gains tend to compound until the effects are undeniable.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002940.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002940.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002940.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The Seed of Speed grants a permanent stat boost.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Most traditionally, defeating enemies grants experience points and accumulating the required amount grants characters a level-up, which slightly increases basic stats. Experience gained and gold / treasure collected is displayed on an after-battle screen. It is this type of XP that most contemporary RPGs concerned themselves with. <em>Grandia</em> ups the complexity a bit by introducing leveling for magic and skills, and further mixes things up by employing different weapon classes.</p>



<p>Justin and company are each capable of wielding a few different types of weapons, of which there are seven in total, ranging from swords to maces to staffs to bows. Each weapon class has its advantages and disadvantages, be it speed of use (from Command input to Execution on the IP gauge), to range, to overall damage dealt. As party members use their weapons, they gain experience in those weapon types, separately from their character experience.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002512.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002512.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002512.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The texture work is awesome throughout.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>In total, <em>Grandia</em> features basic character experience points which boosts common stats, magic experience which results in spells being cast faster and the learning of higher-level spells for various element types, skill experience for faster execution of special attacks, and weapon experience points which increase how well a character will handle that weapon type. Cleverly, these different experience categories are implemented in such a way as to make it entirely possible for gamers to completely ignore this aspect of the game should they so fancy. Because the system is automated, gamers can pay all of it little heed and still progress and have a great time with the game. Alternately, gamers can dive right into the finer points of the system to make those minor tweaks to get their characters to exactly the state they prefer.</p>

<h2>Go with the Flow</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> allows up to <strong>four playable characters</strong> to form Justin’s party at any one time. As the story progresses, some of the main characters will permanently step away from the adventure, for reasons practical and dramatic alike. One such parting in particular tugs at the heartstrings — it is nothing quite as dramatic as the year’s earlier death of Aeris (Aerith) from that big RPG on Sony’s lesser 32-bit machine, but it somehow feels more relatable, and more impactful. Players ought not be surprised by the need for tissues to manage an unexpected tear or two. And here, too, <em>Grandia</em> innovates: a portion of a departing playable character’s magic and weapon experience points are stored in the stashing place, to be retrieved and applied to whatever character you see fit. This strengthens their legacy in your party, as well as provide a practical reason not to neglect building up a character just because they may eventually leave the party. A nice touch.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002976.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002976.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002976.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>At the foot of the End of the World.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h2>Is It Perfect?</h2>



<p>Grand as it sounds, the game isn’t without a few small flaws. Story-wise, players will be left wanting to know more about Justin’s father and how he came to be the keeper of his Spirit Stone. He is mentioned often in the early stages of the game, but as Justin’s adventure takes off, that arc never completes. Likewise for General Baal — we eventually learn his motivations, but not so much why he has become who he is today. A really well put together villain is one with whom we can empathise; someone whose circumstance we can understand. Both with Justin’s unnamed father and with Baal, there is a feeling that we are reading a book and that the answers lie just ahead, but despite some teasing, <em>Grandia</em> never lets us turn the page.</p>



<p>Technically, the game’s 3D is solid and varied, with plenty of minor details and meticulous textures, especially in the town sections. Blending VDP2-drawn planes with solid geometry and animated sprites means the world of <em>Grandia</em> is beautifully rendered, but that comes at the cost of an oft-stuttering framerate. The more of <em>Grandia</em>’s world we are allowed to see at once, the more the framerate suffers. Now, these were the formative years of 3D gaming, but at times, that framerate simply chugs, and it’s noticeable to the point of distraction. Thankfully, for most of the game, the framerate sits comfortably in the ‘acceptable’ space, but you won’t get through the game without feeling the Saturn sweat as it works to display all that <em>Grandia</em>’s artists wanted you to see.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002376.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002376.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002376.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Special Moves. These gain experience as well.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Speaking of 3D, the game often requires the shifting of camera angles when exploring. When in long dungeons or any other large space, this can quickly become disorienting, and the player will lose their sense of direction. The game compensates somewhat for this with the addition of the compass, though its implementation is somewhat clumsy as rather than point north, it points to an exit or other objective. <strong>There is also lookout points called Dungeon Scopes</strong>, where the player is given a bird’s eye view of their current location from a default ‘north is up’ viewpoint. This helps orientating, but those lookout points are few and far between and using them tends to break up the game’s flow. Players may well find themselves keeping their camera shifting to a minimum as a result.</p>



<p>Lastly, a technical note: <em>Grandia</em> sure gives the Saturn’s laser a workout, and there are some clever pre-loading techniques implemented to keep the game flowing as smoothly as possible. The cost here is that <em>Grandia</em> is very sensitive to disc quality. Those that have burnt their English-patched game onto CDs and are playing on real Saturn hardware may well find the game freeze, especially in battle when calling various spells. This is VERY annoying, especially as dungeon save points are sparse, and it is not uncommon to be in the heat of a battle only to have everyone freeze with the reset button being the only escape. This is remedied by using an ODE solution that omits discs entirely, but the game’s sensitivity to the quality of your CD-R burn needs to be called out.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002964.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002964.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002964.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Hell yeah!

</div>


<h2>Final Word</h2>



<p><strong><em>Grandia </em>is great.</strong> The visuals are gorgeous, the music is appropriately evocative, the combat is frenetically strategic, and the story is well paced. Tough battles and surprise plot twists await intrepid gamers, and sub-plots occasionally weave their way into the adventure, too — especially in sections where we briefly leave Justin. On occasion, players will follow Colonel Mullen with Feena, explore the mysterious past of Mullen’s attaché Leen, or even soak in the comedic antics of the three beautiful Garlyle generals Mio, Nana, and Saki.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <em>Grandia</em> a delight to play. A total joy… but one that demands an <strong>intense time commitment</strong>. A player Justin’s age surely has the time, but what about those of us that are well into adulting? Some sections of the game, especially the longer dungeons, have few opportunities to save one’s game. In that sense, the game is a total hardcore, traditional JRPG. It is not easily digested in small play sessions, so playing <em>Grandia </em>is committing a huge slice of one’s discretionary time budget.</p>



<p>And yet, perhaps paradoxically, playing <em>Grandia</em> has a way of making one feel young again. <em>Grandia</em> is grand in the same way we ourselves felt grand as youngsters — that, armed with a stick we’ve just picked up and nothing more than our imagination, our wits, and our indomitable spirit, we could go forth boldly and change the world. That’s the beauty of a main character like Justin — he is not yet jaded; he has not yet borne the <strong>burden of grown-up problems on his shoulders</strong>. In many ways, we were all Justin (or Sue!) at one point, and the game shines a light on that part of us that is now long behind (most of) us. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of <em>Grandia</em> is that it allows us, for a moment all too brief, to once again be that young boy or girl full of optimism and energy, and in today’s complex and stressful world, that feels simply wonderful.</p>

<h2>Three Optional Dungeons</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> is generally a well-balanced affair, with experience accumulating at the right rate for players to progress in the game. That said, the world of <em>Grandia</em> plays host to three completely optional dungeons meant solely for increasing character abilities and experience — and goes so far as to explicitly point out that these areas are not part of the game’s story and are entirely optional.</p>



<p>The first such dungeon can be found just west of the first section of the Zil Desert. It’s a large, very dark brown multi-leveled maze with the only save point being at the entrance. The enemies are tougher than one would expect at this point in the game, but nothing is impossible for Justin et al. The key here is to find the four Soldier’s Souls, which grants access to the treasures of the dungeon, at the very end, past the boss. The boss is a remix of a previous boss from Feena’s failed wedding to Pakon and packs quite a punch. The main prize here is the excellent Godspeed Knife, which adds a huge ACT boost, to massively speed up the user’s IP gauge.</p>

<p>The second optional dungeon is also found to the west but is accessible from the second part of the Zil Desert. This dungeon is very small but has perhaps the most charm. Justin and company are greeted by a mysterious Lady at the castle entrance, begging for help but also warning of a curse on the castle. Once inside, there are several rooms to visit and loot to collect. Really simplistic and set to lure the player to lower their guard, just in time to battle the formidable Lord’s Ghost boss. This guy’s TOUGH, with strong multi-character attacks and cancelling moves. Take him down to claim the awesome Lightning Sword, which gives a 50 ATK boost and, as an elemental sword, has the Zap! spell built in.</p>

<p>The final optional dungeon is the mother of all dungeons in<em> Grandia</em>. Found tucked away in the Savanna Wilderness and accessible via a secret passage, the Tower of Temptation consists of an outside area and 12 (!) floors of punishing combat. Of course, the only save point is at the very start of the outside area, though Justin can activate a couple of shortcuts through the tower as he makes progress, so that backtracking to heal and save is a bit easier. Interestingly, the starting area is surrounded by six Zero Weapons – one of each kind of weapons that grants a 0 ATK value — ideal for training weapons on weaker enemies, as these will do nearly no damage.</p>



<p><strong><em>Grandia</em> Grinder Mini-Alert</strong>: many enemies in the Tower drop stat-increasing items, making this an ideal place to pull it all out and go for that growth.</p>

</div>


<p>Each floor of the Tower features maze sections, hidden doors, powerful enemies, and of course, switches to hit. Simply by making one’s way through the tower will increase the party’s levels, as there is so much battling to do. It is not uncommon to spend hours in the Tower, so it’s a welcome fact that the Tower is entirely optional. The final three floors are all boss — yes, there are three bosses to fight in a row. No saving, no healing. The final of the three bosses is tough as nails, but the reward is well worth it — NINE amazing items to pick up, including two items from the Grinder’s Gear™ premium collection: the Astral Miracle and the Ethereal Miracle, both accessories that double weapon or magic experience gained. VERY useful, but they better be, considering the pain just endured to complete the Tower of Temptation!</p>

<h2>The Universe is Grand…ia</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> went on to <strong>sell bucket-loads in Japan</strong>, especially during release week. It received a Digital Museum DLC-style disc, got a port on the mass-market PlayStation including a PS Greatest Hits re-release, and finally, a PlayStation English localization in 1999. The series continued in 2000 with the excellent <em>Grandia 2</em> on Dreamcast, which itself was later poorly ported to Sony’s killer of dreams, the PlayStation 2. That system would also see the less-well received <em>Grandia 3</em>, which would spell the end of the main series’ run. The series also saw several spin-off games such as <em>Grandia Xtreme</em> and <em>Grandia Online</em>. Additionally, the first <em>Grandia</em> was recently remade for modern consoles with the release of the <em>Grandia HD Collection</em>.</p>



<p>*Note: you cannot inspect monsters’ genders in battle. That was just a joke. Also there is no Grinder’s Gear in Grandia. </p>



<h2>I’m Not Crying, You’re Crying!</h2>

</div>


<p>A bit of a personal story… The above screenshot is my favorite scene in all of Grandia. See, the game does a brilliant job of bringing us back to the days of youthful adventures where nothing at all was impossible, and despite whatever danger beset us, we knew deep down that in the end, we would be all right. But in the most subtle of ways, Grandia also covers personal growth and the passage of time. </p>



<p>At some point, deep into the adventure, 8-year-old Sue gets tired. At first, she temporarily leaves the party whilst recuperating at a local sick house, with everyone hoping (and the player confidently knowing) that she will get better. But… she doesn’t. She puts on a brave face and re-joins the party, going on one final quest. As the gamer, I kept looking for the herb or special item that I could find to cure her, but no such moment ever came. There never was any single wound or ailment that Sue suffered, it’s just that one day, she simply… got tired, and ultimately, had to leave the party. She was a trooper through the entire adventure; completely indispensable she was, but there was a sunset to her time on the grand adventure, and she ended up leaving far too soon for my liking.</p>



<p>In real life, this sometimes happens, too. People in our orbit — strong, vibrant people, whom we believe will be with us forever — sometimes, unexpectedly, undeservedly… get tired, and have to quit the great adventure. Sometimes they are even younger than us, or in better health than us, or benefitting from any number of other factors that make their leaving seem senseless and cruelly unfair. It’s a reminder of the finite nature of life, and that sometimes we are living oh so naively and innocently through what we will later call the best times of our lives.</p>



<p>Sometimes, we get a chance to say our goodbyes before they depart us, and this is something Justin and Feena were able to share with Sue. With tears in her eyes, even as she bade farewell, she wished for Justin to follow his dreams and complete his long quest to find Angelou. It’s this that ties all of these sentiments together, for me. We all get older. We all leave our childhood behind us and begin to lead our adult lives in earnest. Our carefree days of questing and playing our days away, confident that in the end, everything will be all right, are replaced by planning, worrying, pressure, stress, failure, and other harsh realities of life. Here, Sue reminds us of the importance of not forgetting our dreams. We may not have the time or the energy that we did then, but whatever the obstacles, we must always go boldly in the direction of our dreams, hand-in-hand with those who love us, for we, too, will one day exit the adventure. In our final moments, what sweeter satisfaction could there be than to warmly smile at those who walked with us, and to look back on our journey with pride.   </p>	</div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It has now been 30 years since WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness was released. After the great response to Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, released in November 1994, Blizzard began working on Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness. Development stared in the first months of 1995, and the game was released in North America and Australia on December 9, 1995.</p>
<p>While WarCraft: Orcs and Humans had laid the foundations of the series — arguably even for the RTS genre at a whole — it was really WarCraft II that took things to new heights. More units could be selected at once, the player could right-click to issue commands, naval and aerial combat was introduced, and buildings and units could be upgraded. The graphics were more vivid and visually appealing, and features like the Fog of War was introduced, where you could only see in the vicinity of your own units — unlike in the first game, where you could indefinitely see any area you had previously visited, you now had to continuously scout the map.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jorsys.org/archive/december_2025-files/war2tod.jpg" alt="WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness"></p><p>Many things still resembled the first game. The two factions — the Humans and the Orcs — were balanced through their similarites. For every unit and building of one faction, the other had one that was functionally equivalent, and so the sides largely mirrored each other. The only real differences lay in the spells available to their higher-level units. In that regard, the clear winners were the Orcs, who had a tremendous advantage thanks to the incredibly powerful and unbalanced Bloodlust spell of the Ogre-Magi.</p>
<p>It is quite impressive that Blizzard managed to release a title of such quality in such a short span of time, especially considering that the overall design and gameplay evolved during development. Originally, Blizzard’s concept blended modern and fantasy elements, such as fighter pilots being ambushed by a fire-breathing dragon. In the Alpha version (it is still probably floating around somewhere on the Internet) which was given to magazines for review shortly before the game's release, players could, for example, mine rocks which acted as an additional required resource.</p>
<p>Several versions and bundles of WarCraft II were released over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness, originally written for DOS, though it had a Windows launch screen and ran well under Windows 95. A Macintosh version was also released. The DOS version supported multiplayer games via null modem cable, modem, or IPX, while Mac players could also play via TCP/IP or AppleTalk.</li>
<li>WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal, the expansion, released in April 1996.</li>
<li>WarCraft: Battle Chest, released in 1996, was a bundle which included WarCraft: Orcs and Humans, WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness, and WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.</li>
<li>WarCraft II: The Dark Saga, released in 1997, was a port for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation consoles by Electronic Arts, including the campaigns from both Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal.</li>
<li>WarCraft II: Battle.net Edition, released in 1999, ported the game's code to Microsoft Windows, fixed some minor bugs, and enabled multiplayer support via Blizzard's online service, Battle.net.</li>
<li>WarCraft II Battle Chest, released in 1999, included the Battle.net Edition and its official strategy guide.</li>
<li>WarCraft II: Remastered, released in November 2024, is modern remaster of Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal, with improved graphics and updated controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness received enthusiastic reviews, elevating Blizzard to the top ranks alongside Westwood Studios, id Software, and LucasArts. The rivalry between Blizzard's series and Westwood Studios' Command and Conquer series helped fuel the RTS boom of the late 1990s. PC Gamer US named WarCraft II the best game of 1995, calling it an "easy" choice and writing that "Warcraft II stand[s] out — way out — as the most impressive, most entertaining, game of 1995". The editors also awarded it Best Multi-Player Game of 1995.</p>
<p>WarCraft II was notable for the large number of third-party utilities created for it. Quickly, <span>Daniel Lemberg</span> reverse-engineered and published the map file (*.pud) format and wrote the first third-party map editor, <span>War2xEd</span>, which could do multiple things that the bundled map editor could not, such as editing unit attributes. Blizzard apparently began using <span>War2xEd</span> internally, and it influenced their decision to later ship a feature-rich map editor with StarCraft.</p>
<p>Next, <span>Alexander Cech</span> and <span>Daniel Lemberg</span> reverse-engineered the game data format, the WAR archives. <span>Alexander Cech</span> went on to make a hugely important tool called <span>Wardraft</span>, which allowed users to browse and modify the contents of the WAR archives. This enabled extensive game modifications, known as "Total Conversions". Many such projects gained popularity and remained in development for a long time, notable examples being <span>DeathCraft: Twilight of Demons</span>, <span>War of the Ring</span>, <span>Editor's Total Conversion</span>, <span>Funcraft</span> and <span>Rituals of Rebirth</span>.</p>
<p>Most of these utilities and conversions have long since faded into obscurity, but their legacy lives on. They impacted Blizzard's decision to bundle ever more powerful editors and trigger systems into StarCraft and later WarCraft III, which in turn later spawned entire games such as Dota (which began as a WarCraft III map). Hopefully, someday (soon?) we can host some of the Total Conversions here at <span>Jorvik Systems</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a personal anecdote, I vividly remember two defining moments related to the game. I was young when it came out, and my dad's friend had pirated it; somehow the game ended up on our computer. I was too young to speak English at the time, and the interface was confusing to me, so a relative helped me understand the basics — how to make peons construct buildings, how to control units, and how to navigate around the map. I hadn't played computer games much before then, but from that moment on, I was arguably obsessed.</p>
<p>A second strong memory came a few months later, at my friend <span>Erik</span>'s house, on his Intel 486 PC. He was experimenting with the WarCraft II map editor, which I hadn't known existed, and I was blown away. I simply could not believe that Blizzard would ship such a tool with the game; to me, it meant that people could essentially create their own games by designing entirely new scenarios. It is quite possible that my fascination with modding was born in that very moment. We probably went outside to play shortly afterward, which I found incredibly lame — we had at our disposal the most powerful tool I could imagine, so why were we not inside using it?</p>
