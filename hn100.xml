<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. –&nbsp;In a head-to-head comparison of masks worn by people with active COVID-19, the inexpensive “duckbill” N95 came out on top, stopping 98% of COVID-19 particles in the breath of infected people from escaping into the air. Led by researchers from the University of Maryland School of Public Health (SPH), results showed other masks also performed well, blocking at least 70% of viral particles from escaping from the source – an infected person’s exhaled breath.</p><div id="umd_terp_paragraph--12679">
				<p>The study,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(24)00192-0/fulltext">Relative efficacy of masks and respirators as source control for viral aerosol shedding from people infected with SARS-CoV-2</a>, published May 29 in eBioMedicine, a Lancet journal.</p>

<p>“The research shows that any mask is much better than no mask, and an N95 is significantly better than the other options. That’s the number one message,” says the study’s senior author,&nbsp;<a href="https://sph.umd.edu/people/donald-milton">Dr. Donald Milton</a>. Milton is a UMD SPH professor of environmental health and a global expert on how viruses spread through the air.</p>

<p>The study started in May 2020, shortly after the pandemic began, and compared breath samples from volunteers who had active COVID-19, testing the performance of four commonly-used masks. Even without giving participants fit tests or training on how to wear masks correctly, all masks significantly reduced the amount of virus escaping into the air. The study tested masks as a way to control the spread of the virus from the source, i.e. the infected person, and did not test masks as protection from COVID-19 in the surrounding air.</p>

<p>“Because COVID-19 is airborne, we focused on the extent to which wearing a mask reduces contamination of the air around you,” Milton says. This latest study is a continuation of investigations by UMD’s&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/phablabumd/home?authuser=0">Public Health AeroBiology Lab</a>&nbsp;(PHAB Lab) into how contagious respiratory viruses such as influenza contaminate the air.</p>

<p>Researchers asked volunteers with COVID-19 to breathe into a unique contraption known as the Gesundheit II Machine, developed by Milton and colleagues to measure viruses in exhaled breath. Participants, who breathed into the machine for 30 minutes at a time, were asked to do a&nbsp;variety of vocalizations such as repeating the alphabet, singing Happy Birthday, and even&nbsp;honoring&nbsp;<a href="https://umterps.com/sports/2018/6/7/school-mascot">UMD’s mascot</a>&nbsp;by repeatedly shouting “Go Terps!”</p>

<p>In each instance, researchers measured the amount of viral particles in the exhaled breath of volunteers, pairing each 30-minute session of breathing with a mask on with another 30-minute session with no mask.</p>

<p>“Data from our study suggests that a mildly symptomatic person with COVID-19 who is not wearing a mask exhales a little over two infectious doses per hour,” says first author Dr. Jianyu Lai, a postdoctoral researcher at the PHAB Lab. “But when wearing an N95 mask, the risk goes down exponentially.”</p>

<p>The duckbill N95 blocked 99% of large particles and 98% of small particles from escaping out of a person’s mask. Milton says the design’s tight seal, a powerful filter, and large air space for breath to move around all contribute to the duckbill’s success.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, KN95 masks – the disposable masks used widely – were no more effective than cloth or surgical masks. The study found that a common brand of KN95 masks leak more air than duckbills or other studied masks, because they don’t conform to the face well. That flaw is compounded by a powerful filter with more flow resistance that pushes air out of the mask at the sides instead of through the filter, allowing more virus particles to escape into the surrounding air.</p>

<p>Cloth masks also outperformed both KN95 and surgical masks. Milton theorizes that cloth masks with greater coverage, wrap around the face and give a better seal than either KN95 or surgical masks. With cloth mask filters, flow resistance is also lower, allowing breath to pass through the filter and not leak out the sides of the mask.</p>

<p>Limiting the amount of viral particles in the air is a key way to control highly contagious respiratory viruses in general, Milton said. This is even more the case with the COVID-19 virus, given transmissibility has increased over time, with Omicron in particular breaking through the immunity people developed from vaccinations or prior infections.</p>

<p>“Our research shows definitively why it’s so important to have non-pharmaceutical responses like wearing masks, and why we need studies like this to illuminate which masks are most effective,” says Milton.</p>

<p>Both Milton and Lai hope that their findings will inform health policies going forward, including when combatting potential outbreaks like bird flu or even the common flu.</p>

<p>“Duckbill N95 masks should be the standard of care in high-risk situations, such as nursing homes and health care settings,” Lai says. “Now, when the next outbreak of a severe respiratory&nbsp;virus occurs, we know exactly how to help control the spread, with this simple and inexpensive&nbsp;solution.”</p>

<p>In addition to researchers from the UMD School of Public Health, collaborators include authors from the UMD A. James Clark School of Engineering and the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at the University of Hong Kong, China.</p>

For a while, she made good money on a freelance writing platform called WritersAccess, where she wrote blogs and other content for small and midsize companies. But halfway through 2023, the income plummeted as some clients switched to ChatGPT for their writing needs. It was already a difficult time. Then the email came. </p><p>“I only got one warning,” Gasuras said. “I got this message saying they’d flagged my work as AI using a tool called ‘Originality.’” She was dumbfounded. Gasuras wrote back to defend her innocence, but she never got a response. Originality costs money, but Gasuras started running her work through other AI detectors before submitting to make sure she wasn’t getting dinged by mistake. A few months later, WritersAccess kicked her off the platform anyway. “They said my account was suspended due to excessive use of AI. I couldn’t believe it,” Gasuras said. WritersAccess did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>When ChatGPT set the world on fire a year and a half ago, it sparked a feverish search for ways to catch people trying to pass off AI text as their own writing. A host of startups launched to fill the void through AI detection tools, with names including Copyleaks, GPTZero, Originality.AI, and Winston AI. It makes for a tidy business in a landscape full of AI boogeymen. </p><p>These companies advertise peace of mind, a way to take back control through “proof” and “accountability.” Some advertise accuracy rates as high as 99.98%. But a growing body of experts, studies, and industry insiders argue these tools are far less reliable than their makers promise. There’s no question that AI detectors make frequent mistakes, and innocent bystanders get caught in the crossfire. Countless <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/student-accused-ai-cheating-turnitin-1234747351/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/student-accused-ai-cheating-turnitin-1234747351/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students have been accused of AI plagiarism</a></span>, but a quieter epidemic is happening in the professional world. Some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4602944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4602944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing gigs are drying up thanks to chatbots</a></span>. As people fight over the dwindling field of work, writers are losing jobs over false accusations from AI detectors.</p><p>“This technology doesn’t work the way people are advertising it,” said Bars Juhasz, co-founder of Undetectable AI, which makes tools to help people humanize AI text to sneak it past detection software. “We have a lot of concerns around the reliability of the training process these AI detectors use. These guys are claiming they have 99% accuracy, and based on our work, I think that’s impossible. But even if it’s true, that still means for every 100 people there’s going to be one false flag. We’re talking about people’s livelihoods and their reputations.”</p><h4 id="h1203"><a id=""></a><strong>Safeguard, or snake oil?</strong></h4><p>In general, AI detectors work by spotting the hallmarks of AI penmanship, such as perfect grammar and punctuation. In fact, one of the easiest ways to get your work flagged is to use Grammarly, a tool that checks for spelling and grammatical errors. It even suggests ways to rewrite sentences for clarity using, you guessed it, artificial intelligence. Adding insult to injury, Gizmodo spoke to writers who said they were fired by platforms that required them to use Grammarly. (Gizmodo confirmed the details of these stories, but we are excluding the names of certain freelance platforms because writers signed non-disclosure agreements.)</p><p>Detectors look for more telling factors as well, such as “burstiness.” Human writers are more likely to reuse certain words in clusters or bursts, while AI is more likely to distribute words evenly across a document. AI detectors can also assess “perplexity,” which essentially asks an AI to measure the likelihood that it would have produced a piece of text given the model’s training data. Some companies, such as industry leader Originaility.AI, train their own AI language models specially made to detect the work of other AIs, which are meant to spot patterns that are too complex for the human mind. </p><p>However, none of these techniques are foolproof, and many major institutions have backed away from this class of tools. OpenAI released its own AI detector to quell fears about its products in 2023 but pulled the tool off the market just months later “due to its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/open-ai-chatgpt-ai-text-detector-1850055005&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/open-ai-chatgpt-ai-text-detector-1850055005">low rate of accuracy</a></span>.” The academic world was first to adopt AI detectors, but false accusations pushed a long list of universities to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/23/turnitin_ai_detection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/23/turnitin_ai_detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ban the use of AI detection software</a></span>,, including Vanderbilt, Michigan State, Northwestern, and the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>AI detection companies “are in the business of selling snake oil,” said Debora Weber-Wulff, a professor at the University of Applied Sciences for Engineering and Economics in Berlin, who co-authored a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent paper</a></span> about the effectiveness of AI detection. According to Weber-Wulff, research shows that AI detectors are inaccurate, unreliable, and easy to fool. “People want to believe that there can be some magic software that solves their problems,” she said. But “computer software cannot solve social problems. We have to find other solutions.”</p><p>The companies that make AI detectors say they’re a necessary but imperfect tool in a world inundated by robot-generated text. There’s a significant demand for these services, whether or not they’re effective.</p><p>Alex Cui, chief technology officer for the AI detection company GPTZero, said detectors have meaningful shortcomings, but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. “We see a future where, if nothing is changed, the internet becomes more and more dictated by AI, whether it’s news, peer-reviewed articles, marketing. You don’t even know if the person you’re talking to on social media is real,” Cui said. “We need a solution for confirming knowledge en masse, and determining whether content is high quality, authentic, and of legitimate authorship.”</p><h4 id="h1204"><a id=""></a><strong>A necessary evil?</strong></h4><p>Mark, another Ohio-based copywriter who asked that we withhold his name to avoid professional repercussions, said he had to take work doing maintenance at a local store after an AI detector cost him his job.</p><p>“I got an email saying my most recent article had scored a 95% likelihood of AI generation,” Mark said. “I was in shock. It felt ridiculous that they’d accuse me after working together for three years, long before ChatGPT was available.” </p><p>He tried to push back. Mark sent his client a copy of the Google Doc where he drafted the article, which included timestamps that demonstrated he wrote the document by hand. It wasn’t enough. Mark’s relationship with the writing platform fell apart. He said losing the job cost him 90% of his income.</p><p>“We hear these stories more than we wish we did, and we understand the pain that false positives cause writers when the work they poured their heart and soul into gets falsely accused,” said Jonathan Gillham, CEO of Originality.AI. “We feel like we feel like we’re building a tool to help writers, but we know that at times it does have some consequences.”</p><p>But according to Gillham, the problem is about more than helping writers or providing accountability.“Google is aggressively going after AI spam,” he said. “We’ve heard from companies that had their entire site de-indexed by Google that said they didn’t even know their writers were using AI.” </p><p>It’s true that the internet is being flooded by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/study-junk-news-sites-ad-systems-ai-generated-content-1850578259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/study-junk-news-sites-ad-systems-ai-generated-content-1850578259">low-effort content farms</a></span> that pump out junky AI articles in an effort to game search results, get clicks, and make ad money from those eyeballs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-search-updates-downrank-seo-ai-generated-content-1851309904&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/google-search-updates-downrank-seo-ai-generated-content-1851309904">Google is cracking down on these sites</a></span>, which leads some companies to believe that their websites will be down-ranked if Google detects any AI writing whatsoever. That’s a problem for web-based businesses, and increasingly the No. 1 selling point for AI detectors. Originality promotes itself as a way to “future proof your site on Google” at the top of the list of benefits on its homepage.</p><p>A Google spokesperson said this completely misinterprets the company’s policies. Google, a company that provides AI, said it has no problem with AI content in and of itself. “It’s inaccurate to say Google penalizes websites simply because they may use some AI-generated content,” the spokesperson said. “As we’ve clearly stated, low value content that’s created at scale to manipulate Search rankings is spam, however it is produced. Our automated systems determine what appears in top search results based on signals that indicate if content is helpful and high quality.”</p><h4 id="h1205"><a id=""></a><strong>Mixed messages</strong></h4><p>No one claims AI detectors are perfect, including the companies that make them. But Originality and other AI detectors send mixed messages about how their tools should be used. For example, Gillham said “we advise against the tool being used within academia, and strongly recommend against being used for disciplinary action.” He explained the risk of false positives is too high for students, because they submit a small number of essays throughout a school year, but the volume of work produced by a professional writer means the algorithm has more chances to get it right. However, on one of the company’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://originality.ai/blog/ai-content-detection-in-education&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://originality.ai/blog/ai-content-detection-in-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a></span>, Originality says AI detection is “essential” in the classroom. </p><p>Then there are questions about how the results are presented. Many of the writers Gizmodo spoke to said their clients don’t understand the limitations of AI detectors or even what the results are actually saying. It’s easy to see how someone might be confused: I ran one of my own articles through Originality’s AI detector. The results were “70% Original” and “30% AI.” You might assume that means Originality determined that 30% of the article was written by a chatbot, especially because the tool highlights specific sentences it finds suspect. However, it’s actually a confidence score; Originality is 70% sure a human wrote the text. (I wrote the whole thing myself, but you’ll just have to take my word for it.)</p><p>Then there’s the way the company describes its algorithm. According to Originality, the latest version of its tool has a 98.8% accuracy rate, but Originality also says its false positive rate is 2.8%. If you’ve got your calculator handy, you’ll notice that adds up to more than 100%. Gillham said that’s because these numbers come from two different tests.</p><p>In Originality’s defense, the company provides a detailed explanation of how you should interpret the information right below the results, along with links to more detailed writeups about how to use the tool. It seems that isn’t enough, though. Gizmodo spoke to multiple writers who said they had to argue with clients who misunderstood the Originality tool.</p><p>Originality has published numerous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://originality.ai/blog/ai-content-detection-accuracy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://originality.ai/blog/ai-content-detection-accuracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a></span> and studies about accuracy and other issues, including the dataset and methodology it used to develop and measure its own tools. However, Weber-Wulff at the University of Applied Sciences for Engineering and Economics in Berlin said the details about Originality’s methodology “were not that clear.” </p><p>A number of experts Gizmodo spoke to, such as Juhasz of Undetectable AI, said they had concerns about businesses across the AI detection industry inflating their accuracy rates and misleading their customers. Representatives for GPTZero and Originality AI said their companies are committed to openness and transparency. Both companies said they go out of their way to provide clear information about the limitations and shortcomings of their tools.</p><p>It might feel like being against AI detectors is being on the side of writers, but according to Gillham the opposite is true. “If there are no detectors, then the competition for writing jobs increases and as a result the pay drops,” he said. “Detectors are the difference between a writer being able to do their work, submit content, and get compensated for it, and somebody being able to just copy and paste something from ChatGPT.” </p><p>On the other hand, all of the copywriters Gizmodo spoke to said the AI detectors are the problem. </p><p>“AI is the future. There’s nothing we can do to stop it, but in my opinion that’s not the issue. I can see lots of ways AI can be useful,” Mark said. “It’s these detectors. They are the ones that are saying with utmost certainty that they can detect AI writing, and they’re the ones who are making our clients on edge and paranoid and putting us out of jobs.” </p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/06/12/elixir-v1-17-0-released/">https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/06/12/elixir-v1-17-0-released/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40656747">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <p>Elixir v1.17 has just been released. 🎉</p>

<p>This release introduces set-theoretic types into a handful of language constructs. While there are still <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2023/06/22/type-system-updates-research-dev/">many steps ahead of us</a>, this important milestone already brings benefits to developers in the form of new warnings for common mistakes. This new version also adds support for <a href="https://www.erlang.org/downloads/27">Erlang/OTP 27</a>, the latest and greatest Erlang release. You’ll also find a new calendar-related data type (<code>Duration</code>) and a <code>Date.shift/2</code> function.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="warnings-from-gradual-set-theoretic-types">Warnings from gradual set-theoretic types</h2>

<p>This release introduces gradual set-theoretic types to infer types from patterns and use them to type check programs, enabling the Elixir compiler to find faults and bugs in codebases without requiring changes to existing software. The underlying principles, theory, and roadmap of our work have been outlined in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06391">“The Design Principles of the Elixir Type System” by Giuseppe Castagna, Guillaume Duboc, José Valim</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment, Elixir developers will interact with set-theoretic types only through <strong>warnings</strong> found by the type system. The current implementation models all data types in the language:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>binary()</code>, <code>integer()</code>, <code>float()</code>, <code>pid()</code>, <code>port()</code>, <code>reference()</code> - these
types are indivisible. This means both <code>1</code> and <code>13</code> get the same <code>integer()</code>
type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>atom()</code> - it represents all atoms and it is divisible. For instance, the
atom <code>:foo</code> and <code>:hello_world</code> are also valid (distinct) types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>map()</code> and structs - maps can be “closed” or “open”. Closed maps only allow
the specified keys, such as <code>%{key: atom(), value: integer()}</code>. Open maps
support any other keys in addition to the ones listed and their definition
starts with <code>...</code>, such as <code>%{..., key: atom(), value: integer()}</code>. Structs
are closed maps with the <code>__struct__</code> key.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>tuple()</code>, <code>list()</code>, and <code>function()</code> - currently they are modelled as
indivisible types. The next Elixir versions will also introduce fine-grained
support to them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We focused on <em>atoms</em> and <em>maps</em> on this initial release as they are respectively the simplest and the most complex types representations, so we can stress the performance of the type system and quality of error messages. Modelling these types will also provide the most immediate benefits to Elixir developers. Assuming there is a variable named <code>user</code>, holding a <code>%User{}</code> struct with a <code>address</code> field, Elixir v1.17 will emit the following warnings at compile-time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pattern matching against a map or a struct that does not have the given key,
such as <code>%{adress: ...} = user</code> (notice <code>address</code> vs <code>adress</code>).</p>

<p>Here’s an example of how the warning for accessing a misspelled field of a
struct looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/type-warning-on-struct-field.png" alt="Example of a warning when accessing a mispelled struct field"></p>

<p>Another example, this time it’s a warning for structural comparison across two
<code>Date</code> structs:</p>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/type-warning-on-date-comparison.png" alt="Example of a warning when comparing two structs with &quot;>&quot;"></p>

<p>These warnings also work natively in text editors, as they are standard Elixir
compiler warnings:</p>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/type-warning-in-editor.png" alt="Example of a type warning inline in an editor"></p>

<p>These new warnings will help Elixir developers find bugs earlier and give more
confidence when refactoring code, especially around maps and structs. While
Elixir already emitted some of these warnings in the past, those were discovered
using syntax analysis. The new warnings are more reliable, precise, and with
better error messages. Keep in mind, however, that the Elixir typechecker only
infers types from patterns within the same function at the moment. Analysis from
guards and across function boundaries will be added in future releases. For more
details, see our new <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/gradual-set-theoretic-types.html">reference document on gradual set-theoretic
types</a>.</p>

<p>The type system was made possible thanks to a partnership between
<a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/">CNRS</a> and <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>. The development
work is currently sponsored by <a href="https://www.fresha.com/">Fresha</a>
(<a href="https://www.fresha.com/careers/openings?department=engineering">they are hiring!</a>),
<a href="https://starfish.team/">Starfish*</a>, and <a href="https://dashbit.co/">Dashbit</a>.</p>



<p>This release adds support for Erlang/OTP 27 and drops support for Erlang/OTP 24.
We recommend Elixir developers to migrate to Erlang/OTP 26 or later, especially
on Windows. Support for WERL (a graphical user interface for the Erlang terminal
on Windows) will be removed in Elixir v1.18.</p>

<p>You can read more about Erlang/OTP 27 in <a href="https://www.erlang.org/downloads/27">their release
announcement</a>. The bits that are
particularly interesting for Elixir developers are the addition of a <a href="https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc3/lib/stdlib-6.0/doc/html/json.html"><code>json</code>
module</a>
and process labels (<code>proc_lib:set_label/1</code>). The latter will also be available
in this Elixir release as <code>Process.set_label/1</code>.</p>

<h2 id="new-duration-data-type-and-shifting-functions">New <code>Duration</code> data type and shifting functions</h2>

<p>This Elixir version introduces the <code>Duration</code> data type and APIs to shift dates,
times, and date times by a given duration, considering different calendars and
time zones.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>iex</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>shift</span><span>(</span><span>~D[2016-01-31]</span><span>,</span> <span>month:</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>~D[2016-03-31]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We chose the name <em>“shift”</em> for this operation (instead of “add”) since working
with durations does not obey properties such as <strong>associativity</strong>. For instance,
adding one month and then one month does not give the same result as adding two
months:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>iex</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>~D[2016-01-31]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>shift</span><span>(</span><span>month:</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>shift</span><span>(</span><span>month:</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>~D[2016-03-29]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Still, durations are essential for building intervals, recurring events, and
modelling scheduling complexities found in the world around us. For <code>DateTime</code>s,
Elixir will correctly deal with time zone changes (such as Daylight Saving
Time). However, provisions are also available in case you want to surface
conflicts, such as shifting to a wall clock that does not exist, because the
clock has been moved forward by one hour. See <code>DateTime.shift/2</code> for examples.</p>

<p>Finally, we added a new <code>Kernel.to_timeout/1</code> function, which helps developers
normalize durations and integers to a timeout used by many APIs—like <code>Process</code>,
<code>GenServer</code>, and more. For example, to send a message after one hour, you can
now write:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>send_after</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>:wake_up</span><span>,</span> <span>to_timeout</span><span>(</span><span>hour:</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="learn-more">Learn more</h2>

<p>Here are other notable changes in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are new <code>Keyword.intersect/2,3</code> functions to mirror the equivalent in
the <code>Map</code> module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new Mix profiler was added, <code>mix profile.tprof</code>, which lets you use the
new <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/tools/tprof.html">tprof</a>
profiler released with Erlang/OTP 27. This profiler leads to the
soft-deprecation of <code>mix profile.cprof</code> and <code>mix profile.eprof</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We added <code>Kernel.is_non_struct_map/1</code>, a new guard to help with the common
pitfall of matching on <code>%{}</code>, which also successfully matches structs (as
they are maps underneath).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elixir’s Logger now formats
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_statem.html"><code>gen_statem</code></a>
reports and includes Erlang/OTP 27 <em>process labels</em> in logger events.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Who would have thought that Raspberry Pi, the maker of the tiny, cheap, single-board computers, would become a public company? Yet, this is exactly what’s <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happening</a>: Raspberry Pi <a href="https://investors.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced its IPO</a> on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday morning at £2.80 per share, valuing it at £542 million, or $690 million at today’s exchange rate.</p>

<p>Shortly after that, the company’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6419f805-01e8-4900-9da7-7e4fc8504a81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shares jumped a nice 32% to £3.70</a>. It means that Raspberry Pi could end up raising more than $200 million during its IPO process.</p>

	
	


<p>Retail investors can’t buy Raspberry Pi shares just yet, as only certain institutional shareholders can trade the company’s shares right now. Retail investors will be able to buy and sell shares starting on Friday.</p>

	
	


<p>This listing is also a win for the London stock market. Deliveroo and Wise both trade in London, but many U.K. tech companies choose to go public in the U.S., as the stock markets there are more liquid.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi is mostly known for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/raspberry-pi-5/">tiny computers</a> that can be programmed to perform all sorts of tasks without spending too much money and requiring too much power. These ARM-based computers became particularly popular among tech hobbyists who wanted to create media servers, retro game consoles, interactive dashboards, robotics projects and more.</p>

<p>More recently, many industrial companies have started integrating the Raspberry Pi in their devices and facilities. The company <a href="https://investors.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that the industrial and embedded segment represents 72% of its sales.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi has sold 60 million units since its inception. In 2023 alone, Raspberry Pi generated $266 million in revenue and $66 million in gross profit.</p>

	
	



<p>Raspberry Pi Ltd, the public company, is the commercial subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The Foundation says it wants to make it easier for people to learn coding through a low-cost, programmable computer. It also remains the main shareholder of Raspberry Pi Ltd.</p>

	
	


<p>Other strategic shareholders in the company include ARM and Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation, a subsidiary of Sony that makes image sensors for smartphones and other components. ARM previously said it intended to increase its stake in Raspberry Pi via the public listing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Ask most venture-backed founders why they get 10x more equity than employee #1, 100x more equity than employee #5, and 1000x more equity than employee #15, and you'll get the same answer: "I'M TAKING SO MUCH RISK, IT'S SO HARD TO START A COMPANY, I MADE A BIG MOVE!!!" And then you'll ask, "but why are you yelling?”</p><p>The narrative of the founder's risk is a cornerstone of Silicon Valley's mythology. Founders are celebrated for leaving stable jobs and pouring their lives into an “uncertain” and “high-risk” venture. This mythos justifies the enormous equity stakes founders hold compared to early employees who take very similar risks by joining an unproven startup.</p><p>However, there's a lesser-known aspect of the startup ecosystem that significantly shifts the risk landscape: <strong>founder liquidity</strong>.</p><h3 id="my-experience-in-early-stage-startups">My Experience in Early Stage Startups</h3><p>Being a software engineer who has a strong preference for creativity, problem-solving, and autonomy I realized during college that very big and slow companies were not for me. I joined a startup straight out of college as employee number 8 and immediately knew I made the right choice. My skills were improving week over week, I was responsible for shipping important features and was given a lot of responsibility right out of the gate.</p><p>I eventually got pretty good at choosing strong founders to join and building great products from zero to one which in turn spawned a cycle of joining a team early, finding success, the company gets too big, and then I leave to do it again elsewhere. I have been an early or first engineer at five different companies and have had three liquidity events in a 9-year career.</p><h3 id="the-reality-of-founder-risk-liquidity">The Reality of Founder Risk &amp; Liquidity</h3><p><strong>Founder liquidity</strong> refers to the practice where founders sell a portion of their shares during a new funding round. This allows them to "take chips off the table," securing personal financial stability while continuing to build the company with a fresh influx of venture capital. This practice is often kept under wraps, discussed in closed boardrooms, and only briefly mentioned in investor updates. You would really only know this happened if you were a founder, investor, or had direct access to the cap table.</p><p>Why is it a secret that founders get liquidity in many venture rounds? Because it undermines the narrative of the founder who is "all-in." The story of the founder who mortgaged their house and lived on ramen noodles for years is compelling. It garners admiration and sympathy, attracting top talent willing to work for lower salaries in exchange for a piece of the pie. If it were widely known that founders could de-risk their financial position while their employees remained all-in, it might change how startups are perceived and valued.</p><p>This is a graph of cash compensation over time modeled off of a real scenario that happened over 4 years. This level of founder liquidity is fairly common.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1056" height="547" srcset="https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 600w, https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 1000w, https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The founder in this scenario was offered $400,000 of liquidity at Series A and $750,000 at Series B and encouraged to do so by their board of investors to de-risk their own life. Liquidity was not offered to any employees and the fact that this happened at all was only revealed to people on the cap table.</p><p>Another more well-known and extreme example was in the case of Adam Neumann the founder of WeWork - Neumann was able to cash out over 2B in secondary meanwhile not a single WeWork employee was able to capitalize on their equity stakes. They were told internally how much their shares were worth at each raise, and the hype surrounding each raise continued as WeWork sky-rocketed in valuation. Neumann was smart to de-risk his position by selling as much secondary as possible during the ascent but only attempted to structure a tender offer for non-founding employees in 2019 <strong><em>nine years</em></strong> after WeWork was created. That tender offer with SoftBank fell through and employees were left with absolutely nothing. (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/04/13/wework-employees-feel-abandoned-and-angry-as-softbank-ditches-its-3-billion-buyout-offer?ref=stefantheard.com">source</a>)</p><p>The part about these stories that feels unfair is not that the founders are getting liquidity - it's that they are the <em>only ones</em> getting liquidity. There are other stories like <a href="https://techfundingnews.com/unravelling-virtual-dreams-the-rise-and-fall-of-hopin/?ref=stefantheard.com" rel="noreferrer">Hopin</a> where the founder takes tens or hundreds of millions in secondary just to later sell the company for less than the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/venture-capital/sections/liquidation-preference?ref=stefantheard.com" rel="noreferrer">liquidation preference</a> stack and leave the employees with a grand total of zero dollars for their equity.</p><h3 id="right-sizing-perception">Right-Sizing Perception</h3><p>There are a lot of odd perceptions surrounding founder liquidity:</p><ol><li>Investors and founders both tend to think that if employees knew founders were getting liquidity that that would negatively impact employee morale (<strong>it wouldn’t</strong>)</li><li>Founders often feel guilty that they are getting liquidity (<strong>they shouldn’t</strong>)</li><li>Investors think that the liquidity could taint the perception of future investors negatively (<strong>it doesn’t</strong>)</li><li>Investors, founders, and employees all believe that founders are taking more risk than early employees (<strong>this isn’t true once founders have exclusive access to liquidity</strong>)</li></ol><p>When I found out that my founders got access to liquidity during our series A my first thought was “That is awesome, they deserve it” my second thought was “I wonder why employees didn’t get access to any liquidity?” and then my third thought was “Is this a secret? It seems like a secret. That’s weird”. I was the only employee who knew about it because I had incidental access to the cap table.</p><p>Once I found out I was curious if I was reading it correctly so I immediately went to one of the founders and asked “Did you get a bit of liquidity during the series A?”. His reaction went from surprise to confusion and then he said “Yeah I did, a little bit”. I said “Wow that is awesome, congrats! It has to be nice to be able to backfill some salary after grinding for a couple of years” and he said, “Yeah, definitely.”. I could sense relief after chatting about it with him, almost like he felt better knowing that I knew about it. I never felt negative, had low morale, or anything of the sort, I trusted in my founding team and I was happy for them. If it were the case that I was lied to about it, then I would be upset and have low morale but that would be a result of being lied to - not liquidity access.</p><h3 id="balancing-the-scales">Balancing the Scales</h3><p>As of 4 months ago I left a very successful stealth startup (which grew to 40M in ARR in two years) to become a founder and that is when it clicked - I expected to feel stressed, pressured, and the weight of all of the risk I was taking. What actually happened is that I realized I could have been a founder 6 years ago and I would have been taking a similar amount of risk as I did then as the first employee at <a href="http://tackle.io/?ref=stefantheard.com">tackle.io</a>.</p><p>My intention now, as a founder, is to balance the risk for early employees by being transparent, more generous with equity, and only taking liquidity if I can also offer it to employees as well.</p><ul><li>Our employee option pool is 20% which is double the average</li><li>We have a 3-month equity cliff which is 9 months sooner than the average.</li><li>We allow employees to exercise options up to 10 years after they leave instead of 90 days.</li><li>Our equity packages vest over 3 years instead of the industry standard 4-year period.</li></ul><p>These changes are great, but nowhere near enough. In my view, every internal announcement of a new round at venture-backed companies should be accompanied by education and transparency around liquidity. Without transparency, none of the misperceptions have a chance of going away. The net result is that employees have a fundamentally misguided idea of the risk landscape as it shifts beneath their feet. </p><div><p>If you work at a venture-backed company the next time a round is announced ask if the founders took any liquidity. Do it anonymously if you have to. This question should become so common that founders and investors become transparent by default. If they say no, great - no change to risk profiles. If they say yes - great, employees are operating with the same information as the founders and investors. This levels the playing field and allows employees to assess if they are still in a lower risk bucket than the founders, or if they are now taking significantly more risk than the founders.</p><p>If employees realize they are taking more risk than the founders, maybe they'll ask for more compensation, maybe they'll congratulate the founders and move on with their day, maybe they'll start yelling: "I'M TAKING SO MUCH RISK, IT'S SO HARD TO BUILD A COMPANY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY!!!". And maybe they're right.</p></div><p><em>(special thanks to anu, jessica, erika, laura, derek, and minh for reading drafts and giving  feedback on this)</em></p>

<p>When T-Mobile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/">announced price hikes</a> of up to $5 per line on older smartphone plans last month, many customers were shocked because of T-Mobile's years-old promise that their price would never rise as long as they stuck with the same plan.</p>
<p>"New rule: Only YOU should have the power to change what you pay," T-Mobile said in a <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next">January 2017 announcement</a> of its "Un-contract" promise for T-Mobile One plans. "Now, T-Mobile One customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it. T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile One plan."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the promise wasn't as simple as T-Mobile claimed it to be in that press release. T-Mobile also published an FAQ that answered the question, "What happens if you do raise the price of my T-Mobile One service?" It explained that the only guarantee is T-Mobile will pay your final month's bill if the price goes up and you decide to cancel.</p>
<p>The FAQ stated, "The Un-contract is our commitment that only you can change what you pay and we mean it! To show just how serious we are we have committed to pay your final month's recurring service charges if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave. Just let us know within 60 days."</p>
<p>The FAQ link now just redirects to the T-Mobile home page but the Internet Archive has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180124073308/https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/tmo_one_faqs#uncontractpromise">capture</a> of the FAQ from January 2018. While we couldn't find an earlier capture of the page, a <a href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/t-mobile-un-carrier-next.760027/#post-5636154">discussion</a> on an Android Central forum shows that the text mentioned above was noticed by some customers in January 2017.</p>
<p>The Un-contract was also previously <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/uncontract-carrier-freedom">applied to T-Mobile Simple Choice plans</a> starting in March 2015. The 2015 announcement said the Un-contract would be enabled automatically with "no crazy strings, no hoops to jump through, no hidden fees, no BS."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The recent price increases <a href="https://tmo.report/2024/05/confirmed-t-mobile-is-raising-prices-on-some-legacy-plans/">reportedly</a> affect Simple Choice plans as well as other packages, but we haven't been able to find any language from 2015 that acknowledges an exception that lets T-Mobile raise prices on Simple Choice. We asked T-Mobile several questions today and will update this article if it provides more information.</p>
<h2>T-Mobile disputes complaint to FCC</h2>
<p>T-Mobile is pointing to the above caveat to defend itself against at least one complaint filed to the Federal Communications Commission after the recent price hike. Yesterday, a Reddit user and T-Mobile subscriber <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1dd1x5t/did_anyone_else_get_the_following_letter_from/">posted a letter</a> in which T-Mobile asked the FCC to close the complaint filed by the user.</p>
<p>T-Mobile's response to the FCC and the user who complained said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regarding these changes, we are aware some customers have inquired about T-Mobile's <em>Un-contract</em> and <em>Price Lock</em>. With <em>Un-contract</em>, T-Mobile committed to its customers that if we were to increase prices and customers chose to leave as a result, T-Mobile would pay the customers' final month's recurring service charge, as long as we are notified within 60 days. Consistent with this commitment, customers who activated on an eligible rate plan between January 5, 2017 and April 27, 2022, can request to have their final month's qualifying service charge reimbursed if their rate plan increases and they choose to cancel service. Customers simply need to request reimbursement within 60 days of the price increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>The T-Mobile response goes on to describe the more recent "Price Lock" guarantee that was offered starting in April 2022 and discontinued in January 2024. The T-Mobile response said that customer lines covered by Price Lock are exempt from the recent price increases:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for customers with concerns about T-Mobile's <em>Price Lock</em> guarantee, it is important to note that customers with <em>Price Lock</em> are not impacted by the change. On April 28, 2022, T-Mobile began offering <em>Price Lock</em> on new account activations on qualifying rate plans. For customers who activated on a qualifying plan between April 28, 2022 and January 17, 2024, <em>Price Lock</em> guarantees that accounts activated with a qualifying rate plan, within the enrollment period, would not be subject to a price increase, so long as the account remained in good standing and the customer remained on the qualifying rate plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>T-Mobile's response to the complaint also said that customers who switch plans lose their Price Lock guarantee.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://frereit.de/aes_gcm/">https://frereit.de/aes_gcm/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40653125">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="an-overview-of-this-article-tldr">An overview of this article (TL;DR)</h2><p>TL;DR: AES-GCM is great, as long as every nonce (mnemonic: <strong>n</strong>umber used <strong>once</strong>) is truly unique. Once a nonce is reused, AES-GCM completely falls apart.</p><p>If you’ve ever worked with AES-GCM, you may have heard that reusing a nonce can lead to catastrophic security failures. In this post, we will look at how exactly all security guarantees of AES-GCM can be broken when a nonce is reused even once.</p><p>First, we’ll quickly go over AES, then explain AES-GCM in detail. We’ll then derive some formulas for the AES-GCM authentication tags and see how we can authenticate any message we want as soon as a nonce is reused.</p><p>This post will be somewhat math heavy, especially as we get to the nonce reuse attack. I’ll try my best to explain any concepts not covered by high-school math, and I’ll skip over any details of the algorithms, as these are best understood by reading the original papers.</p><h2 id="aes">AES</h2><p>If you’re reading this, chances are you know what <abbr title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</abbr> is. It is the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm and is almost always the symmetric cipher used when communicating over HTTPS.</p><p>AES is a block cipher, which means it encrypts and decrypts data in fixed-size blocks. The block size for AES is 128 bits, which is 16 bytes. This means that given a key, the AES algorithm can be used to transform a 128-bit block of data into another 128-bit block of data, and back again. We arbitrarily call this process encryption and decryption, respectively. There’s no intrinsic property of AES that assigns one direction to encryption and the other to decryption. It is important to understand that AES is a bijective function, meaning <em>any</em> 128-bit block of data can be encrypted into a 128-bit block of data, and that <em>any</em> 128-bit block of data is a valid ciphertext that can be decrypted again. This is a fundamental property of block ciphers and important to understand.</p><p>Because every single possible block of 128-bit data can be decrypted using AES, it is absolutely incorrect to assume that just because you <em>can</em> decrypt some ciphertext, that it was indeed encrypted using the key you have. Anyone “in the middle” of a transmission can just replace the ciphertext, even if they don’t have the key, and AES won’t tell you that that’s happened.</p><p>There are three key sizes you can choose from when using AES: 128, 192, and 256. The key size changes some internal parameters of the algorithm, but the basic structure is the same. In this blog post, we will only be considering AES-128 but the same principles apply to the other key sizes as well, and for that matter, to any block cipher.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://frereit.de/img/aes/aes-block-cipher.svg" alt="AES is a bijective function parameterize by a key" data-ffwidth="51%" id="aes-block-cipher"><figcaption>AES is a bijective function parameterized by a key</figcaption></figure><p>It is important to understand that AES-128 is just that, a cipher that encrypts and decrypts a single 128-bit block of data. AES does not specify how to encrypt multiple blocks of data using a single key, nor does it authenticate the data. It is a simple bijective function parameterized by a key, nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>You can play with the following widget to see how AES-128 works. The widget allows you to encrypt and decrypt a single block of data using a key of your choice.</p><p>In summary, we can treat AES-128 as a simple black box that encrypts and decrypts 128-bit blocks of data using a key. It is a building block that can be used to build more complex cryptographic systems, but it is not a complete cryptographic system in itself.</p><h2 id="gcm">GCM</h2><p>When using a block cipher, we want to be able to encrypt arbitrary amounts of data, and we want to ensure that the encrypted data cannot be tampered with. This is where modes of operation come into play. A mode of operation is a way to use a block cipher to encrypt and authenticate data. There are many different modes of operation, but in this post, we will focus on the Galois/Counter Mode, or GCM for short.</p><p>GCM is a method for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD). “Authenticated encryption” means that the mode of operation allows us to validate that a given ciphertext was indeed generated using the secret key, and that it has not been modified. This is called “authenticating” the ciphertext and is essential for secure communication. Without it, a bad actor could modify the ciphertext and the recipient would not be able to detect it, leading to garbled plaintext in the best case, and a huge security issue in the worst case.</p><p>The second part, “with associated data”, means that we can also authenticate additional data that is not encrypted. This is almost a byproduct of the way GCM works, but it is a very useful feature. For example, when sending a message, we might want to encrypt the message but keep the sender in plaintext. Think of a letter you’re mailing, where the contents are “protected” but the sender is plainly visible. By using AES-GCM, we are able to authenticate not only the ciphertext but also the sender so that the recipient can be sure that the message was indeed sent by the sender and that it is intended for them, even if the sender is not part of the ciphertext.</p><p>In this post, we’ll look at the two parts of GCM (encryption and authentication) seperately. We’ll start by seeing how encryption works with AES-GCM, where the nonce comes into play, and how the encryption breaks when a nonce is reused. After that, we’ll dive into the authentication part and see how it can also be broken when a nonce is reused.</p><h3 id="gcm-encryption">GCM encryption</h3><p>GCM, like all modes of operation, provides a way to encrypt and decrypt arbitrary amounts of data using the underlying block cipher.</p><p>To do this, GCM uses the block cipher (in our case, AES-128) to generate a sequence of random-looking bits that are as long as the plaintext. This is called the keystream and it can be generated deterministically using the key (and a nonce, which we will get to in a bit), which means although it looks random, the recipient of a message in possesion of the key is able to calculate the same keystream. To encrypt the plaintext, we take the plaintext and XOR it with the keystream. XOR (⊕) is a simple operation that takes any two bits and returns 1 if exactly one of the bits is 1, and 0 otherwise. It, conveniently, is its own inverse. This means that if we generate by XORing the plaintext and keystream (<code>ciphertext = plaintext ⊕ keystream</code>), we can decrypt the ciphertext, we generate the keystream used during the encryption and XOR it with the cipertext we received: <code>ciphertext ⊕ keystream = (plaintext ⊕ keystream) ⊕ keystream = plaintext</code>. So, technically, in GCM, we don’t actually encrypt the plaintext using the block cipher, we encrypt it using the keystream. The block cipher is only used to generate the keystream.</p><p>However, there’s a problem: Let’s assume for a moment that we have two plaintexts <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> and we want to encrypt them both using the same key. If the keystream was only generated using the key, then the keystream for <code>p1</code> would be the same as the keystream for <code>p2</code>. The ciphertexts would then be <code>c1 = p1 ⊕ keystream</code> and <code>c2 = p2 ⊕ keystream</code>. At first glance, this seems fine, but it is not. If an attacker knows the plaintext <code>p1</code> and the ciphertext <code>c1</code>, then they can compute the keystream by XORing <code>p1</code> and <code>c1</code> together (<code>keystream = p1 ⊕ c1</code>) and then decrypt <code>c2</code> by XORing <code>c2</code> with the keystream (<code>p2 = c2 ⊕ keystream = c2 ⊕ (p1 ⊕ c1)</code>). This is a huge security issue, as it allows an attacker to decrypt any ciphertext they have the plaintext for, without knowing the key. This is why we need to introduce a <strong>nonce</strong>.</p><p>A nonce is a random number transfered along with each ciphertext that may never be reused under the same key. We use the nonce as an additional input to the block cipher when generating the keystream so that for each ciphertext, the keystream is different. This means that even if an attacker knows the plaintext and ciphertext for one message, they cannot use that information to decrypt any other ciphertext. When a nonce is reused, however, the keystream is the same, and an attacker can use the same technique as above to decrypt any ciphertext that was encrypted using the same nonce.</p><p>Let’s take a look at an example! First, we choose a nonce and generate a keystream using the key from earlier and the chosen nonce:</p><p>Notice how <code>c2 ⊕ p1 ⊕ c1</code> is the same as <code>p2</code> as long as <code>p1</code> is long enough? This is the security issue we were talking about. If the nonce is reused, an attacker only needs a single pair of plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt any other ciphertext that was encrypted using the same key and nonce. Additionally, by obtaining the keystream, an attacker is able to create their own ciphertext for any plaintext they want, simply by XORing the plaintext with the recovered keystream. Therefore, encryption is trivially broken when a nonce is reused.</p><h4 id="keystream-generation">Keystream generation</h4><p>Although not necessary for understanding the security issue, let’s look at how the keystream is generated in GCM. In GCM, we start off with some initial block of 16 bytes called <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> that is calculated from the given nonce. Incrementing this block means taking the last 4 bytes and interpreting them as a 32-bit big-endian integer and incrementing that integer by 1. We start off by incrementing the initial block and then encrypting it using AES-128. This will gives us 16 bytes of output, which we then use as the first 16 bytes of the keystream. We then increment the block again and encrypt it again to get the next 16 bytes of keystream, and so on. This process is repeated until the entire plaintext is encrypted. Note that if the plaintext falls short of a full 16 bytes, we simply only take as many bytes as we need from the keystream instead of the full 16 bytes. This process of “counting up” and encrypting the resulting block to get the keystream is the “Counter Mode” part of Galois/Counter Mode.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://frereit.de/img/aes/gcm-ctr.svg" alt="GCM uses a simple counter to generate consecutive keystream blocks" data-ffwidth="99%" id="gcm-ctr-mode"><figcaption>GCM uses a simple counter to generate consecutive keystream blocks</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, the generated keystream only depends on <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub>, which in turn only depends on the nonce, and the key. This means that if the nonce is reused across different messages, the keystream will be the same for both messages, and an attacker can use the technique as above to decrypt any ciphertext that was encrypted using the same nonce.</p><h5 id="ysub0sub-calculation"><code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> calculation</h5><p>I told you before that <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> is calculated from the nonce, but I didn’t tell you how. In the simple case, the supplied nonce is 12 bytes long (e.g. <code>deadbeefcafeaffebadbabe0</code>). In that case, <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> is the nonce with a 4-byte big endian 1 appended to it, so <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> = nonce || 0x00000001</code>. If the nonce is not exactly 12 bytes long, we generate <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> by passing it through a kind-of hash function called <code>GHASH</code>. We’ll look at <code>GHASH</code> in more detail later but for now, just imagine that <code>GHASH</code> takes a nonce of any length and spits out a 16-byte block that we can use as <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub>.</p><p>The generated <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> is then used to generate the keystream as described above.</p><h4 id="recap">Recap</h4><p>We’ve now seen how the encryption part of GCM works. We’ve seen that the nonce is used together with the key to generate a keystream that is then used to encrypt the plaintext. We’ve also seen that if the nonce is reused, an attacker can use a single known plaintext-ciphertext pair to decrypt any other ciphertext that was encrypted using the same nonce. Once an attacker has obtained the keystream, they can also use it to encrypt any plaintext they want, so there is no guarantee that the plaintext was indeed generated by the sender in possession of the key.</p><h3 id="gcm-authentication">GCM authentication</h3><p>The second and equally important part of GCM is the authentication. This means that we are able to validate that a given ciphertext was indeed generated using the secret key, and that it has not been modified. At the risk of repeating myself, remember that the encryption part of GCM only ensures that the ciphertext cannot be decrypted without the key, but it does not ensure that is has not been tampared with. The encryption operation is a simple XOR operation, so if an attacker changes a single bit in the ciphertext from a <code>0</code> to a <code>1</code>, the corresponding bit in the plaintext will also change. This means that even though the ciphertext cannot be decrypted without the key, an attacker can still modify the ciphertext and the recipient would not be able to detect it. With a single known plaintext-ciphertext pair, an attacker is even able to recover the entire keystream and thus encrypt any plaintext they want. Hence, we need to authenticate the ciphertext.</p><h4 id="galois-field-arithmetic">Galois field arithmetic</h4><p>A core part of the authentication in GCM is the use of Galois field arithmetic, the other part of Galois/Counter Mode. Galois field arithmetic is just a fancy name for a kind of maths where we don’t have infinite numbers like in the real numbers, but instead we have a finite number of elements. This is why sometimes Galois fields are also called “finite fields”.</p><h5 id="gf2"><code>GF(2)</code></h5><p>The simplest example of a Galois field is the field of integers modulo <code>2</code>. This means that we only have two elements, <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. Forget all other numbers, only <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> exist when we’re talking about <code>GF(2)</code>. Because this is a new number system, we have to definie how mathematical operations work in it. If no other numbers exist, what is <code>1 + 1</code>?</p><p>We <em>define</em> addition of numbers in these fields to be the result of adding the numbers in the real numbers and then taking the result modulo <code>2</code>. The modulo operation simply takes the remainder of a whole number divison. For example, in the real numbers, <code>5 = 2 * 2 + 1</code>, so <code>5 = 1 (mod 2)</code>. Let’s look at how this looks in an addition table:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>+</th><th>0</th><th>1</th></tr><tr><th>0</th><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>1</th><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, <code>0 + 0 = 0</code>, <code>0 + 1 = 1</code>, <code>1 + 0 = 1</code>, and <code>1 + 1 = 0</code>. You might recognize this as the XOR operation that we used to encrypt the plaintext with the keystream. This is no coincidence, as the XOR operation is exactly the addition operation in the Galois field of integers modulo <code>2</code>. This means that when we XOR two numbers together, we can also think of it as adding them together in the Galois field of integers modulo <code>2</code>. To make it clear that we are working in a different number system, we don’t use the <code>+</code> symbol for addition in Galois fields, but instead use the <code>⊕</code> symbol. You might have seen this symbol as the XOR operation, and now you know that it is exactly the same as addition in the Galois field of integers modulo <code>2</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at how we <em>define</em> multiplication in the Galois field of integers modulo <code>2</code>. We define it to be the result of multiplying the numbers in the real numbers and then taking the result modulo <code>2</code>. Let’s look at how this looks in a multiplication table:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>⋅</th><th>0</th><th>1</th></tr><tr><th>0</th><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>1</th><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Again, you might notice that this is exactly the same as the AND operation. The result of multiplying two numbers in <code>GF(2)</code> is <code>1</code> if and only if both numbers are <code>1</code>. This means that when we AND two numbers together, we can also think of it as multiplying them together in the Galois field of integers modulo <code>2</code>. Analogously to the addition operation, where we use the <code>⊕</code> symbol, we use the <code>⨂</code> symbol to represent multiplication in Galois fields.</p><h5 id="gf2sup128sup"><code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code></h5><p>We can also define Galois fields with more than two elements. For example, we can define a Galois field with <code>2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup> elements. This means that we have <code>2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup> different numbers, which is just to say that we use 128 bits (16 bytes!) to represent each number. You might already notice that this is exactly the same as the block size of AES. As you’ll see later, this is no coincidence, because we’ll start interpreting the 128-bit blocks of data as elements represented by numbers in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code>.</p><p>First, though, we need to define addition and multiplication in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> just like we did for <code>GF(2)</code>. One way to think of elements in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> is as polynomials with coefficients in <code>GF(2)</code>. This is just a definition, we have this set of <code>2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup> things, and we say that each of the things corresponds to some polynomial. This means that we can represent each element in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> as a polynomial of degree at most <code>127</code> with coefficients in <code>GF(2)</code>. So, some elements of <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> can be represented like so:</p><ul><li><code>0 ⋅ x</code><sup><code>0</code></sup><code> = 0</code>.</li><li><code>1 ⋅ x</code><sup><code>0</code></sup><code> = 1</code>.</li><li><code>x</code><sup><code>4</code></sup><code> + x</code>.</li><li><code>x</code><sup><code>127</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>126</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>125</code></sup>.</li></ul><p>Because we’ve defined the the coefficients to be in <code>GF(2)</code>, they are all either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. Another way to look at this is that <code>x</code><sup><code>i</code></sup> is either in the polynomial or it is not, for each <code>i</code> from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code>. This means that we can represent each element in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> as a 128-bit value, where each bit tells us if a certain power of <code>x</code> is in the polynomial or not. Different standards use different ways to assign the bits to the powers of <code>x</code> but the GCM standard uses a kind-of reversed order, so that the most significant bit of the 128-bit value corresponds to <code>x</code><sup><code>0</code></sup>, the next bit to <code>x</code><sup><code>1</code></sup>, and so on, up to the least significant bit corresponding to <code>x</code><sup><code>127</code></sup>. Let’s encode the previous polynomials in this way as hexadecimal values:</p><ul><li><code>0</code> is <code>00000000000000000000000000000000</code> because no powers of <code>x</code> are in the polynomial.</li><li><code>1</code> is <code>80000000000000000000000000000000</code> because <code>x</code><sup><code>0</code></sup> is in the polynomial, which is the most significant bit.</li><li><code>x</code><sup><code>4</code></sup><code> + x</code> is <code>48000000000000000000000000000000</code>.</li><li><code>x</code><sup><code>127</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>126</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>125</code></sup> is <code>00000000000000000000000000000007</code>.</li></ul><p>We now have a way of representing each of the <code>2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup> elements of <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> as a polynomial. To define addition, we use the polynomial representation, which already has a well-defined addition operation. Remember, all coefficients are in <code>GF(2)</code>, so we add them together using the addition operation we defined earlier, for example <code>(x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x) + (x</code><sup><code>4</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + 1) = x</code><sup><code>4</code></sup><code> + x + 1</code>. The result is a polynomial of degree at most <code>127</code> with coefficients in <code>GF(2)</code>, so it is a valid element in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code>. Note that if a power of <code>x</code> appears in both polynomials, it will be cancelled out, so for example <code>(x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) + (x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) = 0</code>. If it appears in exactly one of the polynomials, it will be in the result. This is exactly the same as the XOR operation, so we can again think of addition in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> as the XOR operation on the 128-bit values representing the polynomials.</p><p>You can try it out for yourself here. Enter two polynomials or their hexadecimal representations and see the result of adding them together:</p><p>Hopefully you’re able to convince yourself that adding these polynomials is exactly the same as XORing the 128-bit values representing them. This is the addition operation in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s take a look at multiplication. Multiplication, just like addition, works by interpreting the field elements as polynomials and then multiplying the polynomials together. For example, <code>(x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x) ⋅ (x</code><sup><code>4</code></sup><code> + 1) = x</code><sup><code>6</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>5</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x</code>. We get this result by multiplying all the terms in the first polynomial with all the terms in the second polynomial and then adding the results together. In this case, the result is a polynomial with degree <code>6</code> and coefficients in <code>GF(2)</code>, so it is a valid element in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code>. However, look at what happens when we multiply <code>x</code><sup><code>127</code></sup> by <code>x</code>: <code>x</code><sup><code>127</code></sup><code> ⋅ x = x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup>. This poses a problem because we defined <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> to have elements of degree at most <code>127</code> but this polynomial is of degree <code>128</code>. So <code>x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup> is not an element which we can represent as a 128-bit block of data.
Instead, we need to add another step to the multiplication operation:</p><p>After we multiply the polynomials together, we divide the result by a special polynomial called the “reduction polynomial” and take the remainder as the result instead. The reduction polynomial must be defined along with the field. It is an irreducible polynomial, which means that it isn’t the product of any two non-trivial polynomials (like how prime numbers aren’t the product of any two other numbers, except one and itself) and has degree 128, so that the remainder of a division operation is always of degree at most 127. The GCM standard defines the reduction polynomial to be <code>x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>7</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x + 1</code> for the field <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> used in GCM.</p><p>In this case, where we are trying to reduce <code>x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup>, it’s actually quite easy to see that dividing <code>x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup> by <code>x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>7</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x + 1</code> will result in a remainder of <code>x</code><sup><code>7</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x + 1</code> because <code>x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup> fits exactly once into the reduction polynomial, leaving a remainder of <code>x</code><sup><code>7</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x + 1</code>. Multiplying <code>x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup> by <code>1</code> and adding the remainder confirms this:</p><p><code>1 ⋅ (x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>) + (x</code><sup><code>7</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x + 1) = x</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>7</code></sup><code> + x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + x + 1</code>.</p><p>For more complex cases, we need to use polynomial long division to divide the result by the reduction polynomial and take the remainder as the result. This is a bit more involved, but it is exactly the same as long division with real numbers, just with polynomials instead. I won’t go into the details here because we can just let the computer do the work for us, but if you’re interested, you can look up polynomial long division on the internet and try to apply it to coefficients in <code>GF(2)</code> instead of real numbers<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>If we look at the multiplication in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> from the perspective of the 128-bit blocks of data, instead of the polynomials, the operation is sometimes referred to as “Carry-less multiplication”, because it corresponds to the multiplication of the 128-bit blocks of data, where all carry values are discarded instead of propagated during the multiplication. In this post, we’ll stick to the polynomial representation, but it’s good to know that the operation is also called “Carry-less multiplication” or “CLMUL”, especially if you’re looking at the AES-NI instruction set of modern CPUs. The symbol for multiplication in Galois fields is <code>⨂</code>, so we’ll use that in the following figures.</p><p>Let’s go through another example. Enter two polynomials and see the result of multiplying them together:</p><p>That covers the basics of Galois field arithmetic. We’ve seen that we can add and multiply elements in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> just like we can add and multiply real numbers, but with the added step of reducing the result by a reduction polynomial. Importantly, we can also think of addition as the XOR operation, which is why it can also be represented by the <code>⊕</code> symbol. Multiplication is represented by the <code>⨂</code> symbol in the following figures.</p><h4 id="ghash">GHASH</h4><p>Now that we have the basics of Galois field arithmetic down, we can look at the <code>GHASH</code> function. <code>GHASH</code> is a function defined in the GCM standard that takes a key and arbitrary amounts of data and spits out a 128-bit block of data. This block of data is then used in the GCM standard to authenticate the ciphertext and the associated data.</p><p>To use <code>GHASH</code>, we first need to derive a 128-bit block that we can use as the <code>GHASH</code> key <code>H</code>. This is done by encrypting a block of 16 null bytes using AES and the AES key. This block is then interpreted as a polynomial and used as the <code>GHASH</code> key <code>H</code> for the rest of the <code>GHASH</code> computation:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://frereit.de/img/aes/h-key.svg" alt="The GHASH key H is derived by encrypting a block of 16 null bytes using AES-128 and the AES key" data-ffwidth="51%"><figcaption>The GHASH key H is derived by encrypting a block of 16 null bytes using AES-128 and the AES key</figcaption></figure><p>To compute <code>GHASH</code>, we first need to represent the data we want to authenticate as a sequence of 128-bit blocks. This is done by splitting the data into 128-bit blocks and then padding the last block with null bytes if it is not already 128 bits long. We do this separately for the associated data and the ciphertext, so for example if we wanted to authenticated the associated data <code>deadbeef</code> and the ciphertext <code>cafeaffe</code>, we’d use the blocks <code>deadbeef000000000000000000000000</code> and <code>cafeaffe000000000000000000000000</code> as the input to <code>GHASH</code>. To make sure the size of the data is not lost, we add one more block at the end that contains the length of the associated data in bits as a 64-bit big-endian integer and the length of the ciphertext in bits as a 64-bit big-endian integer concatenated together, so in this case <code>00000000000000200000000000000020</code> for the associated data <code>deadbeef</code> and the ciphertext <code>cafeaffe</code>.</p><p>To start the computation, we initialize a <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> element <code>Q</code> to <code>0</code>. We then process the prepared blocks in sequence. The blocks from the associated data are processed first, followed by the blocks from the ciphertext. The length block is processed last. For each block, we interpret the block as a <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> element and add it to <code>Q</code> using the addition operation in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> (which is just the XOR operation) and then multiply <code>Q</code> by the <code>GHASH</code> key <code>H</code> using the multiplication and reduction operation we defined earlier.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://frereit.de/img/aes/ghash.svg" alt="The GHASH function processes 128-bit blocks in order" data-ffwidth="99%"><figcaption>The GHASH function processes 128-bit blocks in order</figcaption></figure><p>The <code>result</code> of the <code>GHASH</code> function is the final value of <code>Y</code> after processing all the blocks. For security reasons that will hopefully become clear later, we cannot use the <code>result</code> directly as the authentication tag. Instead, we encrypt the <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> block from earlier using the AES key and XOR the encrypted <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> block with the <code>result</code> to get the final authentication tag. This is the value that is sent along with the ciphertext and the associated data to the recipient, who can then use the same key to compute the <code>GHASH</code> function and verify that the authentication tag is correct. An attacker who does not know the key cannot modify the ciphertext or the associated data without the recipient noticing, because they would not be able to compute the correct authentication tag, because they cannot derive <code>H</code> and the encrypted <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> block.</p><h5 id="formula-for-ghash">Formula for GHASH</h5><p>We can also express the <code>GHASH</code> function as a formula. Let <code>H</code> be the <code>GHASH</code> key and <code>U</code><sub><code>i</code></sub> be the <code>i</code>-th prepared block. So, in the example above, <code>U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> would be <code>deadbeef000000000000000000000000</code>, <code>U</code><sub><code>1</code></sub> would be <code>cafeaffe000000000000000000000000</code>, and <code>U</code><sub><code>2</code></sub> would be <code>00000000000000200000000000000020</code>.</p><p>We can build the formula for <code>GHASH</code> iteratively:</p><ol><li>First, we initialize <code>Q</code> to <code>0</code>: <code>Q ← 0</code>.</li><li>Then, for the first block, we add it to <code>Q</code>: <code>Q ← Q ⊕ U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> (which is the same as <code>Q = U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> because <code>Q</code> is <code>0</code>).</li><li>We then multiply <code>Q</code> by <code>H</code>: <code>Q ← Q ⨂ H = (U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H</code>.</li><li>For the second block, we add it to <code>Q</code>: <code>Q ← Q ⊕ U</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> = ((U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H) ⊕ U</code><sub><code>1</code></sub>.</li><li>Again, we multiply <code>Q</code> by <code>H</code>: <code>Q ← Q ⨂ H = (((U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H) ⊕ U</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H</code>.</li><li>We can continue this process for all the blocks and the final result is the <code>GHASH</code> value. The formula for <code>GHASH</code> is then: <code>Q = (((((U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⨂ H) ⊕ U</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H) ⊕ U</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H) ⊕ ...</code></li></ol><p>Take some time to look at the formula and see if you can convince yourself that it indeed the same as the graphical representation above.</p><p>Multiplication and addition in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> follows the usual laws of multiplication and addition, so we can distribute the multiplication of <code>H</code> over the additions. This means that <code>(((U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H) ⊕ U</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H = (U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> ⨂ H)</code>.</p><p>We can apply this rule to the formula above to get a more compact formula for <code>GHASH</code>:</p><p><code>Q = (U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>n+1</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>n</code></sup><code>) ⊕ ... ⊕ (U</code><sub><code>n-1</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U</code><sub><code>n</code></sub><code> ⨂ H)</code>.</p><p>Lastly, we have to XOR the result with the encrypted <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> block to get the final authentication tag. We have to add the encrypted <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> block to the result to get the final authentication tag <code>T</code>, because adding in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> is equal to the XOR operation:</p><p><code>T = Q ⊕ E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) = (U</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>n+1</code></sup><code>) ⊕ ... ⊕ (U</code><sub><code>n</code></sub><code> ⨂ H) ⊕ E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)</code>.</p><p>Now that we have a formula for <code>GHASH</code>, we can use it to compute the authentication tag for the ciphertext and the associated data. Let’s take a look at an example! Enter some key, nonce, associated data, and ciphertext and see the authentication tag computed using the <code>GHASH</code> function:</p><p>Okay, that was a lot! We’ve now seen how the <code>GHASH</code> function works and how it is used to authenticate the ciphertext and the associated data. We’ve also seen that we can represent the <code>GHASH</code> function as a formula that we can use to compute the authentication tag in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code>. To verify the authenticity of the ciphertext and the associated data, the recipient can compute the <code>GHASH</code> function using the same key and the same nonce and compare the result to the authentication tag. If the two values match, the recipient can be sure that the ciphertext and the associated data have not been tampered with and that they were indeed generated by the sender in possession of the key.</p><h3 id="recap-1">Recap</h3><p>We’ve now seen how GCM works.

We have also seen that the nonce is used in the computation of the authentication tag. But what happens if the nonce is reused?</p><p>Let’s assume two authentication tags <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are computed using the same key and nonce. For simplicitly, let’s assume the blocks used in the <code>GHASH</code> computation were <code>U1</code><sub><code>0</code></sub>, <code>U1</code><sub><code>1</code></sub> and <code>U1</code><sub><code>2</code></sub> for the first tag and <code>U2</code><sub><code>0</code></sub>, <code>U2</code><sub><code>1</code></sub> and <code>U2</code><sub><code>2</code></sub> for the second tag. In practice, the number of blocks used in the <code>GHASH</code> computation is (almost) irrelevant, but for this example, we’ll stick to three blocks.</p><p>Let’s write out the formula for the first tag <code>T1</code>:</p><p><code>T1 = GHASH1 ⊕ E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) = (U1</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>3</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U1</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U1</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code> ⨂ H) ⊕ E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)</code>.</p><p>The formula for the second tag <code>T2</code> is similar:</p><p><code>T2 = GHASH2 ⊕ E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) = (U2</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>3</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U2</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U2</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code> ⨂ H) ⊕ E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)</code>.</p><p>Notice how in both formulas <code>E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)</code> appears. This is the crucial part. Remember that <code>E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)</code> is the encryption of the <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> block using the AES key. The <code>Y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> block is only dependant on the nonce, which we assume to have been the same in both messages, and of course we assume both messages were encrypted with the same key. This means that <code>E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)</code> is exactly the same value in both tags. This means that <code>E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)</code> can be cancelled out by adding the two equations together:</p><p><code>T1 ⊕ T2 = ((U1</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>3</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U1</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U1</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code> ⨂ H) ⊕ E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)) ⊕ ((U2</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>3</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U2</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ (U2</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code> ⨂ H) ⊕ E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>))</code><br><code>= ((U1</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⊕ U2</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H</code><sup><code>4</code></sup><code>) ⊕ ((U1</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> ⊕ U2</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ ((U1</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code> ⊕ U2</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H)</code>.</p><p>By adding the two equations together, we have completely eliminated <code>E</code><sub><code>k</code></sub><code>(y</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>)</code>. We’ll now look at what’s left in this formula, and how we can use it to recover <code>H</code>.</p><p>Rearraning the formula by adding <code>T1 ⊕ T2</code> on both sides gives us a zero on one side of the equation:</p><p><code>0 = ((U1</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code> ⊕ U2</code><sub><code>0</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H</code><sup><code>4</code></sup><code>) ⊕ ((U1</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code> ⊕ U2</code><sub><code>1</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ ((U1</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code> ⊕ U2</code><sub><code>2</code></sub><code>) ⨂ H) ⊕ T1 ⊕ T2</code></p><p>Now, you might notice, this is <em>extremely</em> similar to a polynomial equation. In fact, it is a polynomial equation for <code>H</code>! Forget for a moment that <code>H</code> and all the <code>U</code> values are in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> and think of any other polynomial equation you might have seen, like <code>4x</code><sup><code>4</code></sup><code> + 2x</code><sup><code>3</code></sup><code> + 3x</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> + 7x + 1 = 0</code>. This is exactly the same, just with <code>H</code> instead of <code>x</code> and with coefficients the coefficients <code>U1</code><sub><code>i</code></sub><code> ⊕ U2</code><sub><code>i</code></sub> instead of a regular real number like <code>4</code>.</p><p>Note that attacker that has obtained both transmitted messages has knowledge of <code>T1</code>, <code>T2</code> as well as <code>U1</code> and <code>U2</code>, as the tag and ciphetext (with associated data) are the “public” parts of the AES-GCM scheme. So, because an attacker has knowledge of <code>U1</code> and <code>U2</code>, we can treat this coefficient like any other constant coefficient in a polynomial equation. We’ve already defined the addition and multiplication operations in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code>, so hopefully it becomes clear that we can treat the formula we just derived like any other polynomial equation.</p><p>If we can find a solution for this polynomial equation, we can recover the <code>H</code> value. Why is this interesting? Remember that <code>H</code> is the <code>GHASH</code> key, which is derived from the AES key. If we can recover <code>H</code>, we can use it to compute the <code>GHASH</code> function for any data we want. This means that we can authenticate any data we want, even if we don’t know the AES key. Combined with the keystream recovery demonstrated early, this leads to a <strong><em>full break</em></strong> of the AES-GCM encryption scheme.</p><h3 id="solving-the-polynomial-equation">Solving the polynomial equation</h3><p>So, the question is, how do we solve this polynomial equation? This is where the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm comes in. The Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm is an algorithm that can be used to factor polynomials specifically over finite fields. In our case, we want to factor the polynomial equation we derived earlier over <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code>. The Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm, which means that it might not always find a solution, but given enough attempts, it will find a solution with an arbitrarily high probability.</p><p>The Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm cannot be applied to just any polynomial equation, there are a few requirements that must be ticked off before the algorithm can be used. Lukily, there exist other algorithms to ensure that these requirements are met for any given polynomial:</p><ol><li><p>The polynomial must be square-free, which means that it has no repeated roots. For example, let’s say we have a polynomial equation <code>H ⊕ 1 = 0</code>. Remember that addition in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> is the XOR operation, so if we set <code>H</code> to <code>1</code>, then <code>H ⊕ 1 = 1 ⊕ 1 = 0</code>. So the polynomial has a root at <code>H = 1</code>. If we now multiply this polynomial with itself, we get a new polynomial: <code>(H ⊕ 1) ⨂ (H ⊕ 1) = H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> ⊕ 1</code>. This polynomial has a repeated root at <code>H = 1</code>, because <code>H ⊕ 1</code> appears twice in the factorization of the polynomial. You can also think of this as the polynomial having a factor <code>(H ⊕ 1)</code> squared. The Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm cannot factor polynomials with repeated roots, so we need to make sure that the polynomial we derived earlier does not have any repeated roots, which is the case when it is “square-free”. To achive this requirement, we will be constructing a new polynomial that contains all the factors of the original polynomial exactly once. Although this algorithm changes the “form” of the polynomial, the values of the roots stay unchanged, only their multiplicity (how often they appear) is set to exactly one.</p></li><li><p>The polynomial must be the product of polynomials of equal degrees. For example, take the polynomial equation <code>H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code> ⊕ (x ⨂ H) ⊕ 1 = 0</code>. Here the <code>x</code> is the polynomial representation of the block value <code>40000000000000000000000000000000</code>, like we discussed earlier. This polynomial has degree <code>2</code> and is irreducible, which means that it cannot be factored into two polynomials of degree <code>1</code>. Any polynomial that has a root must have a factor of degree <code>1</code>, therefore any irreducible polynomial of degree <code>2</code> or higher cannot have any roots. If we multiply this by <code>H + 1</code>, we get <code>H</code><sup><code>3</code></sup><code> ⊕ ((x + 1) ⨂ H</code><sup><code>2</code></sup><code>) ⊕ ((x + 1) ⨂ H) ⊕ 1</code>, which is a polynomial of degree <code>3</code>. However, this polynomial cannot be factored using the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm because it is the product of one irreducible polynomial of degree <code>2</code> and one polynomial of degree <code>1</code>. We need to split the input polynomial its “parts”, so into a list of polynomials that only have factors of the same degree. This is called “distinct-degree factorization”. It is the last step needed before we can then apply the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm to find the roots of each of the “equal-degree” polynomials.</p></li></ol><p>The algorithms to make the polynomial square-free and to split it into polynomials of equal degrees are well-documented and there’s even pseudocode available on Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_of_polynomials_over_finite_fields#Square-free_factorization">square-free factorization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_of_polynomials_over_finite_fields#Distinct-degree_factorization">distinct-degree factorization</a> respectively.</p><p>Once we have a square-free polynomial that is the product of polynomials of equal degrees, we can use the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm to split the polynomial into two factors and do so repeatedly until we have found all the factors.</p><p>I’ll outline the main idea of the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm here, but again, you can find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_of_polynomials_over_finite_fields#Cantor%E2%80%93Zassenhaus_algorithm">pseudocode on Wikipedia</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.

But you might spot a problem: Raising a polynomial to the power of <code>⅓ ⋅ (2</code><sup><code>d ⋅ 128</code></sup><code> - 1)</code> seems almost impossible, because that number is absolutely huge! But, of course, there’s a trick: Instead of raising the polynomial to the power of <code>⅓ ⋅ (2</code><sup><code>d ⋅ 128</code></sup><code> - 1)</code>, and then computing the greatest common denominator immediately, we can reduce the polynomial by <code>f</code> before computing the greatest common denominator, without “losing” any factors. Calculating an almost arbitrarily large power with a given modulus is a well-known problem in computer algebra, and the square-and-multiply algorithm can be used to compute the result efficiently. Without this trick, the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm would be infeasible for polynomials of degree <code>128</code> in <code>GF(2</code><sup><code>128</code></sup><code>)</code> and it is one of the core reasons why the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm is so powerful.</p><p>Once we have found all the factors of the polynomial, we look at all the factors with degree <code>1</code>. These are the factors that are linear polynomials, so they are of the form <code>H + a</code> where <code>a</code> is a constant. We then know that when we set <code>H = a</code>, this linear polynomial will evaluate to zero, and is thus is a solution to the polynomial equation we derived earlier. Note that we might have multiple solutions for <code>H</code> if there are multiple roots to the polynomial but only one of them is the correct <code>H</code> used in the <code>GHASH</code> computation, which we will need to use if we want to authenticate other data. To do this, we need a third message that was authenticated using the same key and nonce. We can then use the recovered <code>H</code> to compute the <code>GHASH</code> function for the third message and check if the result of our computation matches the real authentication tag of the third message. If it does, we have successfully recovered the <code>H</code> value and can now authenticate any data we want.</p><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3><p>We now have all the pieces we need to recover the <code>GHASH</code> key <code>H</code> if the nonce is reused. We can use the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm to factor the polynomial equation we derived earlier and recover the <code>H</code> value.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>In 1993, id Software released the first-person shooter <em>Doom</em>, which quickly
became a phenomenon. The game is now considered one of the most influential
games of all time.</p>

<p>A decade after <em>Doom</em>’s release, in 2003, journalist David Kushner published a
book about id Software called <em>Masters of Doom</em>, which has since become the
canonical account of <em>Doom</em>’s creation. I read <em>Masters of Doom</em> a few years
ago and don’t remember much of it now, but there was one story in the book
about lead programmer John Carmack that has stuck with me. This is a loose
gloss of the story (see below for the full details), but essentially, early in
the development of <em>Doom</em>, Carmack realized that the 3D renderer he had written
for the game slowed to a crawl when trying to render certain levels. This was
unacceptable, because <em>Doom</em> was supposed to be action-packed and frenetic. So
Carmack, realizing the problem with his renderer was fundamental enough that he
would need to find a better rendering algorithm, started reading research
papers. He eventually implemented a technique called “binary space
partitioning,” never before used in a video game, that dramatically sped up the
<em>Doom</em> engine.
<!--more--></p>

<p>That story about Carmack applying cutting-edge academic research to video games
has always impressed me. It is my explanation for why Carmack has become such a
legendary figure. He deserves to be known as the archetypal genius video game
programmer for all sorts of reasons, but this episode with the academic papers
and the binary space partitioning is the justification I think of first.</p>

<p>Obviously, the story is impressive because “binary space partitioning” sounds
like it would be a difficult thing to just read about and implement yourself.
I’ve long assumed that what Carmack did was a clever intellectual leap, but
because I’ve never understood what binary space partitioning is or how novel a
technique it was when Carmack decided to use it, I’ve never known for sure. On
a spectrum from Homer Simpson to Albert Einstein, how much of a genius-level
move was it really for Carmack to add binary space partitioning to <em>Doom</em>?</p>

<p>I’ve also wondered where binary space partitioning first came from and how the
idea found its way to Carmack. So this post is about John Carmack and <em>Doom</em>,
but it is also about the history of a data structure: the binary space
partitioning tree (or BSP tree). It turns out that the BSP tree, rather
interestingly, and like so many things in computer science, has its origins in
research conducted for the military.</p>

<p>That’s right: E1M1, the first level of <em>Doom</em>, was brought to you by the
US Air Force.</p>

<h2 id="the-vsd-problem">The VSD Problem</h2>
<p>The BSP tree is a solution to one of the thorniest problems in computer
graphics. In order to render a three-dimensional scene, a renderer has to
figure out, given a particular viewpoint, what can be seen and what cannot be
seen. This is not especially challenging if you have lots of time, but a
respectable real-time game engine needs to figure out what can be seen and what
cannot be seen at least 30 times a second.</p>

<p>This problem is sometimes called the problem of visible surface determination.
Michael Abrash, a programmer who worked with Carmack on <em>Quake</em> (id Software’s
follow-up to <em>Doom</em>), wrote about the VSD problem in his famous <em>Graphics
Programming Black Book</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to talk about what is, in my opinion, the toughest 3-D problem of all:
visible surface determination (drawing the proper surface at each pixel), and
its close relative, culling (discarding non-visible polygons as quickly as
possible, a way of accelerating visible surface determination). In the
interests of brevity, I’ll use the abbreviation VSD to mean both visible
surface determination and culling from now on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do I think VSD is the toughest 3-D challenge? Although rasterization
issues such as texture mapping are fascinating and important, they are tasks
of relatively finite scope, and are being moved into hardware as 3-D
accelerators appear; also, they only scale with increases in screen
resolution, which are relatively modest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, VSD is an open-ended problem, and there are dozens of approaches
currently in use. Even more significantly, the performance of VSD, done in an
unsophisticated fashion, scales directly with scene complexity, which tends
to increase as a square or cube function, so this very rapidly becomes the
limiting factor in rendering realistic worlds.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abrash was writing about the difficulty of the VSD problem in the late ’90s,
years after <em>Doom</em> had proved that regular people wanted to be able to play
graphically intensive games on their home computers. In the early ’90s, when id
Software first began publishing games, the games had to be programmed to run
efficiently on computers not designed to run them, computers meant for word
processing, spreadsheet applications, and little else. To make this work,
especially for the few 3D games that id Software published before <em>Doom</em>, id
Software had to be creative. In these games, the design of all the levels was
constrained in such a way that the VSD problem was easier to solve.</p>

<p>For example, in <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, the game id Software released just prior to
<em>Doom</em>, every level is made from walls that are axis-aligned. In other words,
in the Wolfenstein universe, you can have north-south walls or west-east walls,
but nothing else. Walls can also only be placed at fixed intervals on a
grid—all hallways are either one grid square wide, or two grid squares wide,
etc., but never 2.5 grid squares wide. Though this meant that the id Software
team could only design levels that all looked somewhat the same, it made
Carmack’s job of writing a renderer for <em>Wolfenstein</em> much simpler.</p>

<p>The <em>Wolfenstein</em> renderer solved the VSD problem by “marching” rays into the
virtual world from the screen. Usually a renderer that uses rays is a
“raycasting” renderer—these renderers are often slow, because solving the VSD
problem in a raycaster involves finding the first intersection between a ray
and something in your world, which in the general case requires lots of number
crunching. But in <em>Wolfenstein</em>, because all the walls are aligned with the
grid, the only location a ray can possibly intersect a wall is at the grid
lines. So all the renderer needs to do is check each of those intersection
points. If the renderer starts by checking the intersection point nearest to
the player’s viewpoint, then checks the next nearest, and so on, and stops when
it encounters the first wall, the VSD problem has been solved in an almost
trivial way. A ray is just marched forward from each pixel until it hits
something, which works because the marching is so cheap in terms of CPU cycles.
And actually, since all walls are the same height, it is only necessary to
march a single ray for every <em>column</em> of pixels.</p>

<p>This rendering shortcut made <em>Wolfenstein</em> fast enough to run on underpowered
home PCs in the era before dedicated graphics cards. But this approach would
not work for <em>Doom</em>, since the id team had decided that their new game would
feature novel things like diagonal walls, stairs, and ceilings of different
heights. Ray marching was no longer viable, so Carmack wrote a different kind
of renderer. Whereas the <em>Wolfenstein</em> renderer, with its ray for every column
of pixels, is an “image-first” renderer, the <em>Doom</em> renderer is an
“object-first” renderer. This means that rather than iterating through the
pixels on screen and figuring out what color they should be, the <em>Doom</em>
renderer iterates through the objects in a scene and projects each onto the
screen in turn.</p>

<p>In an object-first renderer, one easy way to solve the VSD problem is to use a
z-buffer. Each time you project an object onto the screen, for each pixel you
want to draw to, you do a check. If the part of the object you want to draw is
closer to the player than what was already drawn to the pixel, then you can
overwrite what is there. Otherwise you have to leave the pixel as is. This
approach is simple, but a z-buffer requires a lot of memory, and the renderer
may still expend a lot of CPU cycles projecting level geometry that is never
going to be seen by the player.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, there was an additional drawback to the z-buffer approach:
On IBM-compatible PCs, which used a video adapter system called VGA,
writing to the output frame buffer was an expensive operation. So time
spent drawing pixels that would only get overwritten later tanked the
performance of your renderer.</p>

<p>Since writing to the frame buffer was so expensive, the ideal renderer was
one that started by drawing the objects closest to the player, then the objects
just beyond those objects, and so on, until every pixel on screen had been
written to. At that point the renderer would know to stop, saving all the time
it might have spent considering far-away objects that the player cannot see.
But ordering the objects in a scene this way, from closest to farthest, is
tantamount to solving the VSD problem. Once again, the question is: What can be
seen by the player?</p>

<p>Initially, Carmack tried to solve this problem by relying on the layout of
<em>Doom</em>’s levels. His renderer started by drawing the walls of the room
currently occupied by the player, then flooded out into neighboring rooms to
draw the walls in those rooms that could be seen from the current room.
Provided that every room was convex, this solved the VSD issue. Rooms that were
not convex could be split into convex “sectors.” You can see how this rendering
technique might have looked if run at extra-slow speed <a href="https://youtu.be/HQYsFshbkYw?t=822">in this
video</a>, where YouTuber Bisqwit demonstrates
a renderer of his own that works according to the same general algorithm. This
algorithm was successfully used in Duke Nukem 3D, released three years after
<em>Doom</em>, when CPUs were more powerful. But, in 1993, running on the hardware
then available, the <em>Doom</em> renderer that used this algorithm struggled with
complicated levels—particularly when sectors were nested inside of each other,
which was the only way to create something like a circular pit of stairs. A
circular pit of stairs led to lots of repeated recursive descents into a sector
that had already been drawn, strangling the game engine’s speed.</p>

<p>Around the time that the id team realized that the <em>Doom</em> game engine might be
too slow, id Software was asked to port <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> to the Super Nintendo.
The Super Nintendo was even less powerful than the IBM-compatible PCs of the
day, and it turned out that the ray-marching <em>Wolfenstein</em> renderer, simple as
it was, didn’t run fast enough on the Super Nintendo hardware. So Carmack began
looking for a better algorithm. It was actually for the Super Nintendo
port of <em>Wolfenstein</em> that Carmack first researched and implemented binary
space partitioning. In <em>Wolfenstein</em>, this was relatively straightforward
because all the walls were axis-aligned; in <em>Doom</em>, it would be more complex.
But Carmack realized that BSP trees would solve <em>Doom</em>’s speed problems too.</p>


<p>Binary space partitioning makes the VSD problem easier to solve by splitting a
3D scene into parts ahead of time. For now, you just need to grasp why
splitting a scene is useful: If you draw a line (really a plane in 3D) across
your scene, and you know which side of the line the player or camera viewpoint
is on, then you also know that nothing on the other side of the line can
obstruct something on the viewpoint’s side of the line. If you repeat this
process many times, you end up with a 3D scene split into many sections, which
wouldn’t be an improvement on the original scene except now you know more about
how different parts of the scene can obstruct each other.</p>

<p>The first people to write about dividing a 3D scene like this were researchers
trying to establish for the US Air Force whether computer graphics were
sufficiently advanced to use in flight simulators. They released their
findings in a 1969 report called “Study for Applying Computer-Generated Images
to Visual Simulation.” The report concluded that computer graphics could be
used to train pilots, but also warned that the implementation would be
complicated by the VSD problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most significant problems that must be faced in the real-time
computation of images is the priority, or hidden-line, problem. In our
everyday visual perception of our surroundings, it is a problem that nature
solves with trivial ease; a point of an opaque object obscures all other
points that lie along the same line of sight and are more distant. In the
computer, the task is formidable. The computations required to resolve
priority in the general case grow exponentially with the complexity of the
environment, and soon they surpass the computing load associated with finding
the perspective images of the objects.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One solution these researchers mention, which according to them was earlier
used in a project for NASA, is based on creating what I am going to call an
“occlusion matrix.” The researchers point out that a plane dividing a scene
in two can be used to resolve “any priority conflict” between objects on
opposite sides of the plane. In general you might have to add these planes
explicitly to your scene, but with certain kinds of geometry you can just rely
on the faces of the objects you already have. They give the example in the
figure below, where \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) are the separating planes. If
the camera viewpoint is on the forward or “true” side of one of these planes,
then \(p_i\) evaluates to 1. The matrix shows the relationships between the
three objects based on the three dividing planes and the location of the camera
viewpoint—if object \(a_i\) obscures object \(a_j\), then entry \(a_{ij}\) in
the matrix will be a 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/matrix_figure.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The researchers propose that this matrix could be implemented in hardware and
re-evaluated every frame. Basically the matrix would act as a big switch or a
kind of pre-built z-buffer. When drawing a given object, no video would be
output for the parts of the object when a 1 exists in the object’s column and
the corresponding row object is also being drawn.</p>

<p>The major drawback with this matrix approach is that to represent a scene with
\(n\) objects you need a matrix of size \(n^2\). So the researchers go on to
explore whether it would be feasible to represent the occlusion matrix as a
“priority list” instead, which would only be of size \(n\) and would establish
an order in which objects should be drawn. They immediately note that for
certain scenes like the one in the figure above no ordering can be made (since
there is an occlusion cycle), so they spend a lot of time laying out the
mathematical distinction between “proper” and “improper” scenes. Eventually
they conclude that, at least for “proper” scenes—and it should be easy enough
for a scene designer to avoid “improper” cases—a priority list could be
generated. But they leave the list generation as an exercise for the reader. It
seems the primary contribution of this 1969 study was to point out that it
should be possible to use partitioning planes to order objects in a scene for
rendering, at least <em>in theory</em>.</p>

<p>It was not until 1980 that a paper, titled “On Visible Surface Generation by A
Priori Tree Structures,” demonstrated a concrete algorithm to accomplish this.
The 1980 paper, written by Henry Fuchs, Zvi Kedem, and Bruce Naylor, introduced
the BSP tree. The authors say that their novel data structure is “an
alternative solution to an approach first utilized a decade ago but due to a
few difficulties, not widely exploited”—here referring to the approach taken in
the 1969 Air Force study.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> A BSP tree, once constructed, can easily be used
to provide a priority ordering for objects in the scene.</p>

<p>Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor give a pretty readable explanation of how a BSP tree
works, but let me see if I can provide a less formal but more concise one.</p>

<p>You begin by picking one polygon in your scene and making the plane in which
the polygon lies your partitioning plane. That one polygon also ends up as the
root node in your tree. The remaining polygons in your scene will be on one
side or the other of your root partitioning plane. The polygons on the
“forward” side or in the “forward” half-space of your plane end up in the
left subtree of your root node, while the polygons on the “back” side or in the
“back” half-space of your plane end up in the right subtree. You then repeat
this process recursively, picking a polygon from your left and right subtrees
to be the new partitioning planes for their respective half-spaces, which
generates further half-spaces and further sub-trees. You stop when you run out
of polygons.</p>

<p>Say you want to render the geometry in your scene from back-to-front. (This is
known as the “painter’s algorithm,” since it means that polygons further from
the camera will get drawn over by polygons closer to the camera, producing a
correct rendering.) To achieve this, all you have to do is an in-order
traversal of the BSP tree, where the decision to render the left or right
subtree of any node first is determined by whether the camera viewpoint is in
either the forward or back half-space relative to the partitioning plane
associated with the node. So at each node in the tree, you render all the
polygons on the “far” side of the plane first, then the polygon in the
partitioning plane, then all the polygons on the “near” side of the plane—”far”
and “near” being relative to the camera viewpoint. This solves the VSD problem
because, as we learned several paragraphs back, the polygons on the far side of
the partitioning plane cannot obstruct anything on the near side.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the construction and traversal of a BSP tree
representing a simple 2D scene. In 2D, the partitioning planes are instead
partitioning lines, but the basic idea is the same in a more complicated 3D
scene.</p>

<em>Step Two: The half-spaces on either side of D are split again. Wall C is the
only wall in its half-space so no split is needed. Wall B forms the new
partitioning line in its half-space. Wall A must be split into two walls since
it crosses the partitioning line.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/bsp2.svg" alt="">
<em>A back-to-front ordering of the walls relative to the viewpoint in the
top-right corner, useful for implementing the painter’s algorithm. This is just
an in-order traversal of the tree.</em></p>

<p>The really neat thing about a BSP tree, which Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor stress
several times, is that it only has to be constructed once. This is somewhat
surprising, but the same BSP tree can be used to render a scene no matter where
the camera viewpoint is. The BSP tree remains valid as long as the polygons in
the scene don’t move. This is why the BSP tree is so useful for real-time
rendering—all the hard work that goes into constructing the tree can be done
beforehand rather than during rendering.</p>

<p>One issue that Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor say needs further exploration is the
question of what makes a “good” BSP tree. The quality of your BSP tree will
depend on which polygons you decide to use to establish your partitioning
planes. I skipped over this earlier, but if you partition using a plane that
intersects other polygons, then in order for the BSP algorithm to work, you
have to split the intersected polygons in two, so that one part can go in one
half-space and the other part in the other half-space. If this happens a lot,
then building a BSP tree will dramatically increase the number of polygons in
your scene.</p>

<p>Bruce Naylor, one of the authors of the 1980 paper, would later write about
this problem in his 1993 paper, “Constructing Good Partitioning Trees.”
According to John Romero, one of Carmack’s fellow id Software co-founders, this
paper was one of the papers that Carmack read when he was trying to implement
BSP trees in <em>Doom</em>.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="bsp-trees-in-doom">BSP Trees in Doom</h2>
<p>Remember that, in his first draft of the <em>Doom</em> renderer, Carmack had been
trying to establish a rendering order for level geometry by “flooding” the
renderer out from the player’s current room into neighboring rooms. BSP trees
were a better way to establish this ordering because they avoided the issue
where the renderer found itself visiting the same room (or sector) multiple
times, wasting CPU cycles.</p>

<p>“Adding BSP trees to <em>Doom</em>” meant, in practice, adding a BSP tree generator to
the <em>Doom</em> level editor. When a level in <em>Doom</em> was complete, a BSP tree was
generated from the level geometry. According to Fabien Sanglard, the generation
process could take as long as eight seconds for a single level and 11 minutes
for all the levels in the original <em>Doom</em>.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> The generation process was
lengthy in part because Carmack’s BSP generation algorithm tries to search for
a “good” BSP tree using various heuristics. An eight-second delay would have
been unforgivable at runtime, but it was not long to wait when done offline,
especially considering the performance gains the BSP trees brought to the
renderer. The generated BSP tree for a single level would have then ended up as
part of the level data loaded into the game when it starts.</p>

<p>Carmack put a spin on the BSP tree algorithm outlined in the 1980 paper,
because once <em>Doom</em> is started and the BSP tree for the current level is read
into memory, the renderer uses the BSP tree to draw objects front-to-back
rather than back-to-front. In the 1980 paper, Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor show how
a BSP tree can be used to implement the back-to-front painter’s algorithm, but
the painter’s algorithm involves a lot of over-drawing that would have been
expensive on an IBM-compatible PC. So the <em>Doom</em> renderer instead starts with
the geometry closer to the player, draws that first, then draws the geometry
farther away. This reverse ordering is easy to achieve using a BSP tree, since
you can just make the opposite traversal decision at each node in the tree. To
ensure that the farther-away geometry is not drawn over the closer geometry,
the <em>Doom</em> renderer uses a kind of implicit z-buffer that provides much of the
benefit of a z-buffer with a much smaller memory footprint. There is one array
that keeps track of occlusion in the horizontal dimension, and another two
arrays that keep track of occlusion in the vertical dimension from the top and
bottom of the screen. The <em>Doom</em> renderer can get away with not using an actual
z-buffer because <em>Doom</em> is not technically a fully 3D game. The cheaper data
structures work because certain things never appear in <em>Doom</em>: The horizontal
occlusion array works because there are no sloping walls, and the vertical
occlusion arrays work because no walls have, say, two windows, one above the
other.</p>

<p>The only other tricky issue left is how to incorporate <em>Doom</em>’s moving
characters into the static level geometry drawn with the aid of the BSP tree.
The enemies in <em>Doom</em> cannot be a part of the BSP tree because they move; the
BSP tree only works for geometry that never moves. So the <em>Doom</em> renderer draws
the static level geometry first, keeping track of the segments of the screen
that were drawn to (with yet another memory-efficient data structure). It then
draws the enemies in back-to-front order, clipping them against the segments of
the screen that occlude them. This process is not as optimal as rendering using
the BSP tree, but because there are usually fewer enemies visible than there is
level geometry in a level, speed isn’t as much of an issue here.</p>

<p>Using BSP trees in <em>Doom</em> was a major win. Obviously it is pretty neat that
Carmack was able to figure out that BSP trees were the perfect solution to his
problem. But was it a <em>genius</em>-level move?</p>

<p>In his excellent book about the <em>Doom</em> game engine, Fabien Sanglard quotes John
Romero saying that Bruce Naylor’s paper, “Constructing Good Partitioning
Trees,” was mostly about using BSP trees to cull backfaces from 3D models.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
According to Romero, Carmack thought the algorithm could still be useful for
<em>Doom</em>, so he went ahead and implemented it. This description is quite
flattering to Carmack—it implies he saw that BSP trees could be useful for
real-time video games when other people were still using the technique to
render static scenes. There is a similarly flattering story in <em>Masters of
Doom</em>: Kushner suggests that Carmack read Naylor’s paper and asked himself,
“what if you could use a BSP to create not just one 3D image but an entire
virtual world?”<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>This framing ignores the history of the BSP tree. When those US Air Force
researchers first realized that partitioning a scene might help speed up
rendering, they were interested in speeding up <em>real-time</em> rendering, because
they were, after all, trying to create a flight simulator. The flight simulator
example comes up again in the 1980 BSP paper. Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor talk
about how a BSP tree would be useful in a flight simulator that pilots use to
practice landing at the same airport over and over again. Since the airport
geometry never changes, the BSP tree can be generated just once. Clearly
what they have in mind is a real-time simulation. In the introduction to their
paper, they even motivate their research by talking about how real-time
graphics systems must be able to create an image in at least 1/30th of a
second.</p>

<p>So Carmack was not the first person to think of using BSP trees in a real-time
graphics simulation. Of course, it’s one thing to anticipate that BSP trees
might be used this way and another thing to actually do it. But even in the
implementation Carmack may have had more guidance than is commonly assumed. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning">Wikipedia page about BSP
trees</a>, at least as of
this writing, suggests that Carmack consulted a 1991 paper by Chen and Gordon
as well as a 1990 textbook called <em>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice</em>.
Though no citation is provided for this claim, it is probably true. The 1991
Chen and Gordon paper outlines a front-to-back rendering approach using BSP
trees that is basically the same approach taken by <em>Doom</em>, right down to what
I’ve called the “implicit z-buffer” data structure that prevents farther
polygons being drawn over nearer polygons. The textbook provides a great
overview of BSP trees and some pseudocode both for building a tree and for
displaying one. (I’ve been able to skim through the 1990 edition thanks to my
wonderful university library.) <em>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice</em> is
a classic text in computer graphics, so Carmack might well have owned it.</p>

<p>Still, Carmack found himself faced with a novel problem—”How can we make a
first-person shooter run on a computer with a CPU that can’t even do
floating-point operations?”—did his research, and proved that BSP trees are a
useful data structure for real-time video games. I still think that is an
impressive feat, even if the BSP tree had first been invented a decade prior
and was pretty well theorized by the time Carmack read about it. Perhaps
the accomplishment that we should really celebrate is the <em>Doom</em> game engine as
a whole, which is a seriously nifty piece of work. I’ve mentioned it once
already, but Fabien Sanglard’s book about the <em>Doom</em> game engine (<em>Game Engine
Black Book: DOOM</em>) is an excellent overview of all the different clever
components of the game engine and how they fit together. We shouldn’t forget
that the VSD problem was just one of many problems that Carmack had to solve to
make the <em>Doom</em> engine work. That he was able, on top of everything else, to
read about and implement a complicated data structure unknown to most
programmers speaks volumes about his technical expertise and his drive to
perfect his craft.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">

        <h2>Getting Started with the Static Linux SDK</h2>
      </header>
    
  

  <p>It’s well known that Swift can be used to build software for Apple
platforms such as macOS or iOS, but Swift is also supported on other
platforms, including Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>Building for Linux is especially interesting because, historically,
Linux programs written in Swift needed to ensure that a copy of the
Swift runtime—and all of its dependencies—was installed on the
target system.  Additionally, a program built for a particular
distribution, or even a particular major version of a particular
distribution, would not necessarily run on any other distribution or
in some cases even on a different major version of the same
distribution.</p>

<p>The Swift Static Linux SDK solves both of these problems by allowing
you to build your program as a <em>fully statically linked</em> executable,
with no external dependencies at all (not even the C library), which
means that it will run on <em>any</em> Linux distribution as the only thing
it depends on is the Linux system call interface.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Static Linux SDK can be used from any platform
supported by the Swift compiler and package manager; this means that
you can develop and test your program on macOS before building and
deploying it to a Linux-based server, whether running locally or
somewhere in the cloud.</p>



<p><em>Linking</em> is the process of taking different pieces of a computer
program and wiring up any references between those pieces.  For
<em>static</em> linking, generally speaking those pieces are <em>object files</em>,
or <em>static libraries</em> (which are really just collections of object
files).</p>

<p>For <em>dynamic</em> linking, the pieces are <em>executables</em> and <em>dynamic
libraries</em> (aka dylibs, shared objects, or DLLs).</p>

<p>There are two key differences between dynamic and static linking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The time at which linking takes place.  Static linking happens when
you build your program; dynamic linking happens at runtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a static library (or <em>archive</em>) is really a collection
of individual object files, whereas a dynamic library is monolithic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter is important because traditionally, the static linker will
include every object explicitly listed on its command line, but it
will <em>only</em> include an object from a static library if doing so lets
it resolve an unresolved symbolic reference.  If you statically link
against a library that you do not actually use, a traditional static
linker will completely discard that library and not include any code
from it in your final binary.</p>

<p>In practice, things can be more complicated—the static linker may
actually work on the basis of individual <em>sections</em> or <em>atoms</em> from
your object files, so it may in fact be able to discard individual
functions or pieces of data rather than just whole objects.</p>

          </a></h3>

<p>Pros of static linking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No runtime overhead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only include code from libraries that is actually needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No need for separately installed dynamic libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No versioning issues at runtime.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Cons of static linking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Programs cannot share code (higher overall memory usage).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No way to update dependencies without rebuilding program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Larger executables (though this can be offset by not having to
install separate dynamic libraries).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On Linux in particular, it’s also possible to use static linking to
completely eliminate dependencies on system libraries supplied by the
distribution, resulting in executables that work on any distribution
and can be installed by simply copying.</p>



<p>Before you start, it’s important to note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/">install an Open Source toolchain from
swift.org</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot use the toolchain provided with Xcode to build programs
using the SDK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are using macOS, you will also need to ensure that you use
the Swift compiler from this toolchain by <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/macos/package_installer/">following the
instructions
here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The toolchain must match the version of the Static Linux SDK that
you install.  The Static Linux SDK includes the corresponding Swift
version in its filename to help identify the correct version of the
SDK.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once that is out of the way, actually installing the Static Linux SDK
is easy; at a prompt, enter</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift sdk <span>install</span> &lt;URL-or-filename-here&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>giving the URL or filename at which the SDK can be found.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming you have installed the
<code>swift-6.0-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2024-06-06-a</code> toolchain, you would
need to enter</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift sdk <span>install </span>https://download.swift.org/development/static-sdk/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2024-06-06-a/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2024-06-06-a_static-linux-0.0.1.artifactbundle.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>

<p>to install the corresponding Static Linux SDK.</p>

<p>Swift will download and install the SDK on your system.  You can get a
list of installed SDKs with</p>



<p>and it’s also possible to remove them using</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift sdk remove &lt;name-of-SDK&gt;
</code></pre></div>



<p>First, create a directory to hold your code:</p>



<p>Next, ask Swift to create a new program package for you:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift package init <span>--type</span> executable
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can build and run this locally:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift build
<span>Building for debugging...
[8/8] Applying hello
Build complete! (15.29s)
</span><span>$</span><span> </span>.build/debug/hello
<span>Hello, world!
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But with the Static Linux SDK installed, you can also build Linux
binaries for x86-64 and ARM64 machines:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift build <span>--sdk</span> x86_64-swift-linux-musl
<span>Building for debugging...
[8/8] Linking hello
Build complete! (2.04s)
</span><span>$</span><span> </span>file .build/x86_64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello
<span>.build/x86_64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
</span></code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift build <span>--sdk</span> aarch64-swift-linux-musl
<span>Building for debugging...
[8/8] Linking hello
Build complete! (2.00s)
</span><span>$</span><span> </span>file .build/aarch64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello
<span>.build/aarch64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>These can be copied to an appropriate Linux-based system and executed:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>scp .build/x86_64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello linux:~/hello
<span>$</span><span> </span>ssh linux ~/hello
<span>Hello, world!
</span></code></pre></div>



<p>Swift packages that make use of Foundation or Swift NIO should just
work.  If you try to use a package that uses the C library, however,
you may have a little work to do.  Such packages often contain files
with code like the following:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#if os(macOS) || os(iOS)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Darwin</span>
<span>#elseif os(Linux)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Glibc</span>
<span>#elseif os(Windows)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ucrt</span>
<span>#else</span>
<span>#error(Unknown platform)</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The Static Linux SDK does not use Glibc; instead, it is built on top
of an alternative C library for Linux called
<a href="https://musl-libc.org/">Musl</a>.  We chose this approach for two
reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Musl has excellent support for static linking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Musl is permissively licensed, which makes it easy to distribute
executables statically linked with it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you are using such a dependency, you will therefore need to adjust
it to import the <code>Musl</code> module instead of the <code>Glibc</code> module:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#if os(macOS) || os(iOS)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Darwin</span>
<span>#elseif canImport(Glibc)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Glibc</span>
<span>#elseif canImport(Musl)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Musl</span>
<span>#elseif os(Windows)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ucrt</span>
<span>#else</span>
<span>#error(Unknown platform)</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Occasionally there might be a difference between the way a C library
type gets imported between Musl and Glibc; this sometimes happens if
someone has added nullability annotations, or where a pointer type is
using a forward-declared <code>struct</code> for which no actual definition is
ever provided.  Usually the problem will be obvious—a function
argument or result will be <code>Optional</code> in one case and non-<code>Optional</code>
in another, or a pointer type will be imported as <code>OpaquePointer</code>
rather than <code>UnsafePointer&lt;FOO&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If you do find yourself needing to make these kinds of adjustments,
you can make your local copy of the package dependency editable by
doing</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift package edit SomePackage
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then editing the files in the <code>Packages</code> directory that appears in
your program’s source directory.  You may wish to consider raising PRs
upstream with any fixes you may have.</p>

                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577598" id="137577598" data-legacy-id="sec1">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>What is the rate of return in an economy? It is a simple question, but hard to answer. The rate of return plays a central role in current debates on inequality, secular stagnation, risk premiums, and the decline in the natural rate of interest, to name a few. A main contribution of this article is to introduce a large new data set on the total rates of return for all major asset classes, including housing—the largest but oft-ignored component of household wealth. Our data cover most advanced economies—16 in all—starting in 1870.</p><p>Although housing wealth is on average roughly one-half of national wealth in a typical economy (<span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty 2014), data on total housing returns (price appreciation plus rents) has been lacking (<span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller 2000 provides some historical data on house prices but not on rents). In this article we build on more comprehensive work on house prices (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017) and newly constructed data on rents (<span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll 2017) to enable us to track the total returns of the largest component of the national capital stock.</p><p>We further construct total returns broken down into investment income (yield) and capital gains (price changes) for four major asset classes, two of them typically seen as relatively risky—equities and housing—and two of them typically seen as relatively safe—government bonds and short-term bills. Importantly, we compute actual asset returns taken from market data and therefore construct more detailed series than returns inferred from wealth estimates in discrete benchmark years for a few countries, as in <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014).</p><p>We also follow earlier work in documenting annual equity, bond, and bill returns, but here again we have taken the project further. We recompute all these measures from original sources, improve the links across some important historical market discontinuities (e.g., market closures and other gaps associated with wars and political instability), and in a number of cases we access new and previously unused raw data sources. In all cases, we have also brought in auxiliary sources to validate our data externally, and 100+ pages of online material documents our sources and methods. Our work provides researchers with the first broad noncommercial database of historical equity, bond, and bill returns—and the only database of housing returns—with the most extensive coverage across both countries and years.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn1"></span>1</sup></p><p>This article aims to bridge the gap between two related strands of the academic literature. The first strand is rooted in finance and is concerned with long-run returns on different assets. <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009) probably marked the first comprehensive attempt to document and analyze long-run returns on investment for a broad cross-section of countries. Meanwhile, <span id="jumplink-bib32"></span>Homer and Sylla (2005) pioneered a multidecade project to document the history of interest rates.</p><p>The second related strand of literature is the analysis of comparative national balance sheets over time, as in <span id="jumplink-bib27"></span>Goldsmith (1985). More recently, <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) have brought together data from national accounts and other sources tracking the development of national wealth over long time periods. They also calculate rates of return on capital by dividing aggregate capital income in the national accounts by the aggregate value of capital, also from national accounts.</p><p>Our work is both complementary and supplementary to theirs. It is complementary because the asset price perspective and the national accounts approach are ultimately tied together by accounting rules and identities. Using market valuations, we are able to corroborate and improve the estimates of returns on capital that matter for wealth inequality dynamics. Our long-run return data are also supplementary to the work of <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) in the sense that we greatly extend the number of countries for which we can calculate real rates of return back to the late nineteenth century.</p><p>The evidence we gathered can shed light on active research debates reaching from asset pricing to inequality. For example, in one contentious area of research, the accumulation of capital, the expansion of capital’s share in income, and the growth rate of the economy relative to the rate of return on capital all feature centrally in the current debate sparked by <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) on the evolution of wealth, income, and inequality. What do the long-run patterns on the rates of return on different asset classes have to say about these possible drivers of inequality?</p><p>In many financial theories, preferences over current versus future consumption, attitudes toward risk, and covariation with consumption risk all show up in the premiums that the rates of return on risky assets carry over safe assets. Returns on different asset classes and their correlations with consumption sit at the core of the canonical consumption Euler equation that underpins textbook asset pricing theory (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib49"></span>Mehra and Prescott 1985). But tensions remain between theory and data, prompting further explorations of new asset pricing paradigms, including behavioral finance. Our new data add another risky asset class to the mix, housing, and with it come new challenges.</p><p>In another strand of research triggered by the financial crisis, <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers (2014) seeks to revive the secular stagnation hypothesis first advanced in Alvin <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>Hansen’s <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>(1939) AEA presidential address. Demographic trends are pushing the world’s economies into uncharted territory as the relative weight of borrowers and savers is changing, and with it the possibility increases that the interest rate will fall by an insufficient amount to balance saving and investment at full employment. What is the evidence that this is the case?</p><p>Last, in a related problem within the sphere of monetary economics, <span id="jumplink-bib31"></span>Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) show that estimates of the natural rate of interest in several advanced economies have gradually declined over the past four decades and are now near zero. What historical precedents are there for such low real rates that could inform today’s policy makers, investors, and researchers?</p><p>The common thread running through these broad research topics is the notion that the rate of return is central to understanding long-, medium-, and short-run economic fluctuations. But which rate of return? And how do we measure it? For a given scarcity of funding supply, the risky rate is a measure of the profitability of private investment; in contrast, the safe rate plays an important role in benchmarking compensation for risk and is often tied to discussions of monetary policy settings and the notion of the natural rate. Below, we summarize our main findings.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577611" id="137577611" data-legacy-id="sec1-1">I.A. Main Findings</h3>
<p>We present four main findings:</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577613" id="137577613" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-1">1. On Risky Returns, <em>r</em><sup><em>risky</em></sup></h4>
<p>In terms of total returns, residential real estate and equities have shown very similar and high real total gains, on average about 7% a year. Housing outperformed equities before World War II. Since World War II, equities have outperformed housing on average but had much higher volatility and higher synchronicity with the business cycle. The observation that housing returns are similar to equity returns, but much less volatile, is puzzling. Like <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000), we find that long-run capital gains on housing are relatively low, around 1% a year in real terms, and considerably lower than capital gains in the stock market. However, the rental yield component is typically considerably higher and more stable than the dividend yield of equities so that total returns are of comparable magnitude.</p><p>Before World War II, the real returns on housing and equities (and safe assets) followed remarkably similar trajectories. After World War II this was no longer the case, and across countries equities then experienced more frequent and correlated booms and busts. The low covariance of equity and housing returns reveals that there could be significant aggregate diversification gains (i.e., for a representative agent) from holding the two asset classes.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577616" id="137577616" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-2">2. On Safe Returns, <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup></h4>
<p>We find that the real safe asset return (bonds and bills) has been very volatile over the long run, more so than one might expect, and often even more volatile than real risky returns. Each world war was (unsurprisingly) a moment of very low safe rates, well below zero. So was the 1970s stagflation. The peaks in the real safe rate took place at the start of our sample, in the interwar period, and during the mid-1980s fight against inflation. In fact, the long decline observed in the past few decades is reminiscent of the secular decline that took place from 1870 to World War I. Viewed from a long-run perspective, the past decline and current low level of the real safe rate today is not unusual. The puzzle may well be why the safe rate was so high in the mid-1980s rather than why has it declined ever since.</p><p>Safe returns have been low on average in the full sample, falling in the 1%–3% range for most countries and peacetime periods. While this combination of low returns and high volatility has offered a relatively poor risk-return trade-off to investors, the low returns have also eased the pressure on government finances, in particular allowing for a rapid debt reduction in the aftermath of World War II.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577619" id="137577619" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-3">3. On the Risk Premium, <em>r</em><sup><em>risky</em></sup> − <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup></h4>
<p>Over the very long run, the risk premium has been volatile. Our data uncover substantial swings in the risk premium at lower frequencies that sometimes endured for decades and far exceed the amplitudes of business-cycle swings.</p><p>In most peacetime eras, this premium has been stable at about 4%–5%. But risk premiums stayed curiously and persistently high from the 1950s to the 1970s, long after the conclusion of World War II. However, there is no visible long-run trend, and mean reversion appears strong. Interestingly, the bursts of the risk premium in the wartime and interwar years were mostly a phenomenon of collapsing safe returns rather than dramatic spikes in risky returns.</p><p>In fact, the risky return has often been smoother and more stable than the safe return, averaging about 6%–8% across all eras. Recently, with safe returns low and falling, the risk premium has widened due to a parallel but smaller decline in risky returns. But these shifts keep the two rates of return close to their normal historical range. Whether due to shifts in risk aversion or to other phenomena, the fact that safe returns seem to absorb almost all of these adjustments seems like a puzzle in need of further exploration and explanation.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577623" id="137577623" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-4">4. On Returns Minus Growth, <em>r</em><sup><em>wealth</em></sup> − <em>g</em></h4>
<p><span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) argued that if investors’ return to wealth exceeded the rate of economic growth, rentiers would accumulate wealth at a faster rate and thus worsen wealth inequality. Using a measure of portfolio returns to compute “<em>r</em> minus <em>g</em>” in Piketty’s notation, we uncover an important finding. Even calculated from more granular asset price returns data, the same fact reported in <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) holds true for more countries, more years, and more dramatically: namely, <em>r</em> ≫ <em>g</em>.</p><p>In fact, the only exceptions to that rule happen in the years in or around wartime. In peacetime, <em>r</em> has always been much greater than <em>g</em>. In the pre-World War II period, this gap was on average 5% (excluding World War I). As of today, this gap is still quite large, about 3%–4%, though it narrowed to 2% in the 1970s before widening in the years leading up to the global financial crisis.</p><p>One puzzle that emerges from our analysis is that while <em>r</em> minus <em>g</em> fluctuates over time, it does not seem to do so systematically with the growth rate of the economy. This feature of the data poses a conundrum for the battling views of factor income, distribution, and substitution in the ongoing debate (<span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie 2015). The fact that returns to wealth have remained fairly high and stable while aggregate wealth increased rapidly since the 1970s suggests that capital accumulation may have contributed to the decline in the labor share of income over the recent decades (<span id="jumplink-bib39"></span>Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014). In thinking about inequality and several other characteristics of modern economies, the new data on the return to capital that we present here should spur further research.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577627" id="137577627" data-legacy-id="sec2">II.

<p>In this section, we discuss the main sources and definitions for the calculation of long-run returns. A major innovation is the inclusion of housing. Residential real estate is the main asset in most household portfolios, as we shall see, but so far very little has been known about long-run returns on housing. Our data on housing returns cover capital gains and imputed rents to owners and renters, the sum of the two being total returns.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn2"></span>2</sup> Equity return data for publicly traded equities are used, as is standard, as a proxy for aggregate business equity returns.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn3"></span>3</sup></p><p>The data include nominal and real returns on bills, bonds, equities, and residential real estate for Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

<p>The canonical risk-free rate is taken to be the yield on Treasury bills, that is, short-term, fixed-income government securities. The yield data come from the latest vintage of the long-run macrohistory database (<span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2017).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn8"></span>8</sup> Whenever data on Treasury bill returns were unavailable, we relied on either money market rates or deposit rates of banks from <span id="jumplink-bib72"></span>Zimmermann (2017). Because short-term government debt was rarely used and issued in the earlier historical period, much of our bill rate data before the 1960s actually consist of deposit rates.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn9"></span>9</sup></p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577641" id="137577641" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-2">2. Bond Returns</h4>
<p>These are conventionally the total returns on long-term government bonds. Unlike earlier cross-country studies, we focus on the bonds listed and traded on local exchanges and denominated in local currency. This focus makes bond returns more comparable with the returns of bills, equities, and housing. Moreover, this results in a larger sample of bonds, and on bonds that are more likely to be held by the representative household in the respective country. For some countries and periods we have made use of listings on major global exchanges to fill gaps where domestic markets were thin or local exchange data were not available (for example, Australian bonds listed in New York or London). Throughout the sample we target a maturity of around 10&nbsp;years. For the second half of the twentieth century, the maturity of government bonds is generally accurately defined. For the pre-World War II period we sometimes had to rely on data for perpetuals, that is, very long-term government securities (such as the British consol). Although as a convention we refer here to government bills and bonds as “safe” assets, both are naturally exposed to inflation and default risk, for example. In fact, real returns on these assets fluctuate substantially over time, as we shall see (specifically, Sections&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">V</a> and <span id="jumplink-sec6"></span><a href="#sec6">VI</a>).</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577643" id="137577643" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-3">3. Equity Returns</h4>
<p>These returns come from a broad range of sources, including articles in economic and financial history journals, yearbooks of statistical offices and central banks, stock exchange listings, newspapers, and company reports. Throughout most of the sample, we aim to rely on indices weighted by market capitalization of individual stocks and a stock selection that is representative of the entire stock market. For some historical time periods in individual countries, however, we also make use of indices weighted by company book capital, by stock market transactions, or weighted equally due to limited data availability.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577645" id="137577645" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-4">4. Housing Returns</h4>
<p>We combine the long-run house price series introduced by <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) with a novel data set on rents drawn from the PhD thesis of <span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll (2017). For most countries, the rent series rely on the rent components of the cost of living of consumer price indices constructed by national statistical offices. We then combine them with information from other sources to create long-run series reaching back to the late nineteenth century. To proxy the total return on the residential housing stock, our returns include both rented housing and owner-occupied properties.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn10"></span>10</sup> Specifically, wherever possible we use house price and rental indices that include the prices of owner-occupied properties and the imputed rents on these houses. Imputed rents estimate the rent that an owner-occupied house would earn on the rental market, typically by using rents of similar houses that are rented. This means that, in principle, imputed rents are similar to market rents and are simply adjusted for the portfolio composition of owner-occupied as opposed to rented housing. Imputed rents, however, are not directly observed and hence are less precisely measured than market rents, and are typically not taxed.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn11"></span>11</sup> To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to calculate total returns to housing in the literature for as long and as comprehensive a cross section of economies as we report.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577647" id="137577647" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-5">5.

<div><p>The total annual return on any financial asset can be divided into two components: the capital gain from the change in the asset price <em>P</em>, and a yield component <em>Y</em>, that reflects the cash-flow return on an investment. The total nominal return <em>R</em> for asset <em>j</em> in country <em>i</em> at time <em>t</em> is calculated as: </p><div><div id="equ1" content-id="equ1"><p> \begin{equation}

We construct estimates for total returns on housing using the rent-price approach. This approach starts from a benchmark rent-price ratio <span>|$(\frac{RI_0}{HPI_0})$|</span> estimated in a baseline year (<em>t</em> = 0). For this ratio we rely on net rental yields from the Investment Property Database (IPD).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn13"></span>13</sup> We can then construct a time series of returns by combining separate information from a country-specific house price index series <span>|$(\frac{HPI_t}{HPI_0})$|</span> and a country-specific rent index series <span>|$(\frac{RI_t}{RI_0})$|⁠</span>. For these indices, we rely on prior work on housing prices (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017) and new data on rents (<span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll 2017). This method assumes that the indices cover a representative portfolio of houses. Under this assumption, there is no need to correct for changes in the housing stock, and only information about the growth rates in prices and rents is necessary.</p><div><p>Hence, a time series of the rent-price ratio can be derived from forward and back projection as </p><div><div id="equ10" content-id="equ10"><p> \begin{equation}
\frac{RI_{t}}{HPI_{t}} = \left[ \left(\frac{RI_{t}}{RI_0} \right) \left(\frac{HPI_0}{HPI_{t}}\right) \right] \frac{RI_0}{HPI_0} \, .
\end{equation} </p></div><p><span>(10)</span></p></div><p>In a second step, total returns on housing can then be computed as yield plus capital gains: </p><div><div id="equ11" content-id="equ11"><p> \begin{equation}
R^{housing}_{t+1}=\frac{RI_{t+1}}{HPI_t}+\frac{HPI_{t+1}-HPI_{t}}{HPI_t} \, .
\end{equation} </p></div><p><span>(11)</span></p></div></div><div><p>Our rent-price approach is sensitive to the choice of benchmark rent-price ratios and cumulative errors from year-by-year extrapolation. We verify and adjust rent-price approach estimates using a range of alternative sources. The main source for comparison is the balance sheet approach to rental yields, which calculates the rent-price ratio using national accounts data on total rental income and housing wealth. The “balance sheet” rental yield <span>|$RY^{BS}_t$|</span> is calculated as the ratio of total net rental income to total housing wealth: </p><div><div id="equ12" content-id="equ12"><p> \begin{equation}
RY^{BS}_t = \frac{\text{Net rental income}_t}{\text{Housing Wealth}_t}.
\end{equation} </p></div><p><span>(12)</span></p></div><p>This balance sheet rental yield estimate can then be added to the capital gains series to compute the total return on housing from the balance sheet perspective. We also collect additional point-in-time estimates of net rental yields from contemporary sources, such as newspaper advertisements. These measures are less sensitive to the accumulated extrapolation errors in <span id="jumplink-equ10"></span><a href="#equ10">equation&nbsp;(10)</a> but are themselves measured relatively imprecisely.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn14"></span>14</sup> Wherever the rent-price approach estimates diverge from these historical sources, we make adjustments to benchmark the rent-price ratio estimates to these alternative historical measures of the rental yield. We construct two additional housing return series—one benchmarked to all available alternative yield estimates, and another using primarily the balance sheet approach. The results of this exercise are discussed in <span id="jumplink-sec3-3"></span><a href="#sec3-3">Section&nbsp;III.C</a>. Briefly, all the alternative estimates are close to one another, and the differences have little bearing on any of our results.</p></div>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577663" id="137577663" data-legacy-id="sec3">III.

Although returns on housing and equities are similar, the volatility of housing returns is substantially lower, as <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II shows. Returns on the two asset classes are in the same ballpark—around 7%—but the standard deviation of housing returns is substantially smaller than that of equities (10% for housing versus 22% for equities). Predictably, with thinner tails, the compounded return (using the geometric average) is vastly better for housing than for equities—6.6% for housing versus 4.7% for equities. This finding appears to contradict one of the basic tenets of modern valuation models: higher risks should come with higher rewards.</p><p>Differences in asset returns are not driven by unusual events in the early pre-World War II part of the sample. <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II, Panel B makes this point.

Comparison To Existing Literature</h3>
<p>Earlier work on asset returns has mainly focused on equities and the corresponding risk premium over safe assets (bills or bonds), starting with Shiller’s analysis of historical U.S. data (<span id="jumplink-bib64"></span>Shiller 1981), later extended to cover post-1920 Sweden and the United Kingdom (<span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell 1999), and other advanced economies back to 1900 (<span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton 2009) or back to 1870 (<span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa 2008). The general consensus in this literature is that equities earn a large premium over safe assets. The cross-country estimates of this premium vary between 7% in <span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa (2008) and 6% in <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009) using arithmetic means. <span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell (1999) documents a 4.7% geometric mean return premium instead.</p><p>We find a similarly high, though smaller, equity premium using our somewhat larger and more consistent historical data set. Our estimate of the risk premium stands at 5.9% using arithmetic means and 3.8% using geometric means (see <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II). This is lower than the estimates by <span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell (1999) and <span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa (2008). The average risk premium is similar to that found by <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009), but our returns tend to be slightly lower for the overlapping time period.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn17"></span>17</sup> Details aside, our data confirm the central finding of the literature on equity market returns: stocks earn a large premium over safe assets.</p><p>Studies on historical housing returns, starting with the seminal work of Robert Shiller (see <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller 2000 for a summary), have largely focused on capital gains. The rental yield component has received relatively little attention and in many cases is missing entirely. Most of the literature pre-dating our work has therefore lacked the necessary data to calculate, infer, or discuss the total rates of return on housing over the long run. The few studies that take rents into account generally focus on the post-1970s U.S. sample and often on commercial real estate. Most existing evidence either places the real estate risk premium between equities and bonds or finds that it is similar to that for equities (see <span id="jumplink-bib63"></span>Ruff 2007; <span id="jumplink-bib23"></span>Francis and Ibbotson 2009; <span id="jumplink-bib33"></span>Ilmanen 2011; <span id="jumplink-bib20"></span>Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh 2017). Some studies have even found that over the recent period, real estate seems to outperform equities in risk-adjusted terms (<span id="jumplink-bib66"></span>Shilling 2003; <span id="jumplink-bib12"></span>Cheng, Lin, and Liu 2008).</p><p>The stylized fact from the studies on long-run housing capital appreciation is that over long horizons, house prices only grow a little faster than the consumer price index. But again, note that this is only the capital gain component in <span id="jumplink-equ1"></span><a href="#equ1">equation (1)</a>. Low levels of real capital gains to housing was shown by <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000) for the United States, and is also true, although to a lesser extent, in other countries, as documented in <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017). Our long-run average capital appreciation data for the United States largely come from <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000), with two exceptions. For the 1930s, we use the more representative index of <span id="jumplink-bib21"></span>Fishback and Kollmann (2015) that documents a larger fall in prices during the Great Depression. From 1975 onward, we use a Federal Housing Finance Agency index, which has a slightly broader coverage. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> M compares our series with Shiller’s data and finds that switching to Shiller’s index has no effect on our results for the United States. See also the online appendix of <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) for further discussion.</p><p>However, our article turns this notion of low housing returns on its head—because we show that including the yield component in <span id="jumplink-equ1"></span><a href="#equ1">equation (1)</a> in the housing return calculation generates a housing risk premium roughly as large as the equity risk premium. Prior to our work on historical rental yields, this finding could not be known. Coincidentally, in our long-run data we find that most of the real equity return also comes from the dividend yield rather than from real equity capital gains, which are low, especially before the 1980s. Thus the post-1980 observation of large capital gain components in equity and housing total returns is completely unrepresentative of the normal long-run patterns in the data, another fact underappreciated before now.</p><p>Data on historical returns for all major asset classes allow us to compute the return on aggregate wealth (see <span id="jumplink-equ7"></span><a href="#equ7">equation&nbsp;(7)</a>). In turn, this return can be decomposed into various components by asset class, and into capital gains and yields, to better understand the drivers of aggregate wealth fluctuations. This connects our study to the literature on capital income and the stock of capital (or wealth) from a national accounts perspective. Even though national accounts and national balance sheet estimates have existed for some time (see <span id="jumplink-bib45"></span>Kuznets 1941; <span id="jumplink-bib27"></span>Goldsmith 1985), only recently have scholars systematized and compared these data to calculate a series of returns on national wealth.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn18"></span>18</sup></p><p><span id="jumplink-bib57"></span>Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018) compute balance sheet returns on aggregate wealth and for individual asset classes using post-1913 U.S. data.

Housing returns are very similar. However, equity returns are several percentage points above our estimates and those in the market-based returns literature more generally. Part of this difference reflects the fact that balance sheet returns are computed to measure income before corporate taxes, whereas our returns take the household perspective and are therefore net of corporate tax. Another explanation for the difference is likely to come from some measurement error in the national accounts data.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn19"></span>19</sup> When it comes to housing, our rental yield estimates are broadly comparable and similar to those derived using the balance sheet approach, for a broad selection of countries and historical time spans.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn20"></span>20</sup></p><p>Our data set complements the market-based return literature by increasing the coverage in terms of assets, return components, countries, and years; improving data consistency and documentation; and making the data set freely available for future research.

Accuracy of Equity Returns</h3>
<p>The literature on equity returns has highlighted two main sources of bias in the data: weighting and sample selection. Weighting biases arise when the stock portfolio weights for the index do not correspond with those of a representative investor or a representative agent in the economy.

Weighting Bias</h4>
<p>The best practice when weighting equity indices is to use market capitalization of individual stocks. This approach most closely mirrors the composition of a hypothetical representative investor’s portfolio. Equally-weighted indices are likely to overweight smaller firms, which tend to carry higher returns and higher volatility.</p><p>The existing evidence from historical returns on the Brussels and Paris stock exchanges suggests that using equally-weighted indices biases returns up by around 0.5 percentage points, and their standard deviation up by 2–3 percentage points (<span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010; <span id="jumplink-bib2"></span>Annaert et al. 2011). The size of the bias, however, is likely to vary across markets and time periods. For example, <span id="jumplink-bib29"></span>Grossman (2017) shows that the market-weighted portfolio of UK stocks outperformed its equally-weighted counterpart over the period 1869–1929.</p><p>To minimize this bias, we use market-capitalization-weighted indices for the vast majority of our sample (see <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Table&nbsp;A.29 and <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> X). Where market capitalization weighting was not available, we have generally used alternative weights such as book capital or transaction volumes, rather than equally-weighted averages.

Selection and Survivorship Bias</h4>
<p>Relying on an index whose selection does not mirror the representative investor’s portfolio carries two main dangers. First, a small sample may be unrepresentative of overall stock market returns. Second, a sample that is selected ad hoc, and especially ex post, is likely to focus on surviving firms, or successful firms, thus overstating investment returns. This second bias extends not only to stock prices but also to dividend payments, as some historical studies only consider dividend-paying firms.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn21"></span>21</sup> The magnitude of survivorship bias has generally been found to be around 0.5 to 1 percentage point (<span id="jumplink-bib53"></span>Nielsen and Risager 2001; <span id="jumplink-bib3"></span>Annaert, Buelens, and De Ceuster 2012), but in some time periods and markets it could be larger (see <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010 for France).</p><p>As a first best, we always strive to use all-share indices that avoid survivor and selection biases. For some countries and time periods where no such indices were previously available, we have constructed new weighted all-share indices from original historical sources (e.g., early historical data for Norway and Spain). Where an all-share index was not available or newly constructed, we have generally relied on blue-chip stock market indices. These are based on an ex ante value-weighted sample of the largest firms on the market. It is updated each year and tends to capture the lion’s share of total market capitalization. Because the sample is selected ex ante, it avoids ex post selection and survivorship biases. Because historical equity markets have tended to be quite concentrated, blue-chip indices have been shown to be a good proxy for all-share returns (see <span id="jumplink-bib2"></span>Annaert et al. 2011). Finally, we include non-dividend-paying firms in the dividend yield calculation.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577693" id="137577693" data-legacy-id="sec3-2-3">3. Stock Market Closures and Trading Restrictions</h4>
<p>A more subtle form of selection bias arises when the stock market is closed and no market price data are available. One way of dealing with closures is to simply exclude them from the baseline return comparisons. But this implicitly assumes that the data are “missing at random”—that is, that stock market closures are unrelated to underlying equity returns. Existing research on rare disasters and equity premiums shows that this is unlikely to be true (<span id="jumplink-bib52"></span>Nakamura et al. 2013). Stock markets tend to be closed precisely when we would expect returns to be low, such as periods of war and civil unrest. Return estimates that exclude such rare disasters from the data will thus overstate stock returns.</p><p>To guard against this bias, we include return estimates for the periods of stock market closure in our sample. Where possible, we rely on alternative data sources to fill the gap, such as listings of other exchanges and over-the-counter transactions—for example, in the case of World War I Germany we use the over-the-counter index from <span id="jumplink-bib62"></span>Ronge (2002) and for World War II France we use the newspaper index from <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur (2010). In cases where alternative data are not available, we interpolate the prices of securities listed before and after the exchange was closed to estimate the return (if no dividend data are available, we also assume no dividends were paid).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn22"></span>22</sup></p><p>Even though this approach only gives us a rough proxy of returns, it is certainly better than excluding these periods, which effectively assumes that the return during stock market closures is the same as when the stock markets are open. In the end, we only have one instance of stock market closure for which we are unable to estimate returns—that of the Tokyo stock exchange in 1946–1947. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> H further assesses the impact of return interpolation on the key moments of our data and finds that over the full sample, it is negligible.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblIII"></span>Table&nbsp;III shows the estimated stock returns during the periods of stock exchange closure in our sample. The first two columns show average and cumulative real returns, and the third and fourth columns show the nominal returns.

(2013) also highlight a more subtle bias arising from asset price controls. This generally involves measures by the government to directly control transaction prices, as in Germany during 1943–47, or to influence the funds invested in the domestic stock market (and hence the prices) via controls on spending and investment, as in France during World War II (<span id="jumplink-bib46"></span>Le Bris 2012). These measures are more likely to affect the timing of returns rather than their long-run average level and should have little impact on our headline estimates. For example, Germany experienced negative nominal and real returns despite the World War II stock price controls; and even though the policies it enacted in occupied France succeeded in generating high nominal stock returns, the real return on French stocks during 1940–44 was close to zero. Both instances were followed by sharp drops in stock prices when the controls were lifted.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn23"></span>23</sup></p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577702" id="137577702" data-legacy-id="sec3-3">III.C. Accuracy of Housing Returns</h3>
<p>The biases that affect equity returns—weighting and selection—can also apply to returns on housing. There are also other biases that are specific to housing return estimates. These include costs of running a housing investment and the benchmarking of rent-price ratios to construct the historical rental yield series. We discuss these problematic issues in this section. Our focus is mainly on rental yield data, as the accuracy and robustness of the house price series has been extensively discussed in <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) in their <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">online appendix</a></span>.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577704" id="137577704" data-legacy-id="sec3-3-1">1. Maintenance Costs</h4>
<p>Any homeowner incurs costs for maintenance and repairs, which lower the rental yield and thus the effective return on housing. We deal with this issue by the choice of the benchmark rent-price ratios. Specifically, we anchor to the Investment Property Database (IPD), whose rental yields reflect net income—net of property management costs, ground rent, and other unrecoverable expenditure—as a percentage of the capital employed. The rental yields calculated using the rent-price approach detailed in <span id="jumplink-sec2-4"></span><a href="#sec2-4">Section&nbsp;II.D</a> are therefore net yields. To enable a like-for-like comparison, our historical benchmark yields are calculated net of estimated running costs and depreciation. Running costs are broadly defined as housing-related expenses excluding interest, taxes, and utilities—that is, maintenance costs, management, and insurance fees.</p><p>Applying the rent-price approach to net yield benchmarks assumes that running costs remain stable relative to gross rental income over time within each country. To check this, <span id="jumplink-fig3"></span>Figure&nbsp;III presents historical estimates of running costs and depreciation for Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, calculated as the sum of the corresponding housing expenditures and fixed capital consumption items in the national accounts. The left panel presents these as a proportion of total housing value and the right panel as a proportion of gross rent. Relative to housing value, costs have been stable over the past 40&nbsp;years, but were somewhat higher in the early to mid-twentieth century. This is to be expected because these costs are largely related to structures, not land, and structures constituted a greater share of housing value in the early twentieth century (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017). In addition, structures themselves may have been of poorer quality in past times. When taken as a proportion of gross rent, however, as shown in the right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig3"></span>Figure&nbsp;III, housing costs have been relatively stable, or at least not higher historically than they are today. This is likely because gross yields and costs are low today, whereas historically yields and costs were higher, with the two effects more or less canceling out.

Rental Yield Benchmarking</h4>
<p>To construct historical rental yield series using the rent-price approach, we start with a benchmark rent-price ratio from the IPD and extend the series back using the historical rent and house price indices (see <span id="jumplink-sec2-4"></span><a href="#sec2-4">Section&nbsp;II.D</a>).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn24"></span>24</sup> This naturally implies that the level of returns is sensitive to the choice of the benchmark ratio. Moreover, past errors in rent and house price indices can potentially accumulate over time and may cause one to substantially over- or understate historical rental yields and housing returns. If the historical capital gains are overstated, the historical rental yields will be overstated, too.</p><p>To try to avert such problems, we corroborate our rental yield estimates using a wide range of alternative historical and current-day sources. The main source of these independent comparisons comes from estimates using the balance sheet approach and national accounts data. As shown in <span id="jumplink-equ12"></span><a href="#equ12">equation&nbsp;(12)</a>, the “balance sheet” rental yield is the ratio of nationwide net rental income to total housing wealth. Net rental income is computed as gross rents paid less depreciation, maintenance, and other housing-related expenses (excluding taxes and interest), with all data taken from the national accounts. The balance sheet approach gives us a rich set of alternative rental yield estimates both for the present day and even going back in time to the beginning of our sample in a number of countries. The second source for historical comparisons comes from advertisements in contemporary newspapers and various other contemporary publications. Third, we also make use of alternative current-day benchmarks based on transaction-level market rent data, and the rental expenditure and house price data from <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/" target="_blank">Numbeo.com</a>.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn25"></span>25</sup> For all these measures, we adjust gross yields down to obtain a proxy for net rental yields.</p><p>Historical sources offer point-in-time estimates that avoid the cumulation of errors but can nevertheless be imprecise. The balance sheet approach relies on housing wealth and rental income data, both of which are subject to potential measurement error. For housing wealth, it is inherently difficult to measure the precise value of all dwellings in the economy. Rental income is largely driven by the imputed rents of homeowners, which have to be estimated from market rents by matching the market rent to owner-occupied properties based on various property characteristics. This procedure can suffer from errors in the survey data on property characteristics and market rents, and the matching algorithm.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn26"></span>26</sup> Newspaper advertisements are tied to a specific location and are often biased toward cities. And transaction-level or survey data sometimes only cover the rental sector, rather than both renters and homeowners.</p><p>Given the potential measurement error in all the series, our final rental yield series uses data from both the rent-price approach and the alternative benchmarks listed above. More precisely, we use the following method to construct our final “best-practice” rental yield series. If the rent-price approach estimates are close to alternative measures, we keep the rent-price approach data. This is the case for most historical periods in our sample. If there is a persistent level difference between the rent-price approach and alternative estimates, we adjust the benchmark yield to better match the historical and current data across the range of sources. This is the case for Australia and Belgium. If the levels are close for recent data but diverge historically, we adjust the historical estimates to match the alternative benchmarks. For most countries, such adjustments are small or only apply to a short time span, but for Finland and Spain they are more substantial. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> U details the alternative sources and rental yield construction, including any such adjustments, for each country.</p><p>How large is the room for error in our final housing return series?

Geographic Coverage and Selection Biases</h4>
<p>Our data aim to approximate the return on a representative agent’s housing portfolio. Selection bias means that the selection of properties in our data set does not mirror the balance sheet of the representative agent. The main reason for this bias is selective geographical coverage. Housing returns can vary a lot by location, and our data are based on a sample of housing transactions.</p><p>To make our samples as representative as possible, we strive to attain a broad geographic coverage for both house price and rental data. <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) discuss the potential location biases in house price data but find that the house price trends in their, and hence our, data set should be representative of country-level trends. When it comes to rents, the benchmark IPD yields are based on portfolios of institutional investors, which are slightly biased toward cities. This would lead to lower yields than the national average. On the other hand, investors may select higher-yielding properties within any given city. Comparisons with aggregate balance sheet approach data and alternative estimates indicate that, on average, IPD yields tend to be representative at country level. Furthermore, IPD yields are capitalization weighted, which again better captures the yield on a representative portfolio. Finally, we aim for national coverage with the historical rental indices used for extrapolation and historical balance sheet benchmarks.</p><p>Despite this, our house price and rental data are likely somewhat biased toward cities and urban areas, especially for historical periods—simply because urban housing data are more widely available and researched. Even though this would affect the level of capital gain and yield, it should have little influence on total returns, since cities tend to have higher capital gains but lower rental yields.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn33"></span>33</sup> In addition, <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that the rural-urban divide has a relatively small impact on capital gains. Relatedly, we can establish some bounds on how much our rental yields can vary with the choice of location. In 2013, <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/" target="_blank">Numbeo.com</a> data suggest that price-rent ratios in and out of city centers differ by less than three times annual rent. The rental yield is the inverse of these price-rent ratios. This motivates us to construct a lower-bound rent-price ratio as <span>|$RP_{low}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{RP_{actual}}+3}$|</span> and an upper-bound rent-price ratio as <span>|$RP_{high}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{RP_{actual}}-3}$|</span> for each country in 2013 to estimate upper and lower bounds of our housing returns depending on the choice of location. Given the currently high price-rent ratios, these adjustments have a relatively small impact on our data. <span id="jumplink-fig5"></span>Figure&nbsp;V shows that increasing or reducing the price-rent ratio by three changes annual return estimates by about ±1 percentage point a year relative to our preferred baseline.</p>                    <div data-id="fig5" data-content-id="fig5" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig5.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=USEZiaKFFSidl0pCycPu~x7vhK2fR7XR-xWB8CGe49tbTLKnjxfINdHBo5uMRb6jNFliFmB2-Nkflp1q-UVcerXsIOLaNPLP1XJppzRJydYsv9GuWMJqGrtW2pW5~woS1ZpC7FaR~hBf6IrWUMDI6Gx8somgovgkLwBot31xWAfSyCerL9~045wLoU2H3l~Er~5ziDo5xfHUEZXKaNvSGdK4Pmks9aPus4eHlhfhH3xx0G3lL0g011iEGINPIMNlZ1SqKuvnzhiDxn78qxKlhODEJvHjEiA-5inViYYiduJ2baPu7i9R7TtOV4n9JexRUoWCfqYYv8yaG4HxlA6sUQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Sensitivity of Housing Returns to a Rent-Price Location Correction" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure V</p><div><p>Sensitivity of Housing Returns to a Rent-Price Location Correction</p><p>Bars show the arithmetic- and geometric-average housing returns for selected subperiods.

Still, it could be that returns on locations not included in our sample display higher volatility. For example, the post-1975 U.S. indices are based on conforming mortgages and may exclude the more volatile segments of the market. To assess the likely magnitude of this bias, <span id="jumplink-tblV"></span>Table V compares the recent level and volatility of the U.S. conforming mortgage based OFHEO house price indices with those that cover other segments of the market as well, which are sourced from Zillow.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn34"></span>34</sup> Comparing the second and third columns of <span id="jumplink-tblV"></span>Table V, the nationwide moments of the data are similar across the two measures—but as expected, the OFHEO data display slightly higher real capital gains and slightly lower volatility, because they have a less comprehensive coverage of the areas that were hit hardest by the subprime crisis, which receives a relatively high weight in the 1995–2015 U.S. sample used here.</p>                    <div content-id="tblV"><div id="tblV" data-id="tblV"><p><span id="label-70465">Table V</span></p><p>Level and Volatility of Real Housing Capital Gains at Different Levels of Coverage and Aggregation</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

The standard deviation of ZIP code–level housing returns is roughly one-third higher than that in the national data. If investors owned one undiversified house whose price tracks the neighborhood index, the risk and return characteristics of this portfolio would be somewhat closer to those of the aggregate equity index, although the gap would still be large.</p><p>Of course, it is much more difficult to invest in a diversified housing portfolio than a well diversified equity portfolio. That being said, <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) show that most equity is also held in an undiversified manner. The data regarding returns on individual housing and private equity returns are, however, very sparse at this point in time. To understand exactly how these risk-return characteristics play out at a disaggregated level, a more detailed study of individual portfolios and returns is necessary. This would be a worthy goal of future research.</p><p>Another selection bias comes about from the fact that rent data largely come from the rental market, whereas the majority of housing stock is held by owner-occupiers. To guard against this, we rely on rental indices that, whenever possible, account for the growth of imputed rents. We also benchmark our series to the balance sheet yield data constructed to cover the total housing stock. Still, imputed rents are measured with error and may not reflect the cost that the homeowner would pay on the rental market. If owning is relatively cheaper than renting—for example, due to tax exemptions or long-run house price appreciation—homeowners would purchase larger or better houses than they would rent, and imputed rents would overstate the value of housing services accruing to homeowners. On the other hand, buying a house is subject to credit constraints, which means that renters can afford better houses than homeowners, all else equal. In this case, imputed rents would understate the flow value of housing services. Overall, the direction of any potential bias is unclear and leaves much scope for future work.</p><p>Finally, the portfolio selection in the price and rent series is subject to survivorship bias. In general, our price and rental yield estimates aim to capture transaction or appraisal values, and rental costs on a broad and impartially selected portfolio of properties. Some survivorship bias may enter the series for the following reasons. First, indices that rely on an ex post selection of cities may inadvertently choose the more “successful” cities over the less successful ones. Second, houses that decline in value are likely to lose liquidity and be sold less frequently, hence carrying a lower weight in the index. Third, chain-linking historical house price and rent indices to compute annual returns will generally ignore the impact of large destructions of the housing stock, particularly those occurring during wartime.</p><p>Several factors suggest that the impact of survivorship bias on housing returns should be limited. First, <span id="jumplink-fig5"></span>Figure&nbsp;V and <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that any location-specific bias in our estimates is likely to be small. Second, if the magnitude of survivorship bias is similar to that in equity markets (<span id="jumplink-sec3-2"></span><a href="#sec3-2">Section&nbsp;III.B</a>), the bias is also unlikely to be large. Third, the low liquidity and weight of houses with declining prices is in some ways similar to the documented negative returns on delisted equities (<span id="jumplink-bib67"></span>Shumway 1997; <span id="jumplink-bib68"></span>Shumway and Warther 1999) which, generally, cannot be incorporated into the stock return series due to the lack of data.

Returns on Real Estate Investment Trusts</h4>
<p>Another way to check our housing returns is to compare them to the historical returns on housing investment trusts. These trusts offer independent estimates of returns. Real estate investment trusts (REITs), are investment funds that specialize in the purchase and management of residential and commercial real estate. Many of these funds list their shares on the local stock exchange. The return on these shares should closely track total real estate returns. Differences will arise because the REIT portfolio is more geographically concentrated, its assets often contain nonresidential property, and share price fluctuations may reflect expectations of future earnings and sentiment, as well as underlying portfolio returns. Furthermore, the REIT portfolio returns should be net of taxes and transaction costs as well as housing running costs, and may thus be somewhat lower than our housing series. Still, returns on the REIT portfolio should be comparable to housing and can be used to check the general plausibility of our return series.</p><p><span id="jumplink-fig6"></span>Figure&nbsp;VI compares our historical housing returns (dashed line) with those on investments in REITs (solid line) in France and the United States, two countries for which longer-run REIT return data are available. The REIT returns series for France refers to shares of the fund La Fourmi Immobilière (see <span id="jumplink-bib69"></span>Simonnet, Gallais-Hamonno, and Arbulu 1998). The fund acquired a portfolio of 15 properties in Paris between 1900 and 1913, worth around €36 million at 2015 prices, and its shares were listed on the Paris stock exchange between 1904 and 1997. We exclude the period after 1985, when La Fourmi Immobilière was taken over by AGF. For the United States, we use the FTSE NAREIT residential total return index after 1994, and the general FTSE equity NAREIT before. REIT returns have to be unlevered to capture the returns on the REIT housing portfolio. La Fourmi Immobilière had an unlevered balance sheet structure, hence we do not adjust their returns. We assume a REIT leverage of 45% for the United States following <span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>Giacomini, Ling, and Naranjo (2015). Returns for France are presented as decadal moving averages, and for the United States as five-year moving averages, given the shorter span of the U.S. data.</p>                    <div data-id="fig6" data-content-id="fig6" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig6.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=Nf7QbckYLxsaiSVaf~PHHArYoIPwEPoEb4dbMPkDt0kRwfLuI-4FSEBX-FEZRT30WnJjI1ARj6VbO2a4jsR743lDFL49p1EIuGO6-yD2NX8rDwLMD9GkdaPu2ZppISohC~p52iUxdaHwdwEXPPjyxGsmpqaV6RxAVge0Ep1JKkzsPB07ijTyH-Aig8zfSzJ2Wv6g2UAEpQBYAcfPz1jWmePHRA3DfUGe461bANlBDhsYRxG9G2vKeC~fvdrQVERWImTLyfg-riNrIwCTCDvbAL9YlWUkFWKNdrVNF2E8TyTJgTVwT~YDiT0adxDLaox~o1yzbQpv15y8wfTGmRrRfA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Returns on Housing Compared to Real Estate Investment Funds" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure VI</p><div><p>Returns on Housing Compared to Real Estate Investment Funds</p><p>Total real return on housing, and shares of housing investment firms in France and the U.S. Moving averages.

The time trend also follows a similar pattern, especially in France. The REIT returns, however, tend to be somewhat more volatile—most likely because they reflect changes in the market’s valuations of future earnings and the current portfolio performance. The REIT returns also seem to be affected by the general ups and downs of the stock market: for example, the 1987 Black Monday crash and dot-com bust in the United States, as well as the 1930s Great Depression and 1960s stock crises in France. This suggests that the valuations of the funds’ housing portfolios may have been affected by shifts in general stock market sentiment, possibly unrelated to housing market fundamentals.</p><p>Overall, the returns on real estate investment funds serve to confirm the general housing return level in our data set. The comparison also suggests that returns in housing markets tend to be smoother than those in stock markets. The next section examines various factors that can affect the comparability of housing and equity returns more generally.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577761" id="137577761" data-legacy-id="sec3-4">III.D. Comparability of Housing and Equity Returns</h3>
<p>Even if the fundamentals driving housing and equity returns (expected dividend/profit, and rental flows) are similar, investor returns for the two asset classes may differ for a number of reasons including taxes, transaction costs, and the financial structure of the investment claim. In this subsection we consider such comparability issues.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577763" id="137577763" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-1">1. Transaction Costs</h4>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that while bonds and equities can be purchased with low transaction costs and at short notice, the seller of a house typically incurs significant costs. We provide a rough estimate of how transaction costs affect our return estimates for housing. We perform a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation to do this using contemporary data on average holding periods of residential real estate and average transaction costs incurred by the buyer. According to the <span id="jumplink-bib54"></span>OECD (2012), average round-trip transaction costs across 13 of the 16 countries in our sample amount to about 7.7% of the property’s value.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn36"></span>36</sup></p><p>However, these simple cost ratios need to be adjusted for the typical trading frequency of each asset. According to the American Community Survey of 2007, more than 50% of U.S. homeowners had lived in their current home for more than 10&nbsp;years. Current average holding periods are similar in, for example, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands. Another way to estimate housing turnover is using housing sales data, which for the United States gives us an average holding period of close to 20&nbsp;years.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn37"></span>37</sup> Either way, accounting for transaction costs would thus lower the average annual return to housing by less than 100 basis points (e.g., 77 basis points a year based on a 7.7% cost incurred every 10&nbsp;years).</p><p>For equities, the cost of each individual transaction is much smaller, but the number of transactions is much higher. <span id="jumplink-bib34"></span>Jones (2002) estimates that at the New York Stock Exchange over the period 1900–2001, the average transaction cost was around 80 bps (half bid-ask spread of 30 bps plus commission rate of 50&nbsp;bps), and turnover was roughly 60% a year, resulting in the annual average equity transaction costs of 40 bps. Comparing this number to the back-of-the-envelope housing transaction cost estimates reported above, it seems that even though equity transaction costs are probably somewhat lower, the difference between two asset classes is likely to be small—and no more than 0.5 percentage points a year.</p><p>The fact that housing faces much higher costs per each transaction, however, means that the realized housing transaction costs may understate the “shadow” utility cost, which would include the suboptimal allocation choices from staying in the same house and not moving, for example. It might also reduce the volatility of housing returns, making them react more sluggishly to shocks. This means that the relatively modest short-run volatility of housing returns could mask more pronounced fluctuations at lower frequencies. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> K and Table&nbsp;A.17 compare equity and housing return volatility over longer horizons of up to 20&nbsp;years. It turns out that the standard deviation of housing returns is always around one-half that of equity returns, regardless of the time horizon, which suggests that housing returns not only have lower short-run volatility but also less pronounced swings at all longer horizons.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577768" id="137577768" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-2">2. Leverage</h4>
<p>Household-level returns on real estate and equity will be affected by the structure of the household balance sheet, and how these investments are financed. <span id="jumplink-bib37"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2016) show that advanced economies in the second half of the twentieth century experienced a boom in mortgage lending and borrowing. This surge in household borrowing not only reflected rising house prices, it also reflected substantially higher household debt levels relative to asset values (and relative to household incomes). The majority of households in advanced economies today hold a leveraged portfolio in their local real estate market. As with any leveraged portfolio, this significantly increases both the risk and the return associated with the investment. And today, unlike in the early twentieth century, houses can be levered much more than equities. The benchmark rent-price ratios from the IPD used to construct estimates of the return to housing refer to rent-price ratios of unleveraged real estate. Consequently, the estimates presented so far constitute only unlevered housing returns of a hypothetical long-only investor, which is symmetric to the way we (and the literature) have treated equities.</p><p>However, computing raw returns to housing and equity indices neglects the fact that an equity investment contains embedded leverage. The underlying corporations have balance sheets with both debt and equity liabilities. Thus, reconciliation is needed, and two routes can be taken. For truly comparable raw unlevered returns, equity returns could be delevered. Alternatively, for truly comparable levered returns, housing returns would have to be levered up to factor in the actual leverage (using mortgages) seen on household balance sheets. Is this a big deal in practice? We argue that it does not bias our conclusions significantly based on some elementary calculations.</p><p>Consider, for example, the second reconciliation of levering up housing returns. Let the real long-term mortgage borrowing rate be <em>r</em><sub>0</sub>, and let α be the leverage of the average house proxied by total mortgages divided by the value of the housing stock. Then we can solve for levered real housing returns <em>TR</em>′ as a function of unlevered real housing returns <em>TR</em> using the formula <span>|$\mathit{TR^{\prime }} = \frac{\mathit {TR} - \alpha r_0}{1 - \alpha }$|⁠</span>. In our data, <em>TR</em> ≃ 7.0% and α ≃ 0.2. Using a long bond return as a proxy for <em>r</em><sub>0</sub> of around 2.5% p.a., this would imply <em>TR</em>′ = 8.1%.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn38"></span>38</sup> In other words, for the representative agent the levered housing return is about 110 bps higher than the unlevered housing return (8.1% versus 7%), a small difference. Such adjustments appear to be inconsequential for the main conclusions we present here. In fact, they would bolster one of our central new claims, which is that real housing returns at least match or even exceed real equity returns in the long run when the two are compared on an equal footing.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577772" id="137577772" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-3">3. Taxes</h4>
<p>When computing equity and housing returns we do not account for taxes. From an investor’s perspective, accounting for taxes is clearly important. Typically, equity capital gains—and, for some countries and periods, even dividend income—have been subject to a capital gains tax. When dividends are not taxed as capital gains, they tend to be taxed as income. In some countries, housing capital gains are subject to capital gains taxes, but owner-occupied houses in particular have been granted exemptions in many cases. Imputed rents of homeowners, unlike dividend income, are almost never taxed. In addition, housing tends to be subject to asset-specific levies in the form of property taxes, documented extensively in <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Y.</p><p>For equities and housing, the level and applicability of taxes has varied over time.

Second, the total tax burden on the pre–corporate-tax equity returns is likely to be higher than on housing, since in light of the various homeowner exemptions, the post–corporate-tax burden on the two assets appears to be roughly similar. Third, the returns on the two asset classes are similar before 1920, when the corporate tax rate was close to 0.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577776" id="137577776" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-4">4. Temporal Aggregation and Return Averaging</h4>
<p>The way house and equity price indices are constructed is likely to influence the volatility of the return series. The house price indices used for return calculations (e.g., indices from national statistical agencies) tend to be an average of all transactions in a given year or use a sample of transactions or appraisal values throughout the year. But the equity prices used for return calculations, by the usual convention followed here, compare end-of-year prices of shares. The use of end-of-year rather than yearly average prices mechanically makes equity returns more volatile.</p><p>We can assess the magnitude of this effect by constructing an equity return index based on annual averages of daily data, to mimic how housing returns are computed, and then comparing it to a “normal” return using end-of-year index values. For this robustness exercise we use daily MSCI equity returns data for 1970–2015. <span id="jumplink-tblVI"></span>Table&nbsp;VI presents the end-of-year and yearly average real equity returns in the first two columns, and our yearly average housing returns for the same time period in the third column. Comparing the first two columns shows that yearly averaging lowers the standard deviation of returns by around one-fifth, or 5 percentage points. It also lowers the average return by around 1 percentage point, because the return series is a transformation of the raw price data, and lowering the variance reduces the mean of the return. But the standard deviation of the smoothed yearly average equity series is still almost three times that of housing over the same time period.</p>                    <div content-id="tblVI"><div id="tblVI" data-id="tblVI"><p><span id="label-89983">Table VI</span></p><p>Impact of Using End-of-Year versus Yearly Average Asset Prices</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Global Returns</h3>
<p>We first turn in <span id="jumplink-fig7"></span>Figure&nbsp;VII to a more detailed inspection of the returns on the risky assets, equity and housing. The global returns are GDP-weighted averages of the 16 countries in our sample. Although we do not show the unweighted data, the corresponding figure would look very similar. We smooth the data using decadal moving averages as explained earlier. For example, the observation reported in 1900 is the average of data from 1895 to 1905. <span id="jumplink-fig7"></span>Figure&nbsp;VII shows the trends in decadal-average real returns on housing (solid line) and equity (dashed line) for our entire sample.

Country coverage differs across time periods.</p></div></div></div><p>Risky returns were high in the 1870s and 1880s, fell slowly at first, but then sharply after 1900, with the decade-average real equity returns turning negative during World War I. Risky returns recovered quickly in the 1920s, before experiencing a drop in the the Great Depression, especially for equities. Strikingly, after World War II the trajectories of returns for the two risky asset classes had similar long-run means but over shorter periods diverged markedly from each other.</p><p>Equity returns have experienced many pronounced global boom-bust cycles, much more so than housing returns, with average real returns as high as +16% and as low as –4% over entire decades. Equity returns fell in World War II, boomed in the postwar reconstruction, and fell off again in the climate of general macroeconomic instability in the 1970s. Equity returns bounced back following a wave of deregulation and privatization in the 1980s. The next major event was the global financial crisis, which exacted its toll on equities and to some extent housing, as we shall see.</p><p>Housing returns, on the other hand, have remained remarkably stable over almost the entire post-World War II period. As a consequence, the correlation between equity and housing returns, depicted in the top left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure&nbsp;VIII, was highly positive before World War II, but has all but disappeared over the past five decades. The low covariance of equity and housing returns over the long run reveals potential attractive gains from diversification across these two asset classes that economists, up to now, have been unable to measure or analyze.</p><p>In terms of relative returns, we see that housing persistently outperformed equity up until World War I, even though both of these asset returns followed a broadly similar temporal pattern. In recent decades, equities have slightly outperformed housing in (arithmetic, not geometric) average but with much higher volatility and cyclicality. Furthermore, upswings in equity prices have generally not coincided with times of low growth or high inflation, when standard asset pricing theory would say high returns would have been particularly valuable.</p><p>The top right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure&nbsp;VIII examines the correlation between risky rates of return and inflation. It shows that equity comoved negatively with inflation in the 1970s, while housing provided a more robust hedge against an unusually rapid surge in consumer prices. In fact, apart from the interwar period, when the world was gripped by a broad deflationary bias, we find that equity returns have comoved negatively with inflation in almost all eras. Moreover, the big downswings in equity returns in the two world wars and the 1970s coincided with periods of generally poor economic performance.</p><p>In the past two decades, equity returns have also become highly correlated across countries, as shown by the sharp rise in the degree of cross-country comovement in the bottom left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure&nbsp;VIII, measured as the average of all country-pair correlations for a given window.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn40"></span>40</sup>A well-diversified global equity portfolio has thus become less of a hedge against country-specific risk (<span id="jumplink-bib59"></span>Quinn and Voth 2008). As is a matter of debate, this may reflect greater freedom to arbitrage and trade across equity markets globally or an increase in the global shocks to which firms, especially those in the typical equity index, are increasingly exposed. In contrast to equities, cross-country housing returns have remained relatively uncorrelated, perhaps because housing assets remain less globally tradable than equities or because they are more exposed to idiosyncratic country-level shocks.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577793" id="137577793" data-legacy-id="sec4-2">IV.B. Country Returns</h3>
<p>Next we explore risky returns in individual countries. <span id="jumplink-tblVII"></span>Table&nbsp;VII shows returns on equities and housing by country for the full sample and for the post-1950 and post-1980 subsamples. Long-run risky asset returns for most countries are close to 6%–8% a year, a figure we think represents a robust and strong real return to risky capital. Still, the figures also show an important degree of heterogeneity among countries. Many of the countries that experienced large political shocks show lower equity returns. This is the case for Portugal and Spain, which both underwent prolonged civil strife, and France, which undertook a wave of nationalizations in the aftermath of World War II. French equity returns are also negatively affected by the fallout from the world wars and the fallout from an oil crisis in the 1960s (for more detail, see <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010; <span id="jumplink-bib8"></span>Blancheton, Bonin, and Le Bris 2014). In contrast, real equity returns in Finland have been as high as 10% on average throughout the sample. Housing returns also show considerable heterogeneity. Returns on housing have been high on average in the Nordic countries, but low in Italy and Spain. U.S. risky asset returns fall roughly in the middle of the country-specific figures, with equity returns slightly above average and housing returns slightly below. Our estimates of post-World War II U.S. housing returns are in line with those in <span id="jumplink-bib20"></span>Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2017).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn41"></span>41</sup> The degree of heterogeneity and the relative ranking of returns is broadly similar when comparing the full sample to the post-1950 period.</p>                    <div content-id="tblVII"><div id="tblVII" data-id="tblVII"><p><span id="label-25864">Table VII</span></p><p>Real Rates of Return on Equity and Housing</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Decomposition of Returns</h3>
<p>To further look into the underlying drivers of housing and equity returns, we decompose them into the capital gain (price) and yield (dividend or rent) components. To be consistent with the data in <span id="jumplink-sec3"></span><a href="#sec3">Section&nbsp;III</a> and <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II, we decompose real total return into real capital gain—that is, the price change net of inflation—and dividend or rental yield—that is, the nominal yield as proportion of the previous year’s share or house price.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn43"></span>43</sup> Yet caveats arise. In principle, it is not entirely clear whether inflation should be subtracted from the capital gain or yield component. Moreover, firms may buy back shares to generate low-tax capital gains instead of paying out higher-taxed dividends; thus, the manner of distribution of total returns may not be invariant to circumstances.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table&nbsp;VIII decomposes equity and housing returns into capital gains and dividends or rents, for the full cross-country sample and the period after 1950. Over the full sample, most of the real return is attributable to the yield. Dividends account for roughly 60% of real equity returns, and rents for roughly 80% of real housing returns. In terms of geometric means (<span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table&nbsp;VIII, third row), almost all of both equity and housing returns are attributable to, respectively, dividend and rental income. After 1950, capital gains become more important for both equities and housing. For equities, real capital gains account for the majority of the total return after 1950, and for housing for roughly one-third.</p>                    <div content-id="tblVIII"><div id="tblVIII" data-id="tblVIII"><p><span id="label-25864">Table VIII</span></p><p>Total Return Components for Equity and Housing</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Nevertheless, without dividends or rents, the real returns on both assets would be low, especially in geometric mean terms. This is consistent with the existing literature on real house prices: <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000) documents that house prices in the United States moved in line with inflation before the 2000s bubble, and <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that real house prices in advanced economies were more or less flat before 1950. This is also true in our data: the pre-1950 annual real housing capital gains are just 0.5%. Post-1950 capital gains are somewhat higher at 2.5%, but still only half the magnitude of the rental yields. Adding rents to the equation radically changes the picture and brings the long-run housing total return close to 7%. Interestingly, the broad picture is similar for equities: the real equity capital gain before 1950 is, on average, just 0.4%, compared with 4.7% a year after 1950. However, the contribution of dividend and rental income means that housing and equity returns were high both before and after 1950.</p><p>Although most of the return can be attributed to dividends and rents, almost all of the volatility comes from equity and house prices, that is, the capital gains component. <span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table&nbsp;VIII, second row shows that both dividends and rents are very stable, with a standard deviation of dividend/rental yields of about 2%. Prices, on the contrary, move around much more, with a standard deviation roughly equal to that of total returns (21.4% for equities and 9.9% for housing). The higher variability of equity returns and the superior risk-adjusted performance of housing can therefore largely be attributed to the lower volatility of house prices compared to those of equities. An additional factor is that capital gains—the more volatile component—account for a relatively larger share of equity returns.</p><p>Because aggregate equity prices are subject to large and prolonged swings, a representative investor would have to hold on to his equity portfolio for longer to ensure a high real return. Aggregate housing returns, on the other hand, are more stable because swings in aggregate house prices are generally less pronounced. National aggregate housing portfolios have had comparable real returns to national aggregate equity portfolios, but with only half the volatility.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblIX"></span>Table&nbsp;IX examines the relative importance of capital gains versus dividends/rents at the country level (figures are arithmetic means and standard deviations). Additionally we report the share of real total return accounted for by capital gains. The fact that the majority of housing returns come from yields is true across all countries. The lowest real capital gains are observed in Switzerland, and the highest in Finland, but none exceed 3% a year in the full sample. Rents are relatively more important in the United States, accounting for roughly 90% of returns, but this is not unusual: Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland have the same share of capital gains as the United States. For equities, the picture is more mixed. Seven countries, including the United States, have a roughly 50/50 split between real capital gain and dividend yield shares. Other countries record low or negative real capital gains over the full sample, especially in geometric mean terms (see <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Table&nbsp;A.22).</p>                    <div content-id="tblIX"><div id="tblIX" data-id="tblIX"><p><span id="label-61744">Table IX</span></p><p>Total Return Components for Equity and Housing by Country</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Decadal moving averages.</p></div></div></div><p>Three striking features of <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure&nbsp;X deserve comment. First, low real rates and, in fact, negative real rates have been relatively common in modern financial history. Second, for the most part, returns to long-term and short-term safe assets have tracked each other very closely—with a premium of about 1% that has widened considerably since the well-documented decline of the mid-1980s (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib31"></span>Holston, Laubach, and Williams 2017). Third, a major stylized fact leaps out once we compare the safe rates of return in <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure&nbsp;X to the risky rates of return in <span id="jumplink-fig7"></span>Figure&nbsp;VII. Prior to World War II, real returns on housing, safe assets, and equities followed remarkably similar trajectories. After World War II this was no longer the case.</p><p>Safe rates are far from stable in the medium term. There is enormous time-series, as well as cross-country, variability. In fact, real safe rates appear to be as volatile as real risky rates (sometimes more volatile), a topic we return to in the next section. Considerable variation in the risk premium often comes from sharp changes in safe real returns, not from real returns on risky assets.</p><p>Two four-decade-long declines in real rates stand out: (i) from 1870 to World War I (with a subsequent further collapse during the war), and (ii) the well-documented decline that started in the mid-1980s. We could add to this list the briefer, but more dramatic decline that followed the Great Depression into World War II. Some observers have therefore interpreted the recent downward trend in safe rates as a sign of a new era of “secular stagnation” (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers 2014).</p><p>However, in contrast to 1870–1913 and the 1930s, the more recent decline is characterized by a much higher term premium—a feature with few precedents in our sample.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn44"></span>44</sup> There are other periods in which real rates remained low, such as in the 1960s. They were pushed below zero, particularly for the longer-tenor bonds, during the 1970s inflation spike, although here too term premiums remained relatively tight. Returns also dipped dramatically during both world wars. This is perhaps to be expected: demand for safe assets spikes during disasters, although the dip may also reflect periods of financial repression and high inflation that usually emerge during times of conflict and often persist into peacetime. Thus, from a broad historical perspective, high rates of return on safe assets and high term premiums are more the exception than the rule.</p><p>Summing up, over more than 140&nbsp;years from the late nineteenth to the twenty-first century, real returns on safe assets have been low—on average 1% for bills and 2.5% for bonds—relative to alternative investments. Although the return volatility—measured as annual standard deviation—is lower than that of housing and equities, these assets offered little protection during high-inflation eras and during the two world wars, both periods of low consumption growth.</p><p>Again moving on to examine correlations, <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>Figure&nbsp;XI explores additional key moments of the data. The top left panel plots the correlation between real bond and real bill returns, again using decadal rolling windows and computed as the cross-sectional average of correlations. In parallel to our discussion of the term premium, real returns on bonds and bills have been highly correlated for most of the sample up until the 1960s. From the 1970s onward, the era of fiat money and higher average inflation, this correlation has become much weaker, and near zero at times, coinciding with a widening term premium.</p>                    <div data-id="fig11" data-content-id="fig11" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig11.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=J4GBeJikKLS2l2n8P23AZJQLMv39elva2D~BQH97tmVSvCwv7cAHRUn2jsRIdDFkyj-a1gpSh518bcdqzCqQrQ67MiDpgGhfGiAAKGDEszLDeZD4CamLBC3xoLVlVtwL9~Z9c~coArWoAZ6ILtQDsOKrFolAlnmGxVqzFL85BfsogJPkWvB-YzZmvO-ygjvDy5fqDR48fIoaMHu7MJ~ezHVGgDrTH57fHRutLRgfHWk7QgraD1kPaA03eeajXam2tLo872GXuF5Igy77Z5c5pjXfcCv7kIiA7ChDgeKTTO90WEhgRnY7~Wv9AQH6WleRWQHR6yixRzgPQalwc9UkLw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Correlations across Safe Asset Returns" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure XI</p><div><p>Correlations across Safe Asset Returns</p><p>Color version available online.

The figure shows that safe assets provided more of an inflation hedge starting in the 1970s, around the start of the era of modern central banking. However, as <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure&nbsp;X showed, bonds and bills have experienced prolonged periods of negative real returns—both during wartime inflations and in the high-inflation period of the late 1970s. Although safe asset rates usually comove positively with inflation, they do not always compensate the investor fully.</p><p>The bottom panel of <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>Figure&nbsp;XI displays the cross-correlation of safe returns over rolling decadal windows, averaged for all country-pair combinations, to examine how much risk can be diversified with debt instruments. Cross-country real safe returns have exhibited positive comovement throughout history. The degree of comovement shows a few marked increases in World War I and in the 1930s. The effect of these major global shocks on individual countries seems to have resulted in a higher correlation of cross-country asset returns.</p><p>Turning to cross-sectional features, <span id="jumplink-tblX"></span>Table&nbsp;X shows country-specific safe asset returns for three samples: all years, post-1950, and post-1980. Here the experiences of a few countries stand out. In France, real bill returns have been negative when averaged over the full sample. In Portugal and Spain, they have been approximately zero. In Norway, the average return on bills has been negative for the post-1950 sample. However, most other countries have experienced reasonably similar returns on safe assets, in the ballpark of 1%–3%.</p>                    <div content-id="tblX"><div id="tblX" data-id="tblX"><p><span id="label-45382">Table X</span></p><p>Real Rates of Return on Bonds and Bills</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

What matters for this is not the level of real return per se, but its comparison to real GDP growth, or <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> − <em>g</em>. If the rate of return exceeds real GDP growth, <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> &gt; <em>g</em>, reducing the debt/GDP ratio requires continuous budget surpluses. When <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> is less than <em>g</em>, however, a reduction in debt/GDP is possible even with the government running modest deficits. Existing evidence points to <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> &lt; <em>g</em> being the norm rather than the exception, both in recent years and broader historical data (<span id="jumplink-bib5"></span>Ball, Elmendorf, and Mankiw 1998; <span id="jumplink-bib50"></span>Mehrotra 2017).</p><p><span id="jumplink-fig12"></span>Figure&nbsp;XII plots the representative “safe rate of return” as the arithmetic average of bond and bill returns (dashed line) alongside real GDP growth (solid line), again as decadal moving averages. Starting in the late nineteenth century, safe rates were higher than GDP growth, meaning that any government wishing to reduce debt had to run persistent budget surpluses. Indeed, this was the strategy adopted by Britain to pay off the debt incurred during the Napoleonic War (<span id="jumplink-bib13"></span>Crafts 2016). The two world wars saw low real returns, but nevertheless a large debt accumulation to finance the wartime effort. The aftermath of these two wars, however, offered vastly different experiences for public finances. After World War I, safe returns were high and growth low, requiring significant budgetary efforts to repay the war debts. This was particularly difficult for many countries given the large interlocking reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, and the turbulent macroeconomic environment at the time. After World War II, on the contrary, high growth and inflation helped greatly reduce the value of national debt, creating <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> − <em>g</em> gaps as large as –10 percentage points.</p>                    <div data-id="fig12" data-content-id="fig12" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig12.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=LZLY4Eiu2ZLZiyofpCLrtRi8piWOAAqjg5VopiEGMn-Jx8kSu8GgHuBdbCtkU609MapqDREhsXL91fWMzXc0YxWjRetAV~ftbL2g-3x2MWKSK-KusLY0lAv9Lx02y7mSFLIr2RuV48WykXRMJrP9hdIwN-xKAgivfcgOYXmEXjFyYK4fiiOa9C7Pd47B2gHDv50dgqzFlkZEXWo5r~S8edk9xaNjYGrAG2l8P5l3CYHcmzeQp~cyKGvOELUpC5WlZKtBl6L1jZk2Pfqvo9r~RF~lW~Y~HQLZtQ3pAKpXWzmbDEyMwu-Z6wfUJmrVsROJ-BDQwBxgL~h3RGRFMh~MUQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Trends in the Real Return on Safe Assets and GDP Growth" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure XII</p><div><p>Trends in the Real Return on Safe Assets and GDP Growth</p><p>Mean returns and GDP growth for 16 countries, weighted by real GDP.

On average throughout our sample, the real growth rate has been around 1 percentage point higher than the safe rate of return (3% growth versus 2% safe rate), meaning that governments could run small deficits without increasing the public debt burden.</p><p>In sum, real returns on safe assets have been quite low across the advanced countries over the past 150&nbsp;years. In fact, for some countries, these returns have often been persistently negative. Periods of unexpected inflation, in war and peace, have often diluted returns, and flights to safety may have depressed safe returns even further in the more turbulent periods of global financial history. The low return for investors has, on the flipside, implied a low financing cost for governments, which was particularly important in reducing the debts incurred during World War II.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577827" id="137577827" data-legacy-id="sec6">VI.

The safe return is a simple unweighted average of bonds and bills.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn45"></span>45</sup> The left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig13"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIII shows the risky and safe asset returns, and the right panel depicts the risk premium, calculated as the risky minus safe difference.</p><p>As in <span id="jumplink-sec4"></span><a href="#sec4">Sections IV</a> and <span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">V</a>, the data presented here measure ex post returns and risk premiums, inclusive of capital gains. For some of the debates we touch on, however, a forward-looking expected return measure would have been preferable. Realized returns are likely to fall below ex ante return expectations during periods of large negative shocks, such as the two world wars, and rise above them in times of high capital gains, such as that between 1980 and today. Long-run data on expected returns are, however, difficult to obtain. Our focus on long-run trends, to an extent, allows us to look through some of the unexpected shocks that drive a wedge between ex ante and ex post returns. Nevertheless, the discussion in this section should be treated with a note of caution.</p><p>Both risky and safe returns were high during the nineteenth century but had been gradually declining in the run up to World War I, after which they declined sharply, as is to be expected. After the war, returns were recovering during the 1920s. From 1930 onward, the risky return stayed high and relatively stable, whereas the safe return dropped sharply and remained low until the late 1970s, before increasing and falling back again over the past three decades. These findings have implications for current debates around secular stagnation and the pricing, or mispricing, of risk.</p><p>Secular stagnation is associated with low rates of return, driven by an excess of savings or a general unwillingness to borrow and invest. These in turn reflect a variety of potential factors, including (i) lower rates of productivity growth; (ii) lower fertility and mortality rates; (iii) a decline in the relative price of investment goods; (iv) greater firm-level market power; and (v) higher income inequality (<span id="jumplink-bib60"></span>Rachel and Smith 2015; <span id="jumplink-bib17"></span>Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and Robbins 2017; <span id="jumplink-bib71"></span>Thwaites 2015).</p><p>Indeed, we can see that the safe return fell sharply during the 1930s, when <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>Hansen (1939) originally proposed the secular stagnation hypothesis. That time also coincided with a demographic bust and was preceded by a big rise in income inequality in the run-up to the Great Depression. The safe return has been falling again since the mid-1980s, as many have noted.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn46"></span>46</sup> Understandably, this has led some observers to suggest that advanced economies are again in danger of entering secular stagnation, for example, <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers (2014) and <span id="jumplink-bib16"></span>Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014).</p><p>The picture changes radically when we consider the trend in risky returns in addition to safe returns. Unlike safe returns, risky returns have remained high and broadly stable through the best part of the past 100&nbsp;years, and show little sign of a secular decline. Turning back to the trend for safe assets, even though the safe return has declined recently, much as it did at the start of our sample, it remains close to its historical average. These two observations call into question whether secular stagnation is quite with us. The high and stable risky return coupled with falling safe rates could also be consistent with the notion of a “safety trap” brought about by the relative shortage of safe assets (<span id="jumplink-bib10"></span>Caballero and Farhi 2017). However, with risk premiums still not far off their historical averages, the evidence for a safety trap is thus far also not clear-cut.</p><p>We turn to examine the long-run developments in the ex post risk premium, that is, the spread between safe and risky returns (right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig13"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIII). This spread was low and stable at around 5 percentage points before World War I. It rose slightly after World War I, before falling to an all-time low of near zero by around 1930. The decades following the onset of World War II saw a dramatic widening in the risk premium, with the spread reaching its historical high of around 14 percentage points in the 1950s, before falling back to around its historical average.</p><p>Interestingly, the period of high risk premiums coincided with an era of few systemic banking crises. In fact, not a single such crisis occurred in our advanced-economy sample between 1946 and 1973. By contrast, banking crises appear to have been relatively more frequent when risk premiums were low. This finding speaks to the recent literature on the mispricing of risk around financial crises. Among others, <span id="jumplink-bib42"></span>Krishnamurthy and Muir (2017) argue that when risk is underpriced, that is, risk premiums are excessively low, severe financial crises become more likely.</p><p>The long-run trends in risk premiums presented here seem to confirm this hypothesis. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> F further examines how these long-run movements in the risk premium, and the returns on the individual risky and safe asset classes, correspond to the changing monetary regimes, and finds, in accordance with <span id="jumplink-fig13"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIII, that the risk premium during the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate era was unusually high by historical standards, driven largely by the low, even negative, safe asset returns but also by reasonably high housing returns.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblXI"></span>Table&nbsp;XI zooms in to examine the evolution of safe and risky asset returns across different countries, as well as time periods.

The risky return is largely stable across time, even though it varies somewhat across countries: from just over 5% in Italy and Spain to 11% in Finland. Risk premiums were at or near their highest level in almost every country during the period 1950–1980, largely due to low returns on safe assets. The real safe rate of return was close to zero or negative for the majority of the countries in the sample, with the lowest level of –3.5% observed in Spain and Portugal, and only Belgium, Finland, and Germany experiencing robustly positive real returns. Meanwhile, risky returns were also somewhat above their long-run level in a number of countries, but the differences are relatively smaller than those for safe rates. The post-1980 period saw a recovery in safe returns across the board, with the recent downward trend not yet apparent in these longer-run period averages. Risky returns, meanwhile, were close to their historical levels in most countries, with only Japan experiencing a strong decline following the bursting of its asset price bubble in the 1990s.</p><p>We now turn to examine the correlations between risky and safe returns, which are displayed in <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIV. The top left panel of this figure shows the rolling decadal correlation between the risky and safe returns, calculated as the average of rolling correlations in individual countries in a similar fashion to the calculations in <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure&nbsp;VIII. Throughout most of the historical period under consideration, risky and safe returns had been positively correlated. In other words, safe assets have not generally provided a hedge against risk because safe returns were low when risky returns were low—in particular during both world wars—and vice versa. This positive correlation has weakened over the more recent decades and turned negative from the 1990s onward. This suggests that safe assets have acted as a better hedge for risk during both the Great Moderation and the recent Global Financial Crisis.</p>                    <div data-id="fig14" data-content-id="fig14" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig14.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=WnmuI1UaBuQSpoo7wsfA1PBO8VEEMZnjHTpulD9CwxLIQX4DwAIfj~wC5NnsE477NtFeY5B7orJpq0MwTyfVJKYrInFfcCtmULDKq7STsR4DJMxPLiOJCqofoT8Mwsbuqi1WI0RZWUMGk4kYgRqa1CjGHZNsRjY5qiaQi2w8jUNYmihTE7fjNGA44JCWB6~lZ1UvXuNyg8w0djavX-C8eBPyXl6e0sqSjPDytSsCmPKR3QRh8ozuAMzXpPizg3LMlSDOOYeuN-9158Hn9cOPYtZs7oBkE48pBFPWa7XEHRG6nb9GmijeTEbT2tSMowrf7BC8yh2mvFimaXvGy9ih2w__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Correlations across Risky and Safe Asset Returns" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure XIV</p><div><p>Correlations across Risky and Safe Asset Returns</p><p>Rolling decadal correlations.

Moving to cross-country correlations depicted in the bottom two panels of <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIV, historically safe returns in different countries have been more correlated than risky returns. This has reversed over the past decades as cross-country risky returns have become substantially more correlated. This seems to be mainly driven by a remarkable rise in the cross-country correlations in risk premiums, depicted in the bottom right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIV. This increase in global risk comovement may pose new challenges to the risk-bearing capacity of the global financial system, a trend consistent with other macro indicators of risk-sharing (<span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2017).</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577845" id="137577845" data-legacy-id="sec7">VII. <em>r</em> versus <em>g</em></h2>
<p>Our analysis provides insights into the debate on inequality. <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) and <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) argue that inequality and wealth-to-income ratios in advanced economies have followed a U-shaped pattern over the past century and a half. They further hypothesize that wealth inequality may continue to rise in the future, along with a predicted decline in the rate of economic growth. The main theoretical argument for this comes about from a simple relation: <em>r</em> &gt; <em>g</em>. In their approach, a higher spread between the real rate of return on wealth, denoted <em>r</em>, and the rate of real GDP growth, <em>g</em>, tends to magnify the steady-state level of wealth inequality. <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) show that in a wide class of models featuring stochastic returns to wealth, a higher gap between <em>r</em> and <em>g</em> increases the Pareto index of the steady-state wealth distribution, making it more unequal.</p><p>Of course, this is not the only channel through which rates of return can impact the wealth distribution. Rate of return differentials between asset classes can affect the wealth distribution if there are systematic differences in the portfolio composition between rich and poor households, as <span id="jumplink-bib43"></span>Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins (2017) show, or if rates of returns vary with portfolio size, as stressed by <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014). Studying administrative Swedish data, <span id="jumplink-bib4"></span>Bach, Calvet, and Sodini (2016) find that wealthy households earn higher returns on their portfolios, and <span id="jumplink-bib19"></span>Fagereng et al. (2016) use Norwegian tax data to document substantial heterogeneity in wealth returns. Rates of return on wealth are beginning to receive attention in the theoretical literature. For instance, <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) point to return differences of assets as a potential channel to explain diverging trends between income and wealth inequality, and <span id="jumplink-bib24"></span>Garbinti, Goupille-Lebret, and Piketty (2017) show that asset price effects played an important role in shaping the French wealth distribution over the past 200&nbsp;years. Furthermore, wealth inequality may depend not only on the magnitude of <em>r</em> in relation to <em>g</em> but also on return volatility. Higher return volatility can increase the dispersion of wealth outcomes and make the distribution of wealth more unequal.</p><p>To bring our data to bear on these debates, we construct a measure of the world’s real return on wealth as a weighted average of real returns on bonds, equities, and housing—reflecting the typical portfolio of a private household end-investor. We then compare this measure to the rate of real GDP growth of economies over the long run. Importantly, our approach differs from <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) in that we rely on annual returns from observed market prices and yields for each individual asset class, rather than implicit returns derived from aggregate balance sheet data at selected benchmark dates.

Over the past 150&nbsp;years, the real return on wealth has substantially exceeded real GDP growth in 13 decades and has only been below GDP growth in the 2 decades corresponding to the two world wars. That is, in peacetime, <em>r</em> has always exceeded <em>g</em>. The gap between <em>r</em> and <em>g</em> has been persistently large. Since 1870, the weighted average return on wealth (<em>r</em>) has been about 6.0%, compared to a weighted average real GDP growth rate (<em>g</em>) of 3.0%, with the average <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap of 3.0 percentage points, which is about the same magnitude as the real GDP growth rate itself.

The high level of housing returns that we have uncovered serves to push up the level of <em>r</em>, and thus, potentially, wealth inequality. But what is the counterfactual? We need to bear in mind that housing wealth is more equally distributed than, for instance, equities (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib43"></span>Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins 2017), and returns on housing are less volatile than those on shares—with both factors serving to flatten the distribution of wealth changes, making the overall impact of housing returns on wealth inequality less clear-cut and offering substantial scope for further research.</p><p><span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie (2015) notes that recent trends in wealth and income could be influenced primarily by what has happened in housing. Real house prices have experienced a dramatic increase in the past 40&nbsp;years, coinciding with the rapid expansion of mortgage lending (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017; <span id="jumplink-bib36"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2015, <span id="jumplink-bib37"></span>2016). This is very much evident from <span id="jumplink-tblIX"></span>Table&nbsp;IX. Measured as a ratio to GDP, rental income has been growing, as <span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie (2015) argues. However, the rental yield has declined slightly—given the substantial increase in house prices—so that total returns on housing have remained pretty stable, as we have discussed. In this sense, recent housing trends have diverged little.</p><p>Our data allow us to more formally examine whether movements in the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap are more closely related to return fluctuations or movements in the real GDP growth rate. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Q and Table&nbsp;A.26 document the correlations between <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>g</em>, and <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>r</em> across different time horizons, for the full sample and the period after 1950. Overall, the correlation between <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>g</em> is negative, and somewhat stronger at longer horizons, with the correlation coefficients ranging between –0.2 and –0.6 depending on the historical subperiod and time window. At the same time, the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap is even more robustly related to changes in the return on wealth <em>r</em>, with a positive correlation between the two and a correlation coefficient of around 0.9, both over the short and long run. This suggests that both falling GDP growth and higher returns would tend to increase the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap, although historically much of the changes in <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> have come about from movements in the return on wealth.

Together, these facts have meant that the capital share of GDP has increased across advanced economies (<span id="jumplink-bib39"></span>Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014).

Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article we provide an investigation of the long history of advanced economy asset returns for all the major categories of the investable wealth portfolio. Our work brings new stylized facts to light and rigorously documents many broad patterns that have stimulated so much research in core areas of economics and finance over the past two centuries.</p><p>The returns to risky assets and risk premiums have been high and stable over the past 150&nbsp;years. Substantial diversification opportunities exist between risky asset classes, and across countries. Arguably the most surprising result of our study is that long-run returns on housing and equity look remarkably similar. Yet while returns are comparable, residential real estate is less volatile on a national level, opening up new and interesting risk premium puzzles.</p><p>Our research speaks directly to the relationship between <em>r</em>, the rate of return on wealth, and <em>g</em>, the growth rate of the economy, that figures prominently in the current debate on inequality. One robust finding in this paper is that <em>r</em> ≫ <em>g</em>: globally, and across most countries, the weighted rate of return on capital was twice as high as the growth rate in the past 150&nbsp;years.</p><p>These and other discoveries can provide a rich agenda for future research. Many issues remain to be studied, among them determining the particular fundamentals that drive the returns on each of the asset classes in typical economies. For now, we hope our introduction of this new compilation of asset return data can provide the evidentiary basis for new lines of exploration in years to come.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577864" id="137577864" data-legacy-id="sec9">Supplementary Material</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>In 2022, </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/decade-of-the-battery" rel="">I wrote a post</a><span> arguing that batteries would be the defining technology of the 2020s. That was just a few months before the release of ChatGPT and the boom in generative AI. In light of that sudden efflorescence, the humble battery might seem quaint and prosaic, and my post might seem laughably mistimed. </span></em></p><p><em><span>And yet two years later, I think my post still holds up. These two years have seen small battery-powered drones utterly change </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/30/1067348/mass-market-military-drones-have-changed-the-way-wars-are-fought/" rel="">the way wars are fought</a><span>. They have seen battery storage become a common complement to solar, </span><a href="https://x.com/drvolts/status/1793743067645972773" rel="">solving almost all</a><span> of solar’s intermittency problem and drawing huge amounts of investment worldwide. Batteries have powered the sudden meteoric rise of </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/21/1068880/how-did-china-dominate-electric-cars-policy/" rel="">China’s car industry</a><span>, which went from an also-ran to a juggernaut that suddenly threatens to dominate the entire global auto market. AI is certainly magical and holds incredible potential, but in just a couple of years, batteries have begun to transform human energy supply, war, transportation, and geopolitical dominance. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Also, it’s quickly becoming apparent that AI and batteries are, in many ways, perfectly complementary technologies. Drones are human-piloted now, but </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/drone-swarms-are-about-to-change-the-balance-of-military-power-e091aa6f" rel="">autonomous AI-operated drone swarms</a><span> are coming, and they are going to change war and the balance of power yet again. AI promises to turn robotics from a niche type of machine tool into </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/techno-optimism-for-2024" rel="">a ubiquitous feature of our world</a><span>. The rise of autonomous machines will be — must be — battery-powered.</span></em></p><p><em>So here’s my post from 2022. See how well you think it still holds up. </em></p><p><span>In 2015, Benedict Evans wrote a very influential piece called “</span><a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/627884650300506113" rel="">The smartphone is the new sun</a><span>”. By the middle of the 2010s, it was pretty clear that that decade would be defined in many ways by the mobile computing platform that Steve Jobs unveiled in 2007. For regular people, smartphones became the locus of their lives — an ever-present tether constantly connecting them to the digital world and allowing them to navigate the physical one. For industry, smartphones and the applications they enabled became a massive opportunity for investment and profit.</span></p><p><span>Now, however, it seems like we might be reaching the end of that rainbow. The basic reason is that with smartphones, IT companies have now harvested essentially all of people’s surplus attention and time. </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/" rel="">A new Pew survey of teens’ social media habits</a><span> found that almost half of young people are online “almost constantly”, up from a quarter in the mid-2010s. And </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration" rel="">smartphone penetration</a><span> in rich countries is around 80%. So it’s natural for both consumers and investors/entrepreneurs to be looking around for what technologies might enable another Cambrian explosion of innovation in the next decade.</span></p><p><span>Many people think that this technology is going to be machine learning/AI. But although I do think ML will indeed be very important, I’m going to make an argument that the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_technology" rel="">general-purpose technology</a><span> that will really transform our society is the battery.</span></p><p><span>This is interesting because it’s a bit of a swerve from the pattern of the last four decades. From 1980-2020, the innovations that reshaped our world were all in information technology — the PC, the internet, the smartphone and the social network. But batteries are an “atoms” technology — something that powers our physical world instead of helping us spin a new digital one.

I’m going to go through a bunch of use cases, from the obvious (cars and energy storage) to the not-so-obvious. But first, I should talk a bit about </span><em>why</em><span> batteries are such a general-purpose technology.</span></p><p><span>Energy is obviously fundamental to every piece of industrial society, and it’s especially important for physical (“atoms”) technologies like transportation, manufacturing, electricity, and appliances. We often think in terms of </span><em>primary</em><span> energy — that is to say, where we get the energy from. Technologies like solar and wind and nuclear and hydropower supply this need, and of course burning fossil fuels does this too. Batteries don’t do this.</span></p><p><span>But there’s more to energy than generation. We also have to </span><em>store</em><span> the energy, and we have to </span><em>transport</em><span> it from place to place. In other words, we have to move energy around through both time and space, so that we can use it wherever and whenever we want. Batteries address both problems.</span></p><p>When it comes to storage, batteries are not yet as good as fossil fuels, because they leak energy over time. This is why they can be used for short-term energy storage for power plants and grids, but not for seasonal storage. But for transporting energy, there are some ways in which batteries are qualitatively superior to fossil fuels. First of all, a battery can be charged by basically any electrical power source, whereas an oil pipeline or a natural gas tank can only really hold one specific type of fossil fuel. Second, extracting energy from a battery is generally much less noisy than extracting energy using a combustion engine. There are other advantages too.</p><p><span>Most importantly, though, a battery doesn’t require a bulky combustion engine in order to extract the energy. I first realized the importance of this when I read about Portland protesters in the summer of 2020 </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEqRIkVEya0" rel="">using battery-powered leaf blowers to blow tear gas</a><span> back in the face of federal agents. Battery-powered leaf blowers are less powerful than gasoline-powered ones, but </span><a href="https://www.gardentoolexpert.com/electric-vs-gas-leaf-blowers-what-do-you-choose/" rel="">they’re also much lighter</a><span>. This is why we use batteries for small, lightweight drones. It’s a big part of the reason why your smartphone has a battery in it instead of a little gasoline-powered engine.</span></p><p>Any time some battery skeptic tells you that batteries have “lower energy density” than fossil fuels, point this out to them.</p><p>And as batteries continue to improve, their disadvantages compared to fossil fuels will decrease. We will develop batteries with longer life spans, greater power density, and so on.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg" width="1024" height="766" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:766,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:146274,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Tesla brings the rainbows — seen this morning at work\&quot; by jurvetson is licensed under CC BY 2.0.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Tesla brings the rainbows — seen this morning at work\&quot; by jurvetson is licensed under CC BY 2.0.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="&quot;Tesla brings the rainbows — seen this morning at work&quot; by jurvetson is licensed under CC BY 2.0." title="&quot;Tesla brings the rainbows — seen this morning at work&quot; by jurvetson is licensed under CC BY 2.0." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70980ee9-2611-40e4-a56d-530570a8bbe9_1024x766.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>So, on to a big list of things we’ll use batteries for.

As electric cars get better range — and they’re </span><a href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/cars/g40365538/longest-range-electric-car/" rel="">very close to gasoline cars now</a><span> — this will mean that people will </span><em>almost never</em><span> have to stop to fill up, because their car will always start out fully charged in the morning. A big time-waster — looking for a gas station, sitting around huffing toxic fumes while your tank fills up — will mostly just vanish.

That transforms cycling in two ways. First, it allows you to go much farther. </span><a href="https://www.treehugger.com/e-bikers-ride-much-farther-and-more-frequently-than-regula-bikers-5076231" rel="">From a recent study</a><span> in Norway:</span></p><blockquote><blockquote><p>The people who bought e-bikes increased their bicycle use from 2.1 kilometers (1.3 miles) to 9.2&nbsp;kilometers (5.7 miles) on average per day; a 340% increase. The e-bike's share of all their transportation increased dramatically too; from 17% to 49%, where they e-biked instead of walking, taking public transit, and driving….[I]n fact, people rode their e-bikes more the longer they had them[.]</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><span>Second, e-bikes make it </span><a href="https://cyclebaron.com/how-good-are-electric-bikes-going-uphill/" rel="">pretty easy to bike uphill</a><span>. That opens up huge areas to cyclists that were basically denied to them before (e.g. most of San Francisco).</span></p><p>The combination of much longer range and not having to worry about road grades mean that e-bikes have the potential to transform the way we live. Since the U.S. already has roads and can add bike lanes where they don’t already exist, the cost of converting cities to accommodate masses of e-bike commuters will not be large (certainly smaller than, say, building trains!). And since e-bikes are small and easy to park, we can build a lot of bike racks close to common destinations, taking away some of the hassle of finding a parking space when commuting.</p><p>All in all, e-bikes will simply make it much easier to get around our cities, which hopefully will increase human connection and make us feel more free. They will also make food and product delivery a lot easier in many areas. And because e-bikes do still use a little muscle power, we might become a bit healthier too!</p><p><span>It’s also worth noting that electric </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90738126/this-startup-designed-an-electric-cargo-ship-to-cross-the-ocean" rel="">cargo ships</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.afar.com/magazine/electric-planes-are-coming-sooner-than-you-think" rel="">planes</a><span> are in the pipeline, though I don’t expect these to become common in the next decade.</span></p><p>Batteries aren’t just going to change civilian transportation — they’re going to change military vehicles as well, enabling whole new ways of warfare. Anyone who is paying attention to the war in Ukraine already knows this. Although combustion-powered drones like the Bayraktar get most of the attention, little electric drones have started delivering precision strikes at relatively close range on the battlefield.

Cordless equipment will gradually take over from stuff that needs to be plugged in all the time. Battery-powered air purifiers and fans and humidifiers will stand around our houses and buildings. Battery-powered kettles and crock pots and pressure cookers and other cooking appliances will let us cook food in the park. Cordless vacuums, leaf-blowers, and mowers will make it much easier to keep our houses and lawns neat and tidy. Battery-powered webcams will allow us to more easily capture much of the world on video. And so on. Just look at everything that has a cord in your house, and ask if you might want to run it far from an outlet. Batteries let you do that.</p><p><span>Some special kinds of batteries also have other capabilities that allow them to be used in everyday applications that most people wouldn’t think of. A really cool example is fast-discharging batteries that can be used to make </span><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/battery-powered-appliances" rel="">super-powerful appliances</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Next, think about robots. Currently we have battery-powered roombas vacuuming our houses. Little delivery robots are </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-62180981" rel="">starting to trundle down the street</a><span>.

Battery-powered farm vehicles are </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHnMPIOqzTE" rel="">beginning to transform agriculture</a><span>.</span></p><p>In fact, although I said I didn’t think machine learning was going to be the #1 most transformative tech of the 2020s, it’s obviously the case that AI and batteries go together like peanut butter and jelly. As battery-powered drones and robots proliferate and fill our physical world, AI will be crucial for making sure it all runs correctly. So just as the smartphone revolution was powered by batteries, the battery revolution will be powered by AI.</p><p>Basically, the battery revolution means that the pieces of our world are starting to free themselves, get up, and move around.</p><p><span>Venture capitalists and technology companies, of course, stand to profit handsomely off of all this. “Deep tech” is </span><a href="https://mandel.substack.com/p/four-theses-on-deep-tech" rel="">a hot buzzword in the VC industry</a><span> right now, but the big challenge is that many forms of deep tech — biopharma and other research-intensive industries — is that the long lead time and high up-front cost presents big challenges for the traditional low-cost, fast-scaling VC financing model. Battery-driven tech, however, may prove an exception. The fact that the basic research is being done in universities frees up VCs to fund applications instead of labs. And the fact that energy portability allows gadgets to adapt themselves to existing infrastructure means that investors won’t have to tussle so much with regulators or fund expensive modifications to the built environment.</span></p><p><span>There are, of course, some big obstacles for us to overcome in the Decade of the Battery. Chief among these is mineral availability. Putting batteries in everything requires mining a whole bunch of lithium, copper, cobalt, and other minerals (David Roberts, as usual, has </span><a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/the-minerals-used-by-clean-energy#details" rel="">an excellent rundown</a><span>). This will require us to do a lot of mining, to shift toward </span><a href="https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/lithium-iron-phosphate-batteries/" rel="">types of batteries</a><span> that aren’t as dependent on rare minerals, and to diversify our sources away from unfriendly regimes. It’s a challenge, but </span><a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/minerals-and-the-clean-energy-transition#details" rel="">probably a doable one</a><span>. And of course recycling and disposal of batteries will be a major task as well.</span></p><p>But no technological revolution has been without its challenges and its issues. The upside of batteries — a technology for cheap light energy portability and storage — just swamps the difficulties and downsides. It took a long time for this general-purpose technology to arrive, but now it’s here, and the next decade (or, really three decades) will see it transform the world around us.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/decade-of-the-battery-334?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/decade-of-the-battery-334?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The Gruen transfer is a psychological phenomenon in which an idealised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality" title="Hyperreality">hyperreality</a> is realized by deliberate reconstruction, providing a sense of safety and calm through exceptional familiarity.<sup id="cite_ref-Sussex_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Sussex-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-:1-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>In a speech in London in 1978, Victor Gruen disavowed shopping mall developments as having "bastardised" his ideas:<sup id="cite_ref-NYer04_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-NYer04-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Frank_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-Frank-3">[3]</a></sup> "I refuse to pay alimony for those bastard developments."<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The psychologists involved in these studies found that the size and appearance of such a shopping center have a special pull effect on customers. The moment a customer enters a mall and is overwhelmed by the size, intentional clutter, and glitz of the mall, he forgets his original goals and becomes susceptible to sales manipulation. He becomes an impulse buyer.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Supermarkets, for example in the food industry, also use the experience of the Gruen effect to slow things down, to direct attention when placing products, or to confuse the business through frequent remodeling.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<p><strong>A $1,000,000+ competition towards open AGI progress.</strong></p>

<p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2avWAHXUXXs?si=CTewe9L_Mp8XsDSo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media;" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>AGI progress has stalled. New ideas are needed.</p>

<h4 id="intelligence-vs-memorization">Intelligence vs Memorization</h4>

<p>Modern AI (LLMs) have shown to be great memorization engines. They are able to memorize high-dimensional patterns in their training data and apply those patterns into adjacent contexts. This is also how their apparent reasoning capability works. LLMs are not actually reasoning. Instead they memorize reasoning patterns and apply those reasoning patterns into adjacent contexts. But they cannot generate new reasoning based on novel situations.</p>

<p>More training data lets you "buy" performance on memorization based benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, ImageNet, GLUE, etc.) But memorization alone is not general intelligence. General intelligence is the ability to efficiently acquire new skills.</p>

<p>More scale will not enable LLMs to learn new skills. We need new architectures or algorithms that enable AI systems to learn at test time. This is how humans are able to adapt to novel situations.</p>

<p>Beyond LLMs, for many years, we've had AI systems that can beat humans at poker, chess, go, and other games. However, no AI system trained to succeed at one game can simply be retrained toward another. Instead researchers have had to re-architect and rebuild entirely new systems per game.</p>

<p>This is a failure to generalize.</p>

<p>Without this capability, AI will forever be rate-limited by the human general intelligence in the loop. We want AGI that can discover and invent alongside humans to push humanity forward.</p>

<p>Given the success and proven economic utility of LLMs over the past 4 years, the above may seem like extraodinary claims. Strong claims require strong evidence.</p>

<h3 id="arc-agi">ARC-AGI</h3>

<p>Introduced by <a href="https://x.com/fchollet" target="_blank">François Chollet</a> in his influencial paper "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547" target="_blank">On the Measure of Intelligence</a>", <a href="https://arcprize.org/arc">ARC-AGI</a> is the only AI eval which measures general intelligence: a system that can efficiently acquire new skills and solve novel, open-ended problems.</p>

<p>ARC-AGI was created in 2019 and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) high score was 20%. Today, only 34%.</p>

<p>Yet humans - even children - score 85% to 100%.</p>

<p>ARC-AGI is easy for humans and impossible for modern AI.</p>

<p>Most AI benchmarks rapidly saturate to human performance-level because they test only for memorization, which is something AI is superhuman at.</p>

<p>ARC-AGI is not saturating, in fact current pace is slowing down. It was designed to resist memorization and has proven extremely challenging for both the largest foundational transformer models as well as bespoke AI systems designed to defeat ARC-AGI.</p>

<p><img src="https://arcprize.org/media/images/ai-benchmarks.png" alt="ARC-AGI Benchmark Comparison"></p>

<p>A solution to ARC-AGI, at a minimum, opens up a completely new programming paradigm where programs can perfectly and reliably generalize from an arbitrary set of priors. We also believe a solution is on the critical path towards AGI</p>

<h3 id="open-source-agi-progress">Open Source AGI Progress</h3>

<p>If you accept new ideas are needed, let's consider how to increase the rate of new ideas. Unfortunately, trends in AI are going the wrong way.</p>

<h4 id="closed-vs-open">Closed vs Open</h4>

<p>Starting with the GPT-4 release, frontier AGI progress has gone closed source. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774" target="_blank">GPT-4 technical report</a> surprisingly contains no technical details. OpenAI said "competitive" reasons were the first reason why. Google's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805" target="_blank">Gemini technical report</a> also contains no technical details on the long context window frontier innovation.</p>

<p>LLMs have also shifted the majority of research attention away from new architectures and new algorithms. Over <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-ascent-2024/" target="_blank">$20B was deployed</a> to non-general AI companies in 2023 and many frontier DeepMind researchers were restaffed to Gemini (in order to compete with OpenAI.)</p>

<p>Leading labs have strong incentives to loudly claim, "scale is all you need," and, "don't try to compete with us on frontier research," even though they all quietly believe new ideas are needed to reach AGI. Their bet is they can discover all the necessary new ideas within their labs.</p>

<h4 id="llm-history">LLM History</h4>

<p>But let's look at the history of LLMs. Specifically the transformer architecture. Transformers emerged many years downstream of machine translation research (e.g., English to Spanish.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2014</strong>: Sutskever et. al. (Google) published <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215" target="_blank">Seq2Seq Learning</a> using RNNs and CNNs for variable length input vs output (English and Spanish words are not the same length.)</li>
  <li><strong>2016</strong>: Bahdanau et. al. (Jacobs University) popularized <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473" target="_blank">the concept of "attention"</a> so a system could consider different parts of the input to predict output (English adjectives come before nouns, Spanish after.)</li>
  <li><strong>2017</strong>: Vaswani et. al. (Google) realized <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762" target="_blank">"attention is all you need"</a>, dropping RNNs and CNNs, optimizing the architecture, enabling new scale</li>
  <li><strong>2018</strong>: Radford et. al. (OpenAI) <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf" target="_blank">created GPT-2</a> built on top of the transformer architecture at frontier scale, showing emergent capabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>The story of the transformer is the story of science. Researchers in different labs and teams publish and build on top of each other's work.</p>

<p>While it is possible one lab could discover AGI alone, it is highly unlikely. The global chance of AGI discovery has decreased and will keep decreasing if we accepting this as status quo.</p>

<h4 id="progress">Progress</h4>

<p>I have spoken with many young students and would-be researchers over the past year. Many are depressed. There is a sense of dread that everything has been figured out already. But this is not true! The AI ecosystem is intentioanlly telling a partial-truth to boost their relative competitive positions to the detriment of actual progress towards AGI.</p>

<p>Worse, the inaccurate "scale is all you need" belief is now influencing the AI regulatory environment. Regulators are considering roadblocks to frontier AI research under the wrong assumption that AGI is imminent. The truth is no one knows how to build AGI.</p>

<p>We should be trying to incentivize new ideas, not slow them down. The internet and open source are the strongest innovation engines the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>By incentivizing open source we increase the rate of new ideas, increasing the chance we discover AGI, and ensure those new ideas are widely distributed to establish a more even playing field between small and large AI companies.</p>

<p>We hope ARC Prize can help counterbalance these trends.</p>

<p>As announced <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/02/22/gpay-app-p2p/">in February</a>, “GPay” is no longer available in the US. The redesigned Google Pay was announced in 2020 to “make money simple, secure, and helpful” with plans for a “mobile-first bank account” that never came to fruition.</p>



<p>Starting on June 4, GPay — as was the name of the app on Android homescreens — automatically signed US users out. Attempting to login again explains how: “The Google Pay US app is no longer available. You can still tap to pay using the Google Wallet app.”</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="864" height="1920" src="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=461" alt="" srcset="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg 864w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=59,130 59w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=315,700 315w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=768,1707 768w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=461,1024 461w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=691,1536 691w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=158,350 158w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=140,311 140w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=450,1000 450w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=150,333 150w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px"></figure>



<p>Additionally, Google no longer offers peer-to-peer payments in the US. You can use the <a href="http://pay.google.com/">Google Pay website</a> to view and transfer your balance — money you’ve received or rewards— to a bank account after June.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The focus is now on Google Wallet and digitizing everything in your physical wallet. There’s no equivalent finance tracking functionality. Meanwhile, “Google Pay” still exists as the name for what you’re actually using when making a physical or online purchase with your phone.</p>

</ul>



<p>The main premise of the big redesign was an app centered “around your relationships with people and businesses” with message-like conversations serving as a purchase history. You could also keep track of your bank account and credit card (via Plaid) in the “Insights” tab, while a lot of deals and cash back offers were presented.</p>






<p>At the November 2022 announcement, co-branded checking and saving “Plex Accounts” were also <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-plex-account/">previewed</a>. Google partnered with banks and credit unions, most notably Citi. There would have been a physical card&nbsp;</p>



<p>Savings and the ability to create customizable goals was the other big tentpole. You could create specific tasks with milestones to break things up. One option would have been to “round-up transfers” on all purchases to help meet the goal.</p>

<p>Plex was supposed to launch in 2021, but Google announced <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/01/google-pay-abandons-plans-for-plex-bank-accounts-w-400000-on-the-waitlist/">that October</a> how the project was canceled. This was despite a waitlist of 400,000 people. Officially, Google was shifting to “delivering digital enablement for banks and other financial services providers rather than us serving as the provider of these services.”</p>

<h2>Constituent Update&nbsp;</h2>

<p>July 21, 2023&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2016-P-1171-0017"><u>denied a petition</u></a> requesting that the agency reconsider its denial of a <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2016-P-1171/document?sortBy=postedDate">citizen petition</a> issued on May 19, 2022. The citizen petition requested a ban on the use of eight <em>ortho</em>-phthalates<em> </em>and revocation of the prior sanctioned uses for five ortho-phthalates in food based on alleged safety concerns.</p>

<p><em>Ortho</em>-phthalates, often referred to as “phthalates,” are chemicals used in plastic products (most commonly in the specific type of plastic named polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC or vinyl) to make the material soft and less brittle.</p>

<p>We evaluated the reconsideration petition and concluded that it does not provide a basis for modifying the FDA’s response to the original citizen petition. Our response explains that we adequately considered relevant information and views contained in the administrative record when responding to the original citizen petition. Additionally, we have considered the information submitted in the reconsideration petition and other relevant information in the administrative record. &nbsp;The FDA’s decision to deny the original petition remains unchanged.</p>

<p>We will continue to keep the food industry and the public informed of updates related to our activities on phthalates in food packaging and food contact applications. Up to date information is available on the FDA’s <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="520c05e8-8501-4ffb-b7cd-9885329219a2" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-and-gras-ingredients-information-consumers/phthalates-food-packaging-and-food-contact-applications" title="Phthalates in Food Packaging and Food Contact Applications ">phthalates</a> website.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Researchers from <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, and <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California San Diego</a> recently open-sourced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08801">MEGALODON</a>, a large language model (LLM) with an unlimited context length. MEGALODON has linear computational complexity and outperforms a similarly-sized <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/07/meta-new-ai-model/">Llama 2</a> model on a range of benchmarks.</p>

<p>MEGALODON is designed to address several shortcomings of the Transformer neural architecture underlying most LLMs. Instead of the standard multihead attention, MEGALODON uses a chunk-wise attention. The research team also introduced sequence-based parallelism during training, improving scalability for long-context training. When evaluated on standard LLM benchmarks, such as <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/winogrande">WinoGrande</a> and <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu">MMLU</a>, MEGALODON outperformed a Llama 2 model with the same amount of parameters, training data, and training compute budget. According to the researchers:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MEGALODON achieves impressive improvements on both training perplexity and across downstream benchmarks. Importantly, experimental results on long-context modeling demonstrate MEGALODON’s ability to model sequences of unlimited length. Additional experiments on small/medium-scale benchmarks across different data modalities illustrate the robust improvements of MEGALODON, which lead to a potential direction of future work to apply MEGALODON for large-scale multi-modality pretraining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the Transformer architecture has become the standard for most Generative AI models, Transformers do have some drawbacks. In particular, their self-attention mechanism has quadratic complexity in both compute and storage, which limits the models' input context length. Several alternatives to the standard self-attention model have been developed recently, including structured state space models (SSMs) like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a>, which scales linearly with context length. Another scheme that InfoQ recently covered is the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/03/rwkv-llm-eagle-7b/">RWKV Project's</a> attention-free Transformer model, which has no maximum input context length.</p>

<p>MEGALODON builds on the research team's previous model, <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/mega">MEGA</a> (exponential moving average with gated attention), with several new features. First, while MEGA uses a "classical" exponential moving average (EMA) within its attention mechanism, MEGALODON computes a <em>complex</em>&nbsp;EMA (CEMA). Mathematically, the CEMA component makes MEGALODON equivalent to a "simplified state space model with diagonal state matrix."</p>

<p>The research team trained a seven-billion parameter model, MEGALODON-7B, using the same 2-trillion token dataset that Llama2-7B used; they also used the same training hyperparameters. The team observed that MEGALODON-7B was more computationally efficient. When the Llama model was scaled up to a 32k context length, MEGALODON-7B was "significantly" faster.</p>

<p>Besides evaluating MEGALODON-7B on standard LLM benchmarks, the researchers also tested its performance on the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/scrolls">SCROLLS</a> long-context question-answering benchmark, and compared its results with several baseline models, including the modified Llama 2 model with a 32k context length. MEGALODON outperformed all baseline models on the NarrativeQA subtask, and on all tasks achieved results "competitive" with Llama 2.</p>

<p>In a discussion about MEGALODON on Hacker News, one user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40054901">wondered how well the model performed on recall tasks</a>, given that other non-Transformer models tend to perform poorly. Another user replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what it's worth, RWKV's website on that matter mentions that yes it's bad on recall, but for the vast majority of tasks you can just ask the question *before* the content, and it'll handle the task just fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/XuezheMax/megalodon">MEGALODON code</a> is available on GitHub.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Differences between Revideo and Motion Canvas</h2><a id="user-content-differences-between-revideo-and-motion-canvas" aria-label="Permalink: Differences between Revideo and Motion Canvas" href="#differences-between-revideo-and-motion-canvas"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Motion Canvas aims to be a
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/motion-canvas/discussions/1015">standalone editor</a> for
animations. While it happens to be distributed as an npm package, the
maintainers don't intend for it to be used as a library.</p>
<p dir="auto">We started out as users of Motion Canvas ourselves but ran into these
limitations when we wanted to build a video editing app on top of it. After
building our initial version using Motion Canvas' plugin system, we realized
that we wanted to make more fundamental changes to the codebase that would be
difficult to implement while keeping compatibility with the existing Motion
Canvas API.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's why we decided to fork the project and turn it into Revideo. We wrote a
bit more about it on our <a href="https://re.video/blog/fork" rel="nofollow">blog</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Concretely, some of the differences to Motion Canvas are the following ones:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Headless Rendering:</strong> Motion Canvas currently requires you to press a button
in its UI to render a video. We have exposed this functionality as a
<a href="https://docs.re.video/renderer/renderVideo/" rel="nofollow">function call</a> and are making it
possible to deploy a rendering API to services like Google Cloud Run
(<a href="https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo-examples/tree/main/google-cloud-run">example</a>,
or to use our CLI to expose a rendering endpoint from your Revideo project
(<a href="https://docs.re.video/render-endpoint" rel="nofollow">docs</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Faster Rendering:</strong> When building an app rather than creating videos for
yourself, rendering speeds are quite important. We have sped up rendering
speeds by enabling
<a href="https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo/pull/74" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/redotvideo/revideo/pull/74/hovercard">parallelized rendering</a> and
replacing the <code>seek()</code> operation for HTML video with our ffmpeg-based
<a href="https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo/pull/33" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/redotvideo/revideo/pull/33/hovercard">video frame extractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Better Audio Support:</strong> We have enabled audio export from <code>&lt;Video/&gt;</code> tags

In the morning, you report that you barely slept at all. Yet according to the test—polysomnography, the gold standard for sleep measurement—you slept all night.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">You’re not the classic example of a person with insomnia who waits for sleep to come, maybe checks the clock, paces, reads and waits for morning. What you have has been called subjective insomnia, paradoxical insomnia or sleep misperception. Scientists have doggedly attacked this stubborn puzzle for decades without result—until now. Now they say that you have not been misrepresenting your sleep; they have been mismeasuring it.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The most recent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.14028">studies</a><u>,</u> using far more enhanced measurement, have found that many people with subjective insomnia show different brain activity from good sleepers—throughout the night. Neuroscientist Aurélie Stephan and colleagues at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN) realized that something unusual was going on after they asked people in their study to put onto their head a net of 256 electrodes rather than the typical six to 20 used in sleep clinics. In one <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(21)01366-X.pdf">series of experiments</a>, the researchers woke sleepers about 26 times on average during the night. The participants were asked whether they’d been asleep or awake and what they’d been thinking about.</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

REM is the stage in normal sleep when your brain should completely disconnect from the systems that keep you aware and vigilant, Stephan says.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">People with subjective insomnia with this interrupted REM do not experience their sleep as restful. When wakened, they reported having had thoughts similar to those when awake—adding lettuce to their shopping list, say, or reminding themselves to call their cousin. They were less likely to have what University of Montreal neuroscientist Claudia Picard-Deland calls immersive dreams, in which you feel physically present in the dream world and are fleeing down a dark hallway, feeling the hardness of the floor or battling a dragon, sensing its hot breath.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In a study of normal sleepers Picard-Deland recently presented at the <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/symposia/">the Cognitive Neuroscience Society’s annual meeting</a>, participants said they felt most deeply asleep during immersive dreams, which occurred in the REM stage. People with interrupted REM, as Stephan’s research shows, do not report immersive dreams. They do not feel they’ve slept deeply, and they report fatigue similar to that of people who actually sleep very little.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Perhaps even more important, says NIN sleep scientist Eus van Someren, interrupted REM is strongly linked to disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. If two people experience the same level of trauma, a good sleeper is probably less likely to develop PTSD than someone with disturbed sleep, he says. Those with disturbed sleep are therefore more vulnerable to developing PTSD. It’s a vicious cycle.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This occurs because interrupted REM interferes with the overnight dissolving of emotional distress that has accumulated throughout the daytime, which typically happens during good sleep. “Sound REM sleep is the only state during which the brain has a ‘<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00046.2019">time-out</a>’ of noradrenaline [norepinephrine],” van Someren says. “The neurons are not firing anymore, so they don’t release noradrenaline downstream in the brain. But if you have even the slightest arousal from REM sleep..., then noradrenaline shoots up very fast.” He believes those with interrupted REM experience this arousal repeatedly and never reach the typical quiescent state that allows for the processing of troubled emotions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30590834/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Our%20findings%20are%20the,actually%20aggravates%20physically%20perceived%20distress.">study</a> headed by van Someren’s former graduate student Rick Wassing, now at Macquarie University in Australia, demonstrates this experimentally. The researchers exposed people to a distressing emotional experience for three days in a row: they had to listen to a recording of themselves singing—often out of tune—to karaoke, which aroused shame. As measured by their physiological responses, normal sleepers felt less distress after a night’s sleep. Those with disturbed sleep felt more.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The percentage of people with insomnia that have interrupted REM is unknown, but these insights are suggesting new personalized treatments for insomnia, which is now understood as existing on a spectrum. Such treatments may be especially beneficial to people with insomnia who also have depression and anxiety disorders.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is the standard intervention for insomnia. People with insomnia learn to decrease their anxiety about sleeping and to employ behavioral strategies aimed at better sleep. But CBTi does not work for everyone. Those with interrupted REM, in particular, probably need different solutions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">One behavioral strategy used in CBTi—sleep restriction—does show promise for people with interrupted REM, however. Some sleep-restriction methods involve shortening a person’s time in bed to the average amount that they actually sleep per night. Other methods delay a person’s bedtime.” For example, If a person objectively sleeps for 5.5 hours, the experts allow the person to be in bed only for six hours. A preliminary lab <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03564-6">study</a> in which participants delayed their regular bedtime by two hours showed that such sleep restriction can reduce the number of arousals during REM. The researchers are hoping to replicate these results in a larger study of people sleeping at home.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This new science also opens the way for drug interventions. The NIN group is seeking approvals to test whether a beta-blocker typically prescribed to lower blood pressure might mitigate the effects of continuous bursts of norepinephrine. The researchers are also considering testing the blood pressure drug clonidine in the hopes that it may help the brain reach a more quiescent state.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Until these interventions are available, says sleep researcher Geoffroy Solelhac of the Center for Investigation and Research in Sleep in Switzerland, “just understanding that their sleep is objectively different is reassuring to patients. They feel a sort of relief.” Knowing all that may even help them sleep better.</p></div></div>]]></description>
