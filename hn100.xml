            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-its-finally-here">https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-its-finally-here</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37421529">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since our <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/a-unified-extensible-platform-to-superpower-your-ai">launch</a> of the Mojo programming language on May 2nd, more than 120K+ developers have signed up to use the Mojo Playground and 19K+ developers actively discuss Mojo on <a href="https://discord.gg/modular">Discord</a> and <a href="https://github.com/modularml/mojo">GitHub</a>. Today, we‚Äôre excited to announce the next big step in Mojo‚Äôs evolution: <strong>Mojo is now available for local </strong><a href="https://developer.modular.com/"><strong>download</strong></a> ‚Äì beginning with <strong>Linux systems</strong>, and adding Mac and Windows in coming releases.</p><p>While the <a href="https://playground.modular.com/">Mojo Playground</a> provides an easy hosted introduction to the language, the local Mojo toolchain empowers developers to accomplish much more. Local developer tools provide access to the full power of Mojo, including <strong>a full set of compiler features and IDE tools that make it easy to build and iterate on Mojo applications</strong>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64174a9fd03969ab5b930a08/64fa0ab7e29b0d13abaabff4_mojo-eco.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In this blog post, we‚Äôll take a high-level tour of what‚Äôs inside the Mojo SDK. First, let‚Äôs quickly review what Mojo is and how it can benefit you.</p><h3>Mojo: a high performance 'Python++' language for compute</h3><p>Mojo is <strong>a new programming language for AI developers that will grow into being a superset of Python over time</strong>. It already supports integrating with arbitrary Python code seamlessly and has a scalable programming model to target performance-critical systems, including accelerators (e.g. GPUs) that are pervasive in AI.</p><p>Mojo meets you where you are today, and enables you to progressively adopt new features to enable high performance where you need it. Mojo combines the best of dynamic and static languages together, and can achieve <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-a-journey-to-68-000x-speedup-over-python-part-3">up to 68,000x the performance</a> of Python today. You can read more about <a href="https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo.html">Mojo‚Äôs origin story</a> in our docs, but let‚Äôs recap a few important benefits that Mojo unlocks for users:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Write everything in one language</strong>: Mojo meets AI developers where they are, combining the usability of Python with the systems programming features that cause developers to have to reach for C, C++, or CUDA. Your research and deployment teams can now work in a common codebase, streamlining the research to production workflow.</li><li><strong>Unlock Python performance</strong>: Python is pervasive, but not the right tool for tasks that require high performance or exotic hardware. Mojo enables high performance on CPUs, as well as support for exotic accelerators like GPUs and ASICs, providing performance on par with C++ and CUDA.</li><li><strong>Access the entire Python ecosystem</strong>: Mojo provides full interoperability with the Python ecosystem, making it seamless to use the Python libraries while taking advantage of Mojo‚Äôs features and performance benefits. For example, you can seamlessly intermix NumPy and Matplotlib with your Mojo code.</li><li><strong>Upgrade your AI workloads</strong>: Mojo integrates tightly with the Modular AI Engine, empowering you to easily extend your AI workloads with custom operations, including pre-processing, post-processing operations and high-performance mathematical algorithms. You can integrate kernel fusion, graph rewrites, shape functions, and more.</li></ul><p>As we‚Äôve shown in <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-1">past</a> <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-2">blog</a> <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-a-journey-to-68-000x-speedup-over-python-part-3">posts</a>, with simple code changes to existing Python code, you can get significant (&gt;68000x) speedups with Mojo for compute-bound workloads. If you are a Python programmer, check out <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/an-easy-introduction-to-mojo-for-python-programmers">this blog post</a> for an easy introduction to performance optimizations with Mojo.&nbsp;</p><p>Mojo is now available for download to your computer, but Mojo is a lot more than a compiler.</p><h3>The Mojo Toolbox</h3><p>The first release of the Mojo SDK comes with <strong>everything you need to easily develop Mojo programs</strong>. This includes the following tools:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>mojo driver:</strong> provides a shell (for read-eval-print-loop or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>), and allows you to build and run Mojo programs, package Mojo modules (including support for the üî• extension!), generate docs, and format code<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo"><strong>‚Äç</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo"><strong>Extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</strong></a>: supports various productivity features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and more&nbsp;<strong>‚Äç</strong></li><li><strong>Jupyter kernel:</strong> supports building and running Mojo notebooks, including Python code<strong>‚Äç</strong></li><li><strong>Debugging support (coming soon):</strong> step into and inspect running Mojo programs, even intermixing C++ and Mojo stack frames</li></ul><p>This initial release of the SDK supports X86/Linux systems, and we will expand to additional operating systems, hardware, and tool features in upcoming updates.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64174a9fd03969ab5b930a08/64f8bbb424cf49c042319fed_Tf_aqSWFNEZO993md-Yuh7Bs5ZEMglx-kyDaTzq66m1q3W4eGqFtaH6warFjp69XTIk2bvVj-q2caffdimzLZMQkl9gs3_HA5p9uXjd0YfHiZwrJryiYWJGN5QoxnpSgwflRyHOllLZwe0HN7kbSAU8.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A view of the Mojo SDK</figcaption></figure><p>‚Äç</p><p>Now, let‚Äôs take a look at each of the tools available in the current release of the SDK.</p><h3>Mojo Driver</h3><p>Just as with Python, you can start programming in a REPL by running the mojo command. Here is an example that calculates Euclidean distance in Mojo from our previous blog post:</p><div><pre><code>

</snip></snip></snip></code></pre></div><p>‚Äç</p><p>What‚Äôs more, Mojo allows you to build statically-compiled executables that you can deploy without any dependencies. For example, you can compile and run the <em>hello.üî•</em> program from our examples repository as follows:</p><div><pre><code>
$ mojo build hello.üî•

$ ./hello
Hello Mojo üî•!
9
6
3

$ ls -lGtranh hello*
-rw-r--r-- 1 0   817 Sep  3 23:59 hello.üî•
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0   22K Sep  3 23:59 hello
    
</code></pre></div><p>‚Äç</p><p>A 22 kB statically-compiled binary is pretty cool, and is made possible by Mojo‚Äôs tight dependency management.</p><h3>Visual Studio Code Extension</h3><p>Visual Studio Code is one of the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment">most popular IDEs</a> in the world, and Mojo supports it directly with&nbsp;an <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo">official extension</a> on the Visual Studio Marketplace.

		<p>Microsoft‚Äôs AI-powered Copilots are changing the way we work, making customers more efficient while unlocking new levels of creativity. While these transformative tools open doors to new possibilities, they are also raising new questions. Some customers are concerned about the risk of IP infringement claims if they use the output produced by generative AI. This is understandable, given recent public inquiries by authors and artists regarding how their own work is being used in conjunction with AI models and services.</p>
<p>To address this customer concern, Microsoft is announcing our new Copilot Copyright Commitment. As customers ask whether they can use Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot services and the output they generate without worrying about copyright claims, we are providing a straightforward answer: yes, you can, and if you are challenged on copyright grounds, we will assume responsibility for the potential legal risks involved.</p>
<p>This new commitment extends our existing intellectual property indemnity support to commercial Copilot services and builds on our previous <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/08/announcing-microsofts-ai-customer-commitments/">AI Customer Commitments</a>. Specifically, if a third party sues a commercial customer for copyright infringement for using Microsoft‚Äôs Copilots or the output they generate, we will defend the customer and pay the amount of any adverse judgments or settlements that result from the lawsuit, as long as the customer used the guardrails and content filters we have built into our products.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll find more details below. Let me start with <em><u>why</u></em> we are offering this program:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We believe in standing behind our customers when they use our products.</strong> We are charging our commercial customers for our Copilots, and if their use creates legal issues, we should make this our problem rather than our customers‚Äô problem. This philosophy is not new: For roughly two decades we‚Äôve defended our customers against patent claims relating to our products, and we‚Äôve steadily expanded this coverage over time. Expanding our defense obligations to cover copyright claims directed at our Copilots is another step along these lines.</li>
<li><strong>We are sensitive to the concerns of authors, and we believe that Microsoft rather than our customers should assume the responsibility to address them.</strong> Even where existing copyright law is clear, generative AI is raising new public policy issues and shining a light on multiple public goals. We believe the world needs AI to advance the spread of knowledge and help solve major societal challenges. Yet it is critical for authors to retain control of their rights under copyright law and earn a healthy return on their creations. And we should ensure that the content needed to train and ground AI models is not locked up in the hands of one or a few companies in ways that would stifle competition and innovation. We are committed to the hard and sustained efforts that will be needed to take creative and constructive steps to advance all these goals.</li>
<li><strong>We have built important guardrails into our Copilots to help respect authors‚Äô copyrights.</strong> We have incorporated filters and other technologies that are designed to reduce the likelihood that Copilots return infringing content. These build on and complement our work to protect digital safety, security, and privacy, based on a broad range of guardrails such as classifiers, metaprompts, content filtering, and operational monitoring and abuse detection, including that which potentially infringes third-party content. Our new Copilot Copyright Commitment requires that customers use these technologies, creating incentives for everyone to better respect copyright concerns.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>More details on our Copilot Copyright Commitment</strong></p>
<p>The Copilot Copyright Commitment extends Microsoft‚Äôs existing IP indemnification coverage to copyright claims relating to the use of our AI-powered Copilots, including the output they generate, specifically for paid versions of Microsoft commercial Copilot services and Bing Chat Enterprise. This includes Microsoft 365 Copilot that brings generative AI to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more ‚Äì enabling a user to reason across their data or turn a document into a presentation. It also includes GitHub Copilot, which enables developers to spend less time on rote coding, and more time on creating wholly new and transformative outputs.</p>

<p>There are important conditions to this program, recognizing that there are potential ways that our technology could intentionally be misused to generate harmful content. To protect against this, customers must use the content filters and other safety systems built into the product and must not attempt to generate infringing materials, including not providing input to a Copilot service that the customer does not have appropriate rights to use.</p>
<p>This new benefit doesn‚Äôt change Microsoft‚Äôs position that it does not claim any intellectual property rights in the outputs of its Copilot services.</p>
<p>We have published more details of the Copilot Copyright Commitment for customers and welcome the opportunity to have further conversations as Copilots become more widely available.</p>
<p><strong>Our shared AI journey</strong></p>
<p>Today‚Äôs announcement is a first step. Like all new technologies, AI raises legal questions that our industry will need to work through with a wide array of stakeholders. This step represents a pledge to our customers that the copyright liability of our products is ours to shoulder, not theirs.</p>
<p>Microsoft is bullish on the benefits of AI, but, as with any powerful technology, we‚Äôre clear-eyed about the challenges and risks associated with it, including protecting creative works. It is our responsibility to help manage these risks by listening to and working with others in the tech sector, authors and artists and their representatives, government officials, the academic community, and civil society. We look forward to building on such announcements with new initiatives that help ensure that AI advances the spread of knowledge while protecting the rights and needs of creators.</p>

           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;Active North Korean campaign targeting security researchers&quot;
         }"><p data-block-key="83kli">In January 2021, Threat Analysis Group (TAG) <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/">publicly disclosed</a> a campaign from government backed actors in North Korea who used 0-day exploits to target security researchers working on vulnerability research and development. Over the past two and a half years, TAG has continued to track and disrupt campaigns from these actors, <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/">finding 0-days</a> and protecting online users. Recently, TAG became aware of a new campaign likely from the same actors based on similarities with the previous campaign. TAG is aware of at least one actively exploited 0-day being used to target security researchers in the past several weeks. The vulnerability has been reported to the affected vendor and is in the process of being patched.</p><p data-block-key="9i3qk">While our analysis of this campaign continues, we are providing an early notification of our initial findings to warn the security research community. We hope this post will remind security researchers that they could be targets of government backed attackers and to stay vigilant of security practices.</p></div>

         }">
        <p data-block-key="83kli">Similar to the previous campaign TAG reported on, North Korean threat actors used social media sites like X (formerly Twitter) to build rapport with their targets. In one case, they carried on a months-long conversation, attempting to collaborate with a security researcher on topics of mutual interest. After initial contact via X, they moved to an encrypted messaging app such as Signal, WhatsApp or Wire. Once a relationship was developed with a targeted researcher, the threat actors sent a malicious file that contained at least one 0-day in a popular software package.</p>

         }"><p data-block-key="83kli">In addition to targeting researchers with 0-day exploits, the threat actors also developed a standalone Windows tool that has the stated goal of 'download debugging symbols from Microsoft, Google, Mozilla and Citrix symbol servers for reverse engineers.' The <a href="https://github.com/dbgsymbol/">source code</a> for this tool was first published on GitHub on September 30, 2022, with several updates being released since. On the surface, this tool appears to be a useful utility for quickly and easily downloading symbol information from a number of different sources. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/symbols">Symbols</a> provide additional information about a binary that can be helpful when debugging software issues or while conducting vulnerability research.</p><p data-block-key="2u0jk">But the tool also has the ability to download and execute arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled domain. If you have downloaded or run this tool, TAG recommends taking precautions to ensure your system is in a known clean state, likely requiring a reinstall of the operating system.</p></div>

Your local Bar Association will be able to give you a list of firms/attorneys that practice in this area, or your existing lawyer may have a recommendation. Many law firms will give you a short consultation for free. Bring a succinct written summary of the facts with you that briefly describes the product, how you discovered the issue, and what you found when you investigated, with dates. Include a list of evidence items you have already collected. Litigation is difficult and expensive, but if you have a strong case (and it sounds like you do) then the law firm may take it on contingency in return for a larger portion of the settlement/judgment.<p>EDIT: I wouldn't trust the opinions of the 'just execute better' posters here, considering your competitors' employees already infiltrated your slack channel.

Other factors to consider include cost, embarrassing facts that may emerge during discovery, and reputational damage. That's why cases are often settled on the eve of trial, sometimes for significant sums.<p>Getting a professional opinion on the options is generally better than just making assumptions. Copycats and rip-offs are a fact of life, but that doesn't mean they should enjoy free reign. It's not that I think litigation is better than execution, but people exclusively advocating the latter are expressing an opinion about how they think things should work in a perfect world while not having any assets of their own on the line.

It happens all the time. Personally I would prefer that the world didn't work this way, but it's just how the game is played.<p>There are a lot of people in the tech world with the right connections, access to capital, and execution skill, but who either aren't creative enough to come up with an innovative product, or prefer to be the nth-mover in an already-validated market to the risk of trying to establish a new market. If they see that you have a good idea but aren't executing/growing/raising money at an A+ level, they will swoop in and copy your idea and then pretend that they were the first to come up with it.</p><p>There's nothing necessarily wrong with this apart from (imo) being kind of lame on a personal level. The consumer ultimately benefits from the competition, and you have only yourself to blame really for creating an opening by not executing quickly and effectively enough. It's capitalism. All the solutions to this 'problem' I've ever heard proposed--software patents and the like--create far worse problems for people who want to innovate.</p><p>If you're working on a new idea and are seeing real traction, you just need to expect this and factor it into your strategy. This is why so much emphasis is placed on having a 'moat' of some kind that is difficult to reproduce. If you're seeing success and it's easy to copy you, someone's probably already working on a clone.

        <p>Since Tailscale was founded in 2019, customers have been forced to choose between either Tailscale or Mullvad without the ability for them to co-exist.</p>

<p>Today we announce a partnership with Tailscale that allows you to use both in conjunction through the Tailscale app. This functionality is not available through the Mullvad VPN app.</p>

<p>This partnership allows customers of Tailscale to make use of our WireGuard VPN servers as ‚Äúexit nodes‚Äù. This means that whilst connected to Tailscale, you can access your devices across Tailscale‚Äôs mesh network, whilst still connecting outbound through Mullvad VPN WireGuard servers in any location.</p>

<p>Some simple examples of this could be:</p>

<p><strong>Mobile phone:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Connects to a PC via Tailscale at your home to access private photo albums</li>
	<li>At the same time: browses the Internet via a Mullvad VPN server located in Sweden</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal computer:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Connects via Tailscale to another PC whilst in a cafe to work on self-hosted documents</li>
	<li>At the same time: sends all other traffic through Mullvad VPN whilst on unencrypted WiFi</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more on using Mullvad exit nodes with Tailscales VPN service on Tailscales website here: <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1258/mullvad-exit-nodes/">https://tailscale.com/kb/1258/mullvad-exit-nodes/</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">https://blog.kagi.com/small-web</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37420281">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p>As a part of our ongoing pursuit to humanize the web, we are pleased to announce the launch of Kagi Small Web.</p>

<h2>What is Kagi Small Web?</h2>

<p>While there is no single definition, ‚Äúsmall web‚Äù typically refers to the non-commercial part of the web, crafted by individuals to express themselves or share knowledge without seeking any financial gain. This concept often evokes nostalgia for the early, less commercialized days of the web, before the ad-supported business model took over the internet (and we started <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over">fighting back</a>!)</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding, Ben Hoyt‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">The Small Web is Beautiful</a>‚Äù serves as an excellent primer. Additionally, our GitHub repository links to <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb#small-web-is-beautiful">several more articles</a> on this topic.</p>

<p>Kagi Small Web offers a fresh approach by promoting recently published content from the ‚Äúsmall web.‚Äù We gather new content, published within the last week, from a handpicked list of blogs and surface it in multiple ways:</p>

<ul>

<p>Initially inspired by a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081">vibrant discussion on Hacker News</a>, we began our experiment in late July, <a href="https://twitter.com/KagiHQ/status/1685376538852687873">highlighting blog posts from HN users</a> within our search results. The positive feedback propelled the initiative forward. Today, our evolving concept boasts a curated list of nearly 6,000 genuine websites featuring people with a wide variety of interests.</p>

<p>The entire Kagi Small Web initiative, including the list of curated websites, is open-source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb">Kagi‚Äôs GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Small Web in Kagi Search: A Unique Flavor</h2>

<p>Since inception, we‚Äôve been featuring content from the small web through our proprietary Teclis and TinyGem <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/search-details/search-sources.html#internal">search indexes</a>. This inclusion of high-quality, lesser-known parts of the web is part of what sets Kagi‚Äôs search results apart and gives them a unique flavor.</p>

<p>Today we‚Äôre taking this a step further by integrating Kagi Small Web results into the index.</p>

<p>For instance, a search for ‚Äú<a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=swiftui&amp;r=us&amp;sh=KDbKVza9CAapjd2vu2dOmg">swiftui</a>‚Äù now brings up <a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftui-sensory-feedback/">this</a> intriguing article from the small web.  It discusses a noteworthy change in iOS 17 and comes from Keith Harrison‚Äôs ‚ÄúUse Your Loaf‚Äù blog. Yes, you‚Äôve just met one of your ‚Äúweb neighbors.‚Äù</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694022077-846506-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-104044.png" alt="swiftui search example"></p>

<p>(note that the example Kagi search URL has been generated using Kagi‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/getting-started/#sharing-search-results">Share this Search</a>‚Äù feature, enabling users without a Kagi account to view the results)</p>

<p>And to compare to the above, see Google‚Äôs search results for ‚Äú<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=swiftui">swiftui</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>Another example: a search for ‚Äú<a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=apple+watch&amp;r=us&amp;sh=dx8wSwPLpyWhxxOEJvGJQQ">apple watch</a>‚Äù yields <a href="https://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/so-long-apple-watch/">this recent piece</a> from Timo‚Äôs ‚ÄòScreaming at My Screen‚Äô blog.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694023033-814006-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-105649.png" alt="apple watch example"></p>

<p>Notice how it adds a fresh perspective to the prevailing opinions on Apple Watch, including a fascinating neighboring result about <a href="https://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2015/07/apple-watch-pixels/">Apple Watch Pixels</a> from 2015, coming from our Teclis index.</p>

<p>Compare this diversity to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+watch">Google‚Äôs results</a> for the same term.</p>

<p>We strongly believe that including the results from the ‚Äúsmall web‚Äù not only brings us closer to a more humane experience in the web search, but makes the search genuinely better!</p>

<h2>Introducing the Kagi Small Web Website</h2>

<p>We are also launching the <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">Kagi Small Web website</a>,  a new platform through which we want to surface all the recent content from the small web, that usually zips by in legacy search engines.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694030544-838854-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-130216.png" alt="Kagi Small Web website"></p>

<p>Designed in line with the ethos of the ‚Äúsmall web,‚Äù our website operates without JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here, you can ‚Äúappreciate‚Äù a post or jot down a temporary public note about it. These notes will vanish in about a week as we cycle in new content - emphasizing the fleeting, imperfect nature of the small web.</p>

<p>When we previewed the site to a select group of beta testers on our <a href="https://kagi.com/discord">Discord channel</a>, one user was especially excited to find their blog among the curated feeds. Though they hadn‚Äôt posted recently and weren‚Äôt featured on the KSW website, they felt inspired to write more. This enthusiasm serves as a direct counter to the creeping ‚Äúadshitification‚Äù of the web, encouraging genuine content over commercial clutter.</p>

<p>Our selection criteria for the curated feeds are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The blog must have a post at least three years old.</li>
<li>Content must be in English (hard to curate non-English).</li>
<li>The site should offer authentic self-expression or high informational value.</li>
<li>No NSFW</li>
</ul>

<p>For a post to appear on the KSW website, additional conditions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>It needs to be no older than seven days.</li>
<li>The site should be compatible with iframe embedding. If it‚Äôs not, we‚Äôll still index it for our search results.</li>
</ul>

<p>The website is also <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/tree/main/app">open source</a>, and we‚Äôre open to merge requests.</p>

<h2>Discover Small YouTube</h2>

<p>Explore our experimental ‚ÄúSmall YouTube‚Äù feature <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb/?yt">here</a>.</p>

<p>It surfaces content from emerging YouTube creators who have fewer than 400k subscribers. Your feedback on this criterion is welcome.</p>

<h2>Access via Feed and API</h2>

<p>Obtain real-time updates from Kagi Small Web through our <a href="https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed/">RSS feed</a>, refreshed every 5 hours.</p>

<p>For API enthusiasts, Kagi Small Web is integrated into our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html">TinyGem index</a>, offering high-quality, non-mainstream news from around the web at $2 per 1000 queries.</p>

<h2>How to Contribute and Provide Feedback</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre open to refinements. If you notice omissions or inclusions that don‚Äôt fit, please contribute to our curated list following the <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/tree/main#add-a-site-or-channel-to-the-list">guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>For bug reports and feature suggestions, head to <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/">kagifeedback.org</a> and use the small-web tag to categorize your post.</p>

<p>For general discussions, join us on <a href="https://kagi.com/discord">Kagi Discord</a>.</p>

<h2>Final Words</h2>

<p>The driving question behind this initiative was simple yet profound: the web is made of millions of humans, so where are they? Why do they get overshadowed in traditional search engines, and how can we remedy this?</p>

<p>This project required a certain leap of faith as the content we crawl may contain anything, and we are putting our reputation on the line vouching for it.</p>

<p>But we also recognize that the ‚Äúsmall web‚Äù is the lifeblood of the internet, and the web we are fighting for. Those who contribute to it have already taken their own leaps of faith, often taking time and effort to create, without the assurance of an audience.</p>

<p>Our goal is to change that narrative. Together with the global community of people who envision a different web, we‚Äôre committed to revitalizing a digital space abundant in creativity, self-expression, and meaningful content - a more humane web for all.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:09:19 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/mullvad-integration/">https://tailscale.com/blog/mullvad-integration/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37420053">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Tailscale has partnered with Mullvad to make its global network of VPN servers available for our customers. You can now easily browse the web using any one of Mullvad‚Äôs available servers as a Tailscale <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/">exit node</a> while maintaining the user privacy that‚Äôs synonymous with Mullvad.</p>
<p><a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad</a> is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service that‚Äôs known for its strong commitment to user privacy, anonymity, and security. It safeguards user privacy by not logging or monitoring user activity, and it uses a unique account number system for subscriptions, meaning personal data is not tied to your account. Services like Mullvad help you browse the internet more privately.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this new partnership means that even when you‚Äôre far from home, you can stay connected to the things you care about via Tailscale and maintain private internet browsing from your tailnet thanks to Mullvad‚Äôs secure and high-speed global network.</p>
<h3 id="tailscale-vs-mullvad">Tailscale vs. Mullvad</h3>
<p>You may have heard the term VPN being used interchangeably to refer to Tailscale and services like Mullvad. While both uses are technically correct, there‚Äôs a stark difference in why you‚Äôd use each type of service. Tailscale helps smooth out the connectivity problems of today by building you a personal private internet, which we call a tailnet. This helps you connect to the services and people you care about, securely, from just about anywhere on the planet. Privacy VPNs help you connect to the internet in a secure, private, and anonymous manner. You can protect yourself from advertisers, ISPs, threat actors on a public Wi-Fi network, marketing sites, and more by using a privacy VPN to mask your device identity.</p>
<p>Before today, you‚Äôd have to roll your own infrastructure to get some of the same benefits of a privacy VPN while using Tailscale. With our Mullvad partnership, that changes.</p>
<h3 id="mullvad-is-your-privacy-edge">Mullvad is your privacy edge</h3>
<p>When you use Mullvad, you get instant access to hundreds of servers in 40+ countries around the world. To connect to any one of those servers, your device generates a WireGuard key pair: the public key is used to identify peers in Mullvad‚Äôs infrastructure, and the private key is used to encrypt traffic. When you use Tailscale with a Mullvad exit node, it‚Äôs the same thing! Your node registers its existing Tailscale-generated WireGuard key pair with Mullvad‚Äôs infrastructure. Any traffic coming over the internet is terminated at Mullvad‚Äôs network edge, and end-to-end encrypted all the way to your device. Basically, you get to bring Mullvad‚Äôs entire fleet of servers into your tailnet.</p>
<h3 id="tailscale-is-a-coordination-layer">Tailscale is a coordination layer</h3>

        <p>Mullvad never knows who you are; just that a device is connecting to one of its servers to proxy internet-bound traffic.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tailscale acts as a coordination layer between your devices and Mullvad‚Äôs network edge. Tailscale‚Äôs control layer continually updates the available Mullvad network map, and tells your devices which servers to connect to in each available region or city, and alerts your device of any changes that may affect your connection. Tailscale then lets your device know which Mullvad nodes are available, and sends your device connection information for the selected region or city. From there, traffic goes directly through the connected Mullvad node to the internet. Like other traffic flowing over your tailnet, your data is end-to-end encrypted. Tailscale doesn‚Äôt have the private key, so we can‚Äôt see your traffic.</p>
<h3 id="using-mullvad-exit-nodes">Using Mullvad Exit Nodes</h3>
<p>Starting today, you can use Mullvad exit nodes to do things like privately and securely browse the web at home or on-the-go, protect yourself prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, connect to the internet from specific locations around the globe, and forward non-standard port traffic like web, game, or media servers through Mullvad‚Äôs network edge. Want to give it a try yourself?</p>
<ul>
<li>To enable Mullvad Exit Nodes, have a tailnet admin head over to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general">general settings</a> page of your admin console, and click <strong>Configure</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the devices you‚Äôd like to use with Mullvad on your tailnet.</li>

<h3 id="private-and-mostly-anonymous">Private and (mostly) anonymous</h3>
<p>Tailscale is a privacy-first company, and we go out of our way to design our software to preserve the privacy of its users. We‚Äôre also an identity-based company, and that property is similarly built into our architecture. Each Tailscale connection is a WireGuard tunnel ‚Äî which is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that we can‚Äôt see the contents of the traffic even if we wanted to, and also authenticated, providing strong guarantees that traffic is flowing between endpoints that are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>You can see how this works in the design of the feature we‚Äôre announcing today. Mullvad is not sent any of your personal information; while Tailscale knows who you are through associated identity providers, this information is never needed for a connection to Mullvad‚Äôs servers. We let your local Tailscale client know where to send over its public WireGuard keys to establish a connection. From there, any traffic to the internet will flow through Mullvad VPN infrastructure, obscuring the personal details of your device, network, and connection from prying eyes.</p>
<p>For many use cases, that is a great combination. You get Tailscale‚Äôs strong privacy guarantees and a framework that keeps the number of parties with access to your identity to a minimum. It‚Äôs not true anonymity, because that‚Äôs a problem Tailscale is not trying to solve. But for the many users who want Tailscale‚Äôs powerful encryption and ease of use, and whose threat model allows for that kind of conditional anonymity, it works.</p>
<p>There are also valid use cases that require privacy <em>and</em> true anonymity. But there are risks to providing these guarantees commercially, <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/5/29/removing-the-support-for-forwarded-ports/">as cited by Mullvad</a> and <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/blog/gradual-removal-of-port-forwarding/">others</a>. Bad actors can take advantage of these services, turning them into abuse vectors. That in turn can lead to a worse experience for everyone, including the people who most rely on these services for their own safety. This is a genuinely hard problem, compounded by the fact that it can affect vulnerable populations with very little room for error. For people with this challenging threat model, education is important: resources like <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/">EFF‚Äôs Surveillance Self-Defense guide</a> can help explain what tools are appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="mullvad--tailscale">Mullvad + Tailscale</h3>
<p>Mullvad exit nodes are ready to use starting today, available as a public beta. You can scale your Mullvad use across your family or team for a rate of $5 per month for every 5 devices with access, with recurring automated billing. Mullvad is available as a paid add-on to any current Tailscale plans, including our Free plan. To get started, head over to your <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general">general settings</a> tab in the admin console and select <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>

<p>Moviegoers, critics, and the average internet user have all used the aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes at one point or another. The website categorizes films and shows from ‚Äúfresh‚Äù to ‚Äúrotten,‚Äù with rotten being those with lower ratings. Now it looks like the site‚Äôs scores have been <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/2019/02/27/captain-marvel-rotten-tomatoes-early-user-reviews-disabled/">manipulated</a> for more than five years.</p>
<p>As noted via <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html">Vulture</a>, it looks like a PR firm has manipulated movie scores on Rotten Tomatoes by paying the critics directly. This has been happening for years.</p>
<p>The PR firm, named Bunker 15, is said to pay as much as $50.00 for a single Rotten Tomatoes review. The payments, which aren‚Äôt typically disclosed, are usually given to obscure critics who happen to be part of a pool tracked by Rotten Tomatoes. Though it‚Äôs worth noting that the aggregation site‚Äôs rules prohibit <strong>‚ÄúReviewing based on a financial incentive.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>Director <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/tag/paul-schrader/">Paul Schrader</a>, also a critic, spoke out against Rotten Tomatoes which he says is part of a <strong>‚Äúbroken‚Äù</strong> system.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúThe system is broken. Audiences are dumber. Normal people don‚Äôt go through reviews like they used to. Rotten Tomatoes is something the studios can game. So they do.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>The site responded by delisting a variety of Bunker 15 films from their website. Furthermore, they issued a warning to any critics that reviewed them. The warning emphasizes that they do not tolerate manipulation on their platform.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúWe take the integrity of our scores seriously and do not tolerate any attempts to manipulate them. We have a dedicated team who monitors our platforms regularly and thoroughly investigates and resolves any suspicious activity.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs possible that there are other similar cases happening on the website. And while <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/tag/rotten-tomatoes/">RT</a> can try to remove these websites ‚Äì it looks like moviegoers, critics, and even studios feel that audiences just rely too heavily on the platform. And, for that reason alone, it makes sense why manipulation is bound to happen.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to ScreenGeek for any additional updates on this situation with Rotten Tomatoes as we have them.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce that Arduino raised an additional $22 million round, taking our Series B funding to $54 million, thanks to an expansion co-led by CDP Venture Capital and Anzu Partners. Joining them is semiconductor leader Arm, following up on earlier investments.</p>
<p>CDP Venture Capital, Italy‚Äôs largest VC firm, invested through Large Ventures, launched in 2023 to support the scaling up of Italian global category leaders. ‚ÄúWe are proud to support the dimensional leap of Arduino, a unique global excellence in the democratization of open-source hardware and software,‚Äù said Mario Branciforti, Head of CDP Venture Capital SGR‚Äôs Large Ventures fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the first <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2022/06/07/ready-to-transform-the-enterprise-world-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$32 million Series B financing received in 2022</a>, ‚Äú<strong>This investment will allow us to further fuel our transformational platform initiative for professional customers, lowering the barriers to entry in IoT and AI by providing a continuum from hardware to Cloud</strong>,‚Äù says Arduino‚Äôs CEO Fabio Violante.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to know more about how the funds will be put to good use? A major chunk will be invested to further strengthen the R&amp;D team based in Turin, Italy, with the goal to grow enterprise application libraries and the Arduino Cloud for Business with more integrations and embedded AI features. Another consistent part is earmarked to help Arduino <strong>grow even more in the US</strong>, where we recently opened an office in Austin, TX and bolstered our presence in Chicago, IL. Finally, we will use the additional funds to <strong>accelerate go-to-market initiatives and customer support</strong> in selected areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúArduino came a long way from its humble beginning, becoming a powerful industrial tool used by cutting-edge organizations all over the world. I‚Äôm honored by this investment which is a further confirmation that our original formula keeps applying to new domains.‚Äù</p><cite>‚Äî Massimo Banzi, Arduino‚Äôs co-founder, chairman and CMO</cite></blockquote>
<p>This continued and expanding confidence from investors reflects the quality of the work we‚Äôve been able to do, building a global company based on the strong values we share with every user in our amazing community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Jimmy Kan, Partner at Anzu Partners, ‚ÄúThe enterprise ecosystem is on the cusp of a seismic transformation, driven by the convergence of efficient AI and IoT at the edge. Arduino stands at the heart of this revolution, and their commitment to innovation promises to redefine the industry norms.‚Äù Making technology accessible remains our mission, because <strong>the key to our success is empowering users</strong>: ‚ÄúArduino supports an extensive community of developers who play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of new computing solutions for IoT applications,‚Äù says Paul Williamson, senior vice president and general manager, IoT Line of Business at Arm.&nbsp;</p>

The state respects the cultural differences and lifestyles of ethnic groups, and ensures the equal rights of ethnic minorities in politics, economy, culture, language and folk customs, religious belief and other aspects, with coordinated measures. In 2013 China‚Äôs ethnic minorities and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities made new achievements and developments in various undertakings, and all ethnic minorities fully enjoyed and effectively exercised their basic rights. The political rights of ethnic minorities are fully guaranteed. Areas inhibited by ethnic minorities in compact communities exercising regional ethnic autonomy enjoy autonomous rights in a wide range of areas, including legislative power, flexibility in the execution of relevant state laws and regulations, the right to use their own spoken and written languages, personnel management power, financial management power, and the right of independently developing their special culture and education. The advantages of regional ethnic autonomy are best exemplified in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Xinjiang is an ethnic autonomous area mainly inhibited by the Uyghur people. Autonomous organs at all levels in Xinjiang formulate and implement autonomous regulations, local rules and regulations, and legally binding decisions in light of their actual conditions, ensuring the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous areas.

<p>If you know us, you will know that we are the team behind <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">Rich</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual">Textual</a> ‚Äî two popular Python libraries that work magic in the terminal.</p>

<p>Today we are adding one project more to that lineup: <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual-web">textual-web</a>.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>Textual Web takes a Textual-powered TUI and turns it in to a web application.
Here's a video of that in action:</p>
<p>
<iframe width="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8k8TD7_wg0" title="Textual Web in action" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>With the <code>textual-web</code> command you can publish any Textual app on the web, making it available to anyone you send the URL to.
This works without creating a socket server on your machine, so you won't have to configure firewalls and ports to share your applications.</p>
<p>We're excited about the possibilities here.
Textual web apps are fast to spin up and tear down, and they can run just about anywhere that has an outgoing internet connection.
They can be built by a single developer without any experience with a traditional web stack.
All you need is proficiency in Python and a little time to read our <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">lovely docs</a>.</p>
<p>Future releases will expose more of the Web platform APIs to Textual apps, such as notifications and file system access.
We plan to do this in a way that allows the same (Python) code to drive those features.
For instance, a Textual app might save a file to disk in a terminal, but offer to download it in the browser.</p>
<p>Also in the pipeline is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">PWA</a> support, so you can build terminal apps, web apps, and desktop apps with a single codebase.</p>
<p>Textual Web is currently in a public beta. Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Discord server</a> if you would like to help us test, or if you have any questions.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Welcome to snake-fury</strong>: the Haskell challenge for beginners. This challenge aims to provide a learning path for people willing to learn Haskell further than basic recursion exercises by implementing the snake game in Haskell. Snake-fury's pedagogical approach is based on two legs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>snake-fury isn't a tutorial but a challenge.</li>
<li>snake-fury is focused on learning by refactoring, not by example.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The first leg means that you'll be asked to implement some functions/algorithms. It is expected that the challenger will be unable to implement them without some research on Hackage's documentation, blogs, youtube videos, etc. There will be guidelines to help the challenger. Nevertheless, an important skill when learning Haskell is to be able to search, read and understand the documentation that is (often, but not always) more complex and less accessible than other programming languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second leg is even more interesting. Haskell is notoriously known for its difficulty and the popularization of the holy triad: Functor - Applicative - Monad. There are plenty of tutorials showing examples and hundreds of thousands of lines trying to make them accessible and newcomer-friendly... But with all due respect, It seems they all fail to explain: "Why monads? Why not other less mathematical abstraction? Why not classic OOP patterns?". The approach given by snake-fury is to make the same application twice... it sounds crazy, but the idea goes like this: You'll implement a "pure" version of the snake game: No monads, no functors, no abstractions [<a href="#note-about-not-using-monads">see below</a>]. Then you will refactor the core application logic using the state and reader monads. Then you'll be asked to abstract your code and to use <code>mtl</code> classes to make your code less dependent on the concrete implementation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below there is a dramatization of Haskell's learning curve. This challenge aims to be a helpful companion from the newby slope to the temple of oblivion... but be aware, nothing will save you from the temptation of abandon. Hopefully, you'll be able to climb up to the temple and spread the lambdas</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/assets/Haskell_learning_curve.png"><img src="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/raw/main/assets/Haskell_learning_curve.png" alt="dramatization of Haskell's learning curve"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">note about not using monads</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">By that I mean, not using do notation nor functor/applicative/monads combinators like <code>liftA2</code>, <code>fmap</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, etc...
Obviously, The IO and the asynchronous part of the code are provided and the challenger is not expected to solve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Start coding: Building a MVP</h2>
<p dir="auto">First you need access to a Haskell development environment. You can either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install it locally following the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/get-started/" rel="nofollow">official guide</a> (Recommended).</li>
<li>You can use gitpod to quickly jump into an <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/getting-started" rel="nofollow">online environment</a>. Follow these considerations:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You will need a fork of the repo in order to save your progress</li>
<li>If you are a <code>stack</code> user, modify the <code>hie.yaml</code> so the cradle is <code>stack</code> not <code>cabal</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once you have a dev-env up and running, clone the code and move to <code>snake-fury-exercise</code> branch</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury.git

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Continue coding: Refactors</h2>
<p dir="auto">You've built a minimum viable product. Now it is time to improve it!. In the <code>exercises</code> folder you have intructions for refactoring. Follow them one by one as enumerated. One of the ideas is you feel the power of the type system when refactoring. Also you'll be dealing with poor design choices implemented in the mpv part.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>refactor-1</strong>: you will move from you mvp to a full snake game with all the functionality: like a score counter and increasing speed. Also, you'll deal with performance issue the mvp has.</li>
<li><strong>refactor-2</strong>: you will refactor the logic of the game to use the state monad. Hopefully you'll find code much easier to read.</li>
<li><strong>refactor-3</strong>: you will refactor the logic of the game to use the reader + state monad stack. Also, as an optional but recommended exercise, you can learn about the IO monad</li>
<li><strong>refactor-4</strong>: You will refactor the code to use <code>mtl</code> like constraints. Now the code looks a little bit abstract but it is easy to read and follow</li>
<li><strong>refactor-5</strong>: Finally, you'll refactor the code to be fully abstracted over the monad stack you use. You will create you own type classes expressing exactly the actions you want to execute.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Solution branches</h2>
<p dir="auto">You have multiple solutions branches, one for each refactor step and one for the mvp. Below you have the relation of branches and refactors. You can run <code>git branch -l</code> to see the list of all branches.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>solution-mvp</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the first exercise</li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the first refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-1.md">exercises/refactor-1</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-2.1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the second refactor, step 1 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-2.md#step-1-apply-changes-locally">exercises/refactor-2</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-2.2</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the second refactor, step 2 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-2.md#step-2-did-you-spot-the-pattern-thats-a-monad">exercises/refactor-2</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-3</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the third refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-3.md">exercises/refactor-3</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-4.1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fourth refactor, step 1 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-4.md#step-1-mtl-constraints">exercises/refactor-4</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-4.2</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fourth refactor, step 2 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-4.md#step-2-glue-together-renderstate-and-gamestate">exercises/refactor-4</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-5</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fifth refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-5.md">exercises/refactor-5</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">My solution might be different than yours, and that is totally fine. All solution branches should build and run the same as your exercise branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">note 1: <code>main</code> branch is unstable an you shouldn't build it. Contains all sort of experiments, including an heavy sdl front-end</p>
<p dir="auto">note 2: At the moment, the <code>main</code> branch doesn't use frames per second but microseconds as input parameter. Hence <code>cabal run snake-fury -- 10 10 100000</code> will run at 10 fps. In the exercise branch, the input parameter is correct. So if you want to build from <code>main</code> be aware of this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2>
<p dir="auto">The general architecture of the software is the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There are three major components:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>An <em>Event Queue</em>: It keeps a queue of the following events to happen in the game based on the user keyboard input</li>
<li>A <em>Game State</em>: Is the logic state. It keeps track on the snake body, the current apple, the direction of movement, etc...</li>
<li>A <em>Render State</em>: Is the game board. Instead of building up the board from the GameState, we keep an array in memory and modify it as convenient</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each compoment sends a message to the next one in the following order: <code>(user keyboard) -&gt; EventQueue -&gt; GameState -&gt; RenderState -&gt; (render device)</code></li>
<li>We have two threads:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The secondary thread is continuously reading from user's keyboard and pushing the key strokes into an asynchronous <code>EventQueue</code></li>
<li>The main thread reads at steady time from the <code>EventQueue</code>, and based on what the user has pressed, it runs the game logic and prints the board in the console</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Notice that two threads are necessary, since user could press keys faster than the game updates (fps). For example let say we run a frame each second and a half (normal speed in the snake game), then a user is likely to press keys faster than that. If the key strokes are catched only when a frame is about to be rendered, then many strokes will be lost.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following diagram helps to visualize</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/assets/snake_architecture.png"><img src="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/raw/main/assets/snake_architecture.png" alt="Overview of the architecture"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributions and Feedback</h2>
<p dir="auto">Please, open an issue if you:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>find some solution branch doesn't build. Typically this is due to some external dependencies not available or an error with <code>cabal</code>. Add label <em>solution branch does not build</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If you think the README or any of the exercises is poorly written, or could be improved substantially. Add label <em>documentation</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If the software builds but it missbehaves. For example, the snake doesn't move, or the board looks wrong. Add label <em>bug</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If you want to provide some feedback (see below). Add label <em>feedback</em> to the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you want to contribute with a PR, take into account that due to the refactoring nature of the challenge, there are many branches. This makes integration difficult but you should follow these two rules:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> should be merge into <code>main</code> branch. This rule apply to README, any markdown under <code>exercises</code>, and any file in the <code>assets</code> folder</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> should be merge into <code>solution-mvp</code> if the change applies to all refactors; Or merge into <code>solution-refactor-XXX</code> if the change applies only to that refactor, hence you should branch out from the corresponding branch. Any change done in <code>solution-mvp</code> is merge into <code>snake-fury-exercise</code> and <code>solution-refactor-XXX</code>.</li>
<li>If you aren't sure how to contribute, just ask :)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The branch graph look like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="main

             |-solution-refactor-4.2
               |-solution-refactor-5</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Also I'd appreciate if you write some feedback for me. As already said, open an issue with a label <em>feedback</em>. These issue won't be closed, as it is easier for someone comming to the challenge to filter by open issues with label <em>feedback</em>, rather than closed issues. Please, do not use the <em>feedback</em> issue for any other than providing feedback, so if you have an idea on how to improve the challenge open a second issue with your proposal. Ideally <em>feedback</em> issue will have a maximum of two comments: the feedback itself, and a second comment in case the issue is outdated due to changes.  Avoid meaningless feeback if possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Positive feedback should answer these questions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How much Haskell did you know before starting the challenge?</li>
<li>Does the project helped you with some concepts more than other resources?</li>
<li>In your opinion, What's the most difficult part?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Negative feedback (is welcome) should answer these questions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How much Haskell did you know before starting the challenge?</li>
<li>How much of the project have you completed?</li>
<li>How can I improve the challenge?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wrong positive feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is cool!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Right positive feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is cool!. I learnt some Haskell a year ago but could not build anything usefull with it (so I was in the valley of frustration and abandom the language). Monads are much clearer now, I am still wrapping my head around mtl style, but sure I will get it!!.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wrong negative feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is worthless</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Right negative feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is worthless. I've being learning Haskell for the last 6 months and still I am unable to build anything usefull. Building the mpv is doable (but very difficult), but when you start with the first refactor you end up touching the f**** IO monad and using ByteString/Builder. Why on earth Haskell hasn't a good default string library??.</p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge should make an effort to explain all the inconviniences newcommers should face when getting into the language.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:21:44 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/uk_government_clause_online_safety_bill/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/uk_government_clause_online_safety_bill/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37416909">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> Sanity appears to have prevailed in the debate over the UK Online Safety bill after the government agreed to ditch proposals - at least for the time being - to legislate the scanning of encrypted messages.</p>
<p>In response to questions regarding the technical feasibility of scanning messages and the assessments that Ofcom must make, Lord Parkinson, a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport minister, <a target="_blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-09-06/debates/4AC6A32E-0C53-46C7-A714-AD4165C484D7/OnlineSafetyBill">said</a>: "If the appropriate technology does not exist that meets these requirements, then Ofcom will not be able to use Clause 122 to require its use."</p>
<p>Clause 122 in the Online Safety Bill relates to online terrorism and child exploitation content.</p>

    

<p>Parkinson said: "A notice can be issued only where technically feasible and where technology has been accredited as meeting minimum standards of accuracy."</p>

        


        

<p>Thus no scanning of encrypted messages unless it is technically feasible to do so. Quantum computing, anyone?</p>
<h3>Victory? Not so fast...</h3>
<p>The statements have been widely interpreted as a victory for technology firms, many of which had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/online_safety_bill_age_checks/">threatened</a> to exit the UK over the requirement that it must be possible for encrypted messages to be scanned for illegal content.</p>
<p>However, it could also be argued that the changes only represent the bare minimum needed to get the bill across the line. The controversial clauses remain largely in place, with the buck passed to future administrations, or to when reading the messages becomes "technically feasible."</p>
<p>Matthew Hodgson, CEO of Element, said: "The government saying 'no scanning until it's technically feasible' is nonsense. Scanning is fundamentally incompatible with end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. Scanning bypasses the encryption in order to scan, exposing your messages to attackers."</p>

        

<p>He told <i>The Register</i> that the statement and the reaction from some section of the tech community left him terrified. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a win at all,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Hodgson continued: ‚Äúthe ministers must be feeling utterly smug‚Ä¶ the pressure has been removed from them to change the bill and stop scanning, and they didn‚Äôt have to do anything‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt's terrible because the law still says that scanning can be obligated on encrypted messaging providers, it would still undermine end to end encryption. And all it is [doing] is pushing it slightly down the line until somebody decides it's technically feasible, which is a completely subjective thing.‚Äù</p>

        

<p>Martina Larkin, CEO of Project Liberty, queried the thinking behind the clause and said: "No one is questioning that more must be done to protect people, especially children, online. However the debate should not be about protecting children versus protecting privacy. We can have, and should have, both."</p>
<p>"When it comes to how we build a better web, everybody loses when rash decisions are made. Trying to protect children by building backdoors into encryption will have unprecedented negative consequences for online privacy, the use of people's data as well as the protection of free speech and democratic values. No one would ever willingly let a complete stranger read all of your mail, put cameras in their house, and follow their every move. So why do it online?"</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/29/apple_online_safety_bill_opposition/">Now Apple takes a bite out of encryption-bypassing 'spy clause' in UK internet law</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/18/wrong_time_to_weaken_encryption/">Wrong time to weaken encryption, UK IT chartered institute tells government</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/online_safety_bill_age_checks/">Online Safety Bill age checks? We won't do 'em, says Wikipedia</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/21/meta_encryption_police/">International cops urge Meta <em>not</em> to implement secure encryption for all</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We'll draw a discreet veil over the devices with potential for surveillance supplied by large technology companies that people have indeed cheerfully installed in their houses. Still, both Larkin and Hodgson make excellent points.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Index on Censorship said: "The Online Safety Bill as currently drafted is still a threat to encryption and as such puts at risk everyone from journalists working with whistleblowers to ordinary citizens talking in private. We need to see amendments urgently to protect our right to free speech online."</p>
<p>Attempts to paint the UK government's apparent climbdown as a victory for big tech is missing the point. At best, a skirmish might have been won and a ceasefire temporarily declared. However, the larger battle over privacy and encryption on the internet has yet to be fought. ¬Æ</p>

<p>Apple has acquired 50-year-old record label BIS Records, the Swedish company's founder, Robert von Bahr, <a href="https://www.bis.se/">announced</a> Tuesday. The purchase of the classical music-focused label follows Apple's late March launch of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/apple-will-launch-a-new-app-exclusively-for-classical-music-later-this-month/">Apple Music Classical</a> app.</p>
<p>Apple's BIS purchase adds to the app, which in March Apple called the "world's largest classical music catalogue" with "over" 5 million tracks. Von Bahr said the record label will be incorporated into the Apple Music Classical app and Platoon. Apple bought <a href="https://www.platoon.ai/">Platoon</a>, which identifies new talent and helps creators make, distribute, and market their content, in 2018. Von Bahr noted his just turning 80 as part of the decision to sell. He also pointed to his interest in Apple's support for spatial audio and in bringing "classical music to new audiences all over the world."</p>
<p>Neither Apple nor BIS disclosed the price of the acquisition. However, von Bahr said that he and the rest of the BIS staff will be "retained" by Apple.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The acquisition is another step in Apple's efforts to target classical music as it seeks to differentiate its streaming platform. Classical music still represents a drop in the massive bucket of on-demand music streaming. Data from data analytics firm <a href="https://luminatedata.com/blog/concerto-more-like-concert-oh/">Luminate</a> and cited by <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/apple-music-classical-app-good-streaming-business/">Billboard</a> in March found that classical music represented 0.8 percent of on-demand streams in the US in 2022. However, the data firm also <a href="https://luminatedata.com/blog/concerto-more-like-concert-oh/">said</a> in June that the classical music genre outpaced total US on-demand streaming growth in 2022 (13.4 percent year over year versus 12.2 percent year over year, respectively).</p>

<p>Apple launched Apple Music Classical as a separate app from <a href="https://howl.me/ckwW0tvIk7q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music</a> on March 28. Building upon Apple's 2018 acquisition of <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/primephonic-wants-to-save-classical-music-1-stream-at-a-time">Primephonic</a>, Apple Music Classical allows various search parameters related to classical works, from song title and composer, to conductor and orchestra names, soloist performers, and more. Additional features include composer biographies and deep-dives on famous works. Since its release, Apple Music Classical has added support for devices running Android 9 Pie and later.</p>
<p>Apple didn't respond to questions seeking clarification on how Apple Music Classical artists get paid and if it differs from payments for Apple Music artists. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-music-classical">PCMag</a> in March suggested that the classical music app pays per stream, as Apple Music does. However, that wouldn't benefit older classical works. With its BIS acquisition, Apple may gain insight into how to navigate the financial side of classical music.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>exa</strong> is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program <code>ls</code> that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it‚Äôs <strong>small</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, and just <strong>one single binary</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By deliberately making some decisions differently, exa attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of <code>ls</code>.

</h2>
<p dir="auto">exa is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.
You will need rustc version 1.66.1 or higher.
The recommended way to install Rust for development is from the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" rel="nofollow">official download page</a>, using rustup.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once Rust is installed, you can compile exa with Cargo:</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">just</a> command runner can be used to run some helpful development commands, in a manner similar to <code>make</code>.
Run <code>just --list</code> to get an overview of what‚Äôs available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you are compiling a copy for yourself, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> or <code>just build-release</code> to benefit from release-mode optimisations.
Copy the resulting binary, which will be in the <code>target/release</code> directory, into a folder in your <code>$PATH</code>.
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> is usually a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">To compile and install the manual pages, you will need <a href="https://pandoc.org/" rel="nofollow">pandoc</a>.
The <code>just man</code> command will compile the Markdown into manual pages, which it will place in the <code>target/man</code> directory.
To use them, copy them into a directory that <code>man</code> will read.
<code>/usr/local/share/man</code> is usually a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">exa depends on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs">libgit2</a> for certain features.
If you‚Äôre unable to compile libgit2, you can opt out of Git support by running <code>cargo build --no-default-features</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you intend to compile for musl, you will need to use the flag <code>vendored-openssl</code> if you want to get the Git feature working.
The full command is <code>cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --features vendored-openssl,git</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For more information, see the <a href="https://the.exa.website/install/source" rel="nofollow">Building from Source page</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing with Vagrant</h3>
<p dir="auto">exa uses <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" rel="nofollow">Vagrant</a> to configure virtual machines for testing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Programs such as exa that are basically interfaces to the system are <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/08/22/testing-for-people-who-hate-testing/#troublesome-cases" rel="nofollow">notoriously difficult to test</a>.
Although the internal components have unit tests, it‚Äôs impossible to do a complete end-to-end test without mandating the current user‚Äôs name, the time zone, the locale, and directory structure to test.
(And yes, these tests are worth doing. I have missed an edge case on many an occasion.)</p>
<p dir="auto">The initial attempt to solve the problem was just to create a directory of ‚Äúawkward‚Äù test cases, run exa on it, and make sure it produced the correct output.
But even this output would change if, say, the user‚Äôs locale formats dates in a different way.
These can be mocked inside the code, but at the cost of making that code more complicated to read and understand.</p>
<p dir="auto">An alternative solution is to fake <em>everything</em>: create a virtual machine with a known state and run the tests on <em>that</em>.
This is what Vagrant does.
Although it takes a while to download and set up, it gives everyone the same development environment to test for any obvious regressions.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, initialise the VM:</p>

<p dir="auto">The first command downloads the virtual machine image, and then runs our provisioning script, which installs Rust and exa‚Äôs build-time dependencies, configures the environment, and generates some awkward files and folders to use as test cases.
Once this is done, you can SSH in, and build and test:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ cargo build
vm$ ./xtests/run
All the tests passed!"><pre><code>host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ cargo build
vm$ ./xtests/run
All the tests passed!
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Of course, the drawback of having a standard development environment is that you stop noticing bugs that occur outside of it.
For this reason, Vagrant isn‚Äôt a <em>necessary</em> development step ‚Äî it‚Äôs there if you‚Äôd like to use it, but exa still gets used and tested on other platforms.
It can still be built and compiled on any target triple that it supports, VM or no VM, with <code>cargo build</code> and <code>cargo test</code>.</p>

    Someone keeps trying to reset my facebook password.   I keep getting these "account recovery code" emails.  They're legit.
  </p><p>
    Whoever is doing apparently doesn't have access to my email, though, as  they keep doing it and when I check logins, I only see the devices that I have with me logged in.
  </p><p>
    Is there a way I can find out who is doing this?   Or at least get an IP address of the login attempts
  </p><p>
    I want to know if this is really someone trying to steal my account, or if it's just a Facebook-connected app that I have exhibiting some kind of bizarre bug.
  </p><p>
    I've already turned on 2FA (already had it on before this, but only with text messages, I added the Authenticator app as well)
  </p><p>
    I also went ahead and actually changed my password (NOT a password reset, changed it from within account settings) , just because good security practices.
  </p><p>
    It's annoying that this is happening, but since the security measures I already had in place have defeated these attempts,  not dire.   Still, really annoying.
  </p><p>
    I've tried searching for a way to disable password reset attempts,  but the Facebook article about it just redirects back to itself.
  </p><p>
    .
  </p><p>
    Anyone have any insights?  A way to stop this?    I don't just want to mark the reset emails as spam, what if I really need to reset my password at some point?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-page-content="true"><p>As part of Canva's ongoing mission to build the world's most trusted platform, we continuously evaluate the security of our software dependencies. Identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies helps improve the security of Canva, as well as the wider internet. Coupled with security controls like sandboxing, we continue to make it increasingly difficult for attackers to reach their objectives by exploiting third-party dependencies.</p>
<p>One such dependency Canva uses is <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">librsvg</a> (via <a target="_new" href="https://www.libvips.org/">libvips</a>). We use librsvg to quickly render user-provided SVGs into thumbnails later displayed as PNGs. By exploiting differences in URL parsers when rendering an SVG with librsvg, we showed it's possible to include arbitrary files from disk in the resulting image. The <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996">librsvg maintainers quickly patched the issue</a> and issued a security vulnerability (<a target="_new" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38633">CVE-2023-38633</a>).</p>
<p>We're sharing this research as another example of the <a target="_new" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/">dangers of mixing URL parsers</a>, especially because the example we discovered is very subtle.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Federico (librsvg maintainer), John (libvips maintainer), and Lovell (<a target="_new" href="https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/">Sharp</a> maintainer) for their work and excellent coordinated response.</p>
<h2 id="prequel">Prequel</h2>
<p>The <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/elttam/publications/blob/master/writeups/inkscape-xml.md">XML Parsing Issues in Inkscape in CLI</a> write-up from Elttam's Victor Kahan shows how Inkscape is vulnerable to path traversal when rendering SVGs. Extending Victor's research, we found that while XInclude wasn't directly supported in Inkscape 0.9, it exhibited some interesting behavior when an SVG was nested in another SVG.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following inner SVG.</p>
<pre><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>svg</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xi</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>rect</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>fill:rgb(255,204,204);</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/etc/passwd</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>ASCII</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span>file not found</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre>

<p>When run with Inkscape 0.92.4, it produced an image where the XInclude fallback was triggered.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ inkscape </span><span>-f</span><span> test.svg </span><span>-e</span><span> out.png </span><span>-w</span><span> </span><span>300</span></p></pre>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="File not found" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/file-not-found.82e8094e.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>The fact that Xinclude was supported at all was surprising because it can often lead to security vulnerabilities. While Inkscape isn't used by the Canva product, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/blob/0.92.x/src/display/cairo-utils.cpp#L230">digging into the Inkscape code path</a> showed that nested images are loaded with <a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gdk-pixbuf/">GdkPixbuf</a>, which itself delegates SVG loading to <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">librsvg</a>. This was of great interest because librsvg is something that Canva <em>does</em> use.</p>
<h2 id="xinclude">XInclude</h2>
<p><a target="_new" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</a> is a mechanism for merging XML documents, which can lead to security vulnerabilities when a user-provided XML document (like an SVG) is assembled or rendered on a server.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Xinclude example" loading="lazy" width="935" height="335" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/lfi.3ef943bb.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>There are two standout elements in XInclude:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#include_element"><code>xi:include</code></a> to include contents of a referenced URL, such as a file or HTTP request. The content being included can be plaintext or XML.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#fallback_element"><code>xi:fallback</code></a> to nominate content that should be rendered when the referenced content can't be loaded by <code>xi:Include</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security checks aside, the following XML document loads the contents of <code>/etc/passwd</code> when processed.</p>
<pre><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>example</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xi</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/etc/passwd</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>ASCII</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span>file not found</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>example</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre>
<h2 id="there-are-rules">There are rules</h2>
<p>librsvg is a Rust library to render SVG images to <a target="_new" href="https://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> surfaces. Most of the heavy lifting is now implemented in Rust, but the library relies on the Cairo and GNOME glib C libraries.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Librsvg overview" loading="lazy" width="697" height="311" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/librsvg.e1b01ae7.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>From the prequel, we knew librsvg supported at least some of the XInclude standards. To understand how much, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/tree/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0">we dug into its implementation</a>. As it turns out, every external URL reference in an SVG passes through a single method for validation. This includes references such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;image href="file:///something.png" /&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;rect filter="url('file-with-filters.svg#my_filter')" /&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;xi:include href="/etc/passwd" ... /&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The librsvg <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/url_resolver.rs#L32">url_resolver.resolve_href</a> method implements some <a target="_new" href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/Rsvg-2.0/class.Handle.html#security-and-locations-of-referenced-files">strict security checks</a> to restrict what references can be loaded when processing an SVG document:</p>
<ul>
<li>All <code>data:</code> URLs are permitted because they can't reference external files by design.</li>
<li>The referenced scheme must match the "current document" scheme. For example, when processing <code>file:///foo/bar/example.svg</code>, any encountered URL must be of the <code>file:</code> scheme.</li>
<li>Encountered files must be in the same directory as the current document, or within a subdirectory of the current document. This is enforced by <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/url_resolver.rs#L68-85">checking the URL path</a>.</li>
<li>All other schemes are rejected, including <code>http:</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These strict rules are the reason our earlier naive XInclude tests failed. But we were very interested to see if we could bypass the rules. This could result in path traversal when processing an SVG, for example, being able to include files like <code>/etc/passwd</code> in the contents of the rendered SVG to PNG.</p>
<h2 id="parser-mismatch">Parser Mismatch</h2>
<p>Resolving a URL within an SVG document has two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validate the URL as per the resolve rules mentioned earlier.</li>
<li>If successful, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/io.rs#L87">load the contents</a>, which parses URLs using <a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gio/">Gio</a>'s inbuilt URI parser.</li>
</ol>

<p>Knowing there were two URL parsers at play (one to validate the URL and one to load the contents), to bypass the security checks, we needed to find URLs where the parsers disagreed.</p>
<p>With some quick tests, we mapped out how the URL parsers process different URLs.</p>

<p><a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gio/">Gio</a> doesn't expose generic URL parsing (aside from GUri, which isn't on the callpath). But <code>g_filename_from_uri</code> returns on some examples.</p>

<h2 id="bypassing-validation">Bypassing Validation</h2>
<p>Given this understanding of where the URL parsers were at, we took the relevant parts from librsvg and set up a fuzzing harness ("resolve") to run the same logic as the resolve URL logic when encountering a reference (href, XInclude, etc.) from an on-disk "current.svg" file. This allowed us to quickly test and fuzz inputs to see how the parsers and validation logic were evaluated. Some interesting outputs from fuzzing were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>resolve 'current.svg'</code>: Passes as expected.</li>
<li><code>resolve run '../../../../../../../etc/passwd'</code>: Canonicalization fails with 'No such file or directory'.</li>
<li><code>resolve 'current.svg?../../../../../../../etc/passwd'</code>: Passes.</li>
<li><code>resolve 'none/../current.svg'</code>: Passes as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last 2 results showed us that <code>GFile::for_uri</code> happily resolves path traversals, including path traversals in the query string. However, the second result, <code>../../../../../../../etc/passwd</code>, failed because of the canonicalization check.</p>
<h3 id="bypassing-canonicalization">Bypassing Canonicalization</h3>
<p>Part of librsvg's URL validation is to canonicalize the built URL to replace .. and . segments per regular filesystem path rules. It does this using Rust's <a target="_new" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.canonicalize.html">std::fs::canonicalize</a> (calling <a target="_new" href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/realpath">realpath</a>), which throws an error if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The path doesn't exist.</li>
<li>A non-final component in the path isn't a directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we don't always know the name of the 'current' SVG on disk, we needed to bypass canonicalization if we wanted to have a URL pass librsvg's validation. After some rapid testing, it turns out this is relatively straightforward.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ realpath current.svg</span></p><p><span>/home/zsims/projects/librsvg-poc/current.svg</span></p><p><span>$ realpath </span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span>/home/zsims/projects/librsvg-poc/</span></p></pre>
<p>As it turns out, <code>realpath(".")</code> and <code>std::fs::canonicalize(".")</code> both return the "current directory". We can use this as a placeholder in our PoC instead of <code>current.svg</code>.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h2>
<p>Knowing how the URL parsers mismatch, and how we can bypass canonicalization without knowing the current file name, we can build a payload to include <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p>

<h2 id="patch">Patch</h2>
<p>Following the report to librsvg's maintainer (see <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996">Issue 996</a>), Federico <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/merge_requests/861">patched the issue</a> to add improved URL validation and use the validated URL as input into GFile. Part of the response from Federico included a heads-up to maintainers of Sharp and libvips to upgrade before the issue was disclosed publicly as <a target="_new" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38633">CVE-2023-38633</a>.</p>
<p>The issue also prompted some discussion about <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3050">file URL parsing in glib</a>, resulting in some <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/3502">additional validation</a> in the library.</p>
<p>There were a few standouts from discovery and patching:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a target="_new" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/">dangers of mixing URL parsers</a> are just as applicable to <code>file://</code> URLs and in-process use as they are for networked services and <code>http://</code> URLs.</li>
<li><code>file://</code> URLs are special. For example, the URL specification highlights <a target="_new" href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#file-state">support for query strings in <code>file://</code></a> URLs,&nbsp;but the support in the implementations we reviewed varied greatly.</li>
<li>Efforts to migrate existing C code to Rust are not without risk. Although memory safety is much improved, differences in contracts (like URL parsing) can have negative security consequences.</li>
<li>Make sure you're only parsing URLs once, and using that parsed value from that point onwards.</li>
<li>If possible, enforce your own validation on files, like SVGs, before processing further. This is the reason <a target="_new" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> is not impacted by this issue because <code>xi:include</code> elements are rejected before the SVG reaches librsvg.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li>July 11 2023: Issue discovered.</li>

    <p>SIGGRAPH 2023 just had a paper ‚Äú<a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/"><strong>3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering</strong></a>‚Äù
by Kerbl, Kopanas, Leimk√ºhler, Drettakis, and it looks
pretty cool! Check out their website, source code repository, data sets and so on (I should note that
it is <em>really, really good</em> to see full source and full data sets being released. Way to go!).</p>
<p>I‚Äôve decided to try to implement the realtime visualization part (i.e. the one that takes
already-produced gaussian splat ‚Äúmodel‚Äù file) in Unity. As well as maybe play around with looking at
whether the data sizes could be made smaller (maybe use some of the learnings from
<a href="https://aras-p.info/blog/2023/01/29/Float-Compression-0-Intro/">float compression series</a> too?).</p>
<p><a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2023/gaussian-splat/gs-bike-initial.jpg"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2023/gaussian-splat/gs-bike-initial.jpg" title="" alt="" width="300px"></a>
<em>What‚Äôs a few million badly rendered boxes among friends, anyway?</em></p>
<p>For the impatient: I got <em>something</em> working over at <a href="https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting">aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting</a>, and will tinker with things there some more.</p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, some quick random thoughts on this Gaussian Splatting thing.</em></p>
<h4 id="what-are-these-gaussian-splats">What are these Gaussian Splats?</h4>
<p>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_kXY43VZnk"><strong>paper video</strong></a> and read
<a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/">the paper</a>, they are pretty good!</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_kXY43VZnk" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>I have seen quite many 3rd party explanations of the concept at this point, and some of them, uhh, get a thing or
two wrong about it :)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a NeRF (Neural Radiance Field)! There is absolutely nothing ‚Äúneural‚Äù about it.</li>
<li>It is <em><strong>not</strong></em> somehow ‚Äúfast, because it uses GPU rasterization hardware‚Äù. The official implementation does not
use the rasterization pipeline at all; it is 100% done with CUDA. In fact, it is fast <em>because</em> it does not use
the fixed function rasterization, as we‚Äôll see below.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Anyway,</em></p>
<p>Gaussian Splats are, basically, ‚Äú<strong>a bunch of blobs in space</strong>‚Äù. Instead of representing a 3D scene as
polygonal meshes, or voxels, or distance fields, it represents it as (millions of) particles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each particle (‚Äúa 3D Gaussian‚Äù) has position, rotation and a non-uniform scale in 3D space.</li>
<li>Each particle also has an opacity, as well as color (actually, not a single color, but rather
3rd order Spherical Harmonics coefficients - meaning ‚Äúthe color‚Äù can change depending on the view direction).</li>
<li>For rendering, the particles are rendered (‚Äúsplatted‚Äù) as <em>2D Gaussians</em> in screen space, i.e. they
are <em>not</em> rendered as scaled elongated spheres, actually! More on this below.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <em>that‚Äôs it</em>. The ‚ÄúGaussian Splatting‚Äù scene representation is <em>just that</em>, a whole bunch of scaled and colored
blobs in space. The genius part of the paper is several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They found a way <strong>how</strong> to create these millions of blobs that would represent a scene depicted by a bunch of
photos. This is using gradient descent and ‚Äúdifferentiable rendering‚Äù and all the other things that are way
over my head. This <em>feels</em> like the major contribution, like maybe previously people assumed that in order
for gradient descent optimizer to work nicely, you need to use a continuous or connected scene representation (vs
‚Äújust a bunch of blobs‚Äù), and this paper proved that wrong? <em>Anyway, I don‚Äôt understand this area, so I won‚Äôt talk
about it more :)</em></li>
<li>They have developed a fast way to render all these millions of scaled particles. This by itself is not particularly
ground breaking IMHO, various people have noticed that using something like a tile-based ‚Äúsoftware, but on GPU‚Äù
rasterizer is a good way to do this.</li>
<li>They have combined existing established approaches (like gaussian splatting, and spherical harmonics)
in a nice way.</li>
<li>And finally, they have resisted the temptation to do ‚Äúneural‚Äù anything ;)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="previous-building-blocks">Previous Building Blocks</h4>
<p>The <strong>Gaussian Splatting</strong> seems to be invented around year 2001-2002, see for example ‚Äú<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/publications/EWASplatting-TVCG02.pdf">EWA Splatting</a>‚Äù paper by Zwicker, Pfister, Van Baar, Gross.
There they have scaled and oriented ‚Äúblobs‚Äù in space, calculate how would they project onto screen, and then
do the actual ‚Äúblob shape‚Äù (a ‚ÄúGaussian‚Äù) in 2D, in screen-space. A bunch of signal processing, sampling, aliasing etc.
math presumably supports doing it that way.</p>
<p>Speaking of ellipsoids, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOXk3QJWN8">Ecstatica game</a> from 1994 had a fairly
unique ellipsoid-based renderer.</p>
<p><strong>Spherical Harmonics</strong> (a way to represent a function over a surface of a sphere) have been around for several hundred
years in physics, but really were popularized in computer graphics around 2000 by Ravi Ramamoorthi and
Peter-Pike Sloan. But actually, a 1992 ‚ÄúPredicting Reflectance Functions from Complex Surfaces‚Äù paper by Westin, Arvo,
Torrance might be the first use of them in graphics.</p>
<p><strong>Point-Based Rendering</strong> in various forms has been around for a long time, e.g. particle systems were used since
‚Äúforever‚Äù (but typically used for vfx / non-solid phenomena).
‚Äú<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/projectpages/Surfels-SIG00.html">Surfels</a>‚Äù paper is from 2000. Something closer
to my heart, a whole bunch of demoscene demos are using non-traditional rendering approaches. Fairlight &amp; CNCD
have several notable examples, e.g.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VhecrFsZjc">Agenda Circling Forth</a> (2010),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaPPHUt4K34">Ceasefire (all falls down..)</a> (2010),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyXwmt0EZig">Number One / Another One</a> (2018):</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-VhecrFsZjc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Real-time VFX tools like <a href="https://www.notch.one/">Notch</a> have pretty extensive features for creating, simulating
and displaying point/blob based ‚Äúthings‚Äù.</p>
<p>Ideas of representing images or scenes with a bunch of ‚Äúprimitive shapes‚Äù, as well as tools to generate those, have
been around too. E.g. <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive">fogleman/primitive</a> (2016) is nice.</p>
<p>Media Molecule ‚ÄúDreams‚Äù has a splat-based renderer (I think the shipped version is not purely splat-based
but a combination of several techniques). Check out the most excellent ‚ÄúLearning from Failure‚Äù talk by Alex Evans:
at <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2015/#_TESSELLATION_IN_CALL">SIGGRAPH 2015</a> (splats start at slide 109)
or video from <a href="https://youtu.be/u9KNtnCZDMI?t=1354">Umbra Ignite 2015</a> (splats start at 22:34).</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9KNtnCZDMI" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p><strong>Tiled Rasterization</strong> for particles has been around at least since 2014 (<a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/GPUParticles11">‚ÄúHoly smoke! Faster Particle Rendering
using Direct Compute‚Äù</a> by Gareth Thomas). And the idea
that dividing screen into tiles, doing a bunch of things ‚Äúinside the tile‚Äù thus cutting on memory traffic,
is how <em>entire</em> mobile GPU space operates, and has been operating since ‚Äúforever‚Äù, tracing back to first PowerVR
designs (1996) and even Pixel Planes 5 from 1989.</p>
<p>This is all <em>great</em>! Taking existing, developed, solid building blocks and combining them in a novel way is excellent
work.</p>
<h4 id="my-toy-playground">My Toy Playground</h4>
<p>My current implementation (of just the visualizer of Gaussian Splat models) for Unity is over at github:
<a href="https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting"><strong>aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting</strong></a>. Current state is ‚Äúit kinda
works, but it is not fast‚Äù:</p>

<p>So all of that could be improved and optimized quite a bit!</p>
<p>One thing I haven‚Äôt seen talked much about, by everyone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbXmGgJePsk">super excited</a>
about Gaussian Splats, is data size and memory usage. Yeah, rendering is nice, but this bicycle scene above is
1.5GB of data on-disk, and then at runtime it needs some more (for sorting, tile based rendering etc.).
That scene is six million blobs in space, with each of them taking about 250 bytes. There has to be some
way to make that smaller! Actually the Dreams talk above has some neat ideas.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I should play around with that. Someday!</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the annals of infrastructure investing,  Chicago is best known for getting fleeced in a notorious parking meter deal under ex-Mayor Richard M. Daley. We regret to report that short of declaring bankruptcy, the city is more stuck than ever with this ball-and-chain agreement for decades to come.</p><p>The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/OpinionsWeb/processWebInputExternal.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2023/D04-07/C:22-1166:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:3027710:S:0">affirmed</a> the deal with Chicago Parking Meters LLC, known as CPM, the private company that profits outrageously from Daley‚Äôs folly. The judges upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Chicago motorists who said the deal created a price-gouging monopoly that violates federal law aimed at preserving competitive markets.</p><p>The lawsuit claimed the deal left the city with no real control over on-street meters, and stymied efforts to expand public transit, create bike lanes or otherwise respond to changing times in any way that would interfere with the flow of meter money to CPM. Chicago, the suit alleged, had become a puppet of the investors, unable to act in the public interest without financial penalties that made action unaffordable and therefore impossible.</p><p>Alas, the appellate judges made mincemeat of that argument. While the deal ‚Äúmight have been foolish, short-sighted or worse,‚Äù the court said, perhaps employing some irony Chicago was within its rights to undertake the giveaway, and still retains enough regulatory authority to put a kibosh on the lawsuit‚Äôs monopoly claim.</p><p>So much for a creative legal effort to win back some leverage on behalf of the suckers otherwise known as Chicago‚Äôs citizens.</p><p>The deal came about in 2008, as Daley and the City Council ‚Äî whose lapdog aldermen were the real puppets in this case ‚Äî sought to close a budget shortfall. After due diligence so cursory as to not deserve the name, Chicago agreed to sell a 75-year lease on its parking meter system for just $1.16 billion. Within a few years, the city had spent that money, and sharply jacked up parking rates, as required in the deal. The investors, meantime, recouped their original outlay within a decade, and made millions in additional profits with much more still to come.</p><section aria-roledescription="carousel" aria-label="Tribune cartoonist‚Äôs decadeslong critique of Chicago‚Äôs parking meter deal" id="gallery_div_SBGRPPKBBBHRVAIZDWOV5RYN3M"><div id="gallery-images-SBGRPPKBBBHRVAIZDWOV5RYN3M" data-image-id="BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI" role="group" aria-roledescription="slide" aria-label="1 of 6" aria-hidden="false" aria-live="polite"><picture><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Z3g2j7RIg9rhQEVhCXqQIohPEso=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 996px)"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/vXKsPm3hnqeRexSSNLeyw52d4hE=/600x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/4FayPcSsndL9sNyroFHEbU_FAfE=/400x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)"><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Z3g2j7RIg9rhQEVhCXqQIohPEso=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" data-lightbox="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/_UhDmrInS4XRfhAoV6sKyKW6Dag=/1600x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" width="800" height="0" loading="eager"></picture></div><p><span>After the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the deal with Chicago Parking Meters LLC, the city is more stuck than ever with this ball-and-chain parking meter deal. </span>(Scott Stantis/For the Chicago Tribune)</p></section><p>The investors were fiendishly clever in guaranteeing their interests. Under the contract, the city must maintain at least 30,000 meters in any given year, according to the 7th Circuit ruling. With a few trivial exceptions, if the city cuts parking fees, reduces the number of spaces or the hours of operation, or even just fails to keep up with inflation, it is obliged to pay CPM for ‚Äúlost‚Äù revenue.</p><p>After those so-called true-up payments became a political scandal in 2013, ex-Mayor Rahm Emanuel amended and reapproved the contract, further binding the city to it. As it stands, Chicago has paid more than $150 million in true-ups to CPM, according to the court‚Äôs ruling, and there‚Äôs every reason to expect it will be paying more in the future.</p><p>This is where we thought the lawsuit made a very good point. While Chicago has the authority to set parking rates and revise the number and location of meters, those powers are toothless, as the lawsuit said, because the city can‚Äôt use them freely without paying a fortune to its CPM overlords.</p><p>The court didn‚Äôt see it that way. The city has shown it still regulates its parking by, for instance, adding meters in new zones that are treated differently from those covered under the deal. ‚ÄúThe fact that the city pays a price for certain actions cannot be enough to undermine the whole concession,‚Äù the court found. ‚ÄúRegulation is possible even if the city must conduct a cost-benefit analysis before it takes a given step.‚Äù</p><p>Benefits? What benefits?</p><p>Well, the original check didn‚Äôt bounce. CPM paid the $1.16 billion upfront, temporarily saving Daley and his henchmen from making budget cuts or raising taxes while enabling them, in typical Illinois fashion, to kick financial obligations down the road.</p><p>CPM also agreed to some changes in 2013 that made the deal <a href="https://www.metroplanning.org/work/project/29/subpage/3?utm_source=%2fparking&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=redirect&amp;RedirectReferrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f">slightly less terrible</a> for the city. Plus, it invested a substantial sum (though nowhere near its profits to date) in replacing old-fashioned coin meters with electronic ones, updating the system for mobile apps and handling payments.

<p><i>This is currently a small-scale beta project.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Wikimedia DNS</b> (formerly called <b>Wikidough</b>), is a caching, recursive, public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS" title="en:DNS over HTTPS">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS" title="en:DNS over TLS">DNS-over-TLS (DoT)</a> resolver service that is run and managed by the Site Reliability Engineering (Traffic) team at the Foundation. Wikimedia DNS helps prevent some surveillance and censorship of our wikis and other websites by securing DNS lookups.
</p><p>This document outlines what the service is about, why the SRE/Traffic team is working on it, and what benefits it provides for the Wikimedia community. We welcome any discussions about this project on the talk page.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" title="en:Domain Name System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS) is the phonebook of the internet. It provides a lookup of domain names (such as wikipedia.org) to their IP addresses (<code>208.80.154.224</code>). Whenever you visit a resource on the internet like a website, a DNS resolver ‚Äî typically run by your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Internet_service_provider" title="w:en:Internet service provider">Internet Service Provider</a> (ISP) ‚Äî resolves the domain to an IP address and is the first step in the creation of a connection to a website. Without the IP address you won't be able to find the right website. This process happens in the background and because of the way the internet works, most people automatically connect to their ISP's DNS resolver to perform these DNS queries.
</p><p>DNS is a critical part of the internet and DNS lookups happen regardless of which resource you want to access or where you access it from (mobile or phone).

<p>Even though DNS has been around for decades, a DNS query (<i>what is the IP address of wikipedia.org?</i>) and the response (<i>the IP address is 208.80.154.224</i>) are not encrypted. This is a significant privacy and security risk. An on-path observer ‚Äî such as your coffee shop, ISP, or your government ‚Äî can observe your DNS queries/responses and build a list of the resources you access on the internet, and perhaps worse, censor you by preventing access to content they deem unacceptable.
</p><p>Since we are primarily concerned with censorship in the context of the movement, Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects have been censored through DNS and this has been observed in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://explorer.ooni.org/">various countries</a> where we are active. DNS censorship is easy to implement, scales effectively, and also since DNS is the first step in the connection to a remote resource, most ISPs and governments use DNS censorship to prevent people from accessing content on the internet. 
</p><p>As an example, censoring queries for <i>*.wikipedia.org</i> to prevent people from accessing any language edition of Wikipedia is trivial to implement in most DNS resolver software and is a one-line change.

<p>To solve the problem of surveillance and censorship of DNS, various DNS encryption protocols have been proposed over the years. Due to various reasons including a lack of a standard, adaptability, implementation, none of the proposed protocols have seen mass adoption until DNS-over-HTTPS was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484">proposed and standardized</a> in 2018. The Mozilla Firefox browser helped push adoption of DoH by enabling it by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/">default for US users in 2020</a> and has since rolled this out to other countries as well.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS" title="en:DNS over HTTPS">DNS-over-HTTPS</a>, also called DoH, encrypts DNS by sending queries and getting responses over HTTPS, thus preventing censorship and surveillance: because an on-path observer can no longer see the queries or the responses, they cannot censor it or build a profile of the data. DoH works by sending DNS queries over a secure HTTPS channel.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS" title="en:DNS over TLS">DNS-over-TLS</a>, also called DoT, is a related DNS encryption protocol offering encryption over just TLS. It hasn't seen the same rate of adoption DNS-over-HTTPS has seen for various reasons that we will discuss later. Nevertheless, we consider both of these protocols related for the purpose of this discussion and the Wikimedia DNS service, even though there are differences between them at the protocol level.
</p><p>To use this new DNS encryption technology, you need a DoH- or DoT-enabled client and a resolver.

<p>Wikimedia DNS is a public DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS resolver service. For users who wish to secure their DNS lookups to prevent surveillance or to circumvent DNS-based censorship, Wikimedia DNS helps protect your DNS queries/responses by providing encryption of the same. For a user securing their DNS lookups via Wikimedia DNS, all that an on-path observer or a censor can see is a connection to the Wikimedia DNS service but not the content of the DNS queries or responses.

<p>The SRE/Traffic team in the Wikimedia Foundation is tasked with running the Wikimedia proxy servers and data centers. We are also interested in understanding where and how our websites are censored on a technical level. HTTPS makes it impossible for censors to block access to specific articles, thus forcing them to choose between blocking nothing or the entire website. We are not concerned with censorship of the content of the articles ‚Äî even though that's related ‚Äî but rather the website/ecosystem as a whole.
</p><p>In studying and researching censorship of Foundation websites, we discovered that the most common form of this censorship was through filtering the DNS. The idea of running a secure, encrypted DNS service thus stemmed from those observations. The annual plan for FY 2022‚Äì23, under its <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Annual_Plan/2023-2024/Goals/Safety_%26_Inclusion#Disinformation" title="metawiki:Wikimedia Foundation Annual Plan/2023-2024/Goals/Safety &amp; Inclusion">goal for Safety and Inclusion</a>, talks about "Implement technical improvements to strengthen security and privacy of volunteers on-wiki, protect against surveillance, and enhance the communities' ability to effectively govern themselves and address disinformation and human rights risks."

<p>We cannot recommend external resolver services such as those run by Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, among others, for a variety of reasons. We have no control over how these services are run or what private data is logged. Even though most of these services have explicit privacy policies, they do log some data and we have no control or insight into that. 
</p><p>Furthermore, some of these services use content filtering. Cloudflare's DNS service for families has been <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-mistake-that-caused-1-1-1-3-to-block-lgbtqia-sites-today/">caught blocking LGBTQ content</a>. Other services indulge in various forms of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.quad9.net/service/threat-blocking/">content filtering</a> as well.
</p><p>The SRE team is well poised to run such a service and can provide a reliable alternative to secure DNS resolver services run by for-profit corporations.

<p>No. While DNS protocols such as DoH and DoT encrypt DNS queries between your client (like Firefox) and a resolver (Wikimedia DNS), an on-path observer (such as your ISP/government) can still identify which websites you are connecting to through the SNI field in the ClientHello message (currently unencrypted) or the IP address of the website. Nevertheless, given that DNS-based censorship and surveillance is often the easiest to implement, securing your DNS is a good first step towards improving your privacy and resisting censorship.
</p><p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/">Encrypted Client Hello extension</a> (ECH; formerly called Encrypted SNI) to TLSv1.3 encrypts the SNI field and because of how it works, ECH requires encrypted DNS to be effective. Coupled together and once properly deployed, these two technologies will help address long-standing issues with privacy of users on the internet. While this doesn't solve all our issues, we also need encrypted DNS for future work against surveillance and censorship to be effective.

<p>Yes, a censor can just block Wikimedia DNS. But we believe that coupling encrypted DNS with Encrypted Client Hello (that depends on encrypted DNS) is going to make the blocking of websites more difficult, thus helping minimize the possibility of blocking Wikimedia DNS because censors will no longer be able to see the SNI for it. Additionally, most censors don't typically block DNS resolvers, as observed by the prevalence and usage of <code>1.1.1.1</code> and <code>8.8.8.8</code>.
</p><p>Wikimedia DNS is not a complete solution to all censorship issues. It is just one part of our strategy in fighting against censorship and while it might not help protect all users everywhere, it will help secure DNS lookups for the vast majority of them and help lay the foundation for upcoming protocols.

<p>Let's assume you want to connect to <i>en.wikipedia.org</i>. The first step is the DNS resolution, so a DNS resolver will give you back the IP address of en.wiki for you to create a connection to it. The next stage in that process is that when you want to connect to the IP address, you have to specify the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication" title="en:Server Name Indication">server name indication</a></i> or the SNI as well, which in this case is <i>en.wikipedia.org</i>. This SNI field, like DNS, has been unencrypted so far and a censor that has the capabilities to inspect your traffic can see that you are connecting to en.wiki and prevent you from making that connection. 
</p><p>SNI-based censorship is the most common form of restricting access to websites (not just ours) after DNS, the difference being that it requires more resources in the form of specialized blocking equipment that does deep-packet inspection on the traffic so not every censor is motivated to pursue it or has the equipment to be able to do so.
</p><p>Encrypted Client Hello (formerly called Encrypted Server Name Indication or ESNI), encrypts this SNI field, preventing a censor from blocking traffic based on the SNI field. ECH depends on encrypted DNS to be effective as the key distribution for ECH happens over DNS HTTPS resource records. In the absence of encrypted DNS, a censor could simply filter or poison the DNS result, making ECH ineffective. The Firefox browser for example will <a rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/c/uv7PNrHUagA/m/BNA4G8fOAAAJ">not enable ECH if encrypted DNS is also not enabled</a>.
</p><p>Thus the work on Wikimedia DNS not only secures DNS but also lays the foundation for future implementations of internet security protocols such as ECH.

<p>No. Using Wikimedia DNS does not relay the contents of the communication and does not change the IP address of a user. It only secures the metadata, which in this case is the DNS lookup.

<p>Running a VPN service requires a lot more resources and carries with a lot more liability, as we would be relaying the contents of the transmission as well, not just the metadata.
</p><p>There are also usability and accessibility issues with VPNs. Those who know what VPNs are and can configure them will use them whereas most other users won't be able to do that. Thus if we are offering a censorship circumvention tool, it should work for everyone and while we are not there with DoH or DoT yet, those protocols are more standardized and easier to use than setting up and running a VPN client.

<p>Yes, Wikimedia DNS, just like another DNS service (and even the one run by your ISP), can allow bad actors to perform DNS resolution and to secure their DNS lookups. Note that Wikimedia DNS just provides the metadata for the communication (the <i>phone number</i>) but it is not involved in the actual communication itself (the <i>phone call</i>). Thus the utility Wikimedia DNS provides to bad actors is quite limited when they have better tools available to secure the contents of the communication itself, such as the many free and commercial VPN services or other proxies.
</p><p>Wikimedia DNS is an alternative to already available commercial DNS providers and is not the only such service. Most people will still use Google and Cloudflare to secure their DNS lookups because these services will be much faster than ours because of the scale at which they operate.

<p>Wikimedia DNS supports DoH on TCP/443 and DoT on TCP/853. Users can select either protocol to secure their DNS as both DoH and DoT share the same privacy and security guarantees within Wikimedia DNS, but users are reminded to be mindful of the differences between the protocols themselves. 
</p>
<ul><li>DoH running on port 443 makes it harder for it to be blocked as censors would have to block potentially all HTTPS traffic. DoT runs on a dedicated port, 853, thus making it easier to block.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Typically, DoH support is in the browser (thus securing DNS lookups only from within that browser), while DoT lookups happen at the OS level, for all applications. DoT might be more preferable in that sense unless censorship is an issue.</li></ul>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A tool for running large language models on-premises using non-public
data</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OnPrem.LLM</strong> is a simple Python package that makes it easier to run
large language models (LLMs) on non-public or sensitive data and on
machines with no internet connectivity (e.g., behind corporate
firewalls). Inspired by the
<a href="https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT">privateGPT</a> GitHub repo and
Simon Willison‚Äôs <a href="https://pypi.org/project/llm/" rel="nofollow">LLM</a> command-line
utility, <strong>OnPrem.LLM</strong> is designed to help integrate local LLMs into
practical applications.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Install</h2>
<p dir="auto">Once <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" rel="nofollow">installing PyTorch</a>, you
can install <strong>OnPrem.LLM</strong> with:</p>

<p dir="auto">By default, a 7B-parameter model is used. If <code>use_larger=True</code>, a
13B-parameter is used. You can also supply the URL to an LLM of your
choosing to <a href="https://amaiya.github.io/onprem/core.html#llm" rel="nofollow"><code>LLM</code></a> (see
code generation section below for an example). Currently, only models in
GGML format are supported. Future versions of <strong>OnPrem.LLM</strong> will
transition to the newer GGUF format.</p>

In February 2020, the world began to panic about the novel coronavirus, which killed 2714 people that month. This made the news. In the same month, around 800,000 people died from the effects of air pollution. That didn‚Äôt. Novelty counts for a lot. At the start of the pandemic, it was considered unseemly to make comparisons like these. But comparing the value of human lives is one thing the machine of modern civilisation does relentlessly, almost invariably to prioritise and absolve the rich ‚Äì when, for example, the global supply of Covid vaccines is apportioned primarily to the highest-income countries, or when the cost of natural disasters in Bangladesh is measured against the impact of sea-level rise on Miami Beach real estate, or when Joe Biden‚Äôs onetime economic adviser Lawrence Summers proposed that Africa, as a whole, was ‚Äòvastly underpolluted‚Äô, and suggested that ‚Äòthe economic logic behind dumping a whole load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable.‚Äô</p><p>In its first year, the pandemic did damage according to the opposite logic, with the world‚Äôs wealthiest countries the worst hit. When people in those countries tried to diminish the threat of the virus by comparing it to the flu, the disease made a joke of them. But air pollution kills more than ten times as many as the flu every single year, and we hear even less about it. In 2017, a <em>Lancet</em> study put the figure at almost seven million a year, about two-thirds from outside air pollution and one-third from indoor, household pollution. More recent estimates run higher, with as many as 8.7 million deaths every year attributable just to the outdoor particulate matter produced from burning fossil fuels. Add on indoor pollution, and you get an annual toll of more than ten million. That‚Äôs more than four times the official worldwide death toll from Covid last year. It‚Äôs about twenty times as many as the current annual deaths from war, murder and terrorism combined. Put another way, air pollution kills twenty thousand on an average day, more than have died in the aftermath of all the meltdowns in the history of nuclear power: Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima and all the others put together. If the pandemic so terrified us that billions of us retreated into panicked cocoons for months, what can explain or justify our blindness and indifference towards the ten million lives ended each year by the repeated inhalation of smog?</p><p>Ten million deaths a year is a hundred million a decade. The numbers are so large that even the superlatives of disaster fail. They‚Äôre so large that they strain credulity, perhaps partly because none of us can picture someone dying in the street from air pollution and partly because it seems pathetically old-fashioned for a doctor to advise a sojourn in healthier air. But the chances are that you can‚Äôt picture a death from obesity or cigarette smoking either, and yet you probably don‚Äôt doubt estimates of their toll on human wellbeing, or think it wrong to call Louisiana‚Äôs River Parishes ‚ÄòCancer Alley‚Äô ‚Äì the presence of 150 petrochemical plants has made it an incontrovertibly unhealthy place to live, with some communities registering cancer rates fifty times the national average. Such areas are sometimes known as ‚Äòsacrifice zones‚Äô.</p><p>A single speck of black carbon, inhaled, won‚Äôt stop the heart or poison the lungs, but over time, across populations, the effect is devastating. When we talk about death we always want to see a murderer. When there isn‚Äôt one, it‚Äôs a lot harder to call it a murder, rather than a tragedy or an act of God. (‚ÄòYou see one person run over in the street and you‚Äôll never forget it,‚Äô an environmentalist observes in <em>Choked: The Age of Air Pollution and the Fight for a Cleaner Future</em>.<span><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n23/footnotes/ten-million-a-year-footnote-2">*</a></span> Thousands dying from the effects of dirty air ‚Äòwill never even faze you‚Äô.) But the central premise of any mortality model is that everyone dies: the question is when, and whether a certain behaviour or environmental factor hastened that end. And while none of these estimates is meant to suggest a single cause of mortality, such as a gunshot wound or a dose of poison in your morning tea, the calculus for air pollution is the same as for obesity or smoking: take the problem away, and the number of premature deaths will fall by many millions. According to new research, half of these deaths, concentrated in the developing world, are the result of consumption and fossil-fuel burning in the world‚Äôs richest countries.</p><p>The environmental historian Stephen Pyne calls our era the ‚Äòpyrocene‚Äô, a global regime of burning: coal and oil, agricultural land and forest, bush and wetland, most of it planned. The Anthropocene, Pyne says, implies dominion over nature. He prefers to emphasise the fact that, wherever you look, the earth is in flames. The residue is carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, black carbon, sulphur dioxide, and the particularly toxic grouping of small particulate matter known as PM2.5. Everything we burn, we breathe.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of people live and breathe in cities permanently clouded by airborne toxic events. In November, the authorities in Delhi closed schools and colleges indefinitely, suspended construction work, and shuttered half of the local coal plants after an episode of ‚Äòtoxic smog‚Äô and an order from the Indian Supreme Court to institute emergency measures to combat it. The smog wasn‚Äôt new; the response was. Throughout the city, particulate matter hangs around in offices, lobbies and private homes, even those with air purifiers. It often gets so thick that it interferes with air travel. More remarkably, it has interrupted train travel, the smog making it impossible for drivers to see the tracks. Taxi drivers have filtration systems to process the particulates that sneak in. Pedestrians can‚Äôt escape it, which is one reason that, on especially smoggy days, living in Delhi is the equivalent of smoking several packets of cigarettes. The city has the highest rates of respiratory illness in the world, and 60 per cent of inhabitants diagnosed with COPD ‚Äì chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ‚Äì aren‚Äôt even smokers.</p><p>Across India as a whole, where more than a million people die from air pollution each year, exposure to small particulate matter has been estimated at five times the World Health Organisation‚Äôs longtime ‚Äòsafe‚Äô level ‚Äì defined as ten micrograms per cubic metre of air. This year the WHO set a new standard, at half the old level. Under the old threshold, 90 per cent of the world‚Äôs population were breathing dangerously polluted air; under the new threshold the figure is closer to 99 per cent. Of the world‚Äôs fourteen most polluted metropolises, only one (Hotan in China) is outside India. Of the 336 cities that come next on the list, 184 are in China. But this isn‚Äôt to say that air pollution is a problem in just two countries. Globally, it causes one death in five.</p><p>Here is just a partial list of the things, short of death rates, we know are affected by air pollution. GDP, with a 10 per cent increase in pollution reducing output by almost a full percentage point, according to an OECD report last year. Cognitive performance, with a study showing that cutting Chinese pollution to the standards required in the US would improve the average student‚Äôs ranking in verbal tests by 26 per cent and in maths by 13 per cent. In Los Angeles, after $700 air purifiers were installed in schools, student performance improved almost as much as it would if class sizes were reduced by a third. Heart disease is more common in polluted air, as are many types of cancer, and acute and chronic respiratory diseases like asthma, and strokes. The incidence of Alzheimer‚Äôs can triple: in <em>Choked</em>, Beth Gardiner cites a study which found early markers of Alzheimer‚Äôs in 40 per cent of autopsies conducted on those in high-pollution areas and in none of those outside them. Rates of other sorts of dementia increase too, as does Parkinson‚Äôs. Air pollution has also been linked to mental illness of all kinds ‚Äì with a recent paper in the <em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em> showing that even small increases in local pollution raise the need for treatment by a third and for hospitalisation by a fifth ‚Äì and to worse memory, attention and vocabulary, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorders. Pollution has been shown to damage the development of neurons in the brain, and proximity to a coal plant can deform a baby‚Äôs DNA in the womb. It even accelerates the degeneration of the eyesight.</p><p>A high pollution level in the year a baby is born has been shown to result in reduced earnings and labour force participation at the age of thirty. The relationship of pollution to premature births and low birth weight is so strong that the introduction of the automatic toll system E-ZPass in American cities reduced both problems in areas close to toll plazas (by 10.8 per cent and 11.8 per cent respectively), by cutting down on the exhaust expelled when cars have to queue. Extremely premature births, another study found, were 80 per cent more likely when mothers lived in areas of heavy traffic. Women breathing exhaust fumes during pregnancy gave birth to children with higher rates of paediatric leukaemia, kidney cancer, eye tumours and malignancies in the ovaries and testes. Infant death rates increased in line with pollution levels, as did heart malformations. And those breathing dirtier air in childhood exhibited significantly higher rates of self-harm in adulthood, with an increase of just five micrograms of small particulates a day associated, in 1.4 million people in Denmark, with a 42 per cent rise in violence towards oneself. Depression in teenagers quadruples; suicide becomes more common too.</p><p>Stock market returns are lower on days with higher air pollution, a study found this year. Surgical outcomes are worse. Crime goes up with increased particulate concentrations, especially violent crime: a 10 per cent reduction in pollution, researchers at Colorado State University found, could reduce the cost of crime in the US by $1.4 billion a year. When there‚Äôs more smog in the air, chess players make more mistakes, and bigger ones. Politicians speak more simplistically, and baseball umpires make more bad calls.</p><p>In 2019, a comprehensive global review by the Forum of International Respiratory Societies found that air pollution damages every organ, indeed virtually every cell, in the body. Nanoparticles of pollution have been found inside the brainstems of even the very young. But you don‚Äôt have to wait until birth to see the effects of breathing particulate matter. The impact begins in the womb, damaging the development of lungs and shortening future lives. In 2019, a small-scale study at Hasselt University found particles of black carbon in every single placenta examined, including those from mothers who lived in areas where the air was thought to be clean, with thousands of particles found in every cubic millimetre. For those who worry about microplastics in the flesh of fish, this is a yet more invasive category of intrusion. Of course, there are also microplastics in the air. They‚Äôve been found in placentas too.</p><p><span>T</span><span>hat</span>‚Äã everything is worse in the presence of pollution means that everything should be better in its absence. And, as best we can tell, it is. According to the National Resources Defence Council, the US Clean Air Act of 1970 is still saving 370,000 American lives every year ‚Äì more than would have been saved last year had the pandemic never arrived. According to the NRDC, a single piece of legislation delivers annual economic benefits of more than $3 trillion, 32 times the cost of enacting it ‚Äì benefits distributed disproportionately to the poor and marginalised. The American experience provides the basis for self-justifying indifference to pollution: according to what‚Äôs often called the ‚Äòenvironmental Kuznets curve‚Äô, development makes countries dirtier before they get cleaner. This is wishful thinking, implying that pollution is an inevitable consequence of development, which can‚Äôt conceivably be achieved cleanly; and that it is in a way consensual, as if taking a job expresses a willingness to choke all the way to work. It also suggests that the effect is temporary, since societies at a certain level of wealth will refuse to put up with heavy pollution. But if more than 90 per cent of the planet‚Äôs population have lived for years in places with dangerously polluted air, 90 per cent also live where renewable energy is cheaper than dirty. This one fact renders the ‚Äòeconomic bargain‚Äô of air pollution, if it could ever be said to be credible, no better than an alibi.</p><p>In London, the gains over a single lifetime have been striking. ‚ÄòOn Friday, 5 December 1952 my dad left work in South London, stepped out into the darkness and realised this was not going to be an ordinary journey home,‚Äô Gary Fuller writes in <em>The Invisible Killer: The Rising Global Threat of Air Pollution ‚Äì and How We Can Fight Back</em> (2018). ‚ÄòThe fog was exceptionally thick. It was as if the world around him had vanished.‚Äô He had to feel his way along the kerb all the way home.‚Äô Throughout the city, visibility was reduced to just a yard, Tim Smedley writes in <em>Clearing the Air: The Beginning and the End of Air Pollution</em>.<span><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n23/footnotes/ten-million-a-year-footnote-3">‚Ä†</a></span> ‚ÄòPeople couldn‚Äôt even see their own feet. Blinded commuters stepped off bridges into the icy Thames and from railway platforms into the path of oncoming trains.‚Äô The smoke stuck to windscreens ‚Äòlike paint, forcing drivers to abandon their vehicles‚Äô. In 1952, the fog was estimated to have killed four thousand people in London, though later estimates tripled the figure; the rate of death was higher than in the cholera epidemic of 1866. The hospitals were overwhelmed. Four years later the Clean Air Act was introduced, and in relatively short order the pea-soupers that had given the city a permanent-seeming identity ‚Äì reflected in the works of Dickens, Monet and Conan Doyle ‚Äì came to an end.</p><p>In China, particulate pollution has been cut by a third since 2013, when the state declared ‚Äòwar‚Äô on it. In the 1990s, when Mexico City was more polluted than Delhi, 80 per cent of 10 and 11-year-olds asked the colour of the sky responded ‚Äògrey‚Äô, Smedley writes; only 10 per cent said ‚Äòblue‚Äô. Today the city only just ranks in the list of the world‚Äôs thousand most polluted cities, with air as clean as the Northern French town of Roubaix, terminus of the famous cycle race.</p><p>That those gains are so large doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt much bigger ones to reap. In China, more than a million people still die each year from air pollution. In Africa, another million. In London, Gardiner estimates, 9500, about 20 per cent of the city‚Äôs total deaths, despite the apparent success of the Ultra Low Emission Zone. The Twitter account @CleanAirLondon has begun to tally deaths attributable to pollution by area in real time. About two-thirds of the population of the UK, Smedley calculates, are living with pollution above the legal limit set by the EU, and millions of British children are going to school in dangerously dirty air.</p><p>The World Bank estimates that as much as 6 per cent of global GDP is lost to pollution and puts the annual loss at $8.1 trillion. Last year, Drew Shindell of Duke University, an expert on pollution impact, appeared before the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform. By further cleaning up America‚Äôs air over the next fifty years, Shindell‚Äôs research shows, the country could prevent 4.5 million premature deaths, 1.4 million hospitalisations, 1.7 million cases of dementia and 300 million lost work days. The result, he calculated, would be $700 billion a year in net benefits, ‚Äòfar more than the cost of the energy transition‚Äô. In other words, a total decarbonisation of the US economy would pay for itself through public health gains alone. The American Environmental Protection Agency has an official measure for the value of a single human life: $7 million in 2006 dollars. If you take that number seriously, the annual value of saving the 350,000 lives a year lost to pollution would be $2.45 trillion.</p><p>Globally, air pollution cuts life expectancy by almost two years. The average inhabitant of Delhi would live 9.7 years longer were it not for air pollution. The figure is 8.5 years across the Indo-Gangetic plains, where 500 million people live. Cutting air pollution to the WHO standard would add 5.9 years of life expectancy to 1.38 billion Indians, 5.4 years to 164.7 million Bangladeshis and 3.9 years to 220 million Pakistanis. Annually, 349,000 stillbirths and miscarriages in South Asia can be attributed to air pollution, and 116,000 infants die from its effects in their first month.</p><p>These numbers demand that we reorder our picture of the world we live in, recalculating the brutality of the present. It becomes plain that clean air and clean water and human health should be restored to the centre of the environmental crusade ‚Äì rather than at the margins, where they‚Äôve been relegated as the movement has coalesced around the necessary project of addressing climate change through decarbonisation. (As a side benefit, clean air and clean water tend to be much more popular with voters than climate-focused environmental policies.) The long timescale of global warming has often made it hard to mobilise a majority against damage that may occur decades, or even generations, in the future. That timescale no longer looks quite so distended, after the last few years of serial disaster ‚Äì fire, storm and flood ‚Äì but air pollution provides an even more urgent motive for change: millions are dying, right now, because of it, and because particulate pollution dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, abating that pollution would save lives swiftly. Carbon hangs in the air for centuries if we don‚Äôt remove it; local pollution abates almost as soon as the match is extinguished.</p><p>There‚Äôs a further incentive for individual governments to prioritise the addressing of pollution. The benefits of decarbonisation ‚Äì chiefly that it limits temperature rise ‚Äì are distributed globally, which in practice means that local actors wait and see how quickly others are moving before moving themselves. Air pollution changes the calculus: for one thing, it‚Äôs actually under the control of local and national governments. It‚Äôs also a significant burden on public health, which if alleviated offers immediate benefits every government should want to seize.</p><p>A final implication of numbers as large as ten million deaths a year is that, certainly in terms of human mortality and probably in terms of human suffering, over the next few decades the toll of air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels will be greater than all the other impacts of climate change combined, at least as we currently quantify them. Global warming will of course deliver punishing and transformative impacts well below the threshold of mortality: flooding, drought, crop failure; poverty and forced migration and possibly state collapse; hurricanes and wildfire of unprecedented intensity. But as brutal as these may be, they don‚Äôt add up to anywhere near ten million deaths a year ‚Äì or even one million ‚Äì unless you add to most models the effects of improbable feedback loops (large-scale release of methane from melting permafrost in the northern latitudes, for instance) or widespread civilisational collapse.</p><p>Warming may well destabilise societies: it‚Äôs certainly not out of the question. But the damage done by air pollution isn‚Äôt hypothetical, and it‚Äôs happening at a much bigger scale. According to the WHO, extreme heat killed at least 166,000 people around the world between 1998 and 2017 ‚Äì 8700 a year. Air pollution killed about a thousand times more. Other estimates are higher, but even the highest ‚Äì the <em>Lancet</em>‚Äôs half a million heat-related deaths per year ‚Äì is just a twentieth of the toll of air pollution. Earlier this year, Madagascar was said to be on the brink of the world‚Äôs first ‚Äòclimate famine‚Äô, with 30,000 on the verge of starvation. In the same country, Unicef estimates, more than 40,000 already die each year from the effects of air pollution. The Climate Impact Lab recently published a comprehensive accounting of the ‚Äòglobal mortality consequences for climate change‚Äô. The lab, a consortium of environmental scientists and economists from a wide range of US institutions, is known for being at the alarm-raising vanguard of the serious research on the effects of warming. Their highest estimate for the end of this century ‚Äì assuming an implausibly high emissions scenario called RCP8.5 ‚Äì was for an annual death toll from climate change of 73 deaths per 100,000 people. Today, air pollution is killing up to 126 per 100,000. In a more plausible scenario, the report projects fewer than 20 deaths per 100,000.</p><p><span>P</span><span>erhaps,</span>‚Äã like me, you have spent the last five years in a state of panic about climate change. Perhaps it has inflamed your politics, and your sense of self. It should. The world is already warmer than it has ever been in the history of human civilisation. We have already exceeded the narrow temperature window which gave rise to everything we know as agriculture and society and politics and culture. The last time there was as much carbon in the atmosphere as there is today, temperatures weren‚Äôt 1.2¬∞C warmer than the pre-industrial base level, as they are now, but about 3¬∞C, with forests growing in the Antarctic and sea levels twenty metres higher.</p><p>The climate is changing ten times faster than ever before in a planetary history that includes mass extinctions which wiped out more than 90 per cent of life on Earth. Half of that damage has been done in the last 25 years, since the publication of Al Gore‚Äôs first book on global warming and the formation of the UN‚Äôs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ‚Äì in other words, with the full knowledge of the scientific community and the effective consent of global political leaders. A quarter of the change has taken place since Barack Obama was elected president, having hubristically proclaimed that ‚Äòthis was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.‚Äô Just a few years later, he bragged to an audience in Texas that ‚Äòsuddenly, America is the biggest oil producer. That was me, people.‚Äô</p><p>In 2018 an IPCC report declared that giving the planet a good chance of staying below 2¬∞C of warming and avoiding the catastrophic effects that would bring ‚Äì island nations have called it genocide; African climate ambassadors ‚Äòcertain death‚Äô for the continent ‚Äì would require a 45 per cent reduction in emissions this decade. The report suggested that such a rapid timeline would require a global World War Two-scale mobilisation beginning the following year, 2019. Instead, emissions went up, and will be up again, it appears, in 2021, after a brief dip during the pandemic.</p><p>An IPCC report released in August also noted that air pollution has limited the level of warming, to the extent that if it were removed global temperatures would be half a degree higher than they are now. The reason: aerosols reflect sunlight back into space and therefore hold temperature rise below the level our carbon concentrations alone would dictate. Some estimates of the cooling effect run even higher: the climate scientist James Hansen believes the rate of global warming could double as aerosols decline. Cutting air pollution probably won‚Äôt produce a sudden temperature spike, because the transition would be gradual, but we would probably already be close to the 2¬∞C threshold if we weren‚Äôt also producing enough particulate matter to kill ten million people a year.</p><p>If we fail to keep the rise below 2¬∞C, we may see what used to be once in a century floods happening every single year; major cities in South Asia and the Middle East experiencing ‚Äòlethal‚Äô heat for two hundred or more days a year; the total loss of the planet‚Äôs coral reefs, which provide food, income and coastal protection to a half a billion people; and possibly irreversible acceleration of sea-level rise as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice sheets. And the climate may be more sensitive to our carbon perturbations than median estimates predict: a doubling of carbon concentrations from the pre-industrial average produces anything from two degrees of warming to six, depending on the model. At three degrees, a quarter of potential global GDP could be wiped out; in many equatorial regions there would be no hope of economic growth at all. At four degrees, crop yields could drop dramatically, and parts of the world might be hit by up to six climate-driven natural disasters at once.</p><p>All these impacts, even if unleashed, probably won‚Äôt surpass present-day air pollution in terms of human mortality for a very long time. Reducing fossil fuel pollution won‚Äôt solve the problem. Last year, wildfires accounted for more than half of the air pollution in the western United States ‚Äì meaning that more particulate matter from burning forests infiltrated the lungs of Americans living in those states than from all other human and industrial activity combined. By the middle of the century, the extent of those fires is expected to double, at the very least, with each tree burned releasing carbon just as coal does, along with particulate matter. The worst air quality in the world is now routinely registered in California, and although these record-setting events typically last only a few days, it is already the case that the smoke from last year‚Äôs fires can be held responsible for five thousand additional pre-term births in the state. Globally, the world‚Äôs wildfire smoke delivers only a fraction of air pollution, but the fraction is growing. The 2021 fires are still smouldering, and wildfire emissions from this year have reached 4.7 billion tons of carbon, not far off the 5.1 billion produced last year by the US, which is the world‚Äôs second biggest emitter.</p><p>Fire is eternal in the American west, of course, but when climate sceptics point to evidence of ancient megafires, they neglect to mention that at the time there weren‚Äôt forty million people living in California. In the entire 20th century, there were only five fires that burned more than 100,000 acres. In 2020, there were eleven such fires ‚Äì one blaze, the August Complex fire in Mendocino, which burned more than a million acres, seemed to demand a new term, ‚Äògigafire‚Äô, to describe it. Each of these fires has produced an unprecedented amount of smoke, so much of it that the fires create their own weather systems ‚Äì pyrocumulus clouds, fire tornadoes and lightning storms, the lightning sometimes travelling miles from the central point of ignition, and sparking more fire where it lands, producing yet more smoke.</p><p>In some ways fear of smoke is more logical than fear of fire. In many parts of California, you can be confident your house won‚Äôt burn down. The chances are that you can evade the flames of even rampant wildfire. But smoke can‚Äôt be quarantined. This summer in the resort community of Lake Tahoe ‚Äì where the Air Quality Index, which describes 51 on its scale as ‚Äòhazardous‚Äô, hit 700 ‚Äì those trapped inside during oppressive weeks of smoke finally fled their vacation homes. Poisoned air reached as far as the East Coast of the US, where more deaths are caused every year by western wildfires than in the west itself, and across the Atlantic to Europe, where around the Mediterranean unprecedented fires were already burning, forcing evacuations from resort hotels.</p><p>The story is global, the world wrapped in smoke. In British Columbia, more carbon is now unleashed each year from forest fires than from all other sources. In Australia, where bushfires are an enduring feature of both landscape and legend, 46 million acres burned in the 2019-20 season ‚Äì ten times the record-setting California season that would follow, and enough to kill, it was estimated, more than a billion animals. The smoke in Sydney Harbour was so thick ferries couldn‚Äôt navigate it, and the particulates so dense that fire alarms were triggered in office buildings, the sensors concluding that there had to be flames nearby. In Siberia, where ‚Äòzombie fires‚Äô now burn regularly through the Arctic winter, carbon released from forests in flames regularly sends heavy smoke across the North Pole to the other side of the planet.</p><p>And then there‚Äôs South America, where 30 per cent of the Pantanal, the world‚Äôs largest tropical wetland, was lost to fire in a single year ‚Äì 2020. In the Amazon, so much land is burned to clear trees for farming that the fires release three times as much carbon as all other forms of emission in Brazil ‚Äì enough to make the rainforest itself, if it were a country, the world‚Äôs fifth largest emitter, and to turn the celebrated ‚Äòcarbon sink‚Äô, which might aid in our fight against warming, into a net source of global carbon. In theory, the burning could be halted, and it may at least be slowed if Lula succeeds Bolsonaro and returns to Brazil‚Äôs presidency next year. But the longer-term decline of the rainforest may lie outside the reach of national policy, as current global emissions trajectories suggest an irreversible tipping point for the region by the 2040s: less forest and more grass, less new growth and more new dying, more heat and therefore more fire. The Amazon has long been called ‚Äòthe lungs of the planet‚Äô. It may soon become a bellows. Everything we burn, we breathe.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>While life may soon start to feel a little less sweet for EV owners in Norway, the country is eyeing its next strategic move toward an even greener future, and that means fewer private cars (even electric varieties) clogging the roads in favor of walking, cycling, and taking the bus. </p>



<div><p>Norway is leading the world in electric car adoption, with more than 65% of new passenger cars sold in the country in 2021 being electric ‚Äì and generous tax incentives and perks like free parking have played no small role in that. But the government just announced a new plan to roll back VAT exemptions, especially for higher-end vehicles, with an eye toward potentially slashing more benefits. </p><p>First up is the VAT exemption for EVs priced at more than 500,000 kroner (about $51,700)&nbsp;as of January 1, 2023. The new VAT scheme will be dynamic in that the more expensive the electric car, the higher the VAT fee it incurs from next year. </p></div>



<p>Norwegian news outlet <em>The Local </em><a href="https://www.thelocal.no/20220512/norway-to-remove-vat-exemption-for-electric-cars/">postulates</a> that an EV priced at more than 600,000 kroner ($62,000) would be charged a VAT of 25,000 kroner ($2,580) or around 4%. An electric car priced near the 1 million kroner mark ($103,000) could incur up to a 12.5% VAT ‚Äì which to this France-based reporter seems perfectly reasonable. Note that the standard &nbsp;VAT in Norway is 25%, which is already on the high end compared to the European average of 21%.</p>



<p>Norway already has a goal in place of reducing fossil fuel-burning vehicle sales to zero by 2025 ‚Äì 10 years earlier than the plan set by the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-lawmakers-back-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-cars-2035-2022-05-11/">European Parliament last week</a>. But Norway says it isn‚Äôt hoping to simply replace combustion engines with electric counterparts 1:1 but motivate people to get out of their private vehicles and walk, cycle, and take public transport, the latter which was particularly hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<div><p>EV owners in Norway have long enjoyed a range of <a href="https://elbil.no/english/norwegian-ev-policy/">enticing perks</a> over fossil fuel car owners, from reduced road tolls to driving in bus lanes to free parking, in addition to no purchase or import taxes ‚Äì and while some of this has already been scaled back due to the huge growth in electric car ownership, the government in taking another hard look in hopes of bumping up public transportation usage and reducing traffic, especially in and around cities. Still, no official plan has been released just yet.</p><p>Norwegian Transport Minister Jon-Ivar Nygard said in the statement:</p></div>



<blockquote><p>Electric cars give us greener transport, but they also have a clear intermodal competition with public transport in urban areas. We must make it more attractive to travel by public transport, cycle, and walk.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, the Norwegian Electric Car Association, which represents 110,000&nbsp;EV owners in the country, isn‚Äôt happy with the new VAT measures. Christine Bu, the association‚Äôs general secretary, told Norwegian media outlet <a href="https://www.nrk.no/norge/revidert-nasjonalbudsjett_-fjernar-momsfritak-for-elbilar-_-innforer-tilskotsordning-1.15964393">NRK</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p> The entire electric car policy is at stake. It‚Äôs an incomprehensibly bad idea.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek‚Äôs Take</h2>



<p>Norway is well on pace to meet its <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/04/06/norway-keeps-breaking-ev-adoption-records-tesla-model-y-leads/">all-electric goals by 2025,</a> and while that‚Äôs exciting, the country looks ready to take the next step in making cities, in particular, more livable, safer, while reducing electricity demands and traffic accidents overall. Fewer cars on the road is the only way forward. While more Norwegians than ever before are driving electric vehicles, they are also driving more miles than ever before. In fact, half of European car journeys are less than three miles ‚Äì the kind of distance that for a majority of people is doable by bike, bus, or a brisk walk. Plus with Norway offering so many bonus perks, like EVs cruising down bus lanes (which really should be reserved for actual buses) to free parking (which then creates more demand for parking spaces in lieu of urban parks or green spaces), driving becomes an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù choice. But cities congested with cars and unrestrained car usage isn‚Äôt the utopian future we‚Äôre all dreaming of ‚Äì and Norway is posed once again to lead the charge with a vision of what‚Äôs next after a full electric transition takes place. I think we can all agree that the world would be a lot nicer with fewer cars and more bikes, safe walking and cycling paths, and efficient buses.</p>

                <p>In urban stormwater, particles from tyre wear were the most prevalent microplastic a new Griffith-led study has found.</p>
<p>Published in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c03949"><em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em></a>, the study showed that in stormwater runoff during rain approximately 19 out of every 20 microplastics collected were tyre wear particles with anywhere from 2 to 59 particles per litre of water.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPollution of our waterways by microplastics is an emerging environmental concern due to their persistence and accumulation in aquatic organisms and ecosystems,‚Äù said lead author <a href="https://experts.griffith.edu.au/9419-shima-ziajahromi">Dr Shima Ziajahromi</a>, a research fellow at the <a href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/australian-rivers-institute">Australian Rivers Institute</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStormwater runoff which contains a mixture of sediment, chemical, organic and physical pollutants, is a critical pathway for microplastics to washed off from urban environments during rain and into local aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut to date, our knowledge of the amount of microplastics in urban stormwater, particularly tyre wear particles, is limited, as is the potential strategies we can use to minimise this source.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tyre rubber contains up to 2500 chemicals with the contaminants that leach from tyres considered more toxic to bacteria and microalgae than other plastic polymers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to the analytical challenges in measuring this source of microplastics in stormwater, research to date often lacks information about the actual number of tyre wear particles water samples,‚Äù said Dr Ziajahromi.</p>
<p>Quantitative information of this type is crucial to improve our understanding of the amount of tyre wear particles in stormwater, assess the risk to the environment, and to develop management strategies.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur study quantified and characterize microplastics and tyre wear particles in both stormwater runoff and sediment of stormwater drainage systems in Queensland,‚Äù said co-author <a href="https://experts.griffith.edu.au/18672-frederic-leusch">Professor Fred Leusch</a>, who leads the Australian Rivers Institute‚Äôs Toxicology Research Program.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe also assessed the effectiveness of a stormwater treatment device to capture and remove these contaminants from stormwater and evaluated the role of a constructed stormwater wetland for capturing microplastics in the sediment, removing it from stormwater runoff.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe device is a bag made of 0.2 millimetre mesh which can be retrofitted to stormwater drains. Although originally designed to capture gross pollutants, sediment, litter and oil and grease, it significantly reduced microplastics from raw runoff, with up to 88% less microplastics in treated water which had passed through the device.‚Äù</p>

<p>Sediment samples collected from the inlet and outlet of a constructed stormwater wetland contained between 1450 to 4740 particles in every kilogram of sediment, with more microplastics in the sediment at the inlet than the outlet, indicating the wetland‚Äôs ability to remove them from stormwater.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMicroplastics that enter constructed wetlands for stormwater drainage systems settle in the sediment and form a biofilm, leading to their accumulation over time, removing them from stormwater runoff,‚Äù said Dr Ziajahromi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUrban stormwater runoff typically requires treatment for the removal of suspended solids and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in many jurisdictions in Australia, with some also requiring the removal of gross pollutants. However, regulations are lagging behind when it comes to microplastics and tyre wear particles.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur findings show that both constructed wetlands and the stormwater capture device are strategies that could be potentially used to prevent or at least decrease the amount of microplastics tyre wear particles being transported from stormwater into our waterways.‚Äù</p>

<p>The biggest Internet service providers will dominate a $42.45 billion broadband grant program unless the Biden administration changes a rule requiring grant recipients to obtain a letter of credit from a bank, according to a joint statement from consumer advocacy groups, local government officials, and advocates for small ISPs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://connect-humanity.shorthandstories.com/bead-letter-of-credit-alternatives/">letter</a> sent today to US government officials argues that "by establishing capital barriers too steep for all but the best-funded ISPs, the LOC [letter-of-credit requirement] shuts out the vast majority of entities the program claims to prioritize: small and community-centered ISPs, minority and women-owned ISPs, nonprofits, and municipalities."</p>
<p>The rule is part of the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) <a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/funding-programs/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program">program</a> that's being administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p>
<p>"Rather than demonstrating a provider's ability to construct a broadband network and provide high-speed broadband services to unserved and underserved Americans, the LOC is a measure of whether they can lock up valuable working capital over multiple years," the letter said. "While large incumbents may be able to bear this financial burden, most others can not. And, due to various state and local rules, municipalities are often not allowed to obtain LOCs. Therefore, alternatives to the LOC are critical to ensure these providers can participate in the BEAD program."</p>
<p>The director of the BEAD program, Evan Feinman, responded to letter-of-credit concerns during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_ZWWETMaM0&amp;t=21s">webinar</a> in June. He said the NTIA is aiming to "minimize the failure rate, because every project that's undertaken will expend some funds prior to failing and then have to start back at square one with a new provider if it turns out that a provider doesn't have the wherewithal to undertake a project."</p>
<p>"We know that when we narrow [who can get funding], we're going to lose the opportunity to get into partnership with some high-quality small outfits. But we had to err on one side or the other, there was no way to hit it right on the nose," Feinman said. The NTIA will waive the LOC requirement on a case-by-case basis, but waivers will be "tightly controlled," he said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Biden‚Äôs former FCC nominee among 300 letter-signers</h2>
<p>Today's letter objecting to the letter-of-credit rule was signed by "a coalition of 300 broadband experts, ISPs, community leaders, nonprofits, consumer advocates, and business groups," said the <a href="https://www.benton.org/headlines/benton-institute-joins-broadband-experts-isps-and-local-leaders-urge-biden-administration">Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society</a>. Local government officials from various parts of the US were among the signers.</p>
<p>One signer is Gigi Sohn, the longtime consumer advocate who was nominated by President Biden to the Federal Communications Commission. After the US Senate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/bidens-fcc-pick-withdraws-regrets-that-isps-get-to-choose-their-regulators/">refused to confirm</a> her nomination, Sohn became executive director of the nonprofit <a href="https://aapb.us/">American Association for Public Broadband</a> that lobbies for municipal networks.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by advocates from various other broadband-focused groups, including Public Knowledge; Connect Humanity; the Schools, Health &amp; Libraries Broadband Coalition; the Institute for Local Self-Reliance; Free Press; Next Century Cities; the Multicultural Media, Telecom, and Internet Council; the Coalition for Local Internet Choice; and Consumer Reports.</p>
<p>The letter was sent to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and NTIA Administrator Alan Davidson. Describing the BEAD program requirements, the letter said that participants must obtain a letter of credit "issued by an FDIC bank with Weiss rating of B- or better for 25 percent of the award amount."</p>
<h2>Rules strike wrong balance, letter says</h2>
<p>Funding rules are intended to ensure that ISPs deliver on commitments to build networks. As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/internet-providers-that-won-fcc-grants-try-to-escape-broadband-commitments/">wrote last month</a>, some ISPs that won grants from a different federal program are trying to escape their broadband-deployment commitments.</p>
<p>But the letter to the NTIA and Commerce Department argued that the letter-of-credit requirement is a bad method of ensuring compliance:</p>
<blockquote><p>Banks providing LOCs require that they be collateralized by cash or cash-equivalent. As a result, awardees will have to lock away vast sums of capital for the full duration of the build, likely several years. With the additional 25 percent match requirement, recipients will have a capital hurdle of more than 60 percent of their grant. We <a href="https://connecthumanity.fund/why-the-letter-of-credit-requirement-could-sink-bead/">estimate</a> a provider seeking a $7.5 million grant for a $10 million project will need at least $4.6 million of their own capital up-front.</p>
<p>While we support the NTIA's intention of ensuring providers are accountable for delivering on grants, far from safeguarding taxpayer dollars, the LOC requirement will prevent the Internet service providers best positioned to connect unserved and underserved Americans from participating.</p></blockquote>
<p>ISPs that signed the letter include Astound Broadband (owner of Grande, RCN, and Wave) and several smaller providers. A lobby group for small providers, the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, signed as well.</p>
