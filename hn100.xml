				<div itemprop="articleBody"><p>London's filling out at such a pace, it's only when you stop for a second and look back on recent history that you appreciate just how much it's transformed. Aerial photographer extraordinaire Jason Hawkes has released a set of photos he took from AS355 helicopters — showing London's prodigious transformation between the 2000s and 2023. All we can say is... my, how you've grown!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk “Railway Oriented Programming”.</p>
<p>Here’s the blurb for the talk:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Many examples in functional programming assume that you are always on the “happy path”.
But to create a robust real world application you must deal with validation, logging,
network and service errors, and other annoyances.
</p><p>

So, how do you handle all this in a clean functional way?
</p><p>

This talk will provide a brief introduction to this topic,
using a fun and easy-to-understand railway analogy.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>I am also planning to upload some posts on these topics soon. Meanwhile, please see the <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/series/a-recipe-for-a-functional-app.html">recipe for a functional app</a> series, which covers similar ground.</p>
<p>If you want to to see some real code, I have created
<a href="https://github.com/swlaschin/Railway-Oriented-Programming-Example">this project on Github that compares normal C# with F# using the ROP approach</a></p>
<p>WARNING: This is a useful approach to error handling, but please don’t take it to extremes! See my post on <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/against-railway-oriented-programming/">“Against Railway-Oriented Programming”</a>.</p>

<p>Any Haskellers reading this will immediately recognize this approach as the <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/error-handling.html"><code>Either</code> type</a>,
specialized to use a list of a custom error type for the Left case. In Haskell, something like: <code>type TwoTrack a b = Either [a] (b,[a])</code></p>
<p>I’m certainly not trying to claim that I invented this approach at all (although I do lay claim to the silly analogy).  So why did I not use the standard Haskell terminology?</p>
<p>First, <strong>this post is not trying to be a monad tutorial</strong>, but is instead focused on solving the specific problem of error handling.</p>
<p>Most people coming to F# are not familiar with monads. I’d rather present an approach that is visual, non-intimidating, and generally more intuitive for many people.</p>
<p>I am strong believer in a <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/">“begin with the concrete, and move to the abstract”</a>
pedagogical approach. In my experience, once you are familiar with this particular approach, the higher level abstractions are easier to grasp later.</p>
<p>Second, I would be incorrect to claim that my two-track type with bind is a monad anyway – a monad is more complicated than that, and I just didn’t want to get into the monad laws here.</p>
<p>Third, and most importantly, <code>Either</code> is too general a concept. <strong>I wanted to present a recipe, not a tool</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if I want a recipe for making a loaf of bread, saying “just use flour and an oven” is not very helpful.</p>
<p>And so, in the same way, if I want a recipe for handling errors, saying “just use Either with bind” is not very helpful.</p>
<p>So, in this approach, I’m presenting a whole series of techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a list of custom error types on both the left and right sides of Either (rather than, say, <code>Either String a</code>).</li>
<li>“bind” (<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) for integrating monadic functions into the pipeline.</li>
<li>Kleisli composition (<code>&gt;=&gt;</code>) for composing monadic functions.</li>
<li>“map” (<code>fmap</code>) for integrating non-monadic functions into the pipeline.</li>
<li>“tee” for integrating unit functions into the pipeline (because F# doesn’t use the IO monad).</li>
<li>Mapping from exceptions to error cases.</li>
<li><code>&amp;&amp;&amp;</code> for combining monadic functions in parallel (e.g. for validation).</li>
<li>The benefits of custom error types for domain driven design.</li>
<li>And obvious extensions for logging, domain events, compensating transactions, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you can see that this is a more comprehensive approach than “just use the Either monad”!</p>
<p>My goal here is to provide a template that is versatile enough to be
used in almost all situations, yet constrained enough to enforce a consistent style.
That is, there is basically only one way to write the code. This is extremely helpful to anyone who has to maintain the code later,
as they can immediately understand how it is put together.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that this is the <em>only</em> way to do it. But I think this approach is a good start.</p>
<p>As an aside, even in the Haskell community <a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/2007/03/10/haskell-8-ways-to-report-errors/">there is no consistent approach to error handling</a>, which
can make things <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/252977/cleanest-way-to-report-errors-in-haskell">confusing for beginners</a>.
I know that there is a <a href="http://www.fpcomplete.com/school/starting-with-haskell/basics-of-haskell/10_Error_Handling">lot of content</a>
about the individual <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/errors">error handling techniques</a>, but I’m not aware of a document that brings all these tools
together in a comprehensive way.</p>

<li>If you want to see a sample web-service using these techniques, <a href="https://github.com/swlaschin/Railway-Oriented-Programming-Example">I have created a project on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/railway-oriented-programming-carbonated/">see the ROP approach applied to FizzBuzz</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>F# does not have type classes, and so you don’t really have a reusable way to do monads (although the <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharpx/blob/master/src/FSharpx.Core/ComputationExpressions/Monad.fs">FSharpX library</a>
has a useful approach).  This means the <code>Rop.fs</code> library defines all its functions from scratch.
(In some ways though, this isolation can be helpful because there are no external dependencies at all.)</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, one reason why I stayed away from monads is that defining a monad correctly is <em>not</em> just a matter of implementing “bind” and “return”.
It is an algebraic structure that needs to obey the monad laws (which in turn are just the <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/monoids-without-tears/">monoid laws</a> in a specific situation)
and that was a path I did not want to head down in this particular talk.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/08/17/typescript-is-surprisingly-ok-for-compilers.html">https://matklad.github.io/2023/08/17/typescript-is-surprisingly-ok-for-compilers.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37171801">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>

    
<p><span>There are two main historical trends when choosing an implementation language for something</span>
<span>compiler-shaped.</span></p>
<p><span>For more language-centric tasks, like a formal specification, or a toy hobby language, OCaml makes</span>
<span>most sense. See, for example, </span><a href="https://plzoo.andrej.com/"><span>plzoo</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/653938a88c6f40eb886d5980ca315136eb861d03/interpreter"><span>WebAssembly reference</span>
<span>interpreter</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For something implementation-centric and production ready, C++ is often chosen: LLVM, clang, v8,</span>
<span>HotSpot are all C++.</span></p>
<p><span>These days, Rust is a great new addition to the landscape. It is influenced most directly by ML and</span>
<span>C++, combines their strengths, and even brings something new of its own to the table, like seamless,</span>
<span>safe multithreading. Still, Rust leans heavily towards production readiness side of the spectrum.</span>
<span>While some aspects of it, like a </span>“<span>just works</span>”<span> build system, help with prototyping as well, there</span>’<span>s</span>
<span>still extra complexity tax due to the necessity to model physical layout of data. The usual advice,</span>
<span>when you start building a compiler in Rust, is to avoid pointers and use indexes. Indexes are great!</span>
<span>In large codebase, they allow greater decoupling (side tables can stay local to relevant modules),</span>
<span>improved performance (an index is  </span><code>u32</code><span> and nudges you towards struct-of-arrays layouts), and more</span>
<span>flexible computation strategies (indexes are easier to serialize or plug into incremental</span>
<span>compilation framework). But they do make programming-in-the-small significantly more annoying, which</span>
<span>is a deal-breaker for hobbyist tinkering.</span></p>
<p><span>But OCaml is crufty! Is there something better? Today, I realized that TypeScript might actually be</span>
<span>OK? It is not really surprising, given how the language works, but it never occured to me to think</span>
<span>about TypeScript as an ML equivalent before.</span></p>
<p><span>So, let</span>’<span>s write a tiny-tiny typechecker in TS!</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, we start with </span><a href="https://deno.land/"><span>deno</span></a><span>. See </span><a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/02/12/a-love-letter-to-deno.html"><em><span>A Love Letter to</span>
<span>Deno</span></em></a><span> for more details, but the</span>
<span>TL;DR is that deno provides out-of-the-box experience for TypeScript. This is a pain point for</span>
<span>OCaml, and something that Rust does better than either OCaml or C++. But deno does this better than</span>
<span>Rust! It</span>’<span>s just a single binary, it comes with linting and formatting, there</span>’<span>s no compilation step,</span>
<span>and there are built-in task runner and watch mode. A dream setup for quick PLT hacks!</span></p>
<p><span>And then there</span>’<span>s TypeScript itself, with its sufficiently flexible, yet light-ceremony type system.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>’<span>s start with defining an AST. As we are hacking, we won</span>’<span>t bother with making it an IDE-friendly</span>
<span>concrete syntax tree, or incremental-friendly </span>“<span>only store relative offsets</span>”<span> tree, and will just tag</span>
<span>AST nodes with locations in file:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>interface</span> <span>Location</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>file</span>: <span>string</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>line</span>: <span>number</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>column</span>: <span>number</span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Even here, we already see high-level nature of TypeScript </span>—<span> string is just a </span><code>string</code><span>, there</span>’<span>s no</span>
<span>thinking about </span><code>usize</code><span> vs </span><code>u32</code><span> as numbers are just </span><code>number</code><span>s.</span></p>
<p><span>Usually, an expression is defined as a sum-type. As we want to tag each expression with a location,</span>
<span>that representation would be slightly inconvenient for us, so we split things up a bit:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>interface</span> <span>Expr</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>location</span>: <span>Location</span>;</span>
<span>    <span>kind</span>: <span>ExprKind</span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>ExprKind</span> = <span>ExprBool</span> | <span>ExprInt</span> | ... ;</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>One more thing </span>—<span> as we are going for something quick, we</span>’<span>ll be storing inferred types directly in</span>
<span>the AST nodes. Still, we want to keep raw and type-checked AST separate, so what we are going to do</span>
<span>here is to parametrize the </span><code>Expr</code><span> over associated data it stores. A freshly parsed expression would</span>
<span>use </span><code>void</code><span> as data, and the type checker will set it to </span><code>Type</code><span>. Here</span>’<span>s what we get:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>interface</span> <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>location</span>: <span>Location</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>data</span>: T;</span>
<span>  <span>kind</span>: <span>ExprKind</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>ExprKind</span>&lt;T&gt; =</span>
<span>  | <span>ExprBool</span>&lt;T&gt;</span>
<span>  | <span>ExprInt</span>&lt;T&gt;</span>
<span>  | <span>ExprBinary</span>&lt;T&gt;</span>
<span>  | <span>ExprControl</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>A definition of </span><code>ExprBinary</code><span> could look like this:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ExprBinary</span>&lt;T&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>op</span>: <span>BinaryOp</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>lhs</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span>  <span>rhs</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span> <span>enum</span> <span>BinaryOp</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>Add</span>, <span>Sub</span>, <span>Mul</span>, <span>Div</span>,</span>
<span>  <span>Eq</span>, <span>Neq</span>,</span>
<span>  <span>Lt</span>, <span>Gt</span>, <span>Le</span>, <span>Ge</span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Note how I don</span>’<span>t introduce separate types for, e.g, </span><code>AddExpr</code><span> and </span><code>SubExpr</code><span> </span>—<span> all binary</span>
<span>expressions have the same shape, so one type is enough!</span></p>
<p><span>But we need a tiny adjustment here. Our </span><code>Expr</code><span> kind is defined as a union type. To match a value of</span>
<span>a union type a bit of runtime type information is needed. However, it</span>’<span>s one of the core properties</span>
<span>of TypeScript that it doesn</span>’<span>t add any runtime behaviors. So, if we want to match on expression kinds</span>
<span>(and we for sure want!), we need to give a helping hand to the compiler and include a bit of RTTI</span>
<span>manually. That would be the </span><code>tag</code><span> field:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ExprBinary</span>&lt;T&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>tag</span>: <span>"binary"</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>op</span>: <span>BinaryOp</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>lhs</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span>  <span>rhs</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><code>tag: "binary"</code><span> means that the only possible runtime value for </span><code>tag</code><span> is the string </span><code>"binary"</code><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly to various binary expressions, boolean literal and int literal expressions have </span><em><span>almost</span></em>
<span>identical shape.  Almost, because the payload (</span><code>boolean</code><span> or </span><code>number</code><span>) is different. TypeScript</span>
<span>allows us to neatly abstract this over:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>ExprBool</span>&lt;T&gt; = <span>ExprLiteral</span>&lt;T, <span>boolean</span>, <span>"bool"</span>&gt;;</span>
<span><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>ExprInt</span>&lt;T&gt; = <span>ExprLiteral</span>&lt;T, <span>number</span>, <span>"int"</span>&gt;;</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ExprLiteral</span>&lt;T, V, <span>Tag</span>&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>tag</span>: <span>Tag</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>value</span>: V;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Finally, for control-flow expressions we only add </span><code>if</code><span> for now:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>ExprControl</span>&lt;T&gt; = <span>ExprIf</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ExprIf</span>&lt;T&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>tag</span>: <span>"if"</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>cond</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span>  <span>then_branch</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span>  <span>else_branch</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>This concludes the definition of the ast! Let</span>’<span>s move on to the type inference! Start with types:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>Type</span> = <span>TypeBool</span> | <span>TypeInt</span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>interface</span> <span>TypeBool</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>tag</span>: <span>"Bool"</span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span><span>const</span> <span>TypeBool</span>: <span>TypeBool</span> = { <span>tag</span>: <span>"Bool"</span> };</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>interface</span> <span>TypeInt</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>tag</span>: <span>"Int"</span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span><span>const</span> <span>TypeInt</span>: <span>TypeInt</span> = { <span>tag</span>: <span>"Int"</span> };</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Our types are really simple, we could have gone with </span><span><code>type Type = "Int" | "Bool"</code><span>,</span></span><span> but</span>
<span>lets do this a bit more enterprisy! We define separate types for integer and boolean types. As these</span>
<span>types are singletons, we also provide canonical definitions. And here is another TypeScript-ism.</span>
<span>Because TypeScript fully erases types, everything related to types lives in a separate namespace. So</span>
<span>you can have a type and a value sharing the same name. Which is exactly what we use to define the</span>
<span>singletons!</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we can take advantage of our associated-data parametrized expression and writhe the</span>
<span>signature of</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>infer_types</span>(<span>expr: ast.Expr&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;</span>): ast.<span>Expr</span>&lt;<span>Type</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>As it says on the tin, </span><code>inter_types</code><span> fills in </span><code>Type</code><span> information into the void! Let</span>’<span>s fill in the</span>
<span>details!</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>infer_types</span>(<span>expr: ast.Expr&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;</span>): ast.<span>Expr</span>&lt;<span>Type</span>&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>switch</span> (expr.<span>kind</span>.<span>tag</span>) {</span>
<span>    cas</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>If at this point we hit Enter, the editor completes:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>infer_types</span>(<span>expr: ast.Expr&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;</span>): ast.<span>Expr</span>&lt;<span>Type</span>&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>switch</span> (expr.<span>kind</span>.<span>tag</span>) {</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"bool"</span>:</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"int"</span>:</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"binary"</span>:</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"if"</span>:</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>There</span>’<span>s one problem though. What we really want to write here is something like</span>
<span><code>const inferred_type = switch(..)</code><span>,</span></span>
<span>but in TypeScript </span><code>switch</code><span> is a statement, not an expression.</span>
<span>So let</span>’<span>s define a generic visitor!</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>Visitor</span>&lt;T, R&gt; = {</span>
<span>  <span>bool</span>(<span>kind</span>: <span>ExprBool</span>&lt;T&gt;): R;</span>
<span>  <span>int</span>(<span>kind</span>: <span>ExprInt</span>&lt;T&gt;): R;</span>
<span>  <span>binary</span>(<span>kind</span>: <span>ExprBinary</span>&lt;T&gt;): R;</span>
<span>  <span>if</span>(<span>kind</span>: <span>ExprIf</span>&lt;T&gt;): R;</span>
<span>};</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span> <span>function</span> visit&lt;T, R&gt;(</span>
<span>  <span>expr</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;,</span>
<span>  <span>v</span>: <span>Visitor</span>&lt;T, R&gt;,</span>
<span>): R {</span>
<span>  <span>switch</span> (expr.<span>kind</span>.<span>tag</span>) {</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"bool"</span>: <span>return</span> v.<span>bool</span>(expr.<span>kind</span>);</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"int"</span>: <span>return</span> v.<span>int</span>(expr.<span>kind</span>);</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"binary"</span>: <span>return</span> v.<span>binary</span>(expr.<span>kind</span>);</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"if"</span>: <span>return</span> v.<span>if</span>(expr.<span>kind</span>);</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Armed with the </span><code>visit</code><span>, we can ergonomically match over the expression:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>infer_types</span>(<span>expr: ast.Expr&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;</span>): ast.<span>Expr</span>&lt;<span>Type</span>&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>const</span> ty = <span>visit</span>(expr, {</span>
<span>    <span>bool</span>: <span>() =&gt;</span> <span>TypeBool</span>,</span>
<span>    <span>int</span>: <span>() =&gt;</span> <span>TypeInt</span>,</span>
<span>    <span>binary</span>: <span>(<span>kind: ast.ExprBinary&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;</span>) =&gt;</span> <span>result_type</span>(kind.<span>op</span>),</span>
<span>    <span>if</span>: (<span>kind</span>: ast.<span>ExprIf</span>&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;) {</span>
<span>      ...</span>
<span>    },</span>
<span>  });</span>
<span>  ...</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span> <span>result_type</span>(<span>op: ast.BinaryOp</span>): <span>Type</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>switch</span> (op) { <span>// A tad verbose, but auto-completed!</span></span>
<span>    <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Add</span>: <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Sub</span>:</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Mul</span>: <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Div</span>:</span>
<span>      <span>return</span> <span>TypeInt</span></span>
<span></span>
<span>    <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Eq</span>: <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Neq</span>:</span>
<span>      <span>return</span> <span>TypeBool</span></span>
<span></span>
<span>    <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Lt</span>: <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Gt</span>:</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Le</span>: <span>case</span> ast.<span>BinaryOp</span>.<span>Ge</span>:</span>
<span>      <span>return</span> <span>TypeBool</span></span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Before we go further, let</span>’<span>s generalize this visiting pattern a bit! Recall that our expressions are</span>
<span>parametrized by the type of associated data, and type-checker-shaped transformations are essentially an</span>
<code>Expr&lt;U&gt; -&gt; Expr&lt;V&gt;</code>
<span>transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>’<span>s make this generic!</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>function</span> transform&lt;U, V&gt;(<span>expr</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;U&gt;, <span>v</span>: <span>Visitor</span>&lt;V, V&gt;): <span>Expr</span>&lt;V&gt; {</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Transform maps an expression carrying </span><code>T</code><span> into an expression carrying </span><code>V</code><span> by applying an </span><code>f</code>
<span>visitor. Importantly, it</span>’<span>s </span><code>Visitor&lt;V, V&gt;</code><span>, rather than a </span><code>Visitor&lt;U, V&gt;</code><span>. This is</span>
<span>counter-intuitive, but correct </span>—<span> we run transformation bottom up, transforming the leaves first.</span>
<span>So, when the time comes to visit an interior node, all subexpression will have been transformed!</span></p>
<p><span>The body of </span><code>transform</code><span> is wordy, but regular, rectangular, and auto-comptletes itself:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>export</span> <span>function</span> transform&lt;U, V&gt;(<span>expr</span>: <span>Expr</span>&lt;U&gt;, <span>v</span>: <span>Visitor</span>&lt;V, V&gt;): <span>Expr</span>&lt;V&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>switch</span> (expr.<span>kind</span>.<span>tag</span>) {</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"bool"</span>:</span>
<span>      <span>return</span> {</span>
<span>        <span>location</span>: expr.<span>location</span>,</span>
<span>        <span>data</span>: v.<span>bool</span>(expr.<span>kind</span>),</span>
<span>        <span>kind</span>: expr.<span>kind</span>, <i data-value="1"></i></span>
<span>      };</span>
<span>    <span>case</span> <span>"int"</span>:</span>
<span>      <span>return</span> {</span>
<span>        <span>location</span>: expr.<span>location</span>,</span>

<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Note how here </span><code>expr.kind</code><span> is both </span><code>Expr&lt;U&gt;</code><span> and  </span><code>Expr&lt;V&gt;</code><span> </span>—<span> literals don</span>’<span>t depend on this type</span>
<span>parameter, and TypeScript is smart enough to figure this out without us manually re-assembling</span>
<span>the same value with a different type.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>This is where that magic with </span><code>Visitor&lt;V, V&gt;</code><span> happens.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The code is pretty regular here though! So at this point we might actually recall that TypeScript is</span>
<span>a dynamically-typed language, and write a generic traversal using </span><code>Object.keys</code><span>, </span><em><span>while keeping the</span>
<span>static function signature in-place</span></em><span>. I don</span>’<span>t think we need to do it here, but there</span>’<span>s comfort in</span>
<span>knowing that it</span>’<span>s possible!</span></p>
<p><em><span>Now</span></em><span> implementing type inference should be a breeze! We need some way to emit type errors though.</span>
<span>With TypeScript, it would be trivial to accumulate errors into an array as a side-effect, but let</span>’<span>s</span>
<span>actually represent type errors as instances of a specific type, </span><code>TypeError</code><span> (pun intended):</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>Type</span> = <span>TypeBool</span> | <span>TypeInt</span> | <span>TypeError</span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>interface</span> <span>TypeError</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>tag</span>: <span>"Error"</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>location</span>: ast.<span>Location</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>message</span>: <span>string</span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>To check ifs and binary expressions, we would also need an utility for comparing types:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>type_equal</span>(<span>lhs: Type, rhs: Type</span>): <span>boolean</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> (lhs.<span>tag</span> == <span>"Error"</span> || rhs.<span>tag</span> == <span>"Error"</span>) <span>return</span> <span>true</span>;</span>
<span>  <span>return</span> lhs.<span>tag</span> == rhs.<span>tag</span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>We make the </span><code>Error</code><span> type equal to any other type to prevent cascading failures. With all that</span>
<span>machinery in place, our type checker is finally:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>infer_types</span>(<span>expr: ast.Expr&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;</span>): ast.<span>Expr</span>&lt;<span>Type</span>&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>return</span> ast.<span>transform</span>(expr, {</span>
<span>    <span>bool</span>: (): <span><span>Type</span> =&gt;</span> <span>TypeBool</span>,</span>
<span>    <span>int</span>: (): <span><span>Type</span> =&gt;</span> <span>TypeInt</span>,</span>
<span></span>
<span>    <span>binary</span>: (<span>kind</span>: ast.<span>ExprBinary</span>&lt;<span>Type</span>&gt;, <span>location</span>: ast.<span>Location</span>): <span><span>Type</span> =&gt;</span> {</span>
<span>      <span>if</span> (!<span>type_equal</span>(kind.<span>lhs</span>.<span>data</span>, kind.<span>rhs</span>.<span>data</span>)) {</span>
<span>        <span>return</span> {</span>
<span>          <span>tag</span>: <span>"Error"</span>,</span>
<span>          location,</span>
<span>          <span>message</span>: <span>"binary expression operands have different types"</span>,</span>
<span>        };</span>
<span>      }</span>
<span>      <span>return</span> <span>result_type</span>(kind.<span>op</span>);</span>
<span>    },</span>
<span></span>
<span>    <span>if</span>: (<span>kind</span>: ast.<span>ExprIf</span>&lt;<span>Type</span>&gt;, <span>location</span>: ast.<span>Location</span>): <span><span>Type</span> =&gt;</span> {</span>
<span>      <span>if</span> (!<span>type_equal</span>(kind.<span>cond</span>.<span>data</span>, <span>TypeBool</span>)) {</span>
<span>        <span>return</span> {</span>
<span>          <span>tag</span>: <span>"Error"</span>,</span>
<span>          location,</span>
<span>          <span>message</span>: <span>"if condition is not a boolean"</span>,</span>
<span>        };</span>
<span>      }</span>
<span>      <span>if</span> (!<span>type_equal</span>(kind.<span>then_branch</span>.<span>data</span>, kind.<span>else_branch</span>.<span>data</span>)) {</span>
<span>        <span>return</span> {</span>
<span>          <span>tag</span>: <span>"Error"</span>,</span>
<span>          location,</span>
<span>          <span>message</span>: <span>"if branches have different types"</span>,</span>
<span>        };</span>
<span>      }</span>
<span>      <span>return</span> kind.<span>then_branch</span>.<span>data</span>;</span>
<span>    },</span>
<span>  });</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span> <span>result_type</span>(<span>op: ast.BinaryOp</span>): <span>Type</span> {</span>
<span>    ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Astute reader will notice that our visitor functions now take an extra </span><code>ast.Location</code><span> argument.</span>
<span>TypeScript allows using this argument only in cases where it is needed, cutting down verbosity.</span></p>
<p><span>And that</span>’<span>s all for today! The end result is pretty neat and concise. It took some typing to get there,</span>
<span>but TypeScript autocompletion really helps with that! What</span>’<span>s more important, there was very little</span>
<span>fighting with the language, and the result feels quite natural and directly corresponds to the shape</span>
<span>of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I am not entirely sure in the conclusion just yet, but I think I</span>’<span>ll be using TypeScript as my tool</span>
<span>of choice for various small language hacks. It is surprisingly productive due to the confluence of</span>
<span>three aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>deno is a perfect scripting runtime! Small, hermetic, powerful, and optimized for effective</span>
<span>development workflows.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>TypeScript tooling is great </span>—<span> the IDE is helpful and productive (and deno makes sure that it</span>
<span>also requires zero configuration)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The language is powerful both at runtime and at compile time. You can get pretty fancy with types,</span>
<span>but you can also just escape to dynamic world if you need some very high-order code.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><span>Just kidding, here</span>’<span>s one more cute thing. Let</span>’<span>s say that we want to have lots of syntactic sugar,</span>
<span>and also want type-safe desugaring. We could tweak our setup a bit for that: instead of </span><code>Expr</code><span> and</span>
<code>ExprKind</code><span> being parametrized over associated data, we circularly parametrize </span><code>Expr</code><span> by the whole</span>
<code>ExprKind</code><span> and  vice verse:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>interface</span> <span>Expr</span>&lt;K&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>location</span>: <span>Location</span>,</span>
<span>  <span>kind</span>: K,</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>interface</span> <span>ExprBinary</span>&lt;E&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>op</span>: <span>BinaryOp</span>,</span>
<span>  <span>lhs</span>: E,</span>
<span>  <span>rhs</span>: E,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>This allows expressing desugaring in a type-safe manner!</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>// Fundamental, primitive expressions.</span></span>
<span><span>type</span> <span>ExprKindCore</span>&lt;E&gt; =</span>
<span>    <span>ExprInt</span>&lt;E&gt; | <span>ExprBinary</span>&lt;E&gt; | <span>ExprIf</span>&lt;E&gt;</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// Expressions which are either themselves primitive,</span></span>
<span><span>// or can be desugared to primitives.</span></span>
<span><span>type</span> <span>ExprKindSugar</span>&lt;E&gt; = <span>ExprKindCore</span>&lt;E&gt;</span>
<span>    | <span>ExprCond</span>&lt;E&gt; | <span>ExprUnless</span>&lt;E&gt;</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>type</span> <span>ExprCore</span> = <span>Expr</span>&lt;<span>ExprKindCore</span>&lt;<span>ExprCore</span>&gt;&gt;;</span>
<span><span>type</span> <span>ExprSugar</span> = <span>Expr</span>&lt;<span>ExprKindSugar</span>&lt;<span>ExprSugar</span>&gt;&gt;;</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// Desugaring works by reducing the set of expression kinds.</span></span>
<span><span>function</span> <span>desugar</span>(<span>expr: ExprSugar</span>): <span>ExprCore</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// A desugaring steps takes a (potentially sugar) expression,</span></span>
<span><span>// whose subexpression are already desugared,</span></span>
<span><span>// and produces an equivalent core expression.</span></span>
<span><span>function</span> <span>desugar_one</span>(<span></span></span>
<span><span>    expr: ExprKindSugar&lt;ExprCore&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span></span>): <span>ExprKindCore</span>&lt;<span>ExprCore</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>

<p dir="auto">This library aims to provide a set of data types and functions that make it easy and fun to write maintainable and testable code in golang. It encourages the following patterns:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>write many small, testable and pure functions, i.e. functions that produce output only depending on their input and that do not execute side effects</li>
<li>offer helpers to isolate side effects into lazily executed functions (IO)</li>
<li>expose a consistent set of composition to create new functions from existing ones
<ul dir="auto">
<li>for each data type there exists a small set of composition functions</li>
<li>these functions are called the same across all data types, so you only have to learn a small number of function names</li>
<li>the semantic of functions of the same name is consistent across all data types</li>

<p dir="auto">✔️ Each of the top level packages (e.g. Option, Either, ReaderIOEither, ...) fulfils the purpose of defining the respective data type and implementing the set of common operations for this data type.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Handle errors explicitly</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ The library makes a clear distinction between that operations that cannot fail by design and operations that can fail. Failure is represented via the <code>Either</code> type and errors are handled explicitly by using <code>Either</code>'s monadic set of operations.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Return early rather than nesting deeply</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ We recommend to implement simple, small functions that implement one feature and that would typically not invoke other functions. Interaction with other functions is done by function composition and the composition makes sure to run one function after the other. In the error case the <code>Either</code> monad makes sure to skip the error path.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Leave concurrency to the caller</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ All pure are synchronous by default. The I/O operations are asynchronous per default.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Before you launch a goroutine, know when it will stop</h4>
<p dir="auto">🤷🏽 This is left to the user of the library since the library itself will not start goroutines on its own. The Task monad offers support for cancellation via the golang context, though.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Avoid package level state</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ No package level state anywhere, this would be a significant anti-pattern</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Simplicity matters</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ The library is simple in the sense that it offers a small, consistent interface to a variety of data types. Users can concentrate on implementing business logic rather than dealing with low level data structures.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Write tests to lock in the behaviour of your package’s API</h4>
<p dir="auto">🟡 The programming pattern suggested by this library encourages writing test cases. The library itself also has a growing number of tests, but not enough, yet. TBD</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 If you think it’s slow, first prove it with a benchmark</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ Absolutely. If you think the function composition offered by this library is too slow, please provide a benchmark.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Moderation is a virtue</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ The library does not implement its own goroutines and also does not require any expensive synchronization primitives. Coordination of IO operations is implemented via atomic counters without additional primitives.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Maintainability counts</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ Code that consumes this library is easy to maintain because of the small and concise set of operations exposed. Also the suggested programming paradigm to decompose an application into small functions increases maintainability, because these functions are easy to understand and if they are pure, it's often sufficient to look at the type signature to understand the purpose.</p>
<p dir="auto">The library itself also comprises many small functions, but it's admittedly harder to maintain than code that uses it. However this asymmetry is intended because it offloads complexity from users into a central component.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comparation to Idiomatic Go</h2>
<p dir="auto">In this section we discuss how the functional APIs differ from idiomatic go function signatures and how to convert back and forth.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pure functions</h3>
<p dir="auto">Pure functions are functions that take input parameters and that compute an output without changing any global state and without mutating the input parameters. They will always return the same output for the same input.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Without Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">If your pure function does not return an error, the idiomatic signature is just fine and no changes are required.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">With Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">If your pure function can return an error, then it will have a <code>(T, error)</code> return value in idiomatic go. In functional style the return value is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/either" rel="nofollow">Either[error, T]</a> because function composition is easier with such a return type. Use the <code>EitherizeXXX</code> methods in <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/either" rel="nofollow">"github.com/IBM/fp-go/either"</a> to convert from idiomatic to functional style and <code>UneitherizeXXX</code> to convert from functional to idiomatic style.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Effectful functions</h3>
<p dir="auto">An effectful function (or function with a side effect) is one that changes data outside the scope of the function or that does not always produce the same output for the same input (because it depends on some external, mutable state). There is no special way in idiomatic go to identify such a function other than documentation. In functional style we represent them as functions that do not take an input but that produce an output. The base type for these functions is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/io" rel="nofollow">IO[T]</a> because in many cases such functions represent <code>I/O</code> operations.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Without Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">If your effectful function does not return an error, the functional signature is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/io" rel="nofollow">IO[T]</a></p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">With Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">If your effectful function can return an error, the functional signature is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/ioeither" rel="nofollow">IOEither[error, T]</a>. Use <code>EitherizeXXX</code> from <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/ioeither" rel="nofollow">"github.com/IBM/fp-go/ioeither"</a> to convert an idiomatic go function to functional style.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Go Context</h3>
<p dir="auto">Functions that take a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context" rel="nofollow">context</a> are per definition effectful because they depend on the context parameter that is designed to be mutable (it can e.g. be used to cancel a running operation). Furthermore in idiomatic go the parameter is typically passed as the first parameter to a function.</p>
<p dir="auto">In functional style we isolate the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context" rel="nofollow">context</a> and represent the nature of the effectful function as an <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/ioeither" rel="nofollow">IOEither[error, T]</a>. The resulting type is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/context/readerioeither" rel="nofollow">ReaderIOEither[T]</a>, a function taking a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context" rel="nofollow">context</a> that returns a function without parameters returning an <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/either" rel="nofollow">Either[error, T]</a>. Use the <code>EitherizeXXX</code> methods from <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/context/readerioeither" rel="nofollow">"github.com/IBM/fp-go/context/readerioeither"</a> to convert an idiomatic go function with a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context" rel="nofollow">context</a> to functional style.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Implementation Notes</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generics</h3>
<p dir="auto">All monadic operations are implemented via generics, i.e. they offer a type safe way to compose operations. This allows for convenient IDE support and also gives confidence about the correctness of the composition at compile time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Downside is that this will result in different versions of each operation per type, these versions are generated by the golang compiler at build time (unlike type erasure in languages such as Java of TypeScript). This might lead to large binaries for codebases with many different types. If this is a concern, you can always implement type erasure on top, i.e. use the monadic operations with the <code>any</code> type as if generics were not supported. You loose type safety, but this might result in smaller binaries.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ordering of Generic Type Parameters</h3>
<p dir="auto">In go we need to specify all type parameters of a function on the global function definition, even if the function returns a higher order function and some of the type parameters are only applicable to the higher order function. So the following is not possible:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Map[A, B any](f func(A) B) [R, E any]func(fa ReaderIOEither[R, E, A]) ReaderIOEither[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Map</span>[<span>A</span>, <span>B</span> <span>any</span>](<span>f</span> <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>) [<span>R</span>, <span>E</span> <span>any</span>]<span>func</span>(<span>fa</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that the parameters <code>R</code> and <code>E</code> are not needed by the first level of <code>Map</code> but only by the resulting higher order function. Instead we need to specify the following:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Map[R, E, A, B any](f func(A) B) func(fa ReaderIOEither[R, E, A]) ReaderIOEither[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Map</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span> <span>any</span>](<span>f</span> <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>) <span>func</span>(<span>fa</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">which overspecifies <code>Map</code> on the global scope. As a result the go compiler will not be able to auto-detect these parameters, it can only auto detect <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> since they appear in the argument of <code>Map</code>. We need to explicitly pass values for these type parameters when <code>Map</code> is being used.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because of this limitation the order of parameters on a function matters. We want to make sure that we define those parameters that cannot be auto-detected, first, and the parameters that can be auto-detected, last. This can lead to inconsistencies in parameter ordering, but we believe that the gain in convenience is worth it. The parameter order of <code>Ap</code> is e.g. different from that of <code>Map</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Ap[B, R, E, A any](fa ReaderIOEither[R, E, A]) func(fab ReaderIOEither[R, E, func(A) B]) ReaderIOEither[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Ap</span>[<span>B</span>, <span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span> <span>any</span>](<span>fa</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>func</span>(<span>fab</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>]) <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">because <code>R</code>, <code>E</code> and <code>A</code> can be determined from the argument to <code>Ap</code> but <code>B</code> cannot.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use of the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/47781-parameterized-go-ast.md" rel="nofollow">~ Operator</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The FP library attempts to be easy to consume and one aspect of this is the definition of higher level type definitions instead of having to use their low level equivalent. It is e.g. more convenient and readable to use</p>

<p dir="auto">than</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func(R) func() Either.Either[E, A]"><pre><span>func</span>(<span>R</span>) <span>func</span>() Either.<span>Either</span>[<span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">although both are logically equivalent. At the time of this writing the go type system does not support generic type aliases, only generic type definition, i.e. it is not possible to write:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type ReaderIOEither[R, E, A any] = RD.Reader[R, IOE.IOEither[E, A]]"><pre><span>type</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span> <span>any</span>] <span>=</span> RD.<span>Reader</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>IOE</span>.<span>IOEither</span>[<span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">only</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type ReaderIOEither[R, E, A any] RD.Reader[R, IOE.IOEither[E, A]]"><pre><span>type</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span> <span>any</span>] RD.<span>Reader</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>IOE</span>.<span>IOEither</span>[<span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This makes a big difference, because in the second case the type <code>ReaderIOEither[R, E, A any]</code> is considered a completely new type, not compatible to its right hand side, so it's not just a shortcut but a fully new type.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the implementation perspective however there is no reason to restrict the implementation to the new type, it can be generic for all compatible types. The way to express this in go is the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/47781-parameterized-go-ast.md" rel="nofollow">~</a> operator. This comes with some quite complicated type declarations in some cases, which undermines the goal of the library to be easy to use.</p>
<p dir="auto">For that reason there exist sub-packages called <code>Generic</code> for all higher level types. These packages contain the fully generic implementation of the operations, preferring abstraction over usability. These packages are not meant to be used by end-users but are meant to be used by library extensions. The implementation for the convenient higher level types specializes the generic implementation for the particular higher level type, i.e. this layer does not contain any business logic but only <em>type magic</em>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Higher Kinded Types</h3>
<p dir="auto">Go does not support higher kinded types (HKT). Such types occur if a generic type itself is parametrized by another generic type. Example:</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>Map</code> operation for <code>ReaderIOEither</code> is defined as:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Map[R, E, A, B any](f func(A) B) func(fa ReaderIOEither[R, E, A]) ReaderIOEither[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Map</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span> <span>any</span>](<span>f</span> <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>) <span>func</span>(<span>fa</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and in fact the equivalent operations for all other mondas follow the same pattern, we could try to introduce a new type for <code>ReaderIOEither</code> (without a parameter) as a HKT, e.g. like so (made-up syntax, does not work in go):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Map[HKT, R, E, A, B any](f func(A) B) func(HKT[R, E, A]) HKT[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Map</span>[<span>HKT</span>, <span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span> <span>any</span>](<span>f</span> <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>) <span>func</span>(<span>HKT</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>HKT</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">this would be the completely generic method signature for all possible monads. In particular in many cases it is possible to compose functions independent of the concrete knowledge of the actual <code>HKT</code>. From the perspective of a library this is the ideal situation because then a particular algorithm only has to be implemented and tested once.</p>
<p dir="auto">This FP library addresses this by introducing the HKTs as individual types, e.g. <code>HKT[A]</code> would be represented as a new generic type <code>HKTA</code>. This loses the correlation to the type <code>A</code> but allows to implement generic algorithms, at the price of readability.</p>
<p dir="auto">For that reason these implementations are kept in the <code>internal</code> package. These are meant to be used by the library itself or by extensions, not by end users.</p>

<p>
The Python global interpreter lock (GIL) has long been a barrier to
increasing the performance of programs by using multiple threads—the GIL
serializes access to the interpreter's virtual machine such that only one thread
can be executing Python code at any given time.  There are other mechanisms
to provide 
concurrency for the language, but the specter of the GIL—and its reality as
well—have often been cited as a major negative for Python.  Back in October
2021, Sam Gross <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/python-dev/CAGr09bSrMNyVNLTvFq-h6t38kTxqTXfgxJYApmbEWnT71L74-g@mail.gmail.com/">introduced</a>
a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/872869/">proof-of-concept, no-GIL version of the
language</a>. It was met with a lot of excitement at the time, but
seemed to languish to a certain extent for more than a year; now, the Python
Steering 
Council has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/939568/">announced its intent to accept the
no-GIL feature</a>.  It will still be some time before it lands in a
released Python version—and there is the possibility that it all has to be
rolled back at some point—but there are several companies backing the
effort, which gives it all a good chance to succeed.
</p>

<p>
After its introduction in&nbsp;2021, and the discussion around that, the next public
appearance for the feature was at the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit_01678898482.html">2022
Python Language Summit</a> in April. Gross gave a <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit-python_11.html">talk</a> about
his <a href="https://github.com/colesbury/nogil">no-GIL fork</a> in the
hopes of getting some tacit agreement on proceeding with the work.  That
agreement 
was not forthcoming, in part because the full details and implications of
a no-GIL interpreter were not really known.
Meanwhile, the Faster CPython project, which <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/857754/">came about in mid-2021</a> had been working along
on its plan to increase the <i>single-threaded</i> performance of the
interpreter. 
Mark Shannon <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit_2.html">reported
on the status of that effort</a> at the&nbsp;2022 summit as well.  He also
authored <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/">PEP&nbsp;659</a>
("Specialized Adaptive Interpreter") that describes the kinds of changes
being made, some of which have found their way into Python&nbsp;3.10
and&nbsp;3.11. 
</p>

<p>
At this year's PyCon, two of the Faster CPython team gave talks describing
the techniques they have been using to improve the performance of the
interpreter: Brandt Bucher <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/930705/">looked at adaptive
instructions</a>, while Shannon  <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/931197/">described memory layout improvements and other
optimizations</a>. 
Given the GIL, nearly all existing Python
programs are single threaded, so improving the performance of
those programs will effectively speed up the entire Python world.  One of
the concerns that has been heard about no-GIL Python is what its impact on
single-threaded programs would be.
</p>

<h4>PEP 703</h4>

<p>
In January 2023, Łukasz Langa <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606">posted</a>
the first version of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP&nbsp;703</a> ("Making the
Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython") that is authored by Gross;
Langa is sponsoring the PEP 
as a core developer.  As might be guessed, that set off a lengthy thread,
with, once again, a lot of excitement.  There were also some concerns expressed
with regard to the implications of not having a GIL, especially for Python
extensions written in C; since the GIL protects that code from 
many concurrency problems, removing it might well lead to bugs. 
</p> 

<p>
One
thing that everyone wants to avoid is another "flag day" transition like
that of Python&nbsp;2 to&nbsp;3.  The huge and unfortunate impact of
Python&nbsp;3 being incompatible with its predecessor was not foreseen—the
core developers vastly underestimated the growing popularity of the
language, for one thing—but that mistake will not be repeated.  Any switch
to remove the GIL will need to smoothly work with code that is not (yet)
ready for it.
</p>

<p>
There was a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606/25">question</a>
from Shannon about "<q>what people think is a acceptable slowdown for
single-threaded code</q>".  To a large extent, that question went
unanswered in the thread, but he had estimated an impact "<q>in the 15-20%
range, but it could be more, depending on the impact on PEP 659</q>".
</p>

<p>
Another Faster CPython team member, Eric Snow, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606/84">posted</a>
a lengthy analysis with a bunch of questions, which he summarized as:
"<q>tl;dr I'm really excited by this proposal but have significant
concerns, which I genuinely hope the PEP can address.</q>"  He noted that
he was the author of a "competing" concurrency option in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/">PEP&nbsp;684</a> ("A
Per-Interpreter GIL"), along with the related <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0683/">PEP&nbsp;683</a> ("Immortal
Objects, Using a Fixed Refcount"), though he does not truly see multiple
sub-interpreters, each with their own GIL, as being incompatible with the
no-GIL work.  Much of his concern was focused on the impacts on the C
extensions (which is also a problem for PEP&nbsp;684, though to a lesser
extent), but single-threaded performance was also mentioned.  Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606/97">replied</a>
that the impact on the extensions was not completely negative:
</p><blockquote>
There are also substantial benefits to extension module maintainers. The
PEP includes quotes from a number of maintainers of widely used C API
extensions who suffer the complexity of working around the GIL. For
example, Zachary DeVito, PyTorch core developer, wrote "On three separate
occasions in the past couple of months… I spent an order-of-magnitude more
time figuring out how to work around GIL limitations than actually solving
the particular problem." 
</blockquote>


<h4>Updated PEP</h4>

<p>
The thread had mostly run its course by the end of January.
In early May, Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503">posted</a>
an updated version of PEP&nbsp;703, along with an <a href="https://github.com/colesbury/nogil-3.12">implementation based on the
in-progress Python&nbsp;3.12</a>.  There was just one <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/2">response</a>
early on 
(which Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/3">replied
to</a>).  On May&nbsp;12, Gross <a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/188">asked the
steering council to decide on the PEP</a>.  As it turned out, there was
still a lot more discussion to go before any decision would be made.
</p>

<p>
On June 2, Shannon <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/9">posted
a performance assessment</a> of the PEP with some pretty eye-opening
numbers (that were disputed) on the impact of the changes; his estimates
of the impact ranged from&nbsp;11 to&nbsp;30%.
He also noted that removing the GIL had some negative impacts on the
existing and planned Faster CPython work:
</p><blockquote>
The adaptive specializing interpreter relies on the GIL; it is not
thread-friendly. 
If NoGIL is accepted, then some redesign of our optimization strategy will
be necessary. 
While this is perfectly possible, it does have a cost.
The effort spent on this redesign and resulting implementation is not being
spent on actual optimizations. 
</blockquote>


<p>
Shannon has noted that he is not a fan of the free-threading, shared-memory
concurrency model; his assessment ends with a suggestion that
sub-interpreters provide a better concurrency solution with fewer of the
performance and other concerns that no-GIL brings.  Others, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/13">including
steering council member Gregory P. Smith</a> found that analysis to be
somewhat oversimplified.  Langa <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/17">posted
benchmark numbers</a> that showed considerably less impact than Shannon's
estimates. Langa <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/18">followed
that up</a> with some additional results that correspond closely with what
Gross had reported in the PEP.
</p>

<p>
Guido van Rossum, who  heads up the Faster CPython team, wanted to
ensure that everyone 
learned from the mistakes made in the past:
</p><blockquote>
If there's one lesson we've learned from the Python 2 to 3 transition, it's
that it would have been very beneficial if Python 2 and 3 code could
<i>coexist</i> in the same Python interpreter. We blew it that time, and it
set us 
back by about a decade. 
<p>
Let's not blow it this time. If we're going forward with nogil (and I'm not
saying we are, but I can't exclude it), let's make sure there is a way to
be able to import extensions requiring the GIL in a nogil interpreter
without any additional shenanigans – neither the application code nor the
extension module should have to be modified in any way [...]
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Meanwhile, Smith replied to Gross's steering-council request (and <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/20">copied
it to the forum thread</a>): 
</p><blockquote>
The steering council is going to take its time on this. A huge thank you
for working to keep it up to date! We're not ready to simply pronounce on
703 as it has a HUGE blast radius. 
<p>
[...] That does not mean "no" to this. There is demand for it. (<i>personally,
I've wanted this since forever!</i>) It's just that it won't be easy and we'll
need to consider the entire ecosystem and how to smoothly allow such a
change to happen without breaking the world. 
</p><p>
I'm glad to see the continued discuss thread with faster-cpython folks in
particular piping up. The intersection between this work and ongoing single
threaded performance improvements will always be high and we don't want to
hamper that in the near term. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/28">largely
disagreed</a> with Shannon's assessment and, in particular, with his
characterization of threading.  He was also, seemingly, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/43">somewhat
unhappy</a> with Smith's reply:
</p><blockquote>
You wrote that the Steering Council's decision does not mean "no," but the
steering council has not set a bar for acceptance, stated what evidence is
actually needed, nor said when a final decision will be made. Given the
expressed demand for PEP 703, it makes sense to me 
for the steering committee to develop a timeline for identifying the
factors it may need to consider and for determining the steps that would be
required for the change to happen smoothly. 
<p>
Without these timelines and milestones in place, I would like to explain
that the effect of the Steering Council's answer is a "no" in practice. I
have been funded to work on this for the past few years with the milestone
of submitting the PEP along with a comprehensive implementation to convince
the Python community. Without specific concerns or a clear bar for
acceptance, I (and my funding organization) will have to treat the current
decision-in-limbo as a "no" and will be unable to pursue the PEP further. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
That obviously put pressure on the council, as did the users who were
clamoring for a no-GIL Python, but the decision is clearly not a simple
one.  On June&nbsp;14, more pressure was applied from the Faster CPython
team.  Van Rossum <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/118">described</a>
some of
the costs of no-GIL, but also expressed concern about waiting for a
decision:
</p><blockquote>
We've had a group discussion about how our work would be affected by free
threading. Our key conclusion is that merging nogil will set back our
current results by a significant amount of time, and in addition will
reduce our velocity in the future. We don't see this as a reason to reject
nogil – it's just a new set of problems we would have to overcome, and we
expect that our ultimate design would be quite different as a result. But
there is a significant cost, and it's not a one-time cost. We could use
help from someone (Sam?) who has experience thinking about the problems
posed by the new environment. 
<p>
[...] In the meantime we're treading water, unsure whether to put our
efforts in continuing with the current plan, or in designing a new,
thread-safe optimization architecture. 
</p></blockquote>


<h4>Fast, free threading</h4>

<p>
The next day, Shannon <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903">started
a new thread</a> (titled: "A fast, free threading Python") that described
three possible options for a way forward.  It started with a lengthy
description of the tradeoffs for optimization of a dynamic language like
Python. Of the three aspects that he thinks need to be considered,
single-threaded performance, parallelism, and mutability, the last has
mostly been glossed over in earlier discussions, "<q>but it is key</q>":
</p><blockquote>
It isn't quite:
<blockquote>
    Performance, parallelism, mutability: pick two.
</blockquote>
but more like:
<blockquote>
    Performance, parallelism, mutability: pick one to restrict.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>
He also cautioned that there are some unknowns:
</p><blockquote>
Performing the optimizations necessary to make Python fast in a
free-threading environment will need some original research. That makes it
more costly and a lot more risky. 
</blockquote>


<p>
The options for the steering council amount to choosing a fast
single-threaded interpreter as currently planned, a no-GIL free-threading
interpreter with an unknown (but non-zero) impact on single-threaded
performance, or both at the same time.  His preference is for both,
but he is concerned that the council might choose no-GIL without also
committing to the rest of the work needed:
</p><blockquote>
Please don't choose option 2 [no-GIL] hoping that we will get option 3
[both], because 
"someone will sort out the performance issue". They won't, unless the
resources are there. 
<p>
If we must choose option 1 [current Faster CPython plans] or 2, then I
think it has to be option 1. 
It gives us a speedup at much lower cost in CPUs and energy,
by doing things more efficiently rather than just throwing lots of cores at
the problem. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Marc-André Lemburg <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/2">asked</a>
about a phased approach, where, effectively, GIL or no-GIL were chosen at
the command line; over time, the two could slowly be merged. "<q>Or would
this not be feasible because the 'slow merge' would actually require
redesigning the whole specialization approach?</q>"  Smith <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/30">replied</a> 
that he thinks that is more or less what PEP&nbsp;703 is proposing; even
though Shannon basically recommended against it, Smith thinks pursuing
both at once is possible:
</p><blockquote>
I'd more or less expect work on specialization for to proceed in parallel
without worrying if those benefits cannot yet be available in a free
threaded build for a few of releases. Turning it mostly into an additional
code maintenance and test matrix burden on the CPython core dev side to
keep both our still-primary single threaded GIL based interpreter and the
experimental free threaded build working. 
<p>
I figure this is basically exactly what Mark claims <i>not</i> to
want. Presumably 
due to the interim added build and maintenance complexity. But also seems
like the most likely way to get to his "both" option 3 that I suspect we
all <i>magically wish would just happen</i>. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Smith <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/31">followed
that up</a> by noting that free threading will need to addressed at some
point; even if the Faster CPython plans work out and Python&nbsp;3.15 is
five times faster than Python&nbsp;3.10, nobody will "<q>be satisfied at 'just
5x' in the end</q>".   Van Rossum <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/34">agreed</a>,
but was also concerned that the council "<q>might be betting on hope as a
strategy</q>" by choosing no-GIL and hoping for the best.
</p><blockquote>
Like Mark, I hope that you're choosing (3) – like Mark says, it's clearly
the best option. But we will need to be honest about it, and accept that we
need more resources to improve single-threaded performance. (And, as I
believe someone already pointed out, it will also be harder to do future
maintenance on CPython's C code, since so much of it is now exposed to
potential race conditions. This is a problem for a language that's for a
large part maintained by volunteers.) 
</blockquote>


<p>
The talk of "more resources" led Itamar Oren to 
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/41">wonder</a>
what that means: "<q>It's not clear to me to what extent the SC
[steering council] is in a position to tie PEP acceptance or rejection to
allocation of funding.</q>"  Van Rossum <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/45">replied</a>
that Microsoft was committed to continue funding the team and that "<q>our
charter 
is not limited to single-threaded performance work</q>", but that there is
extra work to do in a no-GIL world:
</p><blockquote>
Meanwhile, we can start adapting the specialization and optimization work
to a no-GIL world, with the goal of obtaining Mark's Option 3 (free
threading and faster per-thread performance). Ideally we would reach a
state where we can make no-GIL the one and only build mode without a drop
in single-threaded performance (important for apps that haven't been
re-architected, e.g. apps that currently use multi-processing, or
algorithms that are hard to parallelize). 
<p>
It is this latter step (getting to Option 3) that requires extra resources
– for example, it would be great if Meta or another tech company could
spare some engineers with established CPython internals experience to help
the core dev team with this work.
</p><p>
Finally, I want to re-emphasize that while Microsoft has a team using the
Faster CPython moniker, we don't intend to own CPython performance – we
believe in good citizenship and want to contribute in a way that puts our
skills and experience to the best possible use for the Python community. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Van Rossum did not just choose Meta out of a hat, here; Gross works for the
company, which presumably funded his no-GIL work, and the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder">Cinder</a> CPython fork
is maintained by a team at Meta.  Carl Meyer <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/46">said</a>
that he expected the Cinder team to work on no-GIL Python.  In fact, on
July&nbsp;7, Meyer <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/99">announced</a>
that Meta would fund work on the no-GIL interpreter:
</p><blockquote>
If PEP 703 is accepted, Meta can commit to support in the form of three
engineer-years (from engineers experienced working in CPython internals)
between the acceptance of PEP 703 and the end of 2025, to collaborate with
the core dev team on landing the PEP 703 implementation smoothly in CPython
and on ongoing improvements to the compatibility and performance of nogil
CPython. 
</blockquote>


<p>
On July 19, Anaconda <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606/121">followed
suit</a>. Stan Seibert said that the company would fund work on the
"<q>packaging challenges that will be associated with adopting PEP 703,
including any work on pip, cibuildwheel, and conda-forge that will be
needed to get nogil-compatible packages into the hands of the Python
community</q>".  Some of that funding commitment likely helped the council
reach a verdict, but the results of a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/poll-feedback-to-the-sc-on-making-cpython-free-threaded-and-pep-703/28540">core-developer
poll on no-GIL</a> also pushed the council in the direction of accepting the
PEP.   That poll showed 87% of 46 voters thought that free-threaded Python
should be actively pursued and 63% of 38 voters said that they were willing
to help support and maintain a no-GIL Python based on PEP&nbsp;703.
</p>

<h4>Steering council decision</h4>

<p>
On July 28, council member Thomas Wouters <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-steering-council-notice-about-pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython/30474">announced</a>
that the council would be accepting PEP&nbsp;703, though it was "<q>still
working on the acceptance details</q>".  The idea would be to introduce the
no-GIL version of the interpreter in order to give everyone a chance to
figure out what pieces are missing, so that they can be filled in before
no-GIL becomes the default and, eventually, the only, version of Python.
The time frame for that transition is estimated to be around five years,
but there will be no repeat of earlier mistakes:
</p><blockquote>
We do not want another Python 3 situation, so any changes in third-party
code needed to accommodate no-GIL builds should just work in with-GIL
builds (although backward compatibility with older Python versions will
still need to be addressed). This is not Python 4. We are still considering
the requirements we want to place on ABI compatibility and other details
for the two builds and the effect on backward compatibility. 
</blockquote>


<p>
As was noted in the various discussions, there is more to removing the GIL
than simply adopting a PEP.  Wouters made it clear that the core developers
will need to gain experience with no-GIL Python so that they can lead the
rest of the community:
</p><blockquote>
We will probably need to figure out new C APIs and Python APIs as we sort
out thread safety in existing code. We also need to bring along the rest of
the Python community as we gain those insights and make sure the changes we
want to make, and the changes we want them to make, are palatable. 
</blockquote>


<p>
If the Python community finds that the switch is "<q>just
going to be too disruptive for too little gain</q>", the council wants to
be able to change its mind anytime before declaring no-GIL as the default
mode for the language.  He outlined the steps that the council sees,
starting with a short-term (perhaps for Python&nbsp;3.13, which is due in
October 2024) experimental no-GIL build of the interpreter that core
developers and others can try out.  In the medium term, no-GIL would be a
supported option, but not the default; when that happens depends a lot on
how quickly the community adopts and supports the no-GIL build.  In the
long term, 
no-GIL would be the default build and the GIL would be completely excised
("<q>without unnecessarily breaking backward compatibility</q>").   Along
the way, periodic reviews will be needed:
</p><blockquote>
Throughout the process we (the core devs, not just the SC) will need to
re-evaluate the progress and the suggested timelines. We don't want this to
turn into another ten year backward compatibility struggle, and we want to
be able to call off PEP 703 and find another solution if it looks to become
problematic, and so we need to regularly check that the continued work is
worth it. 
</blockquote>


<p>
As might be guessed, that spawned multiple congratulatory and
excited-for-the-future responses, though there are a few who think that
keeping the GIL would be a better choice for the language.  The
announcement presumably 
also sent the Faster CPython folks back to their drawing boards; though
there were some accusations of turf wars in the discussions, that did not
really seem to be the case.  The Faster CPython team simply wanted to
ensure that all of the costs were taken into consideration;  overall, the
team seems quite excited to work on surmounting the challenges of producing
a no-GIL 
interpreter, with minimal (or, ideally, no) performance impact on
single-threaded 
code.
</p>

<p>
It is quite a turning point in the history of the language, but the work is
(obviously) not done yet.  There is a huge amount of researching, coding,
testing, experimenting,
documenting, and so on between here and a no-GIL-only version of the language
in, say, Python&nbsp;3.17 in October&nbsp;2028. One guesses that the work
will not be done, then, either—there will be more optimizations to be
found and applied if there is still funding available to do so.
Meanwhile, we have yet to dig into the details of the PEP itself; that will
come soon. We will be keeping an eye on the no-GIL development process as
it plays 
out over the coming years as well.

Five years later, here we go again. </p><p> Before the delisting, EQT Private Equity plans to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to SUSE’s remaining shareholders. Marcel has committed to pay a price of EUR 16.00 per SUSE share, less the gross amount per share of an interim dividend paid by SUSE. This represents a 67% premium on SUSE’s closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023. </p><p> Both SUSE’s Management and Supervisory Boards have expressed support for the strategic opportunity presented by this delisting. They believe that it will enable SUSE to concentrate on its operational priorities and the execution of its long-term strategy without the pressure of public markets. </p><p> To facilitate the transaction, SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel, which includes provisions for paying the interim dividend. This interim dividend, to be paid to all shareholders before the settlement of the offer, will assist Marcel in financing its purchase of SUSE shares under the offer and covering specific transaction costs. </p><p> “The strategic opportunity of taking the company private gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE. “Our partnership with EQT Private Equity in a private setting has been fruitful before, and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration.” </p><p> The offer document will be published by Marcel soon, initiating an acceptance period of at least four weeks. Settlement of the offer is anticipated to occur in the first half of October 2023. Subsequently, an extraordinary general meeting of SUSE is expected to be held in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Afterward, the company will be taken private. </p><p> Under the terms of the TFA, SUSE is committed to declaring and paying an interim dividend to all shareholders, regardless of whether they accept the offer. This dividend will be funded through a combination of SUSE’s existing cash and additional borrowing, which is not expected to exceed EUR 500 million. </p><p> There is, however, no obligation for shareholders to accept the offer. EQT Private Equity assures stock owners that it won't pursue a squeeze-out. Therefore, shareholders desiring to remain invested in SUSE in its new private setting will have the option to do so. </p><p> As usual, this transaction is subject to various conditions, including receipt by Marcel of an interim dividend for the SUSE shares held by it, which must be sufficient to fund the offer price for all tendered SUSE shares and certain transaction costs. </p><p> Considering the nature of the deal and Marcel's dominating stock position, I've no doubt this deal will go through. What that will mean for SUSE remains to be seen. I will say, though, that SUSE manages to keep going despite one ownership and management change after another. I'm sure it will make it through this one too. </p><p><span><b>Noteworthy Linux and open-source stories:</b></span></p><div><ul><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.36u8QeHTpms79eRxuzldUGjekXgqZX43BE6CK926niI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">New CrossOver 23 out for better Windows gameplay on MacOS, ChromeOS, and Linux</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.fRcjTQH7H0GScCXWH8-0F_qDYl-E7NFNW9-wgvBGvMU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">HashiCorp Abandons Open Source for Business Source License</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.wKzq21AH1HBh4UQCvtoESpg5V81wvizO94wN5BeCTpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">AMD and Intel CPU security bugs bring Linux patches</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

        Abstract
        
      </h2>
      
        
          
            <p>
      
      Oxalate nephropathy is an uncommon condition that causes acute kidney injury with the potential for progression to end-stage renal disease. Diagnosis is based on the kidney biopsy findings of abundant polarizable calcium oxalate crystals in the epithelium and lumen of renal tubules. We report a case of acute oxalate nephropathy in a 65-year-old woman, temporally associated with the consumption of an oxalate-rich green smoothie juice "cleanse" prepared from juicing oxalate-rich green leafy vegetables and fruits. Predisposing factors included a remote history of gastric bypass and recent prolonged antibiotic therapy. She had normal kidney function before using the cleanse and developed acute kidney injury that progressed to end-stage renal disease. Consumption of such juice cleanses increases oxalate absorption, causing hyperoxaluria and acute oxalate nephropathy in patients with predisposing risk factors. Given the increasing popularity of juice cleanses, it is important that both patients and physicians have greater awareness of the potential for acute oxalate nephropathy in susceptible individuals with risk factors such as chronic kidney disease, gastric bypass, and antibiotic use.

                    manipulate arbitrary objects in diverse settings has been a distant goal for several decades. This
                    is in-part because of the paucity of diverse robotics datasets to train such agents, at the same

                    <p>
                        Building a robotic agent that can generalize to many different scenarios requires a dataset with broad coverage. With the recognition that scaling efforts will generally help (e.g. <a href="https://robotics-transformer1.github.io/">RT-1</a> presents results with ~130,000 robot trajectories), our goal is to understand the principles of <strong> efficiency </strong> and <strong> generalization</strong> in learning system under a <strong>data budget</strong>. Low data regimes often results in over-fitting. Our main aim is to thus develop a powerful paradigms that can learn a generalizable universal policy while avoiding overfitting in this low-data regime.

                    <p>
                        The dataset <strong>RoboSet(MT-ACT)</strong> used for training RoboAgent consists of merely 7,500 trajectories (18x less data than RT1). The dataset was collected ahead of time, and was kept frozen. It consists of high quality (mostly successful) trajectories collected using human teleoperation on commodity robotics hardware (<a href="https://www.franka.de/">Franka-Emika robots</a> with <a href="https://robotiq.com/products/2f85-140-adaptive-robot-gripper">Robotiq gripper</a>) across multiple tasks and scenes.

                        RoboSet(MT-ACT) <strong>sparsely</strong> covers 12 unique skills in a few different contexts. It was collected by dividing everyday kitchen activities (e.g. making tea, baking) into different sub-tasks, each representing a unique skill. The dataset includes common pick-place skills but also includes contact-rich skills such as <em>wipe, cap</em> as well as skills involving articulated objects.

                        In addition to the RoboSet(MT-ACT) we use for training RoboAgent, we are also releasing <a href="https://robopen.github.io/robopen.github.io/roboset">RoboSet</a> a much larger dataset collected over the course of a few related project containing a total of 100,050 trajectories, including non-kitchen scenes. <strong>We are open-sourcing our entire <a href="https://robopen.github.io/robopen.github.io/roboset">RoboSet</a></strong> to facilitate and accelerate open-source research in robot-learning.

                    <h2> MT-ACT: Multi-Task Action Chunking Transformer</h2>

                    <div><p>
                        RoboAgent builds on two critical insights to learn generalizable policies in low-data regimes. It leverages world priors from foundation models to avoid mode collapse and a novel efficient policy representations capable of ingesting highly multi-modal data.
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Semantic Augmentations:</strong> RoboAgent injects world priors from existing foundation models by creating semantic augmentations of the RoboSet(MT-ACT). The resulting dataset multiplies robots experiences with world priors at no extra human/robot cost. We use <a href="https://segment-anything.com/">SAM</a> to segment target objects and semantically augment them to different objects with shape, color, texture variations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Efficient Policy Representation:</strong> The resulting dataset is heavily multi-modal and contains a rich diversity of skills, tasks, and scenarios. We adapt <a href="https://tonyzhaozh.github.io/aloha/">action-chunking</a> to multi-task settings to develop <strong>MT-ACT</strong> -- a novel efficient policy representation that can ingest highly multi-modal dataset while avoiding over-fitting in low data budget settings.

                                Figure on the right compares our proposed MT-ACT policy representation against several imitation learning architectures. For this result we use environment variations that include object pose changes and some lighting changes only. Somewhat similar to previous works, we refer to this as L1-generalization. From our results we can clearly see that using action-chunking to model sub-trajectories significantly outperforms all baselines, thereby reinforcing the effectiveness of our proposed policy representation for sample efficient learning.

                                Above figure shows the different levels of generalization we test our approach on.
                                We visualize levels of generalization, L1 with object pose changes, L2
                                with diverse table backgrounds and distractors and L3 with novel skill-object
                                combinations. Next we show how each method performs on these levels of generalization. In a rigorous evaluation study under, we observe that MT-ACT significantly outperforms all other
                                methods especially on harder generalization levels (L3).

                                Next we evaluate how RoboAgent performs with increasing levels of semantic augmentations.
                                We evaluate this on one activity (5-skills). Below figure shows that with increased data
                                (i.e. more augmentations per frame)
                                the performance significantly improves across all generalization levels. Importantly,
                                the performance increase is much larger for the harder tasks (L3 generalization).

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">By far, the greatest threat to the submarine cables connecting the global internet is human maritime activity. This usually involves seafaring vessels breaking submarine cables either by snagging them during fishing operations (especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trawling" rel="noopener" target="_blank">trawling</a>) or by inadvertently dragging their anchors along the seafloor, the cause of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_submarine_cable_disruption" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2008 submarine cable cuts</a> in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">But after marine activity, the next biggest category of threat consists of natural causes — and let me emphasize, I’m <em>not</em> talking about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/its-official-sharks-no-longer-a-threat-to-subsea-internet-cables/amp/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sharks biting cables</a>. On numerous occasions, undersea landslides and earthquakes have damaged cables laying on the seafloor.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">In December 2006, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29connect.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">large earthquake</a> off the southern coast of Taiwan crippled internet communications in East Asia by rupturing numerous submarine cables.

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">During a panel at the Suboptic 2013 submarine cable conference in Paris, the audience listened in rapt attention as a speaker from Japan described the efforts to repair submarine cables damaged by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Great East Japan Earthquake</a> two years earlier. According to him, one of the cables had been dragged <em>over a kilometer</em> by an undersea landslide triggered by the powerful earthquake. Additionally, the sequence in which the cables were to be restored was driven, not by usual contractual priorities, but by where the cable ship could safely navigate while avoiding the radiation cloud emanating from the crippled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant</a>.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">In another case, a decade ago, I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910063825/http://research.dyn.com/2013/02/faraway-fallout-from-black-sea/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote about</a> an undersea earthquake in the Black Sea that unexpectedly impacted Iranian transit. It was initially reported that <em><a href="https://en.trend.az/regions/scaucasus/georgia/2105346.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an underwater volcano</a></em> had severed a submarine cable in the Black Sea running between Poti, Georgia, and Sochi, Russia. This caught the attention of WIRED magazine’s resident geologist, who dutifully <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/01/submarine-eruption-in-the-black-sea-off-georgia-not-likely/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that there were no volcanoes in the Black Sea. As was later <a href="https://ictna.ir/id/052590/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported in the Iranian press</a>, it was an earthquake that led to the failure of the cable — likely by triggering another underwater landslide.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Finally, this isn’t the first time that these cables (SAT-3 and WACS) have been downed by undersea landslides in the Congo Canyon. A study, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/study-finds-mudslides-caused-by-river-flooding-can-damage-subsea-cable-damage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published in June 2021</a>, described how these cables had suffered breaks in 2020 due to, in one instance, “an exceptionally large and powerful submarine mudslide that originated at the mouth of the Congo River.”</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Make no mistake; the seafloor can be a dangerous place.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Shifting back to the cable cuts in Africa, let’s begin by looking at the impact on cloud connectivity.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Last year, a terrestrial cable cut in Egypt temporarily knocked out service for multiple submarine cables, a <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/outage-in-egypt-impacted-aws-gcp-and-azure-interregional-connectivity/">situation I analyzed</a> by illustrating the impact on <em>internal</em> connectivity for the three major public cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Well, this cable incident was no different, proving once again that even the big hyperscalers must rely on the same submarine cable infrastructure as everybody else.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Below is a screenshot of our performance monitoring from <code>af-south-1</code>, AWS’s region in Cape Town, South Africa, to <code>eu-west-2</code> in London, England. It shows an increase in latency, from 150 to 195 ms, as AWS’s traffic is diverted to a backup route, presumably with a longer geographic distance, to reach London in this example.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Conversely, we can also see a <em>drop</em> in latency from af-south-1 to some points in Asia. The screenshot below shows a latency decrease from 386 to 304 ms from Cape Town to Seoul at 17:30 UTC, when the WACS cable was cut.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">While this may seem counterintuitive, this is a phenomenon I have often encountered when analyzing submarine cable cuts — see slide 10 in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougmadory/details/featured/50016397/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAABgDfMBQqg6K3WmEobvLYAvoetjdTSF-R0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my presentation</a> at Suboptic 2013. Essentially a higher latency route becomes unavailable, and traffic is forced to go a more direct path.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Why would traffic be using the higher latency path in the first place? What you can’t see in these visualizations are factors like cost. The business case for maintaining the lowest possible latency between Cape Town and Seoul may not justify a higher-cost but lower-latency route.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">We observed a drop in traffic volume as seen in our aggregate NetFlow to the affected countries following the cable cuts. Let’s take a closer look at the impacts in the largest affected market, South Africa. According to our data, the largest traffic destination in South Africa is Telkom SA (AS37457), who experienced a 20% drop in peak traffic following the cuts.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Namibia was another country in southwest Africa impacted by these cable cuts. When WACS was cut at 17:30 UTC, Telecom Namibia (AS20459) lost transit from Cogent (AS174) and BICS (AS6774). Two hours later, the Namibian incumbent partially restored service using transit from Angola to the south.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Telecom Namibia, for example, lost its two main transit providers Cogent (AS174) and BICS (AS6774) as a result of the WACS cable cut.

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Since KMI is strictly based on interpreting BGP data, let’s see what an individual route change looked like. Let’s take this Telecom Namibia route as an example: 41.205.128.0/19.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">When we take the upstream view from AS20459, we can see that, like the NetFlow-based graphic above, Telecom Namibia lost AS174 and AS6774 at around 17:30 UTC and gained transit from AS37468 at 22:00 UTC on August 6. In the interim, the reachability of the route became very low, along with traffic reaching its destination.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">To make up for the loss of capacity, traffic has been shifted to other submarine cables, such as Google’s new <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/equiano" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Equiano cable</a>, which was activated earlier this year. Like WACS and SAT-3, Equiano also runs along the west coast of Africa, but was not impacted by the undersea landslide earlier this month. This fact was highlighted by Equiano client Liquid Dataport (formerly Liquid Telecom) in a <a href="https://liquid.tech/about-us/news/liquid-dataport-subsea-cables/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> last week. Liquid has managed to use their service on Equiano to fill the gaps left by the loss of WACS and SAT-3.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT shows a significant and systemic left-wing bias, according to a new study by the University of East Anglia (UEA).</p><div><p> The team of researchers in the UK and Brazil developed a rigorous new method to check for political bias.</p><p>  Published today in the journal Public Choice, the findings show that ChatGPT’s responses favour the Democrats in the US, the Labour Party in the UK, and in Brazil President Lula da Silva of the Workers’ Party.</p><p>  Concerns of an inbuilt political bias in ChatGPT have been raised previously but this is the first largescale study using a consistent, evidenced-based analysis.</p><p>  Lead author <a href="https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/fabio-motoki" target="_blank">Dr Fabio Motoki</a>, of <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/norwich-business-school" target="_blank">Norwich Business School</a> at the University of East Anglia, said: “With the growing use by the public of AI-powered systems to find out facts and create new content, it is important that the output of popular platforms such as ChatGPT is as impartial as possible.</p><p>  “The presence of political bias can influence user views and has potential implications for political and electoral processes.</p><p>  “Our findings reinforce concerns that AI systems could replicate, or even amplify, existing challenges posed by the Internet and social media.”</p><p>  The researchers developed an innovative new method to test for ChatGPT’s political neutrality.</p><p>  The platform was asked to impersonate individuals from across the political spectrum while answering a series of more than 60 ideological questions.</p><p>  The responses were then compared with the platform’s default answers to the same set of questions – allowing the researchers to measure the degree to which ChatGPT’s responses were associated with a particular political stance.</p><p>  To overcome difficulties caused by the inherent randomness of ‘large language models’ that power AI platforms such as ChatGPT, each question was asked 100 times and the different responses collected. These multiple responses were then put through a 1000-repetition ‘bootstrap’ (a method of re-sampling the original data) to further increase the reliability of the inferences drawn from the generated text.</p><p>  “We created this procedure because conducting a single round of testing is not enough,” said co-author Victor Rodrigues. “Due to the model’s randomness, even when impersonating a Democrat, sometimes ChatGPT answers would lean towards the right of the political spectrum.”</p><p>  A number of further tests were undertaken to ensure the method was as rigorous as possible. In a ‘dose-response test’ ChatGPT was asked to impersonate radical political positions. In a ‘placebo test’ it was asked politically-neutral questions. And in a ‘profession-politics alignment test’ it was asked to impersonate different types of professionals.</p><p>  “We hope that our method will aid scrutiny and regulation of these rapidly developing technologies,” said co-author Dr Pinho Neto. “By enabling the detection and correction of LLM biases, we aim to promote transparency, accountability, and public trust in this technology,” he added.</p><p>  The unique new analysis tool created by the project would be freely available and relatively simple for members of the public to use, thereby “democratising oversight,” said Dr Motoki. As well as checking for political bias, the tool can be used to measure other types of biases in ChatGPT’s responses.</p><p>  While the research project did not set out to determine the reasons for the political bias, the findings did point towards two potential sources.</p><p>  The first was the training dataset – which may have biases within it, or added to it by the human developers, which the developers’ ‘cleaning’ procedure had failed to remove. The second potential source was the algorithm itself, which may be amplifying existing biases in the training data.</p><p>  The research was undertaken by Dr Fabio Motoki (Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia), Dr Valdemar Pinho Neto (EPGE Brazilian School of Economics and Finance - FGV EPGE, and Center for Empirical Studies in Economics - FGV CESE), and Victor Rodrigues (Nova Educação).</p><p>  ‘More Human than Human: Measuring ChatGPT Political Bias’ is published by Public Choice.&nbsp;</p><p>  This publication is based on research carried out in Spring 2023 using version 3.5 of ChatGPT and questions devised by The Political Compass.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>This is based on an internal quip doc I wrote up about careful communication in the context of rebuilding trust. I got a couple requests to turn it into a blog post for sharing purposes; here you go.🌈✨🥂</p>
<p>In this doc I mention <a href="http://twitter.com/cyen">Christine</a>, my wonderful, brilliant cofounder and CEO, and the time (years ago) when our relationship had broken down completely, forcing us to rebuild our trust from the ground up.</p>
<p>(Cofounder relationships can be hard. They are a lot like marriages; in their difficulty and intensity, yes, but also in that when you’re doing it with the right person, it’s all worth it. 💜)</p>
<h3>Tips for Careful Communication</h3>
<p>When a relationship has very little trust, you tend to interpret everything someone says in the worst possible light, or you may hear hostility, contempt, or dismissiveness where none exists. On the other side of the exchange, the conversation becomes a minefield, where it feels like everything you say gets misinterpreted or turned against you no matter how careful you are trying to be. This can turn into a death spiral of trust where every interaction ends up with each of you hardening against each other a little more and filing away ever more wounds and slights. 💔</p>
<p>Yet you HAVE to communicate in order to work together! You <i>have</i> to be able to ask for things and give feedback.</p>
<p>The way trust gets rebuilt is by ✨small, positive interactions✨. If you’re in a trust hole, you can’t hear them clearly, and they can’t hear you (or your intent) clearly. So you have to bend over backwards to overcommunicate and overcompensate.</p>
<p>There are lots of books out there on how to talk about hard topics. (We actually include a copy of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822">Crucial Conversations</a>” in every new employee packet.) They are all pretty darn cheesy, but it’s worth reading at least one of them.</p>
<p>I’m not going to try and cover all of that territory. What follows is a very subjective list of tactics that worked for Christine and me when we were digging our way out of a massive trust deficit. Power dynamics can admittedly make things more difficult, but the mechanics are the same.</p>
<h3>Acknowledge it is hard beforehand:</h3>
<p>“I want to say something, but I am having a hard time with it.”<br>
“I have something to say, but I don’t know how you’ll take it.”<br>
“I need to tell you something and I am anxious about your reaction.”</p>
<p>What this does: forces you to slow down and be intentional about the words you’re going to use. It gives the other person a heads up that this was hard for you to say. Most of all, it shows that you <em>do care</em> about their feelings, and <em>are trying</em> to do your best for them (even if you whiff the landing).</p>
<h3>… or check in afterwards.</h3>
<p>“I’m not sure how that came across. Is there a better way I could have phrased it?”<br>
“In my head that sounded like a compliment…how did you hear it?”<br>
“Did that sound overly critical? I’m not trying to dwell on the past, but I could use your help in figuring out a better way.”</p>
<p>It’s okay if it’s minutes or hours or days later; if it’s still eating at you, ✨<i>clear the fucking air</i>.✨</p>
<h3>Speak tentatively.</h3>
<p>“Speak tentatively” is the exact opposite of the advice that people (especially women) tend to get in business. But it’s actually super helpful when the relationship is frayed because you are explicitly allowing that they may have a different perception, and making it safer to share it.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, it looks like these results might be missing some data… do you see the same thing?” opens the door for a friendly conversation based on concrete outcomes, whereas “You’re missing data” might sound accusatory and trigger fear and defensiveness.</p>
<h3>Try to sound friendly.</h3>
<p>Say “please” and “thank you” a lot. Add buffer words like “Hey there”, or “Good morning!” or “lol”. Even just using 🌱emojis🍃 will soften your response to an almost unsettling degree. This may seem almost insultingly simple, but it works. When trust is low, the lack of frills can easily be read as brusque or rude.</p>
<h3>Take a breath.</h3>
<p>If you are experiencing a physical panic response (sweating, heart racing, etc), announce that you need a few minutes before responding. Compose yourself. Firing off a reply while you are in fight-or-flight mode <em>reliably</em> leads to unintentional escalations.</p>
<p>If you need to take a few beats to read and process, <em>take the time</em>. But empty silence can also generate anxiety 🙂 so maybe say <i>something</i> to indicate “I’m listening, but I need a minute to absorb what you said”, or “I’m still processing”. (We often use “whoa…” as shorthand for this.)</p>
<p>(Alternately, if you find yourself <b>really pissed</b>, “whoa” becomes a great placeholder for yourself to get yourself under control 😬 before saying something you’ll regret having to deal with later.)</p>
<h3>“The story in my head”.</h3>
<p>When you are in a state where you are assuming the worst of someone and reading hostile intent into their words or actions, try to check yourself on those assumptions.</p>
<p>Repeat the words or behaviors back to them along with your interpretation, like: “The story in my head is that you asked me to send that status email because you don’t trust me to have done the work, or maybe even gathering evidence that I am not performing for a PIP.” This gives them the opportunity to reply and clarify what they actually meant.</p>
<h3>Engineer positive interactions, <span>even if</span> you have to invent them.</h3>
<p>Relationship experts say that there’s a magic ratio for happy, healthy relationships, which is at least<b>&nbsp;five positive interactions </b>for every<b> one negative interaction</b>. If you only interact with the people you have difficult relationships when you have something difficult to say, you are <em>always going to dread it</em>. Forever.</p>
<p>It might seem artificial at first, but look for chances to have any sort of positive interactions, and <em>seize them</em>.</p>
<h3>Communicate positive intent.</h3>
<p>In a low trust environment, you can assume everything you say will be read with a voice that is menacing, dismissive or sneering. It behooves you to pay extra attention to tone and voice, and to add extra words that overcommunicate your intended meaning. A neutral statement like “That number seems low”, or “Why is that number low?” will come out sounding brusque and accusatory, e.g. <i>why isn’t that number growing? it’s your fault, you should know this, I blame you, you’re bad at your job.</i> Not might: <i>it will</i>. Try to immunize your communication from distortion by saying things like,</p>
<p>“Hey, I know this just got dropped in your lap, but do you have any idea why this number is so low?”<br>
“This number seems lower than usual. I’m wondering if it’s due to this other thing we tried. Do you have any better ideas?”<br>
“I know it isn’t exactly in your wheel house, but can you help me understand this?”<br>
“I’m new to this system and still trying to figure out how it works. Should this number be going down like this?”</p>
<p>It may seem excessive and time consuming, but it will save you time and effort overall because you will have fewer miscommunications to debug. ☺️</p>
<h3>Give people the opening&nbsp;to do better.</h3>
<p>We tend to make up our minds about people very quickly, and see them through that lens from then on. It takes work to open our selves up again.</p>
<p>“Assume positive intent” is a laudable goal, but in practice falls short. If every word someone says sounds accusatory or patronizing to you, what are you supposed to do with that advice? Just pretend you don’t hear it, or tell yourself they mean well? That’s not sustainable; your anger will only build up.</p>
<p>But if you can hold just enough space for the idea that they <i>might</i> mean well, then you can give them the opportunity to clarify (and hopefully use different words next time). Like,</p>
<p>Person A: “Why is that number low?”<br>
Person B: “I’m not sure.”<br>
(pause)<br>
Person B: “…. Hey, sorry to interrupt, but the story in my head is that you think owning that number is part of my job, and now you’re upset with me, or you think I’m incompetent at my job.”<br>
Person A: “OMG no, not at all. I’m just trying to figure out who understands this part of the system, since it seems like none of us do! 😃 Sorry for stressing you out!”</p>
<p>and maybe next time it will start off like…</p>
<p>Person A: “Hey, do you have any idea why this number is low? It’s a mystery … nobody I’ve talked to yet seems to know.” 🙂</p>
<h3>Remember the handicaps, value the effort.</h3>
<p>Ever meet someone you didn’t like online, and realize they’re terrific in person? Online communication loses sooooo much in transit. Christine and I know each other extremely well, and <i>still</i> sometimes we realize we’re reading way too much into each other’s written words. That’s when we try to remember to move it to “mouth words”, aka zoom or phone. Not as good as in person, but eons better than text.</p>
<p>Once you’ve met someone in person, it’s usually easier to read their written words in their voice, too.</p>
<p>Some people just aren’t great at written communication. Some people have neurodiversities that make it difficult for them to hear tone. Some people have English as a second language. And so on. Do give points for effort; if they’re trying, obviously, they care about your experience.</p>
<p>To the best of your ability, try to resist reading layers of meaning into textual communication; keep it simple, overcommunicate intent, and <i>ask for clarity</i>. And if someone is asking you for clarity, <i>help them do a better job for you.</i></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LUXEMBOURG</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>SUSE®, </span></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>the company behind SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), Rancher and NeuVector and a global leader in enterprise open source solutions, is announcing that its majority shareholder </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>Marcel LUX III SARL (Marcel) </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>intends to take the company private by delisting it from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange via a merger into an unlisted Luxembourg entity in the legal form of an S.A.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>Marcel</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>, a holding company that is legally controlled by fund entities of the EQT VIII fund (referred to herein, together with Marcel, as EQT Private Equity), which in turn are managed and legally controlled by affiliates of EQT AB with its registered seat in Stockholm, Sweden, holds approximately 79% of the shares in SUSE.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>EQT Private Equity has announced its intention to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to the other shareholders of SUSE (Offer) to buy their shares prior to the delisting. The offer price per SUSE share to be paid by Marcel will be EUR 16.00 less the gross amount per SUSE share of an interim dividend to be paid by SUSE to all shareholders. EUR 16.00 represents a premium of approximately 67 percent on the XETRA closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>SUSE’s Management Board and Supervisory Board support the strategic opportunity from delisting of the company</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> as it will allow SUSE to focus fully on its operational priorities and execution of its long-term strategy. To this end SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel to facilitate the transaction, including through paying the interim dividend. The interim dividend will be paid to all shareholders prior to the settlement of the Offer and will allow Marcel to finance its purchase of SUSE shares under the Offer and certain transaction costs incurred by it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The interim dividend amount (and therefore the offer price) will only be determined after the end of the acceptance period based on the acceptance ratio for the Offer. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>EQT Private Equity </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>has underscored its commitment to supporting the company strategically and financially, and to co-operate closely with SUSE’s CEO and his leadership team.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I believe in the strategic opportunity of taking the company private – it gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE. “EQT Private Equity’s and SUSE’s partnership in a private setting has been fruitful before and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration”.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The transaction timetable:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The offer document for the Offer will be published by Marcel in due course, followed by an acceptance period of at least four weeks. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Settlement of the Offer is expected to occur in the first half of October 2023.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Following the settlement of the Offer, an extraordinary general meeting of SUSE to be held in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 will resolve on SUSE’s merger with an unlisted Luxembourg entity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>This will result in SUSE’s delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The transaction structure: </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>SUSE has entered into a TFA with Marcel.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Under the terms of the TFA, SUSE has committed to declare and pay an interim dividend to all shareholders irrespective of whether they accept the Offer or not. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The interim dividend per SUSE share will be determined and is payable after the expiry of the Offer acceptance period.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The payment of the interim dividend will be funded by SUSE through a combination of existing cash and additional borrowing. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Any additional borrowing will be in the form of loans taken out by companies of the SUSE group to a maximum of EUR 500 million. The amount of the loans taken out will only be determined after the expiry of the Offer acceptance period.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>There is no obligation for shareholders to accept the Offer. EQT Private Equity does not intend to pursue a squeeze-out. Therefore, shareholders who wish to stay invested in SUSE in a private setting may do so.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>For illustrative purposes, the table below sets out the gross interim dividend amount per share and other key parameters for different hypothetical acceptance ratios</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> based on the current number of outstanding SUSE shares.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>I have struggled, literally for years, with Quicken being dog slow to start. It could take 30+ seconds to start. From what I could remember, this problem has existed since I first installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>There were some other other small applications that were also doggedly slow to start. Further, changing font properties of a task in outlook was very slow too. It could take 10+ seconds for the font-properties window to fully populate. THAT should have been my clue as to the problem, but sadly I didn’t yet put 2+2 together.</p>
<p>To compound the problem, once quicken and the other apps were started the first time, they would restart fast for quite some time. You had to walk away from the computer for several hours before the problem would appear again.</p>
<p>I just accepted that Win10 was a pile of crap which, based on past versions of Windows, was a reasonable explanation. Another irritating Windows problem I just had to live with it.</p>
<p>Several years later, I had to make an extended road trip so I loaded my Win10 laptop up with Quicken, Outlook, and the various apps I have to use daily. Lo and behold Quicken started fast EVERY time, every day. OK, I realized the problem wasn’t just Win10 but something about that PC as well.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Aug 2021, I sat down and tried to figure out exactly what the issue was. Looking at my notes from those days, I tried re-installing quicken, experimenting with DNS servers, capturing network packets, monitoring it with process hacker, playing with virus scanner settings. Nothing helped.</p>
<p>I went so far as to use procmon to carefully monitor all of the events generated by quicken. Procmon said quicken would spend 30 seconds opening every font I had. And I have a lot. It made no sense that quicken was messing with fonts at startup and the only thing I could see to do was not virus scan those files as they were read, but that made no difference.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought I might try to uninstall some of the many fonts in c:\windows\fonts only to find they all seemed to be ‘system’ fonts and I couldn’t uninstall them. That was 2 years ago, and I don’t recall exactly why I gave up on the font idea except I do recall finding it ridiculous the size and count of all of the required ‘system’ fonts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was out of ideas and my final ‘solution’ was to put quicken into task scheduler so it would start first thing in the morning so when I sat down to use it, it would be ready to go.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I was playing with Office Libre fonts and one of MY fonts was not in c:\windows\fonts. Perplexing because I know I was using it. I found it in C:\Users\dan\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts.</p>
<p>AHA! That’s new. A quick check of an old Win7 system I have and sure enough there is no such directory in Win7. Evidently all user fonts for Win10 get installed into that new directory. Ugh!!</p>
<p>Sure enough I have almost 900 files in that directory. Way back when, I used to do a lot of design work which required a lot of fonts. Those days are long gone, but when I install a new PC, I just copy all of my fonts over because I really don’t know which ones I may want in the future.</p>
<p>My first plan was to copy that fonts folder and then delete most of the user fonts to see if performance would be affected. Well, that failed immediately. Even though they are supposedly personal fonts, like the system fonts, I couldn’t delete most of the ones that I tried.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than screw around with Windows restrictions any longer, I booted the system under Linux using a thumb drive. In Linux it was simple to rename the user fonts directory to fonts-old.</strong></p>
<p>I then rebooted the PC under windows. Removing the fonts directory had no severe side effect. For the past 2 weeks, I have been monitoring performance and quicken is very fast. On an unloaded system it will start in about 5 seconds. That is what I would expect. Small apps I had problems with have all started equally fast. And changing fonts in outlook is fast again.</p>
<p>When I stumble onto a font I need (I have learned to make do almost entirely with Georgia and Helvetica now) I just “install” it by copying it from fonts-old into the normal fonts folder. The PC asks if I want to replace existing fonts and after I say yes, the fonts show up in the user font directory.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why Quicken and a handful of apps needs to scan every installed font on the system. I suspect those programmers are just calling some black-box windows function and that is really where the problem lies. It seems like the ONLY time all fonts should be scanned is when I bring up a font dialog box (like the issue in outlook). But I no longer need 900 font files, so this solution works for me!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Also see <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/226">Part 2</a> and <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/232">Part 3</a>.</p>
<p>Programming languages typically make a distinction between normal program actions and erroneous actions. For Turing-complete languages we cannot reliably decide offline whether a program has the potential to execute an error; we have to just run it and see.</p>
<p>In a <em>safe</em> programming language, errors are trapped as they happen. Java, for example, is largely safe via its exception system. In an <em>unsafe</em> programming language, errors are not trapped. Rather, after executing an erroneous operation the program keeps going, but in a silently faulty way that may have observable consequences later on. <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/TypeSystems.pdf">Luca Cardelli’s article on type systems</a> has a nice clear introduction to these issues. C and C++ are unsafe in a strong sense: executing an erroneous operation causes the entire program to be meaningless, as opposed to just the erroneous operation having an unpredictable result. In these languages erroneous operations are said to have <em>undefined behavior</em>.</p>
<p>The C FAQ defines “undefined behavior” like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anything at all can happen; the Standard imposes no requirements. The program may fail to compile, or it may execute incorrectly (either crashing or silently generating incorrect results), or it may fortuitously do exactly what the programmer intended.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a good summary. Pretty much every C and C++ programmer understands that accessing a null pointer and dividing by zero are erroneous actions. On the other hand, the full implications of undefined behavior and its interactions with aggressive compilers are not well-appreciated. This post explores these topics.</p>
<h2>A Model for Undefined Behavior</h2>
<p>For now, we can ignore the existence of compilers. There is only the “C implementation” which — if the implementation conforms to the C standard — acts the same as the “C abstract machine” when executing a conforming program. The C abstract machine is a simple interpreter for C that is described in the C standard. We can use it to determine the meaning of any C program.</p>
<p>The execution of a program consists of simple steps such as adding two numbers or jumping to a label. If every step in the execution of a program has defined behavior, then the entire execution is well-defined. Note that even well-defined executions may not have a unique result due to unspecified and implementation-defined behavior; we’ll ignore both of these here.</p>
<p>If any step in a program’s execution has undefined behavior, then the entire execution is without meaning. This is important: it’s not that evaluating (1&lt;&lt;32) has an unpredictable result, but rather that the entire execution of a program that evaluates this expression is meaningless. Also, it’s not that the execution is meaningful up to the point where undefined behavior happens: the bad effects can actually precede the undefined operation.</p>
<p>As a quick example let’s take this program:</p>
<pre><strong><span>#include &lt;limits.h&gt;</span><span>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (void)
{
  printf ("%d\n", (INT_MAX+1) &lt; 0);
  return 0;
}</span></strong></pre>
<p>The program is asking the C implementation to answer a simple question: if we add one to the largest representable integer, is the result negative? This is perfectly legal behavior for a C implementation:</p>
<pre><strong>$ cc test.c -o test
$ ./test
1</strong></pre>
<p>So is this:</p>
<pre><strong>$ cc test.c -o test
$ ./test
0</strong></pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<pre><strong>$ cc test.c -o test
$ ./test
42</strong></pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<pre><strong>$ cc test.c -o test
$ ./test
Formatting root partition, chomp chomp</strong></pre>
<p>One might say: Some of these compilers are behaving improperly because the C standard says a relational operator must return 0 or 1. But since the program has no meaning at all, the implementation can do whatever it likes. Undefined behavior trumps all other behaviors of the C abstract machine.</p>
<p>Will a real compiler emit code to chomp your disk? Of course not, but keep in mind that practically speaking, undefined behavior often does lead to Bad Things because many security vulnerabilities start out as memory or integer operations that have undefined behavior. For example, accessing an out of bounds array element is a key part of the canonical stack smashing attack. In summary: the compiler does not need to emit code to format your disk. Rather, following the OOB array access your computer will begin executing exploit code, and that code is what will format your disk.</p>
<h2>No Traveling</h2>
<p>It is very common for people to say — or at least think — something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The x86 ADD instruction is used to implement C’s signed add operation, and it has two’s complement behavior when the result overflows. I’m developing for an x86 platform, so I should be able to expect two’s complement semantics when 32-bit signed integers overflow.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>THIS IS WRONG</strong>. You are saying something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Somebody once told me that in basketball you can’t hold the ball and run. I got a basketball and tried it and it worked just fine. He obviously didn’t understand basketball.</p></blockquote>
<p>(<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/readings/undef.950311.html">This explanation is due to Roger Miller via Steve Summit</a>.)</p>
<p>Of course it is physically possible to pick up a basketball and run with it. It is also possible you will get away with it during a game.&nbsp; However, it is against the rules; good players won’t do it and bad players won’t get away with it for long. Evaluating (INT_MAX+1) in C or C++ is exactly the same: it may work sometimes, but don’t expect to keep getting away with it. The situation is actually a bit subtle so let’s look in more detail.</p>
<p>First, are there C implementations that guarantee two’s complement behavior when a signed integer overflows? Of course there are. Many compilers will have this behavior when optimizations are turned off, for example, and GCC has an option (-fwrapv) for enforcing this behavior at all optimization levels. Other compilers will have this behavior at all optimization levels by default.</p>
<p>There are also, it should go without saying, compilers that do not have two’s complement behavior for signed overflows. Moreover, there are compilers (like GCC) where integer overflow behaved a certain way for many years and then at some point the optimizer got just a little bit smarter and integer overflows suddenly and silently stopped working as expected. This is perfectly OK as far as the standard goes. While it may be unfriendly to developers, it would be considered a win by the compiler team because it will increase benchmark scores.</p>
<p>In summary: There’s nothing inherently bad about running with a ball in your hands and also there’s nothing inherently bad about shifting a 32-bit number by 33 bit positions. But one is against the rules of basketball and the other is against the rules of C and C++. In both cases, the people designing the game have created arbitrary rules and we either have to play by them or else find a game we like better.</p>
<h2>Why Is Undefined Behavior Good?</h2>
<p>The good thing — the only good thing! — about undefined behavior in C/C++ is that it simplifies the compiler’s job, making it possible to generate very efficient code in certain situations. Usually these situations involve tight loops. For example, high-performance array code doesn’t need to perform bounds checks, avoiding the need for tricky optimization passes to hoist these checks outside of loops. Similarly, when compiling a loop that increments a signed integer, the C compiler does not need to worry about the case where the variable overflows and becomes negative: this facilitates several loop optimizations. I’ve heard that certain tight loops speed up by 30%-50% when the compiler is permitted to take advantage of the undefined nature of signed overflow. Similarly, there have been C compilers that optionally give undefined semantics to unsigned overflow to speed up other loops.</p>
<h2>Why Is Undefined Behavior Bad?</h2>
<p>When programmers cannot be trusted to reliably avoid undefined behavior, we end up with programs that silently misbehave. This has turned out to be a really bad problem for codes like web servers and web browsers that deal with hostile data because these programs end up being compromised and running code that arrived over the wire. In many cases, we don’t actually need the performance gained by exploitation of undefined behavior, but due to legacy code and legacy toolchains, we’re stuck with the nasty consequences.</p>
<p>A less serious problem, more of an annoyance, is where behavior is undefined in cases where all it does is make the compiler writer’s job a bit easier, and no performance is gained. For example a C implementation has undefined behavior when:</p>
<blockquote><p>An unmatched ‘ or ” character is encountered on a logical source line during tokenization.</p></blockquote>
<p>With all due respect to the C standard committee, this is just lazy. Would it really impose an undue burden on C implementors to require that they emit a compile-time error message when quote marks are unmatched? Even a 30 year-old (at the time C99 was standardized) systems programming language can do better than this. One suspects that the C standard body simply got used to throwing behaviors into the “undefined” bucket and got a little carried away. Actually, since the C99 standard lists 191 different kinds of undefined behavior, it’s fair to say they got a lot carried away.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Compiler’s View of Undefined Behavior</h2>
<p>The key insight behind designing a programming language with undefined behavior is that the compiler is only obligated to consider cases where the behavior is defined. We’ll now explore the implications of this.</p>
<p>If we imagine a C program being executed by the C abstract machine, undefined behavior is very easy to understand: each operation performed by the program is either defined or undefined, and usually it’s pretty clear which is which. Undefined behavior becomes difficult to deal with when we start being concerned with all possible executions of a program. Application developers, who need code to be correct in every situation, care about this, and so do compiler developers, who need to emit machine code that is correct over all possible executions.</p>
<p>Talking about all possible executions of a program is a little tricky, so let’s make a few simplifying assumptions. First, we’ll discuss a single C/C++ function instead of an entire program. Second, we’ll assume that the function terminates for every input. Third, we’ll assume the function’s execution is deterministic; for example, it’s not cooperating with other threads via shared memory. Finally, we’ll pretend that we have infinite computing resources, making it possible to exhaustively test the function. Exhaustive testing means that all possible inputs are tried, whether they come from arguments, global variables, file I/O, or whatever.</p>
<p>The exhaustive testing algorithm is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compute next input, terminating if we’ve tried them all</li>
<li>Using this input, run the function in the C abstract machine, keeping track of whether any operation with undefined behavior was executed</li>
<li>Go to step 1</li>
</ol>
<p>Enumerating all inputs is not too difficult. Starting with the smallest input (measured in bits) that the function accepts, try all possible bit patterns of that size. Then move to the next size. This process may or may not terminate but it doesn’t matter since we have infinite computing resources.</p>
<p>For programs that contain unspecified and implementation-defined behaviors, each input may result in several or many possible executions. This doesn’t fundamentally complicate the situation.</p>
<p>OK, what has our thought experiment accomplished? We now know, for our function, which of these categories it falls into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 1: Behavior is defined for all inputs</li>
<li>Type 2: Behavior is defined for some inputs and undefined for others</li>
<li>Type 3: Behavior is undefined for all inputs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Type 1 Functions</h2>
<p>These have no restrictions on their inputs: they behave well for all possible inputs (of course, “behaving well” may include returning an error code). Generally, API-level functions and functions that deal with unsanitized data should be Type 1. For example, here’s a utility function for performing integer division without executing undefined behaviors:</p>
<pre><strong>int32_t safe_div_int32_t (int32_t a, int32_t b) {
  if ((b == 0) || ((a == INT32_MIN) &amp;&amp; (b == -1))) {
    report_integer_math_error();
    return 0;
  } else {
    return a / b;
  }
}</strong></pre>
<p>Since Type 1 functions never execute operations with undefined behavior, the compiler is obligated to generate code that does something sensible regardless of the function’s inputs. We don’t need to consider these functions any further.</p>
<h2>Type 3 Functions</h2>
<p>These functions admit no well-defined executions. They are, strictly speaking, completely meaningless: the compiler is not even obligated to generate even a return instruction. Do Type 3 functions really exist? Yes, and in fact they are common. For example, a function that — regardless of input — uses a variable without initializing it is easy to unintentionally write. Compilers are getting smarter and smarter about recognizing and exploiting this kind of code. Here’s a great <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=245">example from the Google Native Client project</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><tt>When returning from trusted to untrusted code, we must sanitize the return address before taking it. This ensures that untrusted code cannot use the syscall interface to vector execution to an arbitrary address. This role is entrusted to the function NaClSandboxAddr, in sel_ldr.h. Unfortunately, since r572, this function has been a no-op on x86.</tt></p>
<p><tt></tt><tt>-- What happened?</tt></p>
<p><tt>During a routine refactoring, code that once read </tt></p>
<p><tt> aligned_tramp_ret = tramp_ret &amp; ~(nap-&gt;align_boundary - 1);</tt></p>
<p><tt>was changed to read </tt></p>
<p><tt> return addr &amp; ~(uintptr_t)((1 &lt;&lt; nap-&gt;align_boundary) - 1);</tt></p>
<p><tt>Besides the variable renames (which were intentional and correct), a shift was introduced, treating nap-&gt;align_boundary as the log2 of bundle size.</tt></p>
<p><tt>We didn't notice this because NaCl on x86 uses a 32-byte bundle size.&nbsp; On x86 with gcc, (1 &lt;&lt; 32) == 1. (I believe the standard leaves this behavior undefined, but I'm rusty.) Thus, the entire sandboxing sequence became a no-op.</tt></p>
<p><tt>This change had four listed reviewers and was explicitly LGTM'd by two. Nobody appears to have noticed the change.</tt></p>
<p><tt>-- Impact</tt></p>
<p><tt>There is a potential for untrusted code on 32-bit x86 to unalign its instruction stream by constructing a return address and making a syscall. This could subvert the validator. A similar vulnerability may affect x86- 64.</tt></p>
<p><tt>ARM is not affected for historical reasons: the ARM implementation masks the untrusted return address using a different method.</tt></p></blockquote>
<p>What happened? A simple refactoring put the function containing this code into Type 3. The person who sent this message believes that x86-gcc evaluates (1&lt;&lt;32) to 1, but there’s no reason to expect this behavior to be reliable (in fact it is not on a few versions of x86-gcc that I tried). This construct is definitely undefined and of course the compiler can do done anything it wants. As is typical for a C compiler, it chose to simply not emit the instructions corresponding to the undefined operation. (A C compiler’s #1 goal is to emit efficient code.) Once the Google programmers gave the compiler the license to kill, it went ahead and killed. One might ask: Wouldn’t it be great if the compiler provided a warning or something when it detected a Type 3 function? Sure! But that is not the compiler’s priority.</p>
<p>The Native Client example is a good one because it illustrates how competent programmers can be suckered in by an optimizing compiler’s underhanded way of exploiting undefined behavior. A compiler that is very smart at recognizing and silently destroying Type 3 functions becomes effectively evil, from the developer’s point of view.</p>
<h2>Type 2 Functions</h2>
<p>These have behavior that is defined for some inputs and undefined for others. This is the most interesting case for our purposes. Signed integer divide makes a good example:</p>
<pre><strong>int32_t unsafe_div_int32_t (int32_t a, int32_t b) {
  return a / b;
}</strong></pre>
<p>This function has a precondition; it should only be called with arguments that satisfy this predicate:</p>
<pre><strong><tt>(b != 0) &amp;&amp; (!((a == INT32_MIN) &amp;&amp; (b == -1)))</tt></strong></pre>
<p>Of course it’s no coincidence that this predicate looks a lot like the test in the Type 1 version of this function. If you, the caller, violate this precondition, your program’s meaning will be destroyed. Is it OK to write functions like this, that have non-trivial preconditions? In general, for internal utility functions this is perfectly OK as long as the precondition is clearly documented.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the compiler’s job when translating this function into object code. The compiler performs a case analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 1: <tt>(b != 0) &amp;&amp; (!((a == INT32_MIN) &amp;&amp; (b == -1)))</tt><br>
Behavior of / operator is defined&nbsp;â†’ Compiler is obligated to emit code computing a / b</li>
<li>Case 2: <tt>(b == 0) || ((a == INT32_MIN) &amp;&amp; (b == -1))</tt><br>
Behavior of / operator is undefined&nbsp;â†’ Compiler has no particular obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the compiler writers ask themselves the question: What is the most efficient implementation of these two cases? Since Case 2 incurs no obligations, the simplest thing is to simply not consider it. The compiler can emit code only for Case 1.</p>
<p>A Java compiler, in contrast, has obligations in Case 2 and must deal with it (though in this particular case, it is likely that there won’t be runtime overhead since processors can usually provide trapping behavior for integer divide by zero).</p>
<p>Let’s look at another Type 2 function:</p>
<pre><strong>int stupid (int a) {
  return (a+1) &gt; a;
}</strong></pre>
<p>The precondition for avoiding undefined behavior is:</p>
<pre><strong>(a != INT_MAX)</strong></pre>
<p>Here the case analysis done by an optimizing C or C++ compiler is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 1: <strong><tt>a != INT_MAX</tt></strong><br>
Behavior of + is defined: Computer is obligated to return 1</li>
<li>Case 2: <strong><tt>a == INT_MAX</tt></strong><br>
Behavior of + is undefined: Compiler has no particular obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, Case 2 is degenerate and disappears from the compiler’s reasoning. Case 1 is all that matters. Thus, a good x86-64 compiler will emit:</p>
<pre><strong>stupid:
  movl $1, %eax
  ret</strong></pre>
<p>If we use the -fwrapv flag to tell GCC that integer overflow has two’s complement behavior, we get a different case analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 1: <strong><tt>a != INT_MAX</tt></strong><br>
Behavior is defined: Computer is obligated to return 1</li>
<li>Case 2: <strong><tt>a == INT_MAX</tt></strong><br>
Behavior is defined: Compiler is obligated to return 0</li>
</ul>
<p>Here the cases cannot be collapsed and the compiler is obligated to actually perform the addition and check its result:</p>
<pre><strong>stupid:
  leal 1(%rdi), %eax
  cmpl %edi, %eax
  setg %al
  movzbl %al, %eax
  ret</strong></pre>
<p>Similarly, an ahead-of-time Java compiler also has to perform the addition because Java mandates two’s complement behavior when a signed integer overflows (I’m using GCJ for x86-64):</p>
<pre><strong>_ZN13HelloWorldApp6stupidEJbii:
  leal 1(%rsi), %eax
  cmpl %eax, %esi
  setl %al
  ret</strong></pre>
<p>This case-collapsing view of undefined behavior provides a powerful way to explain how compilers really work. Remember, their main goal is to give you fast code that obeys the letter of the law, so they will attempt to forget about undefined behavior as fast as possible, without telling you that this happened.</p>
<h2>A Fun Case Analysis</h2>
<p>About a year ago, the Linux kernel started using a special GCC flag to tell the compiler to avoid optimizing away useless null-pointer checks. The code that caused developers to add this flag looks like this (I’ve cleaned up the example just a bit):</p>
<pre><strong>static void __devexit agnx_pci_remove (struct pci_dev *pdev)
{
  struct ieee80211_hw *dev = pci_get_drvdata(pdev);
  struct agnx_priv *priv = dev-&gt;priv; 

  if (!dev) return;</strong></pre>
<pre><strong>  ... do stuff using dev ...
}</strong></pre>
<p>The idiom here is to get a pointer to a device struct, test it for null, and then use it. But there’s a problem! In this function, the pointer is dereferenced before the null check. This leads an optimizing compiler (for example, gcc at -O2 or higher) to perform the following case analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 1: <strong><tt>dev == NULL</tt></strong><br>
“dev-&gt;priv” has undefined behavior: Compiler has no particular obligations</li>
<li>Case 2: <strong><tt>dev != NULL</tt></strong><br>
Null pointer check won’t fail: Null pointer check is dead code and may be deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can now easily see, neither case necessitates a null pointer check. The check is removed, potentially creating an exploitable security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Of course the problem is the use-before-check of pci_get_drvdata()’s return value, and this has to be fixed by moving the use after the check. But until all such code can be inspected (manually or by a tool), it was deemed safer to just tell the compiler to be a bit conservative. The loss of efficiency due to a predictable branch like this is totally negligible. Similar code has been found in other parts of the kernel.</p>
<h2>Living with Undefined Behavior</h2>
<p>In the long run, unsafe programming languages will not be used by mainstream developers, but rather reserved for situations where high performance and a low resource footprint are critical. In the meantime, dealing with undefined behavior is not totally straightforward and a patchwork approach seems to be best:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable and heed compiler warnings, preferably using multiple compilers</li>
<li>Use static analyzers (like Clang’s, Coverity, etc.) to get even more warnings</li>
<li>Use compiler-supported dynamic checks; for example, gcc’s -ftrapv flag generates code to trap signed integer overflows</li>
<li>Use tools like Valgrind to get additional dynamic checks</li>
<li>When functions are “type 2” as categorized above, document their preconditions and postconditions</li>
<li>Use assertions to verify that functions’ preconditions are postconditions actually hold</li>
<li>Particularly in C++, use high-quality data structure libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically: be very careful, use good tools, and hope for the best.</p>

&gt; I spite of my expressed concerns about R7RS-large, I fully agree with 
<br>&gt; what Arthur has written above.
<br>&gt; I feel for your disappointment of giving up on something you have put so 
<br>&gt; much effort in:
<br>&gt; It was a noble effort, and we have all learned a lot. If nothing else,
<br>&gt; you can take well-deserved satisfaction in shepherding R7RS-small.  
<br>&gt; Thank you.
</p></div><p>Agreed on all counts.
</p><p>
When I came on the scene the default attitude among schemers was to have 
<br>endless turf wars about which implementation is 15% sparklier than 
<br>another. John's example in particular stood out like a lighthouse above 
<br>these rough seas. Instead of infighting, you have always been a tireless 
<br>champion of improving the whole. That's what it's all about. At the end 
<br>of the day, what's of value to humanity is a better overall language 
<br>with less friction and you have been working on exactly that.
</p><p>
Thank you in particular for giving new generations of schemers a chance 
<br>at a point when many old timers have given up hope that things will ever 
<br>improve. We will try our best to continue on the path you have laid, and 
<br>look forward to your participation should you find the time and energy 
<br>to make more contributions. Your massive knowledge base covering any 
<br>number of topics with precise recall has been an invaluable help on more 
<br>occasions than I can count.
</p><p>
I apologize for the unpleasant exchanges on R7RS-large. I would never 
<br>judge a project so harshly if it were not laying claim to the name of 
<br>Scheme. I am motivated by a sincere worry that the R6/R7 split will turn 
<br>into an R7/R8 split, and have tried my best to exhaust the polite 
<br>avenues for expressing that concern. I agree that a huge library is a 
<br>desirable thing and would be happy to see that goal come about through a 
<br>process fit for the purpose.

I guess the status of WG2 is up in the air right now, and that it is up

within a set time after agreeing to continue the WG and naming a new

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://andersoncardoso.github.io/ydd/">https://andersoncardoso.github.io/ydd/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37164173">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"><p><strong>YOLO-Driven Development Manifesto</strong></p>

<p><em>You Only Launch Once!</em></p>

<p>We, the fearless proponents of YOLO-Driven Development, in the pursuit of breaking all the rules and embracing chaos, proudly present this manifesto. We recognize that traditional software development methodologies have their merits, but we believe in a more exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping approach to creating software. YOLO-Driven Development is not for the faint of heart; it’s for those who thrive on uncertainty, spontaneity, and a dash of recklessness. We hereby declare our commitment to the following principles:</p>

<p><strong>1. Embrace the Unknown</strong></p>

<p>Why waste time on planning, analysis, and careful consideration? YOLO-Driven Development thrives in the realm of ambiguity. Jump headfirst into coding without any clear understanding of the requirements. You’ll be amazed at the creative solutions you’ll conjure when you’re under the gun!</p>

<p><strong>2. All Nighters over All Sprints</strong></p>

<p>Who needs sleep when you have a looming deadline? Forget about the delicate balance between work and personal life. YOLO-Driven Development encourages marathon coding sessions fueled by caffeine and sheer determination. Burnout is for the weak!</p>

<p><strong>3. Code First, Test… Maybe Later</strong></p>

<p>Testing? Pfft, that’s so last-century. YOLO-Driven Development dictates that you write code like your life depends on it and only consider testing when the application crashes in spectacular fashion. It’s not a bug; it’s a feature waiting to be discovered!</p>

<p><strong>4. Duct Tape and WD-40 Are Your Allies</strong></p>

<p>Complex problems require ingenious solutions. In YOLO-Driven Development, you’ll master the art of duct-tape programming and WD-40 debugging. Your codebase will be a monument to human ingenuity, even if it’s held together with virtual spit and glue.</p>

<p><strong>5. Scope Creep is Your Muse</strong></p>

<p>Fixed scope? Nah, we prefer the thrill of never-ending scope creep. YOLO-Driven Development invites you to chase after ever-evolving requirements. Who cares about deadlines when you can chase the elusive perfection that is perpetually just around the corner?</p>

<p><strong>6. No Documentation, No Problem</strong></p>

<p>Who needs documentation when you have the power of intuition? YOLO-Driven Development encourages you to keep your genius solutions locked away in your head. After all, real developers don’t read documentation; they conjure it from thin air.</p>

<p><strong>7. Collaborative Chaos</strong></p>

<p>Teamwork? Sure, but let’s kick it up a notch. In YOLO-Driven Development, collaboration is an exercise in controlled chaos. Rally your teammates with the shared goal of adding more unpredictability to the mix. Assign tasks on a whim, switch roles randomly, and merge code without warning. The resulting blend of ideas and styles will surely keep everyone on their toes, and who knows, you might just stumble upon brilliance amidst the pandemonium!</p>

<hr>

<p>In conclusion, YOLO-Driven Development is not for everyone. It’s a high-stakes game where the only certainty is uncertainty. But for those who dare to embrace the chaos, who scoff at conventional wisdom, and who thrive on the thrill of code that could crash at any moment, YOLO-Driven Development offers a wild ride that you’ll never forget… if you survive it!</p>

</figure><p>A protein involved in wound healing can improve learning and memory in ageing mice<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Platelet factor 4 (PF4) has long been known for its role in promoting <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/515S168a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/515S168a" data-track-category="body text link">blood clotting</a> and sealing broken blood vessels. Now, researchers are wondering whether this signalling molecule could be used to treat age-related cognitive disorders such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00954-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00954-w" data-track-category="body text link">Alzheimer’s disease</a>.</p><p>“The therapeutic possibilities are very exciting,” says geneticist and anti-ageing scientist David Sinclair at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, who was not involved in the research. The study was published on 16 August in <i>Nature. </i></p><h2>Young blood, old brains</h2><p>About a decade ago, scientists discovered that blood from young mice could restore youthful properties, including learning abilities, in older mice<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>. The idea captivated Saul Villeda, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco and a co-author of the new study. He and his colleagues have since been trying to identify the components of blood that cause this rejuvenation.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Several lines of evidence suggested that PF4 might be one of these components, including the fact that young mice have higher levels of this molecule in their blood than do older mice. Villeda and his colleagues tried injecting PF4 into aged mice without including other blood components. The researchers found that the ratios of various types of immune cells shifted to become more similar to what is typically seen in younger mice. Some immune cells also reverted to a more youthful pattern of gene expression.</p><p>Although PF4 was not able to cross the blood–brain barrier, its effects on the immune system also led to changes in the brain, probably through indirect mechanisms. Old mice that received doses of PF4 showed decreases in damaging inflammation in the hippocampus — a part of the brain that’s particularly vulnerable to the effects of ageing. They also showed increases in the levels of molecules that promote synaptic plasticity (the capacity to alter the strength of connections between nerve cells).</p><p>Aged mice injected with PF4 also did better than aged control mice in cognitive tests, such as remembering where to find a submerged platform they could rest on when forced to swim through a maze.</p><h2>Platelet plus</h2><p>Before this study, “nobody, to my knowledge, has really ever shown that platelets can play a role in cognition”, said platelet biologist Robert Campbell from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “I was really excited about it.”</p><p>Two other publications released today also suggest that PF4 has a role in regulating hallmarks of ageing. Dena Dubal and her colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco found that PF4 enhances synaptic plasticity<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>, and Tara Walker and her colleagues at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia showed that PF4 is involved in the formation of new neurons<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>PF4 is one of a handful of molecules related to ageing that Villeda and others have identified in recent years. Some are <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/02/409856/cognitive-benefits-young-blood-linked-brain-protein-mice" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/02/409856/cognitive-benefits-young-blood-linked-brain-protein-mice" data-track-category="body text link">involved in cognition</a>, whereas others relate to aspects of ageing such as <a href="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/cellular-rejuvenation-therapy-safely-reverses-signs-of-aging-in-mice/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/cellular-rejuvenation-therapy-safely-reverses-signs-of-aging-in-mice/" data-track-category="body text link">muscle loss</a>, and some have multiple functions.</p><p>Biotech companies, including <a href="https://www.elevian.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.elevian.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Elevian</a> and <a href="https://www.alkahest.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.alkahest.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Alkahest</a>, are trying to turn these discoveries into therapies that promote regeneration and healthy ageing. Treatments will probably need to take a range of factors relating to ageing into consideration, Villeda says, and different combinations of treatments might be appropriate for different people.</p><p>If decreases in the levels of PF4 are shown to precede Alzheimer’s disease, this molecule could be used as a biomarker to identify people who might benefit from other treatments, says physiologist Cheryl Conover at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Some existing treatments for Alzheimer’s work best if they’re used during the early stages of the disease, so a way to identify people who are at risk before they develop symptoms would be helpful.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tokio.rs/blog/2023-01-03-announcing-turmoil">https://tokio.rs/blog/2023-01-03-announcing-turmoil</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37163187">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we are happy to announce the initial release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/turmoil"><code>turmoil</code></a>,
a framework for developing and testing distributed systems.</p>
<p>Testing distributed systems is hard. Non-determinism is everywhere (network,
time, threads, etc.), making reproducible results difficult to achieve.
Development cycles are lengthy due to deployments. All these factors slow down
development and make it difficult to ensure system correctness.</p>
<p><code>turmoil</code> strives to solve these problems by simulating hosts, time and the
network. This allows for an entire distributed system to run within a single
process on a single thread, achieving deterministic execution. We also provide
fine grain control over the network, with support for dropping, holding and
delaying messages between hosts.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use <code>turmoil</code>, add the crate to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code><span>[dev-dependencies]</span>
<span>turmoil</span> = <span>"0.3"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://docs.rs/loom/latest/loom/#writing-tests"><code>loom</code></a>, we provide simulated networking types that mirror
<code>tokio::net</code>. Define a new module in your crate named <code>net</code> or any other name of
your choosing. In this module, list out the types that need to be toggled
between <code>turmoil</code> and <code>tokio::net</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[cfg(not(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>))]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> tokio::net::*;

<span>#[cfg(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> turmoil::net::*;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, write your software using networking types from this local module.</p>
<pre><code><span>#[cfg(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>)]</span>
<span>mod</span> simulation {
    <span>#[test]</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>simulate_it</span>() <span>-&gt;</span> turmoil::<span>Result</span> {
        <span>// build the simulation</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>sim</span> = turmoil::Builder::<span>new</span>().<span>build</span>();

        <span>// setup a host</span>
        sim.<span>host</span>(<span>"server"</span>, || <span>async</span> <span>move</span> {
            <span>// host software goes here</span>
        });

        <span>// setup the test</span>
        sim.<span>client</span>(<span>"test"</span>, <span>async</span> <span>move</span> {
            <span>// dns lookup for "server"</span>
            <span>let</span> <span></span><span>addr</span> = turmoil::<span>lookup</span>(<span>"server"</span>);

            <span>// test code goes here</span>

            <span>Ok</span>(())
        });

        <span>// run the simulation</span>
        sim.<span>run</span>()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each host (including the test code) runs on its own <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html"><code>Runtime</code></a>, which is
managed by the simulation. Within <code>run()</code>, the simulation steps each runtime a
configurable duration until the test code completes.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>This crate is still experimental. Your use cases and feedback are invaluable in
guiding our development.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/turmoil/issues">file issues</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/tokio">ping us on Discord in
#turmoil-simulation</a>.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rachit.pl/post/you-have-built-a-compiler/">https://rachit.pl/post/you-have-built-a-compiler/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37162898">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Dear Sir,</em></p>
<p>I am afraid to inform you that you have built a compiler.
I know you wanted a “simple prototype” that would just add that
one feature to your programming model.
You said that “SSA is an overkill” and “it’s just way too much infrastructure
to maintain for a simple task” and yet, six months later, you have pile of
string mangling scripts that do not work—breaking every time a user input
slightly deviates from things you’ve seen before.</p>
<p>Surely, switching to the unstable abstract syntax tree (AST) library provided by the compiler will be the
end of your woes; at least that way, someone else maintains a real parser and provides
at least a semblance of sane input for you to transform.
But wait, the AST is massive. “Do I really have to handle all 500 different AST nodes?” you ask yourself?
Surely not.
Your users aren’t crazy; they don’t use all the weird features of this language.
So you march on, and handle the 50 AST nodes that matter, certain, that this
will be the last of what you need to do to maintain this pile of hacks.</p>
<p>Ah, but wait! Inevitably, someone wanted to nest a for loop inside a switch
statement, a struct definition within that loop, and a conditional in
expression position.
Tired, you patch in support for each feature, distracting from the crucial
features you should be working on and shipping.
One of your brilliant team member suggests a pre-processing stage: de-nest all definitions,
hoist all expressions, flatten out all control, and that way, you only have to handle
50 AST nodes because you will <em>know</em>, yes <em>know</em>, that the program cannot have any other
shape.</p>
<p>Except once that engineer leave, who will <em>know</em> what assumptions you encoded?
Those littered asserts? The inscrutable “unreachable code” errors? Who will <em>know</em>,
how you simplified your AST?
So you rolled out your own AST library, so that you may compile, nay, <em>transpile</em> your
code and expose your assumptions in your data structures.<span>
<label for="sn-1">
</label>
</span>

<span>
Certain, of course, that because you’re <em>transpiling</em> JavaScript to JavaScript, it is going to
way easier than what real compilers do.
</span>
 What glorious engineering, you say to yourself.</p>
<p>In the last leg of your journey to avoid building a compiler, your manager tells you
that your code should run on older machines, which only support version 0.8.
Version 0.8, of course, does not support the brilliant type-level encodings your
transpiler generates to implement your feature.
Not my problem, your manager says.
So you write some code that simplifies your <em>transpiled</em> code further, making
it use only features present in version 0.8.
Done at last, you say to yourself, without having to build a compiler.</p>
<p>A parser, an intermediate representation, transformation passes, and a code generator.
Dear Sir, you have built a compiler.</p>
<p><em>Addressed to,</em><br>
<em>Those who did not want to build a compiler</em></p>

So starting today, we’re launching an early experiment in <a href="https://labs.google.com/search">Search Labs</a> called “<a href="https://search.app.goo.gl/?link=https://www.google.com/search/about?url%3Dgoogleapp://open-url?url%253Dhttps://labs.google.com/search%25253Fsource%253Dsmp.23q2USLabs.31%2526min-version%253D262%26source%3Dsmp.23q2USLabs.31&amp;afl=market://details?id%3Dcom.google.android.googlequicksearchbox%26url%3Dhttps://www.google.com/search/about?url%253Dgoogleapp://open-url?url%25253Dhttps://labs.google.com/search%2525253Fsource%25253Dsmp.23q2USLabs.31%252526min-version%25253D262%2526source%253Dsmp.23q2USLabs.31&amp;apn=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&amp;amv=301236343&amp;ofl=https://labs.google.com/search?source%3Dsmp.23q2USLabs.31&amp;efr=1&amp;isi=284815942&amp;ius=googleapp&amp;ibi=com.google.GoogleMobile&amp;ifl=https://apps.apple.com/app/id284815942?ppid%3D8f4d8362-6a5d-4fac-a18b-6780270b3536%26pt%3D9008%26mt%3D8%26ct%3Doo-pmm-web-Labsinstall-SGEBlog2&amp;source=smp.23q2USLabs.31&amp;al=https://www.google.com/gahomescreen?source%3Dsmp.23q2USLabs.31">SGE while browsing,</a>” available in the Google app on Android and iOS, and coming to Chrome on desktop in the days ahead. Our aim is to test how generative AI can help you navigate information online and get to the core of what you’re looking for even faster.</p><p data-block-key="emqq4">“SGE while browsing” was specifically designed to help people more deeply engage with long-form content from publishers and creators, and make it easier to find what you’re looking for while browsing the web. On some web pages you visit, you can tap to see an AI-generated list of the key points an article covers, with links that will take you straight to what you’re looking for directly on the page. We’ll also help you dig deeper with “Explore on page,” where you can see questions the article answers and jump to the relevant section to learn more.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-5650651831645025424" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
So, a while ago I built a gaming PC with the following specification:</p><div><p><span>&nbsp; Case&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dan A4 v4.1</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Motherboard&nbsp; &nbsp; Z690I Strix Gaming</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Processor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i5-12400F</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; CPU Cooler&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noctua NH-L9i-17xx Chromax Black</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noctua NA-FD1</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Memory&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corsair CMK32GX5M2B5200C40</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; GPU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GeForce RTX 3070 Eagle</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Storage&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 x Seagate Firecuda 530 1TB</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Case fans&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 x Noctua A9x14 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; PSU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corsair SF750</span></p></div><p><span>And one day after months of use it froze mid-game and went into a BIOS loop and wouldn't boot. I quickly realized that only one of the&nbsp;</span>Seagate Firecuda 530 SSDs was detected. After some unscrewing and experimenting with the two drives in the two slots I found that one of them was dead.</p><p>And then I left the PC alone for a few days and turned it on again. It booted into Windows and immediately crashed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEib0tZhWawGzg3BQEATkDGi381NDN5c1L9m_Tap_8MUDCHyuRRXmELQkIfAO1EJxIgI1y46Wdue0wjlqOVAdHNJc_NQnFoSCJA93Xvdf_Aiuy2iM9MjjiZk9CSUgwmulIMKxoygy3zvJb4kr8ywLUkTo8w9V1nu511qHqW2Tfm779QWdSK334Kq3w/s1024/firecuda-2.jpg"><img data-original-height="760" data-original-width="1024" height="476" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEib0tZhWawGzg3BQEATkDGi381NDN5c1L9m_Tap_8MUDCHyuRRXmELQkIfAO1EJxIgI1y46Wdue0wjlqOVAdHNJc_NQnFoSCJA93Xvdf_Aiuy2iM9MjjiZk9CSUgwmulIMKxoygy3zvJb4kr8ywLUkTo8w9V1nu511qHqW2Tfm779QWdSK334Kq3w/w640-h476/firecuda-2.jpg" width="640"></a></p><p>That made me wonder if the failure was temperature related; when cool it seemed to work. So, I left the Firecuda in the freezer at -18C for 30 minutes. Inserting it into an NVMe M.2 USB case I was able to see the drive on my Mac. Success!</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzvkNr-q7YxTA6V5PecJgrv0uOLzeO0oOt2P7fuvPmchXcI3b3ZS9c8mH5FxGgtKBsC6Pst1j3AcZKyV3Nfer92BVv6cUGhAWaaPZ5CSFTYxoJeCDTu9VPFq2QVYeQQs88yWq6XPQ4IrQ3APEMAzf1dnS1ByOimjbavsfXDW1UY5wkLlQt4wDOHA/s1646/firecuda-1.png"><img data-original-height="497" data-original-width="1646" height="194" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzvkNr-q7YxTA6V5PecJgrv0uOLzeO0oOt2P7fuvPmchXcI3b3ZS9c8mH5FxGgtKBsC6Pst1j3AcZKyV3Nfer92BVv6cUGhAWaaPZ5CSFTYxoJeCDTu9VPFq2QVYeQQs88yWq6XPQ4IrQ3APEMAzf1dnS1ByOimjbavsfXDW1UY5wkLlQt4wDOHA/w640-h194/firecuda-1.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Well, for a few minutes. It seemed that as the drive heated up it failed again. Which lead me to believe that there was a faulty connection somewhere on the board. Very careful plugging and unplugging of the board helped me find the right spot to squeeze one of the chips to make the SSD work: no low temperatures needed.</p><p>Now, I couldn't possibly sit and hold the SSD squeezing the chip while I copied off the data so I came up with another solution. A metal G clamp and strips of a Silicon Valley Bank credit card under the SSD to support the PCB.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the contraption with just the right amount of turns on the G clamp to get the SSD to work.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRvr7hH-IeJhEQCKuri9rMVuPK2M8CEfCR1d_v7-IZwhaviCaiaIBkw7dC_bkrpyqV2G9mxTZqgIMlSMHwpuugwKVahIXc2e2gCX1nozSIPqQ8OBnAWxHtGHdfLLtN6-YK0Xq9OSHjAiBlip32U5EGGd7mVUG7uwmKXJ-5p1uM5WsriRX-bi-aTg/s1432/firecuda-3.jpg"><img data-original-height="1432" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRvr7hH-IeJhEQCKuri9rMVuPK2M8CEfCR1d_v7-IZwhaviCaiaIBkw7dC_bkrpyqV2G9mxTZqgIMlSMHwpuugwKVahIXc2e2gCX1nozSIPqQ8OBnAWxHtGHdfLLtN6-YK0Xq9OSHjAiBlip32U5EGGd7mVUG7uwmKXJ-5p1uM5WsriRX-bi-aTg/w572-h640/firecuda-3.jpg" width="572"></a></p><p>But, of course, the SSD gets quite hot during operation so I used one of the heatsinks from the PC and another made from part of carpentry square and some thermal adhesive tape to keep things cool.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin_w7Ss4XJ7pzNHx_cl9cb_KiTKSz95dyLNngCJbc3k15dr_6QUYt_msIkoFwUVYs0mztA1rUwAa9Y8AYgG6Bhq6jSTTaupCIwHbM092LlYOte3rJJZKcIIUJ_qAk8G4YUYir5r7bv5D1lrvyNReOtDlcJLOA5Ih7PCUlHcWDk55O61eP-pB3JHQ/s1492/firecuda-4.jpg"><img data-original-height="1492" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin_w7Ss4XJ7pzNHx_cl9cb_KiTKSz95dyLNngCJbc3k15dr_6QUYt_msIkoFwUVYs0mztA1rUwAa9Y8AYgG6Bhq6jSTTaupCIwHbM092LlYOte3rJJZKcIIUJ_qAk8G4YUYir5r7bv5D1lrvyNReOtDlcJLOA5Ih7PCUlHcWDk55O61eP-pB3JHQ/w550-h640/firecuda-4.jpg" width="550"></a></p><p>During the copy operation I kept an eye on the temperatures with the thermal camera in my CAT S60 phone. Toasty.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhk1dztLcppM4o2UN8IJk2XxAd4jcPPQ61SR5KFE-YaWhNEN2MISEmviKVLsI060LnLztBhgHwVxtzKcATpIM3HjjewczjxrJNQ6atLHvw_47DBsKuVd6fJycWlzmLcIOxgLXWs-SzhA6OGp33CULOf4FPpZfguoAWZkUbHe7m3XpOb6bf-vbT8Vg/s640/firecuda-5.jpg"><img data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhk1dztLcppM4o2UN8IJk2XxAd4jcPPQ61SR5KFE-YaWhNEN2MISEmviKVLsI060LnLztBhgHwVxtzKcATpIM3HjjewczjxrJNQ6atLHvw_47DBsKuVd6fJycWlzmLcIOxgLXWs-SzhA6OGp33CULOf4FPpZfguoAWZkUbHe7m3XpOb6bf-vbT8Vg/w640-h480/firecuda-5.jpg" width="640"></a></p><p>With that combination I was able to copy the /Users directory off the drive for safekeeping. After that I decided to push my luck an image the entire drive into a single 1TB file using dd.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm tempted to try to permanently fix the SSD using my SMD hot air blower. But maybe I should just replace it at this point.</p><p>PS I couldn't resist using the SMD hot air blower on the chip with the red arrow on it below, and now the SSD works without having woodworking tools applied to it! It even boots in the PC.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpNU6GWNhhH3ie3A8oKIg_AgDs0BEmdfw83v6sZfXlXcR9_1qBlmHgWNEFVoDv2pGj8vlUfe8dhu49ZacN9pOjezWwuNv7LFMOdTGbq4kGXKvkNmJjo210tqAvFOgFFQIT2fET4hRBQbnyjk_S9gNqhTICgLr0YZeY3pb2haI1DwqAKF0COyK9jA/s2954/firecuda-6.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="1527" data-original-width="2954" height="330" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpNU6GWNhhH3ie3A8oKIg_AgDs0BEmdfw83v6sZfXlXcR9_1qBlmHgWNEFVoDv2pGj8vlUfe8dhu49ZacN9pOjezWwuNv7LFMOdTGbq4kGXKvkNmJjo210tqAvFOgFFQIT2fET4hRBQbnyjk_S9gNqhTICgLr0YZeY3pb2haI1DwqAKF0COyK9jA/w640-h330/firecuda-6.jpg" width="640"></a></p><br>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-218644.html">https://www.autoevolution.com/news/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-218644.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37160677">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There are two main arguments against hydrogen use in transportation. The first is that it is mostly generated from fossil fuels, which does not make it helpful against climate change. When it is genuinely green, it is obtained through electrolysis, a process that is only 70% to 80% efficient. That's not bad compared to internal combustion engines (ICEs), but fuel cell detractors use that to bash them anyway. Scientists at Tel Aviv University plan to kill that argument with a method that is over 90% efficient in generating green hydrogen.</p><div><p>
		The doctoral student Itzhak Grinberg and Dr. Oren Ben-Zvi explored the fact that photosynthesis breaks water into oxygen and hydrogen to try to reproduce the method plants adopt to do that. Microscopic organisms – probably some sort of algae – helped them with the enzymes that became the key to the idea they developed with the guidance of professors Iftach Yacoby and Lihi Adler-Abramovich. Their study was published in the June edition of Carbon Energy.</p><p>

In a plant, the sun powers the enzyme that decomposes the water molecules into gases – called hydrogenase. The solution the Israeli scientists developed was to replace the sun's power with electricity. An electrode feeds the enzymes, but the electric charge repels them. What Grinberg and Ben-Zvi did was create a chemical treatment that prevented that: a hydrogel mixed with hydrogenase.</p><p>

The researchers were pretty happy with the material they created because <em>"the gel assembles itself."</em> According to Adler-Abramovich, when it is placed in water, it makes nanometric fibers that hold hydrogenase in place. These materials are much cheaper than the platinum that electrolyzers have to use, among other precious metals. The hydrogen is also apparently produced with any kind of water, not only distilled water, as electrolyzers demand. The researchers said salt water is more beneficial to the enzyme to work, for example. That makes green hydrogen production much cheaper, without the need for any secondary process.</p><div><a id="xaegal_5" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis_5.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(5, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="Atmospheric Electrolyzer from Nel ASA Nikola Intended to Use" title="Atmospheric Electrolyzer from Nel ASA Nikola Intended to Use" data-gidm="1905316" data-gida="218644" data-gidx="9"></picture></a><p>Photo: Nel ASA</p></div>

According to these scientists, it can cost 15 times more than gray hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas. Hydrogen can also be made from coal in a process called gasification – that's black or brown hydrogen. The scientists said gray, black, and brown hydrogen release 9 to 12 tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of hydrogen produced. Yet, they correspond to 95% of all hydrogen currently produced worldwide for agricultural and industrial needs. Even if this green hydrogen does not help move a vehicle, it is a welcome way to curb the production of the gray and black kinds.</p><p>

Currently, the hydrogen refueling infrastructure does not increase because green hydrogen prices are too high. In June, Alexander Vlaskamp warned that hydrogen costs four to five times more than it would be acceptable for truck buyers to use it. Although <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/fuel-cell-trucks-face-a-danger-worse-than-weight-that-s-hydrogen-costs-217098.html">the MAN CEO</a> has to justify why Volkswagen is betting so heavily on batteries, the green hydrogen cost was something that needed to be solved quickly. The Israeli production method may be the answer that can solve this once and for all. We just need to have a more refined and commercially usable system to confirm the benefits this idea may bring.</p><p>

If the prices really get more competitive, energy solar and wind farms may dedicate to producing hydrogen when there is no demand for the electricity they generate. That's a better idea than spending millions of dollars on expensive stationary storage systems: these batteries could have better uses in vehicles or houses. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/hydrogen/">Hydrogen</a> storage would still be a problem unless the gas was transformed into synthetic fuel. Hopefully, another scientific breakthrough could address that as soon as possible. We also have another idea floating around that may help solve that.</p><div><a id="xaegal_64" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis_64.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(64, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg" width="860" height="483" alt="NamX's CapXtores will allegedly provide hydrogen in Gogoro fashion for the HUV to run in 2026" title="NamX's CapXtores will allegedly provide hydrogen in Gogoro fashion for the HUV to run in 2026" data-gidm="1905375" data-gida="218644" data-gidx="127"></picture></a><p>Photo: NamX</p></div>
<p>
NamX wants its first vehicle – the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/NamX%20HUV/">HUV</a> – to use swappable hydrogen capsules that can be bought anywhere. If these capsules could be refilled directly from one of the production stations, the storage problem woulxd be quickly solved. Toyota is investigating a similar solution. If we can produce green hydrogen at reasonable prices, that will be a good starting point.</p><p>

It may also be the case that we have to develop vehicles in a different way. Riversimple proposed that when it argued that we are currently trying to make fuel cells fit the cars we already have, just like some carmakers tried to use internal combustion engine (<span data-url="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/i.html#ge-internal-combustion-engine" title="ICE - click for definition">ICE</span>) platforms to make electric vehicles. It did not work. FCEVs have to be conceived around fuel cells and not the other way around. If you check the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai NEXO, they are the perfect example of what Riversimple tried to demonstrate: they look like ordinary vehicles with motors and a fuel cell instead of a combustion engine and a fuel tank. It makes sense that an established automaker will try to keep things as they are, but that will bite them back when competitors find a better way to do that. The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cey2.411">Israeli scientists</a> may have found precisely what was missing to kick this off. Find yourself a comfortable seat to follow how everything unfolds from here. <i></i></p>

<p>Over 30 years ago the late Ian Murdock
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHistory?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Debian-announcement-1993.txt">wrote</a>
to the comp.os.linux.development newsgroup about the completion of a brand-new
Linux release which he named "The Debian Linux Release".</p>
<p>He built the release by hand, from scratch, so to speak. Ian laid out
guidelines for how this new release would work, what approach the release
would take regarding its size, manner of upgrades, installation procedures; and
with great care of consideration for users without Internet connection.</p>
<p>Unaware that he had sparked a movement in the fledgling F/OSS community, Ian
worked on and continued to work on Debian. The release, now aided by volunteers
from the newsgroup and around the world, grew and continues to grow as one of
the largest and oldest FREE operating systems that still exist today.</p>
<p>Debian at its core is comprised of Users, Contributors, Developers, and
Sponsors, but most importantly, <strong><em>People</em></strong>. Ians drive and focus remains
embedded in the core of Debian, it remains in all of our work, it remains in
the minds and hands of the users of <em><strong>The Universal Operating System</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The Debian Project is proud and happy to share our anniversary not exclusively
unto ourselves, instead we share this moment with everyone, as we come together
in celebration of a resounding community that works together, effects change,
and continues to make a difference, not just in our work but around the world.</p>
<p>Debian is present in cluster systems, datacenters, desktop computers, embedded
systems, IoT devices, laptops, servers, it may possibly be powering the web
server and device you are reading this article on, and it can also be found in
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux/">Spacecraft</a>.</p>
<p>Closer to earth, Debian fully supports projects for accessibility:
<a href="https://blends.debian.org/edu/">Debian Edu/Skolelinux</a> - an operating system
designed for educational use in schools and communities,
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience">Debian Science</a> - providing free
scientific software across many established and emerging fields,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/blends/hamradio/about">Debian Hamradio</a> - for amateur
radio enthusiasts,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-accessibility/">Debian-Accessibility</a> - a
project focused on the design of an operating system suited to fit the
requirements of people with disabilites, and
<a href="https://blends.debian.org/astro/">Debian Astro</a> - focused on supporting
professional and hobbyist astronomers.</p>
<p>Debian strives to give, reach, embrace, mentor, share, and teach with
internships through many programs internally and externally such as the Google
Summer of Code, Outreachy, and the Open Source Promotion Plan.</p>
<p>None of this could be possible without the vast amount of support, care, and
contributions from what started as and is still an all volunteer project.
We celebrate with each and every one who has helped shape Debian over all of
these years and toward the future.</p>
<p>Today we all certainly celebrate 30 years of Debian, but know that Debian
celebrates with each and every one of you all at the same time.</p>
<p>Over the next few days Celebration parties are planned to take place in
Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany
(CCCcamp), India, Iran, Portugal, Serbia, South Africa, and Turkey.</p>
<p>You are of course, invited to join us!</p>
<p>Check out, attend, or form your very own
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2023">DebianDay 2023 Event</a>.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you all so very much.</p>
<p>With Love,</p>
<p>The Debian Project</p></div></div>]]></description>
