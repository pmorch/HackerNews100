</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The M3 family of chips features a next-generation GPU that represents the biggest leap forward in graphics architecture ever for Apple silicon. The GPU is faster and more efficient, and introduces a new technology called Dynamic Caching, while bringing new rendering features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading to Mac for the first time. Rendering speeds are now up to 2.5x faster than on the M1 family of chips.<sup>1</sup> The CPU performance cores and efficiency cores are 30 percent and 50 percent faster than those in M1, respectively, and the Neural Engine is 60 percent faster than the Neural Engine in the M1 family of chips. And, a new media engine now includes support for AV1 decode, providing more efficient and high-quality video experiences from streaming services. The M3 family of chips continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon, and brings massive enhancements and new features to the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" target="_blank">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/" target="_blank">iMac</a>.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“Apple silicon has completely redefined the Mac experience. Every aspect of its architecture is designed for performance and power efficiency,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “With 3-nanometer technology, a next-generation GPU architecture, a higher-performance CPU, faster Neural Engine, and support for even more unified memory, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max are the most advanced chips ever built for a personal computer.”

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The next-generation GPU inside the M3 family of chips represents the largest leap forward in graphics architecture for Apple silicon. It features Dynamic Caching that, unlike traditional GPUs, allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time. With Dynamic Caching, only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This is an industry first, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of the new GPU architecture. It dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>With the M3 family of chips, hardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to the Mac for the first time. Ray tracing models the properties of light as it interacts with a scene, allowing apps to create extremely realistic and physically accurate images. This, along with the new graphics architecture, allows pro apps to deliver up to 2.5x the speed of the M1 family of chips. Game developers can use ray tracing for more accurate shadows and reflections, creating deeply immersive environments. Additionally, the new GPU brings hardware-accelerated mesh shading to the Mac, delivering greater capability and efficiency to geometry processing, and enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. This breakthrough GPU architecture enables all of these enhancements and features while maintaining Apple silicon’s legendary power efficiency. In fact, the M3 GPU is able to deliver the same performance as M1 using nearly half the power, and up to 65 percent more performance at its peak.

                 <div>The next-generation CPU in M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max features architectural improvements to the performance and efficiency cores. The performance cores are up to 30 percent faster than those in the M1 family, so tasks like compiling and testing millions of lines of code in Xcode are even faster, and musicians can use hundreds of audio tracks, plug-ins, and virtual instruments in Logic Pro. The efficiency cores are up to 50 percent faster than the efficiency cores in M1, so everyday tasks are faster than ever, while allowing the system to maximize battery life. Together, these cores create a CPU that delivers the same multithreaded performance as M1 using as little as half the power, and up to 35 percent more performance at peak power.

As such it supports many different device types and CPU architectures. We’re excited to be adding a new one to that list - RISC-V. </p>

<p><a href="https://riscv.org/" target="_blank">RISC-V</a> is a free and open instruction set architecture (ISA), bringing the same spirit of industry-wide collaboration and innovation that we see in software around <a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank">open source</a> to the hardware ecosystem. Invented <a href="https://riscv.org/about/history/" target="_blank">10 years ago</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V has seen rapid adoption in embedded and microcontroller spaces, and in recent years has expanded into accelerators, servers, and mobile computing.</p>

<p>In November of 2022, we announced at the RISC-V Summit that we were accepting patches for RISC-V:</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/70O_RmTWP58" width="100%" youtube-src-id="70O_RmTWP58"></iframe>

<p>The latest update that we have is that now not only are we accepting patches, but we have begun to mature support for RISC-V in Android. RISC-V is a modular ISA, meaning that there are a large number of optional extensions. We have also determined an initial set that we feel is critical to ensure that any CPU running RISC-V will have all of the features we expect to achieve high performance. This set includes the rva22 profile as well as the vector and vector crypto extensions. This update was provided at the RISC-V summit in Europe:</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLwdUn3DQp8" width="100%" youtube-src-id="xLwdUn3DQp8"></iframe>

<p>You can build, test, and run the Android support for RISC-V on your own machine as well now! Just like other platform targets in AOSP, you can use the <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/create/cuttlefish" target="_blank">Cuttlefish</a> Virtual Device <a href="https://github.com/google/android-riscv64" target="_blank">support</a>:</p>

<p>Then, you can use <span>vncviewer</span> to connect to the running device and interact.</p>

<p>At this time, <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/owner:maohan4761%2540gmail.com" target="_blank">these patches</a> will support building and running a basic Android Open Source Project experience, but are not yet fully optimized. For example, work on a fully optimized backend for the Android Runtime (ART) is still a work in progress. Additionally, AOSP, our external projects, and compilers haven’t generated fully optimized, reduced code that also takes advantage of the latest ratified extensions, such as the one for <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0" target="_blank">vectors</a>. However, we believe that it is ready to allow experimentation and collaboration.</p> 

<p>Later this year, we expect to have the NDK ABI finalized and canary builds available on Android’s public <a href="https://ci.android.com/builds/branches/aosp-master-ndk/grid" target="_blank">CI</a> soon and RISC-V on x86-64 &amp; ARM64 available for easier testing of riscv64 Android applications on a host machine. By 2024, the plan is to have emulators available publicly, with a full feature set to test applications for various device form factors! As recently <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/10/qualcomm-to-bring-risc-v-based-wearable-platform-to--wear-os-by-" target="_blank">announced</a> in our collaboration with Qualcomm, we expect wearables to be the first form factor available.</p>

<p>However, just porting the Android operating system itself is not enough! We are working with the community and <a href="https://riseproject.dev/" target="_blank">RISE</a> (RISC-V Software Ecosystem). The RISE Project has been established to provide a way to accelerate the availability of software for high-performance and power-efficient RISC-V processor cores running high-level operating systems. That includes not only Android, but also Linux and other operating systems across a variety of application domains, including high-performance computing. The RISE Project includes members from Andes, Google, Intel, Imagination Technologies, MediaTek, Nvidia, Qualcomm Technologies, Red Hat, Rivos, Samsung, SiFive, T-Head, and Ventana.</p>

<p>Google is also continuing and expanding our strong investments at <a href="https://riscv.org/" target="_blank">RISC-V International</a>, even beyond our long-standing Premium membership and <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/" target="_blank">board participation</a>. We also have many other contributors in key roles on horizontal committees, working groups, and technical committees to ensure that specifications are rapidly being designed and ratified to benefit not only Android but also many other use cases.</p>

<p>Android's support for RISC-V is dependent on a wide range of contributions from <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/" target="_blank">toolchain</a> to basic support libraries. We are very appreciative of the ongoing efforts which requires countless projects to support RISC-V build configurations and quality implementations.  If you are interested in contributing please visit the following resources:</p>
<ul>

<li>Subscribe to <a href="https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-android" target="_blank">RISC-V Android SIG</a> mailing list or join directly, if your organization is a member of RISC-V International to stay tuned in to progress and offer your suggestions and feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure to stay tuned as we look into ways to make it as easy for Android developers writing native to target new platforms as it is for our Java and Kotlin developers! </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://news.artnet.com/opinion/devon-rodriguez-parasocial-aesthetics-2380960">https://news.artnet.com/opinion/devon-rodriguez-parasocial-aesthetics-2380960</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38077684">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-id="2380960">
									<p>A little more than a week ago, I wrote <a href="https://news.artnet.com/opinion/devon-rodriguez-painter-tiktok-underground-2373157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a review</a> of an art show by the artist and TikTok sensation Devon Rodriguez, best known for live drawing subway riders. He is, by some measures, the most famous artist in the world, with many millions of social media followers. He did not like the review.</p>
<p>It went up on a Friday. On Saturday morning, I woke up to a tidal wave of anger from Rodriguez on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGPe42gBSt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>, tagging me across scores of posts. Hundreds of his followers went on the attack, swarming my Instagram: “loser,” “hater,” “pathetic,” “jealous,” “your a dick,” and on and on and on. There were many creative variations on “kill yourself.” Others said they were going to get me fired, or said things like, “we are going to start a cancellation campaign against you.” A large number thought that defending Rodriguez meant calling me bald, ugly, fat, or whatever they thought could get under my skin. Most didn’t seem to have actually read my article. A contingent went after my wife. “Some women will do anything for money,” one commented. That one was funny, actually.</p>
<p>After a few days Rodriguez ceased tagging me, and the wave of hate cooled down. “@benstoppable love will always outshine being a hater, I hope I taught you that today,” Rodriguez posted.</p>
<div id="attachment_2381034"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2381034" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1-628x1024.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories. " width="628" height="1024" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1-628x1024.jpg 628w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1-184x300.jpg 184w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1-31x50.jpg 31w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2381034">Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories.</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, I also received an urgent email from UTA Artist Space: “Devon (who we represent) nor UTA was given a chance to respond to this very negative and one-sided article.” I wrote back that I had never heard of an artist demanding to comment on a review in advance, but that if Rodriguez or UTA wanted to write a reply, we would publish it.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time that an artist has been mad at me—only the first time that an artist with this particular type of fame has gone out of his way to unleash his fans in this way. It’s also not anywhere near the worst or most important thing going on in the world, obviously. Nevertheless, I do think it raises some larger issues worth thinking about.</p>

<h4><strong>A Shifting Attention Economy&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>In his torrent of posts, Rodriguez takes big issue with my opener: “Devon Rodriguez is almost certainly the most famous artist in the world, at least on one level,” I wrote. “Almost no one I know has ever heard of him. Except if you say: ‘he’s the painter who draws people on the subway, from TikTok.’ Then sometimes they will light up with recognition.”</p>
<p>His response: “no one he knows has ever heard of me… as if the people that HE knows are more important than everybody else in this world that follows me.. Sorry that I’m not a part of your pretentious circle&nbsp;@benstoppable.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2380606"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2380606" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-589x1024.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories." width="589" height="1024" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-589x1024.jpeg 589w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-173x300.jpeg 173w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-883x1536.jpeg 883w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-29x50.jpeg 29w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a.jpeg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2380606">Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories.</p></div>
<p>But the spirit of the article is clearly, if you read it, the <em>exact</em>&nbsp;<em>opposite</em> of what Rodriguez seems to think it is: I’m arguing that traditional art circles should take the phenomenon seriously, and think through what is really going on with this kind of art career. Rodriguez has a lot of cultural clout—but the fact is that most people who go to museums and galleries or who regularly read about art haven’t heard of him.</p>
<p>This is a very weird feature of the cultural present. Instead of art that gains traction over time via traditional channels and then breaks out to a wider audience, there are now regularly art phenomena that get <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/immersive-van-gogh-experiences-1983011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explosively popular</a> with an immense audience, leaving art institutions and everyone else to <a href="https://news.artnet.com/opinion/beeple-everydays-review-1951656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort out</a> what a particular cultural trend means after it has already happened.</p>

<p>Rodriguez is acting as if he is being unfairly scrutinized when he is one of the most influential artists out there, someone who works with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devonrodriguezart/video/7272593458991287594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A-list celebrities</a>, who the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/realestate/tiktok-subway-artist-renters-lower-east-side.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>New York Times</em></a> says has made as much as $30,000 a day working with mega-brands like Cheetos, who has numerous press agents working to stage-manage his image, who is the ambassador for what contemporary art <em>is</em>&nbsp;to the largest possible audience—he even teaches a <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/sessions/classes/create-realistic-paintings-you-are-proud-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masterclass</a> on realistic portrait painting!</p>

<p>“Dude has PRs putting him in the room with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devonrodriguezart/video/7254988301164219690" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the president</a> and he’s acting like you are gatekeeping him,” someone wrote me. (I should mention that I’ve received a lot of support too.)</p>
<p>In fact, the only way I can understand Rodriguez’s incredibly thin-skinned reaction to my article is that he has managed to rise to this status of apex visibility without <em>any kind of critical writing about him at all</em>. It’s all just been feel-good profiles, so that the first critical word feels like a huge crisis. That’s a relatively new kind of situation for an artist to be in, and worth analyzing.</p>

<h4><strong>Art Criticism and Parasocial Relationships</strong></h4>
<p>“If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all” was a phrase that commenters repeated a lot. Rodriguez’s art content makes people happy, so why be “negative?” Quite a few people posted variations on, “what is even the point of art critics?” So let me say what purpose an article like the one I wrote might serve.</p>
<p>First: With regard to the paintings themselves, simply repeating press-release hype isn’t healthy for anyone. It happens all the time that artists get stuck doing whatever first brought them success, and dealers or marketers encourage them to just do the same thing because it’s the easiest thing to sell, thereby undermining what could be a more enduring career.</p>
<p>As I repeat in the article, Rodriguez seems a gifted painter, in a photo-inspired realist style. At the same time, when it comes to the show I reviewed, “<a href="https://utaartistspace.com/exhibitions/underground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Underground,</a>” the subject matter is well-trodden territory. We have 100-plus years of painters doing subway scenes, from <a href="https://whitney.org/collection/works/1560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reginald Marsh</a> to <a href="https://www.jordancasteel.com/2018-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Casteel</a>, so the question of what is different or exceptional about these particular versions of the theme is accented. Maybe this doesn’t matter to his audience, but it probably <em>does</em> matter to people who are interested in painting.</p>
<p>Still, my question was not even this. It was whether the paintings on their own were enough to explain his extraordinary popularity. And the answer to that question is clearly no.</p>
<div id="attachment_2373240"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2373240" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-1024x768.jpeg" alt="A visitor looks at paintings in &quot;Underground.&quot; P" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-50x38.jpeg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground.jpeg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2373240">A visitor looks at paintings in “Underground.” Photo by Ben Davis.</p></div>
<p>That brings me to the second point, which is where the case of Devon Rodriguez is specifically interesting. Basically, I’m arguing that we should think of his social media posts as part of his practice, to be reviewed in and of themselves. These are, after all, not just <em>how</em> he got famous; in some sense they are what he is really famous for. And they are in many cases clearly staged. (There is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/ldrbro/devon_rodriguez_the_artist_who_got_famous_for_his/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long and robust online debate</a> by artists about how real his subway clips are.)</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devonrodriguezart/video/7286157229861162286?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his post</a> from October 4, where Rodriguez draws a dancer on the London Underground, who turns out to be Sabrina Bahsoon, a.k.a. “<a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-tube-girl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tube Girl</a>.” “I love your moves—are you a professional dancer?” Rodriguez asks at the climax of the clip as he hands the drawing to Bahsoon, who has three quarters of a million TikTok followers and signed with <a href="https://www.thehivemanagement.com/new-faces/sabrina-bahsoon/#book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hive&nbsp;modeling agency</a> this year. “Definitely not!” she replies, feigning surprise.</p>
<div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Look who I saw on the tube @Sabrina Bahsoon ✍🏼  #devonrodriguezart #shorts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ww3AN8dW4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>

<p>What do his fans think is going on here? That Rodriguez happened to be in London, and happened to come upon another famous TikToker, and that she continued to dance in front of him for 30 minutes as he sat drawing her, with multiple cameras filming the two of them and his drawing pad, as he created a hyper-detailed portrait of Bahsoon that looks like it is sourced from a close-up photo? The comments are full of people marveling: “How did you do that? She wasn’t standing still. Absolutely incredible.” Or: “HOW DO YOU DRAW THEM WHEN THEY ARE MOVING A LOT?” Or: “Your work is amazing. I keep wondering how you keep the pencil steady on a moving train.” Great questions!</p>
<p>Is it “mean” to point out how fake this is? If there’s no criticism of it, here’s what I think will happen: All the marketing companies and PR people looking to piggyback on Rodriguez’s popularity will stuff his feed with more and more cringe celebrity content and half-baked promo ideas until his social-media presence is bled dry of whatever charm it has.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, a lot of fans coming across art through his channel will get a totally confused idea of how contemporary art-celebrity works. Which brings me to the last and most important answer to the question of why I think it’s worth writing about Rodriguez seriously: Because he is a role model for a ton of young artists, and they deserve an actual assessment of what is going on.</p>
<p>“While Devon is instantly recognizable as a TikTok sensation, his story about his rise as a fine artist—from his childhood in the South Bronx to his Subway paintings and achieving Masterclass-worthy expertise—is something we are incredibly excited to share with the art world and beyond,” his agent, Arthur Lewis, wrote in <a href="https://d3kiriw2ovsgup.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/26153557/Press-Release_Devon-Rodriguez-Exhibition-Announcement-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the press release</a> for “Underground.” Artists’ personal stories have long been part of how art is marketed, from Vincent van Gogh to Frida Kahlo, but in those cases, the artists’ paintings attracted interest first, and the biography became part of its legend as its fame grew. Today, personal biography and narrative are more important than ever in the gallery—most art comes equipped with some kind of story. But social media gives an added twist: Hordes of people can feel as if they have a relationship with a painter like Devon Rodriguez without ever having had any direct experience of his painting at all.</p>
<div id="attachment_2373728"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2373728" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-1024x1004.jpg" alt="Devon Rodriguez with fans at the opening of &quot;Underground.&quot;" width="1024" height="1004" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-1024x1004.jpg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-300x294.jpg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-1536x1505.jpg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-50x50.jpg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2373728">Devon Rodriguez with fans at the opening of “Underground.” Photo by Ben Davis.</p></div>
<p>“What if he was your son??” someone posted at me angrily. This comment is emblematic. It’s not the kind of thing one normally says about an artist getting a critical review (unless the criticism is extremely over the top and disproportionate to the status of the artist in question). Generally, the point of presenting an art show in public is to see if it can hold the attention of people who don’t directly know you.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that the majority of Rodriguez’s fans are most engaged by his appealing social-media persona, <em>not</em> his actual artworks. If this is the case, then it’s logical to think that it changes how criticism is perceived. His followers feel like I am attacking a person they like, not judging artworks or analyzing a media phenomenon. I think that explains the character of the reaction, which has a level of raw personal anger completely out of joint with what I wrote in my article.</p>
<p>Recently there’s been a lot of writing on the increasing currency of “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/04/parasocial-relationships-imaginary-connections-fans-celebrities/673645/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parasocial relationships</a>” in media, that is, the imaginary, one-sided friendships people develop with celebrities and influencers in their heads. It seems to me that Devon Rodriguez’s title as the “most popular painter in the world” shows what a powerful cultural force a “parasocial aesthetic” can be—it’s probably more powerful (or at least more accessible) than interest in paint on canvas.</p>
<p>All the same, Devon Rodriguez’s art agents and PR handlers might gently tell him that, if one of the things you are selling is likability and good vibes, cheering on this kind of vicious reaction every time you get a review you don’t like is probably not a sustainable career path.</p>

  <p>Today, we’re releasing a new version of the RedPajama dataset, with 30 trillion filtered and deduplicated tokens (100+ trillions raw) from 84 CommonCrawl dumps covering 5 languages, along with 40+ pre-computed data quality annotations that can be used for further filtering and weighting.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last half a year, we have been pleased to see that RedPajama-1T, which we released in March, has ignited the creation of many new language models. So many people from the community have downloaded this 5TB dataset---more than 190,000 times and have been using them <a href="https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=redpajama"><span>in such creative ways</span></a>! RedPajama-1T consists of 1 trillion high-quality English tokens, but it was only the first step. Today, with the release of RedPajama-V2, we are making a further step towards the development of open datasets by releasing a massive, 30 trillion token web dataset. This is, to our best knowledge, the largest public dataset released specifically for LLM training. Even more excitingly, we include 40+ pre-computed quality annotations, allowing the community to further filter and weigh the data. Specifically, this release includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Over 100 billion text documents with 100+ trillion raw tokens from 84 CommonCrawl dumps;</p></li><li><p>40+ of the most widely used quality annotations pre-computed for a deduplicated 30 trillion tokens subset;</p></li><li><p>Five languages: English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian</p></li><li><p>All data processing scripts are open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data"><span>GitHub</span></a>; all data are available on <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-V2"><span>HuggingFace</span></a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Why RedPajama-Data-v2 and How to Use it?</h2><p>A central ingredient to state-of-the-art open LLMs like Llama, Mistral, Falcon, MPT, and the RedPajama models is the large amounts of high-quality data that these models are trained on. For example, Llama 2 is trained on 2.4 trillion carefully curated tokens. The most prominent data sources are the crawls made publicly available by <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/"><span>CommonCrawl</span></a>. However, this data is crude and is not ideal for direct use for LLM training due to artifacts arising from the conversion of HTML to plain text, sources of generally low quality, and biases inherent to the distribution of content on the web. Getting the right dataset and data mixture is painful and any LLM developer has to go through the laborious, time-consuming, energy-intensive and expensive steps of processing and filtering this crude data. Although there have been several community projects around this effort, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683"><span>C4</span></a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T"><span>RedPajama-1T,</span></a> <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb"><span>Refinedweb (Falcon)</span></a>, <a href="https://github.com/allenai/dolma"><span>Dolma (AI2)</span></a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/SlimPajama-627B"><span>SlimPajama</span></a>, many of them only cover a small portion of the CommonCrawl crawls; moreover, they represent a very specific way in which data are filtered.</p><p>With RedPajama-Data-v2, our goal is to lift this burden off the community and provide a pool of web data serving as a base from which high quality datasets for LLM training can be extracted and based on which LLM training data can be thoroughly researched. It provides, to our best knowledge, the most complete coverage on CommonCrawl (with 84 dumps processed). More importantly, we provide 40+ quality annotations — the result of different ML classifiers on data quality, minhash results that can be used for fuzzy deduplication, or heuristics such as “the fraction of words that contain no alphabetical character”. We provide our best effort implementations of quality annotations used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683"><span>C4</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446"><span>Gopher</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13169"><span>Pretrainer’s Guide</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116"><span>RefinedWeb</span></a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03169"><span>Data Selection for Language Models via Importance Resampling</span></a>. These annotations provide a way for an LLM developer to easily slice and filter the data, combining these into a new data quality pipeline to create their own pre-training dataset.</p><p>Here are some examples! The following code snippets show how one can implement commonly used filtering rules in combination with the RedPajama-V2 dataset. For example, implementing the Gopher rules and use these to filter out documents that do not comply with the Gopher rules is as easy as:</p>

  <p>In the current release, we include 40+ quality annotations, but we very much view this as a “living” project where new additions will be made over time as the field moves towards a better understanding of LLM training data. We hope the community provides feedback, and we are looking forward to continuing to enrich our current pool of annotations.</p><h3>Data Processing Steps</h3><p>RedPajama-V2 focuses on CommonCrawl. Other data sources such as Wikipedia are available in <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T"><span>RedPajama-V1</span></a>. We also encourage you to enrich your data mixture with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack"><span>Stack</span></a> (by BigScience) for code and <a href="https://allenai.org/data/s2orc"><span>s2orc</span></a> (by AI2) for scientific articles. RedPajama-V2 is built from the ground up based on publicly available web data, consisting of 84 crawls provided by CommonCrawl. The core components that this dataset is made of, are the source data (plain text), 40+ quality annotations, and deduplication clusters.</p><h3>Creating the Source Data</h3><p>The first processing step in building this dataset is to pass each CommonCrawl snapshot through the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.494/"><span>CCNet pipeline</span></a>. We choose this pipeline due to its light processing, aligning with our guiding principle of preserving as much information in the raw dataset as possible and allowing downstream model developers to filter or reweight the dataset. We use the language filter in CCNet and keep five languages in this release: English, French, Spanish, German and Italian. This processing step produces 100 billion individual text documents.&nbsp;</p><h3>Quality Annotations</h3><p>In addition to the text documents processed by CCNet, we compute over 40 of the most widely used quality annotations for the “head” and “middle” buckets. The primary purpose of these annotations is to allow downstream model developers to filter or reweight the dataset based on their criteria, and to foster research into how these annotations should be used. In addition, we also plan, with the help of the community, to include more quality signals over time. With this release, we publish a first set of quality annotations, which consists of our implementations of the most common quality annotations that are described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683"><span>C4</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446"><span>Gopher</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13169"><span>Pretrainer’s Guide</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116"><span>RefinedWeb</span></a>, in addition to several signals described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03169"><span>other papers</span></a>. These annotations fall into the following categories:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Quality signals indicating how <strong>natural</strong> a given piece of text is. This includes simple heuristic measures such as the number of sentences, the number of words, the fraction of all-caps words, among others.</p></li><li><p>Quality signals indicating how <strong>repetitive</strong> a given piece of text is. Here follow the Gopher rules (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446"><span>Rae et al.</span></a>) and compute the fraction of characters that appear in duplicated word n-grams and the fraction of characters in the most frequent word n-gram appearing in the documents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Content-based</strong> quality signals are comprised of signals that take the content into account such as the density of words appearing in a list of blocked words (similar to C4), or documents which come from a list of domains flagged as containing potentially harmful or otherwise offensive content.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>ML-based</strong> quality signals revolve around the idea of measuring how similar a given text is to a high-quality domain. Here we use fasttext classifiers trained on various high quality domains such as Wikipedia, as well as importance weights as proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03169"><span>Xie et al</span></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deduplication</strong> signals with pre-computed Minhash signatures (with 128 permutations) which can be used for fuzzy deduplication at different degrees.</p></li></ul>

  <p>In addition to these minhash signatures, we conduct exact deduplication with a Bloom filter over the sha1 hash-digest of the document. These are stored as a separate quality annotation file to allow the original non-duplicated distribution to be recovered to facilitate research in this direction.</p><h3>Dataset Statistics</h3><p>RedPajama-v2 processed 84 CommonCrawl crawls and consists of 113B documents in the five languages (English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian). While we keep the tail partition of the resulting data, consisting of an estimated 80B documents, we also compute the number of documents and tokens for the head and middle partitions (before and after deduplication). Interestingly, while this reduces the token count by 60%, the number of documents decreases disproportionately more by 71%, indicating that the tail documents are generally shorter.</p>

<p>We further deduplicated the head+middle documents using a Bloom filter, which leads to a reduction in the dataset size by roughly 40%. In the following figure, we show the development of the number of documents in the head+middle partition, as a function of the point in time of the crawl. What stands out here is that there is a relatively stable number until 2018, and a significantly smaller number of documents between 2014 and 2016 (up to 10x for, e.g., German). It is also worth noting how the number of unique documents over time develops. Specifically, since we ran the deduplication from the newest snapshot to the oldest, one expects an increasingly smaller number of unique documents in the corpus, which can be observed from the figure below (note the log-scale). However, it is worth pointing out the sudden drop in unique documents occurring for the crawls between 2014 and 2017. We believe that this can be explained from a different list of seeds used by the CommonCrawl web crawler during that period.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Dataset Structure</h3><p>The core of the dataset is composed of the text documents, accompanied by the quality annotations and deduplication clusters. The structure largely follows the one defined by CCNet. Specifically, the documents for a given CommonCrawl snapshot (say, e.g., 2018-43) are partitioned into 5k shards where the key indicates the shard, language of the document, and the perplexity bucket (partition). The quality annotations and duplicates follow the same logic and “mirror” the source filenames:</p>

  <p>Since we have quality signals that can characterise the quality on a line level (e.g., whether a line ends in a terminal punctuation mark), or on a document level we choose the logic used by <a href="https://github.com/allenai/dolma"><span>Dolma</span></a>, allowing for a unified representation of different types of signals. Specifically, each score corresponds to an array of tuples `(start, end, score)` where start and end correspond to the span in the document string where the score “applies”.</p><h3>A “Living” Dataset</h3><p>We envision the release of this dataset to be the start of a larger, community-driven development of large-scale datasets for LLMs. Along the data axis, we hope to continuously grow this pool and enrich it with additional domains and new snapshots over time. Along the data quality side, we view the current set of quality signals as an initial base set of signals that we hope to grow with new additions. In that sense, RedPajama-v2 should be seen as a pool that grows over time as the community learns more about harnessing the data for training performant language models. In the future, we plan to add more quality annotations such as: Contamination annotations against popular LLM benchmarks, topic modelling and classification annotations for each document, and other annotations that the community is excited about!</p><h3>Model Building at Together</h3><p>Together is building open models based on RedPajama-Dataset-V2, and we also help companies and organizations build custom models built with principled mixes of open and their proprietary datasets. If you are evaluating solutions to build models, please contact us here.&nbsp;</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>We are appreciative to so many partners and collaborators that together are pushing forward the frontier of open LLM models.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Thank you to the OLMo team at <a href="https://allenai.org/"><span>AI2</span></a> and friends at <a href="https://opengpt-x.de/en/"><span>OpenGPT-X</span></a> for the insightful discussions about datasets and data quality!

     The Grug Brained Developer<br>
     <small>A layman's guide to thinking like the self-aware smol brained</small>
  </h2>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>this collection of thoughts on software development gathered by grug brain developer</p>
<p>grug brain developer not so smart, but grug brain developer program many long year and learn some things
although mostly still confused</p>
<p>grug brain developer try collect learns into small, easily digestible and funny page, not only for you, the young grug, but also for him
because as grug brain developer get older he forget important things, like what had for breakfast or if put pants on</p>
<p>big brained developers are many, and some not expected to like this, make sour face</p>
<p><em>THINK</em> they are big brained developers many, many more, and more even definitely probably maybe not like this, many
sour face (such is internet)</p>
<p>(note: grug once think big brained but learn hard way)</p>
<p>is fine!</p>
<p>is free country sort of and end of day not really matter too much, but grug hope you fun reading and maybe learn from
many, many mistake grug make over long program life</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-complexity"></a><a href="#grug-on-complexity">The Eternal Enemy: Complexity</a></h2>
<p>apex predator of grug is complexity</p>
<p>complexity bad</p>
<p>say again:</p>
<p>complexity <em>very</em> bad</p>
<p><em>you</em> say now:</p>
<p>complexity <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> bad</p>
<p>given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex</p>
<p>complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable non grug-brain
developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime</p>
<p>one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good!</p>
<p>next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!</p>
<p>grug no able see complexity demon, but grug sense presence in code base</p>
<p>demon complexity spirit mocking him make change here break unrelated thing there what!?! mock mock mock ha ha so funny
grug love programming and not becoming shiney rock speculator like grug senior advise</p>
<p>club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who let spirit in with club: sometimes grug
himself!</p>
<p>sadly, often grug himself</p>
<p>so grug say again and say often: complexity <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> bad</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-saying-no"></a><a href="#grug-on-saying-no">Saying No</a></h2>
<p>best weapon against complexity spirit demon is magic word: "no"</p>
<p>"no, grug not build that feature"</p>
<p>"no, grug not build that abstraction"</p>
<p>"no, grug not put water on body every day or drink less black think juice you stop repeat ask now"</p>
<p>note, this good engineering advice but bad career advice: "yes" is magic word for more shiney rock and put in
charge of large tribe of developer</p>
<p>sad but true: learn "yes" then learn blame other grugs when fail, ideal career advice</p>
<p>but grug must to grug be true, and "no" is magic grug word.  Hard say at first, especially if you nice grug and don't like
disappoint people (many such grugs!) but  easier over time even though shiney rock pile not as high as might otherwise be</p>
<p>is ok: how many shiney rock grug really need anyway?</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-saying-ok"></a><a href="#grug-on-saying-ok">Saying ok</a></h2>
<p>sometimes compromise necessary or no shiney rock, mean no dinosaur meat, not good, wife firmly remind grug
about young grugs at home need roof, food, and so forth, no interest in complexity demon spirit rant by grug for
fiftieth time</p>
<p>in this situation, grug recommend "ok"</p>
<p>"ok, grug build that feature"</p>
<p>then grug spend time think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 solution</a> to problem and build that instead.<br>
80/20 solution say "80 want with 20 code"  solution maybe not have all bell-whistle that project manager want, maybe a
little ugly, but work and deliver most value, and keep demon complexity spirit at bay for most part to extent</p>
<p>sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way.  easier forgive than permission, project managers
mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs.  often forget what even feature supposed to do or move on or
quit or get fired grug see many such cases</p>
<p>anyway is in project managers best interest anyway so grug not to feel too bad for this approach usually</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-factring-your-code"></a><a href="#grug-on-factring-your-code">Factoring Your Code</a></h2>
<p>next strategy very harder: break code base up properly (fancy word: "factor your code properly")  here is hard give general
advice because each system so different.  however, one thing grug come to believe: not factor your application too early!</p>
<p>early on in project everything very abstract and like water: very little solid holds for grug's struggling brain to hang
on to.  take time to develop "shape" of system and learn what even doing.  grug try not to factor in early part of project
and then, at some point, good cut-points emerge from code base</p>
<p>good cut point has narrow interface with rest of system: small number of functions or abstractions that hide complexity
demon internally, like trapped in crystal</p>
<p>grug quite satisfied when complexity demon trapped properly in crystal, is best feeling to trap mortal enemy!</p>
<p>grug try watch patiently as cut points emerge from code and slowly refactor, with code base taking shape over time along
with experience.  no hard/ fast rule for this: grug know cut point when grug see cut point, just take time to build
skill in seeing, patience</p>
<p>sometimes grug go too early and get abstractions wrong, so grug bias towards waiting</p>
<p>big brain developers often not like this at all and invent many abstractions start of project</p>
<p>grug tempted to reach for club and yell "big brain no maintain code!  big brain move on next architecture committee
leave code for grug deal with!"</p>
<p>but grug learn control passions, major difference between grug and animal</p>
<p>instead grug try to limit damage of big brain developer early in project by giving them thing like
UML diagram (not hurt code, probably throw away anyway) or by demanding working demo tomorrow</p>
<p>working demo especially good trick: force big brain make something to actually work to talk about and code to look at that do
thing, will help big brain see reality on ground more quickly</p>
<p>remember!  big brain have big brain!  need only be harness for good and not in service of spirit complexity demon on
accident, many times seen</p>
<p>(best grug brain able to herd multiple big brain in right direction and produce many complexity demon trap crystals, large
shiney rock pile awaits such grug!)</p>
<p>also sometimes call demo approach "prototype", sound fancier to project manager</p>
<p>grug say prototype early in software making, <em>especially</em> if many big brains</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-testing"></a><a href="#grug-on-testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p>grug have love/hate relationship with test: test save grug many, many uncountable time and grug love and respect test</p>
<p>unfortunately also many test shamans exist.  some test shaman make test idol, demand things like "first test" before grug
even write code or have any idea what grug doing domain!</p>
<p>how grug test what grug not even understand domain yet!?</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry: the tests will show you what you need to do."</p>
<p>grug once again catch grug slowly reaching for club, but grug stay calm</p>
<p>grug instead prefer write most tests after prototype phase, when code has begun firm up</p>
<p>but, note well: grug must here be very disciplined!</p>
<p>easy grug to move on and not write tests because "work on grugs machine"!</p>
<p>this very, very bad: no guarantee work on other machine and no guarantee work on grug machine in future, many times</p>
<p>test shaman have good point on importance of test, even if test shaman often sometimes not complete useful
feature in life and talk only about test all time, deserve of club but heart in right place</p>
<p>also, test shaman often talk unit test very much, but grug not find so useful.  grug experience that ideal tests are not
unit test or either end-to-end test, but in-between test</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit tests</a> fine, ok, but break as implementation change (much compared api!)
and make refactor hard and, frankly, many bugs anyway often due interactions other code.  often throw away when code change.</p>
<p>grug write unit test mostly at start of project, help get things going but not get too attached or expect value long time</p>
<p><a href="https://smartbear.com/solutions/end-to-end-testing/">end to end</a> tests good, show whole system work, but! hard to
understand when break and drive grug crazy very often, sometimes grugs just end up ignoring because "oh, that break all
time"  very bad!</p>
<p>in-between tests, grug hear shaman call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">"integration tests"</a> sometime
often with sour look on face. but grug say integration test sweet spot according to grug: high level enough test correctness
of system, low level enough, with good debugger, easy to see what break</p>
<p>grug prefer some unit tests especially at start but not 100% all code test and definitely not "first test".  "test along
the way" work pretty well for grug, especially as grug figure things out</p>
<p>grug focus much ferocious integration test effort as cut point emerge and system stabilize!  cut point api hopefully stable
compared implementation and integration test remain valuable many long time, and easy debug</p>
<p>also small, well curated end-to-end test suite is created to be kept working religiously on pain of clubbing. focus of important
end-to-end test on most common UI features and few most important edge cases, but not too many or become impossible maintain
and then ignored</p>
<p>this ideal set of test to grug</p>
<p>you may not like, but this peak grug testing</p>
<p>also, grug dislike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mocking</a> in test, prefer only when absolute necessary
to (rare/never) and coarse grain mocking (cut points/systems) only at that</p>
<p>one exception "first test" dislike by grug: when bug found.  grug always try first reproduce bug with regression test
<em>then</em> fix bug, this case only for some reason work better</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-agile"></a><a href="#grug-on-agile">Agile</a></h2>
<p>grug think agile not terrible, not good</p>
<p>end of day, not worst way to organize development, maybe better than others grug supposes is fine</p>
<p>danger, however, is agile shaman!  many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman!</p>
<p>whenever agile project fail, agile shaman say "you didn't do agile right!"  grug note this awfully convenient for agile
shaman, ask more shiney rock better agile train young grugs on agile, danger!</p>
<p>grug tempted reach for club when too much agile talk happen but always stay calm</p>
<p>prototyping, tools and hiring good grugs better key to success software: agile process ok and help some but sometimes hurt taken
too seriously</p>
<p>grug say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">no silver club</a> fix all software problems no matter what agile
shaman say (danger!)</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-refactoring"></a><a href="#grug-on-refactoring">Refactoring</a></h2>
<p>refactoring fine activity and often good idea, especially later in project when code firmed up</p>
<p>however, grug note that many times in career "refactors" go horribly off rails and end up causing more harm than good</p>
<p>grug not sure exactly why some refactors work well, some fail, but grug notice that larger refactor, more
likely failure appear to be</p>
<p>so grug try to keep refactors relatively small and not be "too far out from shore" during refactor.  ideally system work
entire time and each step of finish before other begin.</p>
<p>end-to-end tests are life saver here, but often very hard understand why broke... such is refactor life.</p>
<p>also grug notice that introducing too much abstraction often lead to refactor failure and system failure.  good example
was <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/j2ee/">J2EE</a> introduce, many big brain sit around thinking too much abstraction, nothing good came of it many project hurt</p>
<p>another good example when company grug work for introduce <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/OSGi">OSGi</a> to help
manage/trap spriit complexity demon in code base.  not only OSGi not help, but make complexity demon much more powerful!
took multiple man year of best developers to rework as well to boot!  more complex spirit and now features impossible
implement! very bad!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-chestertons-fence"></a><a href="#grug-on-chestertons-fence">Chesterton's Fence</a></h2>
<p>wise grug shaman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton">chesterton</a> once say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>here exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>many older grug learn this lesson well not start tearing code out willy nilly, no matter how ugly look</p>
<p>grug understand all programmer platonists at some level wish music of spheres perfection in code.  but danger is here,
world is ugly and gronky many times and so also must code be</p>
<p>humility not often come big brained or think big brained
easily or grug even, but grug often find "oh, grug no like look of this, grug fix" lead many hours pain grug and no better or system
worse even</p>
<p>grug early on in career often charge into code base waving club wildly and smash up everything, learn not good</p>
<p>grug not say no improve system ever, quite foolish, but recommend take time understand system first especially bigger system is and
is respect code working today even if not perfect</p>
<p>here tests often good hint for why fence not to be smashed!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-microservices"></a><a href="#grug-on-microservices">Microservices</a></h2>
<p>grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too</p>
<p>seem very confusing to grug</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-tools"></a><a href="#grug-on-tools">Tools</a></h2>
<p>grug love tool.  tool and control passion what separate grug from dinosaurs!  tool allow grug brain to create code that
not possible otherwise by doing thinking for grug, always good relief! grug always spend time in new place learning
tools around him to maximize productivity: learn tools for two weeks make development often twice faster and often
have dig around ask other developers help, no docs</p>
<p>code completion in IDE allow grug not have remembered all API, very important!</p>
<p>java programming nearly impossible without it for grug!</p>
<p>really make grug think some time</p>
<p>good debugger worth weight in shiney rocks, in fact also more: when faced with bug grug would often trade all shiney rock and
perhaps few children for good debugger and anyway debugger no weigh anything far as grug can tell</p>
<p>grug always recommend new programmer learn available debugger very deeply, features like conditional break points, expression
evaluation, stack navigation, etc teach new grug more about computer than university class often!</p>
<p>grug say never be not improving tooling</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-type-systems"></a><a href="#grug-on-type-systems">Type Systems</a></h2>
<p>grug very like type systems make programming easier.  for grug, type systems most value when grug hit dot on keyboard and
list of things grug can do pop up magic.  this 90% of value of type system or more to grug</p>
<p>big brain type system shaman often say type correctness main point type system, but grug note some big brain type system
shaman not often ship code.  grug suppose code never shipped is correct, in some sense, but not really what grug mean
when say correct</p>
<p>grug say tool magic pop up of what can do and complete of code major most benefit of type system, correctness also good but not
so nearly so much</p>
<p>also, often sometimes caution beware big brains here!</p>
<p>some type big brain think in type systems and talk in lemmas, potential danger!</p>
<p>danger abstraction too high, big brain type system code become astral projection of platonic generic turing model of
computation into code base.  grug confused and agree some level very elegant but also very hard do anything like
record number of club inventory for Grug Inc. task at hand</p>
<p>generics especially dangerous here, grug try limit generics to container classes for most part where most value add</p>
<p>temptation generics very large is trick!  spirit demon complex love this one trick! beware!</p>
<p>always most value type system come: hit dot see what grug can do, never forget!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-expression-complexity"></a><a href="#grug-on-expression-complexity">Expression Complexity</a></h2>
<p>grug once like to minimize lines of code much as possible.  write code like this:</p>
<pre><code>  if(contact &amp;&amp; !contact.isActive() &amp;&amp; (contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS))) {
    // ...
  }
</code></pre>
<p>over time grug learn this hard debug, learn prefer write like so:</p>
<pre><code>  if(contact) {
    var contactIsInactive = !contact.isActive();
    var contactIsFamilyOrFriends = contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS);
    if(contactIsInactive &amp;&amp; contactIsFamilyOrFriends) {
        // ...
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>grug hear screams from young grugs at horror of many line of code and pointless variable and grug prepare defend self with club</p>
<p>club fight start with other developers attack and grug yell: "easier debug!  see result of each expression more clearly and good name!  easier
understand conditional expression!  EASIER DEBUG!"</p>
<p>definitely easier debug and once club fight end calm down and young grug think a bit, they realize grug right</p>
<p>grug still catch grug writing code like first example and often regret, so grug not judge young grug</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-dry"></a><a href="#grug-on-dry">DRY</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> mean Don't Repeat Self, powerful maxim over mind of most
developers</p>
<p>grug respect DRY and good advice, however grug recommend balance in all things, as gruggest big brain aristotle recommend</p>
<p>grug note humourous graph by Lea Verou correspond with grug passion not repeat:</p>
<img alt="code concerns over time" src="https://grugbrain.dev/over-time.png">
<p>over time past ten years program grug not as concerned repeat code.  so long as repeat code simple enough and obvious
enough, and grug begin feel repeat/copy paste code with small variation is better than many callback/closures passed arguments
or elaborate object model: too hard complex for too little benefit at times</p>
<p>hard balance here, repeat code always still make grug stare and say "mmm" often, but experience show repeat code
sometimes often better than complex DRY solution</p>
<p>note well!  grug encourage over literal developer not take does work line too serious, is joke</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-soc"></a><a href="#grug-on-soc">Separation of Concerns (SoC)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concern (SoC)</a> another powerful idea over many developer
mind, idea to separate different aspects of system into distinct sections code</p>
<p>canonical example from web development: separation of style (css file), markup (html file) and logic (javascript file)</p>
<p>here grug much more sour faced than DRY and in fact write big brained essay on alternative design principle
<a href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/">locality of behavior (LoB)</a> against SoC</p>
<p>grug much prefer put code on the thing that do the thing.  now when grug look at the thing grug know the thing what the
thing do, alwasy good relief!</p>
<p>when separate of concern grug must often all over tarnation many file look understand what how button do, much confuse
and time waste: bad!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-closures"></a><a href="#grug-on-closures">Closures</a></h2>
<p>grug like closures for right job and that job usually abstracting operation over collection of objects</p>
<p>grug warn closures like salt, type systems and generics: small amount go long way, but easy spoil things too much use
give heart attack</p>
<p>javascript developers call very special complexity demon spirit in javascript "callback hell" because too much closure
used by javascript libraries very sad but also javascript developer get what deserved let grug be frank</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-logging"></a><a href="#grug-on-logging">Logging</a></h2>
<p>grug huge fan of logging and encourage lots of it, especially in cloud deployed.  some non-grugs say logging expensive
and not important.  grug used think this way no more</p>
<p>funny story: grug learn idol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">rob pike</a> working on logging at google and decide:
"if rob pike working on logging, what grug do there?!?" so not pursue.  turn out logging <em>very</em> important to google so
of course best programmer work on it, grug!</p>
<p>don't be such grug brain, grug, much less shiney rock now!</p>
<p>oh well, grug end up at good company anyway and rob pike dress habit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KINIAgRpkDA">increasingly erratic</a>, so all work out in end, but
point stand: logging very important!</p>
<p>grug tips on logging are:</p>
<ul>
<li>log all major logical branches within code (if/for)</li>
<li>if "request" span multiple machine in cloud infrastructure, include request ID in all so logs can be grouped</li>
<li>if possible make log level dynamically controlled, so grug can turn on/off when need debug issue (many!)</li>
<li>if possible make log level per user, so can debug specific user issue</li>
</ul>
<p>last two points are especially handy club when fighting bugs in production systems very often</p>
<p>unfortunately log libraries often very complex (java, <a href="https://stackify.com/logging-java/">why you do?</a>) but worth investing
time in getting logging infrastructure "just right" pay off big later in grug experience</p>
<p>logging need taught more in schools, grug think</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-concurrency"></a><a href="#grug-on-concurrency">Concurrency</a></h2>
<p>grug, like all sane developer, fear concurrency</p>
<p>as much as possible, grug try to rely on simple concurrency models like stateless web request handlers and simple
remote job worker queues where jobs no interdepend and simple api</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">optimistic concurrency</a> seem work well for web stuff</p>
<p>occasionally grug reach for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">thread local variable</a>, usually when
writing framework code</p>
<p>some language have good concurrent data structure, like java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">ConcurrentHashMap</a>
but still need careful grug work to get right</p>
<p>grug has never used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">erlang</a>, hear good things, but language
look wierd to grug sorry</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-optimizing"></a><a href="#grug-on-optimizing">Optimizing</a></h2>
<p>ultra biggest of brain developer once say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>premature optimization is the root of all evil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this everyone mostly know and grug in humble violent agreement with ultra biggest of big brain</p>
<p>grug recommend always to have concrete, real world perf profile showing specific perf issue before begin optimizing.</p>
<p>never know what actual issue might be, grug often surprise!  very often!</p>
<p>beware only cpu focus: easy to see cpu and much big o notation thinking having been done in school,
but often not root of all slowness, surprise to many including grug</p>
<p>hitting network equivalent of many, many millions cpu cycle and always to be minimized if possible, note well big brain
microservice developer!</p>
<p>inexperienced big brain developer see nested loop and often say "O(n^2)?  Not on my watch!"</p>
<p>complexity demon spirit smile</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-apis"></a><a href="#grug-on-apis">APIs</a></h2>
<p>grug love good apis.  good apis not make grug think too much</p>
<p>unfortunately, many apis very bad, make grug think quite a bit.  this happen many reasons, here two:</p>
<ul>
<li>API creators think in terms of implementation or domain of API, rather than in terms of use of API</li>
<li>API creators think too abstract and big brained</li>
</ul>
<p>usually grug not care too deeply about detail of api: want write file or sort list or whatever, just want to call
<code>write()</code> or <code>sort()</code> or whatever</p>
<p>but big brain api developers say:</p>
<p>"not so fast, grug!  is that file <em>open for write</em>? did you define a <em>Comparator</em> for that sort?"</p>
<p>grug find self restraining hand reaching for club again</p>
<p>not care about that stuff right now, just want sort and write file mr big brain!</p>
<p>grug recognize that big brain api designer have point and that <em>sometime</em> these things matter, but often do not.
big brain api developers better if design for simple cases with simple api, make complex cases possible
with more complex api</p>
<p>grug call this "layering" apis: two or three different apis at different level complexity for various grug needs</p>
<p>also, if object oriented, put api on thing instead of elsewhere. java worst at this!</p>
<p>grug want filter list in java</p>
<p>"Did you convert it to a stream?"</p>
<p>fine, grug convert to stream</p>
<p>"OK, now you can filter."</p>
<p>OK, but now need return list!  have stream!</p>
<p>"Well, did you collect your stream into a list?"</p>
<p>what?</p>
<p>"Define a Collector&lt;? super T, A, R&gt; to collect your stream into a list"</p>
<p>grug now swear on ancestor grave he club every single person in room, but count two instead and remain calm</p>
<p>put common thing like <code>filter()</code> on list and make return list, listen well big brain java api developer!</p>
<p>nobody care about "stream" or even hear of "stream" before, is not networking api, all java grugs use list mr big brain!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-parsing"></a><a href="#grug-on-parsing">Parsing</a></h2>
<p>grug love make programming language at drop of hat and
say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent</a>
most fun and beautiful way create parser</p>
<p>unfortunately many big brain school teach only parser generator tool.  here grug usual love of tool is not: parser
generator tool generate code of awful snakes nest: impossible understand, bottom up, what?  hide recursive nature of
grammar from grug and debug impossible, very bad according grug!</p>
<p>grug think this because while complexity demon bad for code base and understand, complexity demon very good for generation
of much academic papers, sad but true</p>
<p>production parser almost always recursive descent, despite ignore by schools!  grug furious when learn how simple parse
is! parsing not big brain only magic: so can you!</p>
<p>grug very elated find big brain developer Bob Nystrom redeem the big brain tribe and write excellent book on recursive
descent: <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></p>
<p>book available online free, but grug highly recommend all interested grugs purchase book on general principle, provide
much big brain advice and grug love book <em>very</em> much except visitor pattern (trap!)</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-visitor-pattern"></a><a href="#grug-on-visitor-pattern">The Visitor Pattern</a></h2>

<h2><a name="grug-on-front-end-development"></a><a href="#grug-on-front-end-development">Front End Development</a></h2>
<p>some non-grugs, when faced with web development say:</p>
<p>"I know, I'll split my front end and back end codebase up and use a hot new SPA library talking to a GraphQL JSON API back end
over HTTP (which is funny because I'm not transferring hypertext)"</p>
<p>now you have two complexity demon spirit lairs</p>
<p>and, what is worse, front end complexity demon spirit even more powerful and have deep spiritual hold on entire front end
industry as far as grug can tell</p>
<p>back end developers try keep things simple and can work ok, but front end developers make very complex very quickly and
introduce lots of code, demon complex spirit</p>
<p>even when website just need put form into database or simple brochure site!</p>
<p>everyone do this now!</p>
<p>grug not sure why except maybe facebook and google say so, but that not seem very good reason to grug</p>
<p>grug not like big complex front end libraries everyone use</p>
<p>grug make <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> and <a href="https://hyperscript.org/">hyperscript</a> to avoid</p>
<p>keep complexity low, simple HTML, avoid lots javascript, the natural ether of spirit complexity demon</p>
<p>maybe they work for you, but no job post, sorry</p>
<p>react better for job and also some type application, but also you become alcolyte of complexity demon whether you like
or no, sorry such is front end life</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-fads"></a><a href="#grug-on-fads">Fads</a></h2>
<p>grug note lots of fads in development, especially front end development today</p>
<p>back end better more boring because all bad ideas have tried at this point maybe (still retry some!)</p>
<p>still trying all bad ideas in front end development so still much change and hard to know</p>
<p>grug recommend taking all revolutionary new approach with grain salt: big brains have working for long
time on computers now, most ideas have tried at least once</p>
<p>grug not saying can't learn new tricks or no good new ideas, but also much of time wasted on recycled bad ideas, lots of
spirit complexity demon power come from putting new idea willy nilly into code base</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-fold"></a><a href="#grug-on-fold">Fear Of Looking Dumb</a></h2>
<p>note!  very good if senior grug willing to say publicly: "hmmm, this too complex for grug"!</p>
<p>many developers Fear Of Looking Dumb (FOLD), grug also at one time FOLD, but grug learn get over: very important senior
grug say "this too complicated and confuse to me"</p>
<p>this make it ok for junior grugs to admit too complex and not understand as well, often such case!  FOLD major source of
complexity demon power over developer, especially young grugs!</p>
<p>take FOLD power away, very good of senior grug!</p>
<p>note: important to make thinking face and look big brained when saying though.  be prepare for big brain or, worse and
much more common, <em>thinks</em> is big brain to make snide remark of grug</p>
<p>be strong! no FOLD!</p>
<p>club sometimes useful here, but more often sense of humor and especially last failed project by big brain very useful,
so collect and be calm</p>

<p>grug note many such impostor feels in development</p>
<p>always grug one of two states: grug is ruler of all survey, wield code club like thor OR grug have no idea what doing</p>
<p>grug is mostly latter state most times, hide it pretty well though</p>
<p>now, grug make softwares of much work and <a href="https://star-history.com/#bigskysoftware/htmx&amp;bigskysoftware/_hyperscript&amp;Date">moderate open source success</a>
, and yet grug himself often feel not any idea what doing!  very often!  grug still fear make mistake break everyone code and
disappoint other grugs, imposter!</p>
<p>is maybe nature of programming for most grug to feel impostor and be ok with is best: nobody imposter if everybody imposter</p>
<p>any young grug read this far probably do fine in program career even if frustrations and worry is always to be there, sorry</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2>Complaint alleges software company misled investors about its cybersecurity practices and known risks</h2></p><p>
          Washington D.C.,           Oct. 30, 2023 —
        </p><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Austin, Texas-based software company SolarWinds Corporation and its chief information security officer, Timothy G. Brown, for fraud and internal control failures relating to allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. The complaint alleges that, from at least its October 2018 initial public offering through at least its December 2020 announcement that it was the target of a massive, nearly two-year long cyberattack, dubbed “SUNBURST,” SolarWinds and Brown defrauded investors by overstating SolarWinds' cybersecurity practices and understating or failing to disclose known risks.&nbsp;In its filings with the SEC during this period, SolarWinds allegedly misled investors by disclosing only generic and hypothetical risks at a time when the company and Brown knew of specific deficiencies in SolarWinds’ cybersecurity practices as well as the increasingly elevated risks the company faced at the same time.</p>

<p>As the complaint alleges, SolarWinds’ public statements about its cybersecurity practices and risks were at odds with its internal assessments, including a 2018 presentation prepared by a company engineer and shared internally, including with Brown, that SolarWinds’ remote access set-up was “not very secure” and that someone exploiting the vulnerability “can basically do whatever without us detecting it until it’s too late,” which could lead to “major reputation and financial loss” for SolarWinds. Similarly, as alleged in the SEC’s complaint, 2018 and 2019 presentations by Brown stated, respectively, that the “current state of security leaves us in a very vulnerable state for our critical assets” and that “[a]ccess and privilege to critical systems/data is inappropriate.”</p>

<p>In addition, the SEC’s complaint alleges that multiple communications among SolarWinds employees, including Brown, throughout 2019 and 2020 questioned the company’s ability to protect its critical assets from cyberattacks. For example, according to the SEC’s complaint, in June 2020, while investigating a cyberattack on a SolarWinds customer, Brown wrote that it was “very concerning” that the attacker may have been looking to use SolarWinds’ Orion software in larger attacks because “our backends are not that resilient;” and a September 2020 internal document shared with Brown and others stated, “the volume of security issues being identified over the last month have [sic] outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”</p>

<p>The SEC’s complaint alleges that Brown was aware of SolarWinds’ cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities but failed to resolve the issues or, at times, sufficiently raise them further within the company. As a result of these lapses, the company allegedly also could not provide reasonable assurances that its most valuable assets, including its flagship Orion product, were adequately protected.</p>

<p>SolarWinds made an incomplete disclosure about the SUNBURST attack in a December 14, 2020, Form 8-K filing, following which its stock price dropped approximately 25 percent over the next two days and approximately 35 percent by the end of the month.</p>

<p>“We allege that, for years, SolarWinds and Brown ignored repeated red flags about SolarWinds’ cyber risks, which were well known throughout the company and led one of Brown’s subordinates to conclude: ‘We’re so far from being a security minded company,’” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Rather than address these vulnerabilities, SolarWinds and Brown engaged in a campaign to paint a false picture of the company’s cyber controls environment, thereby depriving investors of accurate material information. Today’s enforcement action not only charges SolarWinds and Brown for misleading the investing public and failing to protect the company’s ‘crown jewel’ assets, but also underscores our message to issuers: implement strong controls calibrated to your risk environments and level with investors about known concerns.”</p>

<p>The SEC’s complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, alleges that SolarWinds and Brown violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; SolarWinds violated reporting and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act; and Brown aided and abetted the company’s violations. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Brown.</p>

<p>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by W. Bradley Ney, Lory Stone, and Benjamin Brutlag, with assistance from the Trial Unit’s Christopher Bruckmann and Kristen Warden, and was supervised by Carolyn M. Welshhans and Melissa R. Hodgman. The SEC’s litigation will be led by Mr. Bruckmann and Ms. Warden under the supervision of Melissa Armstrong.</p>

         }" data-reading-time="true"><p data-block-key="z5p66">It’s clear that email has become an essential part of daily communication. And whether you’re submitting a job application or staying in touch with a loved one, your emails should be safe and secure.</p><p data-block-key="deihi">Gmail’s AI-powered defenses <a href="https://safety.google/gmail/">stop more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware</a> from reaching inboxes and <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/holiday-season-scams/">block nearly 15 billion unwanted emails</a> every day. But now, nearly 20 years after Gmail launched, the threats we face are more complex and pressing than ever.</p><p data-block-key="46ole">So today, we’re introducing new requirements for bulk senders — those who send more than 5,000 messages to Gmail addresses in one day — to keep your inbox even safer and more spam-free.</p><h2 data-block-key="fh3ee">Focus on email validation</h2><p data-block-key="cs1bi">Many bulk senders don’t appropriately secure and configure their systems, allowing attackers to easily hide in their midst. To help fix that, we’ve focused on a crucial aspect of email security: the validation that a sender is who they claim to be. As basic as it sounds, it’s still sometimes impossible to verify who an email is from given the web of antiquated and inconsistent systems on the internet.</p><p data-block-key="f1d8c">Last year we started requiring that emails sent to a Gmail address must have some form of authentication. And we’ve seen the number of unauthenticated messages Gmail users receive plummet by 75%, which has helped declutter inboxes while blocking billions of malicious messages with higher precision.</p><p data-block-key="3vage">That’s great progress, but there’s much more we need to do — starting with new requirements for large senders.</p><h2 data-block-key="53u78">New requirements for bulk senders</h2><p data-block-key="uma9">By February 2024, Gmail will start to require that bulk senders:</p><ol><li data-block-key="838h2"><b>Authenticate their email:</b> You shouldn’t need to worry about the intricacies of email security standards, but you should be able to confidently rely on an email’s source. So we're requiring those who send significant volumes to strongly authenticate their emails following well-established <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124">best practices</a>. Ultimately, this will close loopholes exploited by attackers that threaten everyone who uses email.<br></li><li data-block-key="9nsf4"><b>Enable easy unsubscription:</b> You shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to stop receiving unwanted messages from a particular email sender. It should take one click. So we’re requiring that large senders give Gmail recipients the ability to unsubscribe from commercial email in one click, and that they process unsubscription requests within two days. We’ve built these requirements on open standards so that once senders implement them, everyone who uses email benefits.<br></li><li data-block-key="ar3h6"><b>Ensure they’re sending wanted email:</b> Nobody likes spam, and Gmail already includes <a href="https://safety.google/gmail/">many tools</a> that keep unwanted messages out of your inbox. To add yet another protection, moving forward, we’ll enforce a clear spam rate threshold that senders must stay under to ensure Gmail recipients aren’t bombarded with unwanted messages. This is an industry first, and as a result, you should see even less spam in your inbox.</li></ol><p data-block-key="770m9">We aren’t the only ones pushing for these changes. Our industry partners also see the pressing need to institute them: "No matter who their email provider is, all users deserve the safest, most secure experience possible,” says Marcel Becker, Sr. Dir. Product at Yahoo. “In the interconnected world of email, that takes all of us working together. Yahoo looks forward to working with Google and the rest of the email community to make these common sense, high-impact changes the new industry standard."</p><p data-block-key="1thnm">These practices should be considered basic email hygiene, and many senders already meet most of these requirements. For those who need help to improve their systems, we’re sharing <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126">clear guidance</a> before enforcement begins in February 2024.<br></p><p data-block-key="250nh">These changes are like a tune-up for the email world, and by fixing a few things under the hood, we can keep email running smoothly. But just like a tune-up, this is not a one-time exercise. Keeping email more secure, user friendly and spam-free requires constant collaboration and vigilance from the entire email community. And we'll keep working together to make sure your inbox stays safe.</p></div>

Like, I recently tried to delete an ACM cert that still was in use in a Cloudfront distribution - didn't work, but it took <i>20 minutes</i> for Terraform to recognize that, yes, there's an API error. It shouldn't have come so far given that the API call immediately errors out when trying over the CLI or Web Console, but instead of erroring out, Terraform retried for 20 minutes until it hit some sort of timeout.<p>To make it worse, you can't even <i>kill</i> Terraform safely because while it does register your Ctrl+C, it won't interrupt an ongoing process, and if you force kill it you run the very serious risk of corrupting your state file.</p><p>Seriously, I'm looking for OpenTofu to light some fire under the ass of Hashicorp. I don't know where all the VC money went, but for what's supposed to be the golden standard of IaC solutions, it's sometimes bloody ridiculous.</p><p>(Not to mention it's written in Go of all things which means there's virtually zero tooling and documentation to debug it or to develop anything for... especially when compared to the state of the art in Java, NodeJS or PHP)

MTV. Indiana Jones.</p><p>Apple is stumbling.</p><p>Its early breakout success and cash cow, the Wozniak wizardry of the 1977 Apple II, was creaking under its age.</p><p>The IBM PC has just hit the mass market, precipitating an unprecedented influx of purchase orders for PCs. 24-year-old whizkid Bill Gates was asked to supply IBM’s operating system.</p><blockquote><p><em>In 10 years, let’s check in on our friends at IBM to see how this move went.</em></p></blockquote><p>Apple’s LISA is shaping up to be their flagship product. After being a huge jerk to everybody for 5 years, Steve Jobs has been relegated by the board to run the low-end Macintosh project.</p><p><span>Initially a cheaper mass-market consumer product, the Macintosh under Jobs pivoted to focus on one thing: </span><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/677270/deja-vu-a-brief-history-of-every-mac-cpu-architecture/" rel="">upstaging the LISA team</a><span>. Steve introduced a cutting-edge </span><a href="https://crm.org/articles/xerox-parc-and-the-origins-of-gui" rel="">totally-not-stolen</a><span> graphical user interface to the Macintosh and demanded his team find the most advanced hardware available at the time.</span></p><p><span>If you want to </span><em>make a dent in the personal computer universe</em><span>, your choice of CPU is critical. This is the hardware in which your OS lives and the platform upon which you nurture your software ecosystem.</span></p><p><span>Very early PCs — the sort that hobbyists like Wozniak assembled in their garages — </span><a href="https://lowendmac.com/2014/cpus-motorola-68000/" rel="">used 8-bit CPUs</a><span>. But if you’re designing a powerful mass-market computer in the early 1980s, you’re going to want to use modern 16-bit processor architecture. There are really three major choices available: The Intel 8088, the Zilog Z8000, or the Motorola 68k.</span></p><p>Here, 8-bit and 16-bit refers to the size, or “width” in bits, of the registers and data bus with which the CPU works.</p><p><span>Let’s get on the same page: a </span><strong>CPU</strong><span> is a device that moves data from computer memory (RAM) into fast temporary memory (registers), runs operations on this data, then moves the output back into memory.</span></p><p><span>A </span><strong>register</strong><span> is the tiniest unit of electronic memory — they each hold just a few bits in the heart of the CPU. The CPU follows instructions (a computer program) to perform operations on this data — manipulating the bits (</span><code>1</code><span>s and </span><code>0</code><span>s).</span></p><p><span>These operations are performed by the </span><strong>Arithmetic-Logic Unit</strong><span> (ALU). This is basically a collection of circuits that perform simple, specialised jobs, such as:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Adding up binary numbers, e.g. </span><code>0010</code><span> + </span><code>0101</code><span> = </span><code>0111</code></p></li><li><p><span>Perform logical operations, e.g. </span><code>NOT</code><span> </span><code>0000</code><span> = </span><code>1111</code></p></li><li><p><span>Shift bits around, e.g. left-shifting </span><code>0011</code><span> by 1 place becomes </span><code>0110</code></p></li></ul><p><span>The CPU’s control unit decodes instructions one at a time to decide what </span><em>data</em><span> should move to which </span><em>register</em><span>, and which </span><em>register’s data</em><span> should go through which </span><em>ALU circuitry</em><span>.</span></p><p>Perform these operations lots of times, very quickly, and it adds up to outputs such as matrix multiplication, collision physics in a video game, or rasterising image data into on-screen pixels.</p><p>So why does bit width matter?</p><p><span>An 8-bit CPU can run a </span><code>NOT</code><span> operation on </span><code>0010110</code><span> in one clock cycle, inverting its bits into </span><code>1101001</code><span>. A 16-bit CPU leaves this in the dust, converting a hefty </span><code>10100100010110</code><span> into </span><code>01011001101001</code><span> in the same amount of time.</span></p><p>Moreover, a single 8-bit register can point at 2⁸ different byte ‘addresses’ in RAM — a meagre 256 locations in which we can look for data. Due to this limitation, most 8-bit computers needed two registers to store memory addresses. 16-bit registers, or two 8-bit registers stacked against each other, can point to 2¹⁶ memory addresses, meaning access to 64kB of memory.</p><p><strong>Endian-ness</strong><span> becomes a major compatibility consideration when upgrading from 8-bit (1 byte) to 16-bit CPUs (2 bytes). Systems are either big-endian or little-endian, which defines the order in which they store bytes — for example, the number 41,394, in hexadecimal fashion, would be stored on registers as </span><code>A1 B2</code><span> in big-endian systems and </span><code>B2 A1</code><span> in little-endian systems.</span></p><p><span>Lastly, the “</span><strong>data bus</strong><span>” refers to the circuity that connects the CPU to main memory; so a 16-bit bus is essentially twice as fast as an 8-bit bus at reading and writing data to and from memory.</span></p><p>Are we all on the same page? Let’s get back to Apple.</p><p>Let’s imagine you’re Apple’s VP of Hardware presenting to Jobs.</p><p>Which chip architecture do you think you’d choose?</p><ul><li><p>8/16-bit microprocessor — 8-bit registers with a 16-bit data bus.</p></li><li><p>20-bit memory addressing range — supports 640kB of RAM.</p></li><li><p>The IBM PC uses this chip architecture, so it has a strong existing software ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>Low-end price point of ~$35 (in 1983 dollars) thanks to Intel’s massive economies of scale.</p></li><li><p>Little-endian.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Pure 16-bit microprocessor — 16-bit registers and 16-bit data bus.</p></li><li><p>23-bit memory addressing rage — supports 8MB of RAM</p></li><li><p>Few large competitors use this architecture, minimal software ecosystem.</p></li><li><p><span>Mid-range price point of ~</span><a href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/captain-zilog-crushed-supplemental" rel="">$55 in 1983 dollars</a><span> while looking to build market share.</span></p></li><li><p>(Mostly) big-endian.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>16/32-bit microprocessor — 32-bit registers with a 16-bit data bus.</p></li><li><p>24-bit memory addressing range —supports 16MB of RAM.</p></li><li><p>Atari and Commodore use this chip architecture, some existing dev ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>Prior supplier relationship with Motorola through the Apple I, Apple II, and LISA.</p></li><li><p>Mid-to-high-end price point of ~$70 in 1983 dollars.</p></li><li><p>Big-endian.</p></li></ul><p><span>Overall, the Motorola 68k appeared to be the forward-thinking choice to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I" rel="">show why 1984 won’t be like 1984</a><span>. The weaker dev ecosystem and compatibility was a necessary sacrifice to provide brand differentiation against the dominant IBM PC.</span></p><p><span>What’s more, the 68k had a (mostly) </span><strong>orthogonal</strong><span> instruction set — this meant that (almost) every CPU operation could be performed on (almost) every register, whereas many competing CPUs had instructions restricted to specific registers. Orthogonality makes a CPU much easier to program, which is ideal when nurturing a nascent software ecosystem.</span></p><p>The 16MB addressing range ended up becoming critical: the Macintosh reserved the top 12MB of RAM for the OS, leaving a pithy 4MB of computer memory shared between software applications.</p><p>If you ever looked, dismayed, at the storage space available in your 16GB iPod Touch in 2012, you’ll know that nothing changes.</p><p>The year is 1994.</p><p>Steve Jobs was ousted by Apple 8 years ago, and is busy inventing Pixar and NeXT.</p><p>Apple is losing relevance.</p><p>Their former bitter PC rival, IBM, was in the long, painful process of having their lunch eaten by Microsoft.</p><p><span>Intel and Bill Gates, who was more commonly known as “the devil” in the 1990s, had entered an unholy marriage referred to as </span><em><a href="https://www.mayin.org/ajayshah/MEDIA/1998/wintel.html" rel="">Wintel</a><span> </span></em><span>that was carving out near-monopolies for both businesses.</span></p><p><span>Beyond consistent improvement to their powerful x86 chip architecture, Intel had just produced the greatest innovation since the transistor: giving their chip a cool name. The </span><em>Pentium </em><span>processor powered the Microsoft market-share munching machine.</span></p><p>That’s not to downplay the power of x86 chip architecture: Intel was earning its dominance with a 100MHz clock speeds and unparalleled power efficiency. The Motorola 68,000 chip family that carried the Macintosh into the 90’s was failing to keep up.</p><p>With the computer world under threat from monopoly, Apple joined up with its longtime partner, Motorola, and an unlikely ally, IBM. The plan: use the power of friendship to fight the forces of capitalism.</p><p>The AIM (Apple, IBM, Motorola) alliance was born. They realised that the x86 architecture had a key weakness: it utilised CISC architecture.</p><p><span>In response, AIM deployed a RISCy tactic: </span><strong>PowerPC</strong><span>.</span></p><p>There are two opposing chip design philosophies:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CISC</strong><span> (Complex Instruction Set Computer)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>RISC</strong><span> (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)</span></p></li></ul><p><span>To understand this, we need to get a handle on what is meant by </span><strong>Instruction Sets</strong><span>. In the previous section, I mentioned the CPU is running </span><em>operations</em><span> every </span><em>clock cycle</em><span>. These operations include things like moving data between registers, arithmetic, and logic operations.</span></p><p><span>Each CPU, constrained by the actual physical layout of its circuitry, can perform a limited number of different operations. These individual operations are represented by </span><strong>Assembly Language</strong><span>, also called machine code. This code is fed into the processor as a sequence of binary instructions and performed sequentially.</span></p><p>The two schools of thought lead to divergent approaches for building microprocessors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CISC </strong><span>accepts a complex instruction set to continue adding functionality to your CPU. Eventually, you gain the power to perform complex multi-step processing with single instructions, such as the (in)famous </span><em>evaluate polynomial</em><span> instruction, </span><code>POLY</code><span>. While this felt like magic, it also meant lots of internal state was held by the processor — and devastating performance hits if anything goes wrong.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>RISC</strong><span> takes the “Keep it simple, stupid!” approach. The big pitfall in CISC was complexity for the developers. The compiler engineers writing for CISC architectures had to consult 500-page manuals to find the instructions they might need, while RISC engineers were laughing with the 60-ish instructions stored in their registers — I mean — brains.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>To really see the primary performance boost endowed by RISC, you need to understand </span><strong>Pipelining</strong><span> by looking at the fetch-decode-execute cycle. In short, in a single clock cycle — the time for one operation to execute on the CPU — one of three things is done:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Fetch:</strong><span> The CPU fetches the next machine code instruction from memory.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Decode</strong><span>: The CPU’s control unit interprets the instruction to work out what it actually does.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Execute: </strong><span>The CPU executes the instruction — that is; moving data between registers and memory, or pushing bits through logic units.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>When your CPU uses a simpler RISC instruction set, these steps each take a single cycle, and you can </span><em>line up these operations concurrently</em><span>. In each clock cycle, you can get 3 instruction running, 1 at each of the 3 stages, in parallel. This results in (on average) one machine code operation executed per clock cycle.</span></p><p><span>When using CISC, each steps might not take a consistent 1-cycle-per-step. For the </span><code>POLY</code><span> operation, the execute step alone might take 10 cycles for an x² expression. In CISC, it’s hard to get your operations lining up nicely and therefore it’s tough to get good performance on complex instructions.</span></p><p>Pipelining, in short, is the concept of interleaving these instructions concurrently.</p><p>Apple and the AIM alliance hatched their scheme.</p><p>PowerPC, a modern Reduced Instruction Set Computer microprocessor architecture, was built to compete directly with the dominant Intel x86 architecture.</p><p>PowerPC promised better efficiency — that is, more CPU operations per watt of electricity — and since Apple controlled both software and hardware, they could optimise the Mac OS for this processor architecture.</p><p>Now they just had to migrate their ecosystem.</p><p>Software written for one processor doesn’t necessarily run on another. Different families of processors naturally contain different instruction sets — that is, the list of assembly instructions that define each CPU operation.</p><p>Here’s a slice of Motorola 68k assembly code:</p><pre><code>MOVE.L  $1000, D0     ; Load longword from address $1000 into data register D0
MOVE.L  $1004, D1     ; Load longword from address $1004 into data register D1
ADD.L   D1, D0        ; Add the values in D0 and D1, result stored in D0
MOVE.L  $1000, D0     ; Load longword from address $1000 into data register D1
NOT.L   D1            ; Invert all bits in D1</code></pre><p>And now, here is what PowerPC assembly code looked like:</p><pre><code>lwz     r3, 0x1000    ; Load word from address 0x1000 into register r3
lwz     r4, 0x1004    ; Load word from address 0x1004 into register r4
add     r5, r3, r4    ; Add the values in r3 and r4, result stored in r5
lwz     r3, 0x1000    ; Load word from address 0x1000 into register r3
not     r4, r3        ; Invert all bits in r3 and store the result in r4</code></pre><p><span>Since the machine instructions themselves are different, all the existing software in Apple’s ecosystem would need to be re-compiled, and in some cases re-written (such as when writing compiler software, or when code makes </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/1tg6dw/when_apple_made_the_switch_from_powerpc_to_intel/" rel="">assumptions about endian-ness</a><span>), in order to work on PowerPC machines.</span></p><p>Apple needed a plan.</p><p>Apple developed two strategies to manage this transition:</p><p><span>A </span><strong>Emulator</strong><span> was developed where PowerPC could </span><a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/transplanting-the-macs-central-processor-gary-davidian-and-his-68000-emulator/" rel="">emulate the Motorola CPU</a><span>. This translates instructions from one instruction set architecture to another in real-time.</span></p><p>This, unsurprisingly, incurs a huge performance cost. Fortunately, since the PowerPC CPUs were so powerful, emulation wasn’t usually a massive issue for consumers who were upgrading their hardware.</p><p><span>Another strategy which Apple employed was to use “</span><strong>fat binaries</strong><span>” for software during the transition period. This allowed software to contain code compiled for both 68k and PowerPC architectures. Therefore, engineers could ship a single app which worked on both Mac CPU platforms by containing two separate binaries.</span></p><p><span>In the era when 80MB was a </span><em>decent</em><span> hard drive, this was pretty annoying, so </span><a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Fat_binary" rel="">a cottage industry</a><span> of binary stripping tools spawned so end-users only needed to save the one that worked on their device.</span></p><p>Overall, Apple’s migration was a success. Moving from 68k to PowerPC lent a massive performance boost. Emulation and fat binaries allowed the software ecosystem to transition without a major hitch.</p><p><span>Unfortunately, the </span><em>Wintel</em><span> alliance was barely touched. Their market dominance grew to unprecedented levels with the release of Pentium and Windows 95. Windows grew into </span><em>the</em><span> default computing platform, tragically transforming school ICT curriculums the world over into “how to use Microsoft Office”.</span></p><p><span>Now that they had a solid hardware platform, Apple’s antiquated System 7 Mac OS became the primary headwind. </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Apple-buy-NeXT-Computer" rel="">Internal projects to create a modern competitor to Windows had failed</a><span>, which meant an acquisition was the only way out of a tailspin — simply buying a new OS.</span></p><p>This laid the groundwork for Apple’s purchase of NeXT and the return of Steve Jobs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg" width="500" height="419" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:419,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ac0a9dd-fd43-42c8-97d4-1cbc51128deb_500x419.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Intel Pentium 4 600 Series die (the large block to the left is its hefty 2MB L2 cache) — from </span><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/1621/3" rel="">AnandTech</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>By the early 2000s, Apple had its mojo back.</p><p><span>Jobs is CEO.

There will be a copy for everybody at the registration desk immediately following this keynote.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>As someone who became a developer in the 2010s, picking up a CD at a conference for your latest Xcode update seems so </span><em>quaint</em><span>. I wonder if the 2005 Betas were as glitchy as we are used to today.</span></p><p>What really fascinates me, however, is this:</p><p><span>Intel x86 processors are descended from a family of instruction set architectures pioneered in 1978 with the Intel 8086. Future processors, such as 1982's Intel 80186 or 2000’s Pentium 4, maintained backwards compatibility with this original instruction set. You’re reading that right: a program compiled on 8086 in the 70s would run fine in the 2000s </span><em>without any modification</em><span>.</span></p><p>But software ecosystem is just part of the story.</p><p>By 2006, high-end Intel x86 processors were projected to produce almost 5x the performance per watt compared to PowerPC, and nearly 1.5x the clock speed.</p><p>Intel was innovating on all aspects of their CPUs, such as:</p><ul><li><p>CPU Caches (L1, L2, and L3)</p></li><li><p>Branch Prediction</p></li><li><p>Superscalar Architecture</p></li></ul><p>Let’s go over these in some detail, since they are really important concepts in modern CPU performance. No piece single-handedly made Intel’s x86 the winner — the interconnected nature of a CPU meant that optimisation across all these components (and more) kept x86 ahead of the pack.</p><p>As previously explained, a CPU takes data from memory (RAM), places it in ultra-fast registers on the processor chip, and performs operations on that data. But at gigahertz clock speeds (1,000,000,000 operations per second), fetching instructions and data from RAM is far too slow.</p><p>Therefore, CPUs evolved on-chip caches to store middling amounts of data. These act as intermediary miniature blocks of RAM, stored physically closer to the chip itself, and allow for faster access to the necessary data.</p><p>These caches are themselves tiered:</p><ul><li><p><span>The </span><strong>L1 Cache </strong><span>is the smallest, fastest tier — directly integrated with the CPU core to store a small amount of data (a few kB) for rapid retrieval. Since these are integrated so close to the processor circuitry itself, there is an L1 Cache for each CPU core.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The </span><strong>L2 Cache</strong><span> is the middle layer, balancing speed and capacity, usually integrated somewhere on the CPU chip itself (and like all middle siblings, usually left to the side). This cache could be partitioned for each CPU core, or shared between them all.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The </span><strong>L3 Cache</strong><span> is the final buffer before the dreaded cache miss forces the CPU to search for data in RAM — a pyrrhic round-trip across the motherboard and back. This tier of storage is a shared memory pool of many megabytes between all CPU cores.</span></p></li></ul><p>This diagram from Harvard’s CS course explains better than I ever could:</p><p><span>Whenever a CPU needs to fetch instructions or data that isn’t stored in the nearest cache, it’s known as a </span><em>cache miss</em><span>. It needs to fetch from the next tier of cache, or the next tier, or RAM, or disk! This can badly impact speed and efficiency.</span></p><p>As a macro-scale analogy, consider how slowly your app appears to load when your program has to look for data over the network, instead of from local storage. Round-trips on the nano-scale of a CPU can add up quickly.</p><p><span>By the mid-2000s, </span><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/analysis-x86-vs-ppc-this-article-is-concerned-with-the-tec.31775/" rel="">Intel’s x86 CPU caches dwarfed those on PowerPC</a><span>, meaning lower latency and better performance. When supplemented with improved pre-fetching and predictive algorithms, expensive cache misses became less of a problem on x86.</span></p><p>These in turn improved performance-per-watt because when data is next to the processor, less electricity is physically being moved through the CPU’s circuitry to move bytes of memory around.</p><p>Branch Prediction sounds like arcane, occult magick when you first hear about it.</p><p><span>Branch instructions are the assembly code versions of conditional statements such as </span><code>if</code><span>/</span><code>else</code><span> — manifesting on the processor as </span><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/branch-predictor/" rel="">jumps, calls, and returns</a><span>. Clever CPUs use statistics to guess where the code is going, and try to keep the instruction pipeline filled for maximum utilisation.</span></p><p><span>The mechanism for this involves hardware algorithms built directly into the circuits of the CPU. A buffer called the Branch History Table caches recent branch outcomes. </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/correlating-branch-prediction/" rel="">Patterns are analysed</a><span> to draw predictions.</span></p><p><span>Advanced branch predictors apply the ultimate YOLO method: speculative execution, where instructions on the predicted branch are executed </span><em>before the outcome is confirmed</em><span>.</span></p><p>Intel’s silicon crystal balls helped the x86 processor go far faster than non-psychic CPUs.</p><p><span>Superscalar architecture is the ultimate in multitasking. Superscalar CPUs can simultaneously </span><a href="https://www.elprocus.com/superscalar-processor" rel="">execute multiple instructions</a><span> during a single clock cycle:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>In the </span><strong>fetch</strong><span> phase, the CPU collects multiple instructions from the operation pipeline.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The </span><strong>decode</strong><span> phase utilises multiple decoder units to evaluate each instruction.</span></p></li><li><p><span>These instructions may be dispatched to different </span><strong>execution </strong><span>units of the CPU.</span></p></li></ul><p>This architecture works because operations such as arithmetic, moving memory between registers, and floating-point operations require different pieces of circuitry on the ALU. Therefore, if you’re clever, several instructions can be performed in parallel.</p><p><span>This is a tough process to get right. </span><a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/aett" rel="">Bottlenecks can occur</a><span> if multiple simultaneous operations need to use the same resource such as the same register or the same ALU adder circuit. Dependency issues can also lead to stalls, especially if an instruction is stuck waiting on the result of another longer-running operation.</span></p><p>Intel had the will and, more importantly, the R&amp;D dollars, to get superscalar architecture working effectively on their CPU cores.</p><p>As well as caching, branch prediction, and superscalar architecture, Intel’s x86 chips further optimised many features of their CPUs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Advanced pipelining</strong><span> that split the fetch, decode, execute cycle </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/04/ask-ars-whats-the-relationship-between-cpu-clockspeed-and-performance/" rel="">into up to 21 stages</a><span> that allowed for far more instructions to run per second at a given clock speed.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Increased </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/To-what-degree-do-applications-for-x86-processors-utilize-multiple-cores-for-parallel-execution" rel="">numbers of </a><strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/To-what-degree-do-applications-for-x86-processors-utilize-multiple-cores-for-parallel-execution" rel="">execution units</a><span> </span></strong><span>in the ALUs to allow for easier parallelisation of operations from superscalar architecture.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Hyper-threading</strong><span> which allowed a single CPU core to present to the OS as 2 logical cores, enabling one core to </span><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/intel-hyper-threading-explained-1226271/" rel="">execute 2 threads simultaneously</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>Apple again employed their time-honoured transition techniques for a smooth CPU architecture migration.</p><p>Apple introduced universal binaries built for both CPU architectures, which could be set up with a simple Xcode build configuration.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

It has siblings such as the M1 Pro, the M1 Max, and the M1 Ultra. Today, you can even buy M2 chips in the latest hardware (but I’m holding out for M3 before I start petitioning my CTO).</span></p><p><span>The M1 is a </span><a href="https://www.production-expert.com/production-expert-1/why-are-the-apple-m1-m1-pro-and-m1-max-chips-so-fast" rel="">system-on-a-chip</a><span> (SoC). This is an approach to building hardware that differs from standard desktop PCs. Instead of mounting interchangeable components on a motherboard (such as CPU, storage, RAM, graphics card), SoCs integrate everything into a single component, which is why the approach lent itself naturally to space-constrained mobile devices.</span></p><p>Upgrading to an M1 MacBook for the first time is like magic. A real game-changer. Everything is lightning-fast, the cooling fan never seems to switch on, and the battery lasts all day on a single charge.</p><p><span>How is the M1 so powerful, when using</span><em> so little power?</em></p><p>As mentioned in the Intel section, the interconnected nature of a CPU usually makes it tough to evaluate outperformance between chip architectures.</p><p>Intel’s primary performance driver has been to shrink transistors and fit more, faster, CPU cores onto the chip. More, faster, CPU cores leads naturally to higher performance.</p><p><span>But in the case of the M1, there is a completely different approach which leads to its outperformance: </span><strong>Specialisation</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>The M1 chips apply a </span><a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2" rel="">heterogeneous computing strategy</a><span>. This means specialised components for specific workloads. PC gamers are already familiar with this. For decades, Nvidia has been selling graphics cards — GPUs — to handle the specialised parallel workloads you encounter with videogame rendering engines.</span></p><p>Apple takes this approach to the next level with a radical shift in the direction of heterogeneous workloads. The components of the M1 SoC are specialised for many computing tasks:</p><ul><li><p>Image processing circuitry</p></li><li><p>Mathematical signal processors</p></li><li><p>AI-accelerating neural engines</p></li><li><p>Dedicated video encoder and decoders</p></li><li><p>A secure enclave for encrypted storage</p></li><li><p>8 GPU cores with 128 parallel execution units</p></li><li><p><span>4 high-performance </span><em><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested" rel="">Firestorm</a></em><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested" rel=""> CPU cores</a></p></li><li><p><span>4 efficient, low-energy </span><em>Icestorm</em><span> CPU cores</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This approach to utilising twin sets of CPUs was coined by ARM as </span><a href="https://www.arm.com/technologies/big-little" rel="">big.LITTLE architecture</a><span>, which optimises power consumption for those general CPU workloads not dispatched to specialist components.</span></p><p><span>The Firestorm CPUs relentlessly execute time-sensitive workloads requested by the user; while the Icestorm CPUs handle background workloads more slowly while consuming </span><a href="https://www.imore.com/mac-apple-silicon-transition-everything-you-need-know" rel="">90% less power</a><span>.</span></p><p>As well as the core heterogeneous architecture of the Apple Silicon SoC, there are some further supplementary reasons for the astonishing M1 performance:</p><ul><li><p>Unified Memory Architecture</p></li><li><p>Out-of-order Execution</p></li><li><p>Physics: The Ultimate Constraint</p></li></ul><p><span>The M1 chips have a </span><strong><a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2" rel="">unified memory architecture</a></strong><span> shared between GPU and CPUs. This is a masterstroke for performance. When sending data to an external GPU for processing, a CPU usually needs to copy data into the memory owned by the GPU, before it could be picked up for processing.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>This is the problem </span><strong>Metal</strong><span> was introduced to solve — intermediary translation of a graphics driver utilises the CPU, which introduces a serious performance bottleneck when you really want graphics instructions to go to the GPU.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Interested? Read more in my previous entry in this series, </span><a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/through-the-ages-apple-animation-apis-2ab5925f546b#f4ef" rel="">Through the Ages: Apple Animation APIs</a><span>.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Why don’t all processors have integrated graphics?</p><p>In order to get this right, Apple had to solve two major problems that arise when integrating CPU and GPU onto a SoC:</p><ul><li><p>CPUs and GPUs like their data formatted differently. CPUs love to nibble small bytes little and often, GPUs like to guzzle massive blobs of data, infrequently, for massively parallel processing.</p></li><li><p>GPUs make heat. A lot of heat. This is why graphics cards have integrated cooling fans for that “jumbo jet” aesthetic.</p></li></ul><p>Apple’s approach allocates the same blocks of memory — both RAM and L3 cache — shared between both processors, in a format that can supply big chunks that the GPU likes at the high throughput that the CPU requires. Their ARM chips are low-energy enough to integrate on the same die without melting a hole through your lap(top).</p><p>While the heterogeneous architecture allows specialised workloads to go to the best tool for the job, the Firestorm CPU cores themselves are extremely powerful for general workloads.</p><p><span>We previously discussed superscalar architecture that enabled CPU cores to simultaneously fetch, decode, and dispatch multiple instructions at once. The M1 chips, by virtue of their RISC architecture, allow Apple to take this to the next level with </span><a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2#8ac1" rel="">out-of-order execution</a><span>.</span></p><p>ARM RISC instructions are all 4 bytes long (32 bits), while x86 CISC instructions vary from 1–15 bytes. This means ARM chips can easily split up a continuous stream of instruction bytes straight to decoders without any analysis overhead.</p><p><span>The basic M1 chip has an insane </span><strong>8 decoders</strong><span>, which the Firestorm CPU cores fill simultaneously each clock cycle. These instructions are dispatched in parallel to its various specialised pieces of circuitry.</span></p><p><span>Apple Silicon analyses a dependency graph between hundreds of instructions at once, so it knows what can be dispatched now and what needs to wait on results. Pair this with its </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WrMYCZMnhsGP4o3H33ioAUKL_bjuJSPt/view" rel="">advanced branch prediction</a><span>, and the M1 CPU is essentially </span><a href="https://mistborn.fandom.com/wiki/Atium" rel="">burning Atium</a><span>.</span></p><p>There is one final reason this SoC is so fast and so power-efficient. It’s the same concept we looked at when learning about CPU caches.</p><p><span>Simply put, everything on the M1 chip is physically so close together. Even with electrical signals moving literally at lightning speed, operations are simply </span><em>faster</em><span> when there is less distance to travel.</span></p><p>At GHz clock speeds, those nanoseconds add up.</p><p>For the M1 Ultra chips, designed to give the maximum output, Apple took a more blunt instrument out of its tool-belt. Instead of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, Tim Cook took out a sledgehammer.</p><p><span>The M1 Ultra chip is </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-m1-ultra-chip-moores-law/" rel="">simply two M1 Max chips stuck together</a><span>.</span></p><p>It’s perhaps a little more subtle than that — the bridging structure enables a pretty inter-chip throughput of 2.5TB/s, which allows the components to behave exactly as if they’re the same chip.</p><p>Apple continued to apply its battle-tested approach for the transition from Intel x86 to Apple Silicon.</p><p>Developers can build universal apps which contain both Intel and Apple Silicon binaries. Additionally, Rosetta has been upgraded to Rosetta II to invisibly interpret Intel instructions into ARM on-the-fly.</p><p><span>Grandiose as always, Apple claims that some </span><a href="https://www.imore.com/mac-apple-silicon-transition-everything-you-need-know" rel="">Intel apps and games will perform better</a><span> on ARM using Rosetta II than they did on their original.</span></p><p><span>It was a painful blow to Intel for one of their biggest customers to break off their longstanding partnership. Intel is somewhat </span><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/18/intels-apple-silicon-take/" rel="">in denial of reality</a><span> and is pretty sure they can catch up by investing further in their own.</span></p><p>Between Apple Silicon and the dominance of Nvidia for AI use cases, one thing is clear: Intel has been too complacent for too long.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Success breeds complacency, complacency breeds failure, only the paranoid survive”</em></p><p>- Andy Grove, Intel Co-Founder</p></blockquote><p>Originally, this was meant to be a brief history of Apple’s famous CPU architecture migrations, however as usual my curiosity kind of got away from me.

			<p>This will be a two part article: firstly, autistic attitudes towards those in authority, and secondly, how autistic people handle being in a position of authority.</p>
<p>I’ve written before about how autistic people often struggle to know how to act around authority figures. Actually, that’s not true– we don’t seem to <strong><em>care</em></strong> how we act around authority.</p>
<p>I think this is a vital distinction.</p>
<p>It’s not that we’re deficient, after all. It’s more that this <em>authority</em> business is a neurotypical notion that we don’t seem to share, and thus we tend to ignore it.</p>
<p><span>Let me give you an example. </span></p>
<p><span>Autistic children in school are somewhat notorious for finding it hard to adapt to the authority of teachers– some teachers more than others. This is not because they’re evil little ragamuffins, as some teachers would have it, but because their natural state is to assume equanimity. Autistic students (and I speak from long experience) will not bow to authority for authority’s sake. </span></p>
<p><span>They will respect it, if respect can be had, and they’ll do what they’re told</span><span><strong>— if it makes sense</strong></span><span>; but they won’t blindly accept authority. By this point, my teacher readers are wincing in pain as our main tool is automatically-accepted authority. </span></p>
<p><span>But what can I say? Autistic people </span><span><em>are</em></span><span> different! This is </span><span><strong>not</strong></span><span> a deficiency, in and of itself. I believe it’s an offshoot of our particular brand of empathy that we excel at. It is used to find the common ground between people, rather than the differences. I’m aware I may be romanticising autism a bit here, which is not my intention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So when presented with an authority figure, autistic people seek out what makes us the same, and in doing so obliterates the arbitrary (to us at least) difference of their ‘authority.’</p>
<p>We automatically seek to be on a level with *everyone* we meet. This is subconscious and not controllable, unless we really need to. It occurs throughout our lives from childhood to old age. It makes us *really weird* to neurotypical people, who seem to accept authority happily.</p>
<p>So another example: an autistic person meets their company’s CEO. They know who they are, but they greet them as an equal. They say <em>hi</em>. They crack a Chandler-esque joke. They are relaxed and unfazed by the massive authority that is shrinking their peers down.</p>
<p>This may be great! The CEO might think, <em>Wow! Here’s a go-getting individual</em>, if they’re nice and positive. But they may also think, <em>Who is this worm with no respect for my status?</em></p>
<p>Then, we’re screwed. Similarly, this trait can absolutely ruin us when the police are involved. Its bad enough in the UK, but being #AutisticWhileBlack in the USA can get you killed in altercations with the cops when this issue is occurring, and this is happening a lot.</p>
<p>So, to recap, autistic people– at least in my assessment– don’t recognise authority as a thing in and of itself. They will bow to greater expertise, experience, morality, and creativity, very happily, but not just to <em>authority</em> alone.</p>
<p>This is a very good and a very bad thing, because sadly, unearned authority is a big part of human existence. From police and the armed forces, whose authority is granted by an abstract “State,” to random adults in the street telling kids off– it’s <em>everywhere</em>. ￼￼</p>
<p>It’s imperative that these institutions need realise that there is a <strong>significant</strong> <strong>proportion</strong> of the population who will not accept blind authority, not because they’re baddies, or naughty, but <strong>because their brains are wired differently</strong>. This needs to be accepted now.</p>
<p>I’m not excusing autistic people of bad behaviour, by the way. There are always people willing to interpret my writing in the most negative possible light. I’m simply stating its a factor that needs to be understood.</p>
<h3>Autistics in Authority</h3>
<p>But what of part two? Of autistic people in authority? How does <em>this</em> work?</p>
<p>Well, here goes…</p>
<p>Firstly, unless you’re literally the Queen, there will always be further authority above you somewhere, so all the earlier stuff applies, but when it comes to dealing with our “subordinates” (I don’t even like using the word), we perhaps tend to be very accepting, reasonable, and fair. Is this a <em>thing</em>?</p>
<p>I know from my experience of being a manager/leader that I just wanted to let people do their job, and assumed they’d do it well. I wasn’t happy issuing diktats to them or punitive messages from higher up and tended to try to shield them from all that crap.</p>
<p>But this is not how managers are meant to behave. I couldn’t handle the “telling off” side of the job (like confronting people for being ill and absent- <em>wtf</em>!?), so I handed in my notice and went back to classroom teaching.</p>
<p>I feel that autistic people might struggle with the expectations of holding authority, but ironically that we would wield authority fairly and well.</p>

					<p>Another problem is when the whole “doesn’t blindly submit to authority” thing is pathologized in a child, along with with asking questions (AKA “talking back”) and trying to make sense of rules.  Then the parents or teachers decide they need to “break” this “problem child” through abuse.  It doesn’t end well.  Are they just trying to teach learned helplessness?</p>

					<p>I’m the exception to the rule here. I used to blindly bow down to authority, teachers, bosses, the police etc. That’s why I had no problem excepting authority when I went into the military. I think that this acceptance of authority was drummed into me at a very young age and my autism made me think it was the norm.</p>

					<p>I’m on the spectrum and I agree with the article for the most part. However, I don’t simply feel authority is equal with everyone. I’d certainly like it to be and in an idealistic world that would be the case. Personally, I think it’s something to be feared because too many people take advantage of it. As you may have said, people didn’t earn the positions that they’re in. Of course from my experience I’ve had bad experiences with all kinds of individuals in authority that abuse their power, and many of them have earned their positions simply because family members own a company, or simple favoritism. But I agree we shouldn’t blindly accept or follow it. I hate doing so and it causes a huge amount of stress for me especially when I have no choice (such as in a work place where it’s either do what they say agree or not, or leave your job). If I had a dime for every time I had a meltdown due to the stress authority causes, I’d be rich enough to buy the internet.</p>

					<p>That answers so many issues that I have had with authority! I am neurotypical but dont really seem to fit in anywhere. But I have had similar experiences. I can respect authority but I never seemed to have the fear that others had. Possibly because my father taught me early that it was Ok to question him on anything as long as I did not question his right to make the final decision.Of course by the time I was 16 he made it clear that he expected me to use common sense and respect for others so there were few “final decisions” that he had to make for me. So I think I learned to early to separate the authority as a person delegated to make the final decision and the person who as an individual who was placed in that position. Never realized that I was doing it. but also explains why I had issues with certain people who expected me to hold them in awe because they deemed themselves in authority of me.</p>

					<p>Of course, irrespective of being in charge or subordinate, we often have the compulsion to point out mistakes that person has made. Not to be nasty, but because we’re helpful: ‘surely they will want to know what they did wrong so they will not make the same mistake again’.</p>

					<p>I work in the pharmaceutical industry &amp; my boss said “your job is to follow procedures, not criticise management”. Funny, I thought it was to ensure our product is proven quality from go to whoa, at the least expense to our company. I have been trying to correct an unnecessarily complex quadruple check (of worksheets, NOT the product itself!) for over 18 months!</p>

					<p>I have the opposite tendency to want to follow my teacher’s rules and worship their authority, which was too far in the other direction for nearly all my teachers in my years of school. It caused me to majorly butt heads with one of my English professors in college. He’d always ask us “why do we read this story? Why does it appear on the syllabus?” And I’d be like “uh, duh you put it there so if we don’t read it we’ll get in trouble.” He hated that.</p>

					<p>Your experience in leadership is how I functioned as a charge nurse.  I surprised my peers who weren’t too thrilled with the idea of me being in charge because I can be so particular about how things are done.  </p>
<p>But as charge, I assumed my colleagues knew their jobs and how to do them.  I saw my role as making sure they had what they needed to get it done, not to micromanage their work.  </p>
<p>That didn’t fit with management by intimidation.  It lasted less than a year before I went back to floor nursing.  I’m glad.  I’m not management material.  I don’t like screwing people over and I hate office politics.  Why can’t we just do to work and do our jobs?</p>

					<p>The horrible version of management mentioned is actually considered bad, by management professionals. It’s common, but it is destructive. Good managers protect their teams, trust them to do their jobs, and provide guidance and help to do better. Good managers in abusive management systems need techniques to handle the difference, because they’ll get hit with the load of bull, and it can be heavy lifting.</p>
<p>High performance teams that are not completely burned out already tend to thrive with the management you describe.</p>
<p>Also, look up info on Power Distance as a cultural dimension. Both type of authority (power, knowledge, relational, etc.) and power distance apply. People will differ, and culture of origin may matter (including family culture), but yeah, power distances tend to be small with many autistic people – even where the authority is recognized.</p>

					<p>Good article.  I am looking forward to the next part.</p>
<p>Self Dx’d autist here who has been in leadership and senior management roles.  I now do lectures to MBA students on Neurodiversity. I was always considered a bit of a political liability ( I even told a top dog they should attend a training course when they were freeballing about a topic they were ignorant of).  My manager almost visibly sh*t himself as I said it.</p>
<p>In my opinion,  Respect by Autistic people is earnt,  not assumed.  This can be troublesome in social hierarchies permeated by people whose mantra is to fake it until you make it.  In fact those environments tend to be toxic to the health of Autistic people who work within them.</p>
<p>Whilst Autists are an excellent innoculation to groupthink and other disastrous effects of the dominant social hierarchy,  the drawbacks for Autistic people who gravitate into decision making roles is significant.</p>

					<p>Also,  Autistic traits can actually result in more innovative teams.  By acting as a “sh*t umbrella” and focussing on enabling your team,  you can create a degree of psychological safety.</p>
<p>The issue is often the higher level hierarchies which end up sandwiching the autistic leader.</p>
<p>I have taken to trying to not refer to managers or leaders now and to instead refer to the functions – managers as enablers and leaders as catalyzers.  I have seen excellent enablers and catalyzers who haven’t been christened with a role of leader/manager and even more often I have seen  peo p le in roles of leaders/managers who have no capability to catalyze or enable people.</p>

					<p>“I believe it’s an offshoot of our particular brand of empathy that we excel at” – This phrase has stuck in my head and I have spent the last two days thinking about it. It’s such a kind way of interpreting so much of my way of being. I’ve decided for me it means I’m not necessarily in conflict with authority, or any of the other bafflingly weird ways that neurotypicals behave. I just a see them with more clarity.<br>
Maybe nonsense but I’m going to go with it, I think it will help, thanks.</p>

					<p>Your grandchild would benefit from an explanation of the nuances of how authority is granted, exercised, and challenged correctly and in a healthy manner. For myself, the turning point was when I understood the difference between -relational- and -positional- authority. </p>
<p>Relational authority is with a person: someone whom has invested in my wellbeing or vice-versa. I’m far more likely to obey someone whom I know cares about my wellbeing and has proven that concern over time. An example of expression of relational authority would be when my grandmother asks me to do something for her or wants to give me some cogent advice. </p>
<p>Positional authority is with an office (not the person currently occupying the office), which is as an expression of the will of the governed. Obedience in this instance is proportional to the congruence of the office to its purpose (its legitimacy), as well as the manner of how that authority is expressed.</p>
<p>All that being said, obedience is a choice and not one to be taken lightly. In the most extreme case, even if someone were holding a gun to my head to compel obedience, it’s still a choice.</p>
<p>How we conduct ourselves in the presence of authority is a direct reflection of our understanding of personal agency and a deep appreciation of our responsibilities to ourselves, but also those around us. I wish you the very best with your grandchild!</p>

					<p>One aspect of the inability to recognize authority is in judging people within the hierarchy accurately. This means that you do not easily recognize who will move up and thus who you should form an allegiance with. It can significantly impair the person’s level. I think the typical corporate aggressive management type views the autistic manager with suspicion as they don’t sense the killer instinct that they possess and expect in other managers.</p>

        <p>LONDON--(<span itemprop="provider publisher copyrightHolder" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" itemid="https://www.businesswire.com"><span itemprop="name"><a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" rel="nofollow" itemprop="url" href="https://www.businesswire.com/">BUSINESS WIRE</a></span></span>)--UK software company Threads Software Limited and its lawyers have today (30 October) written to Meta’s Instagram giving it 30 days to stop using the name Threads for their service in the UK. If it does not, Threads Software Limited will seek an injunction from the English Courts.

</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
Threads - an intelligent message hub provided by Threads Software Limited - was conceived and trademarked in 2012 by JPY Ltd. The service has been actively promoted worldwide since 2014.

</p><p>
In 2018, the first commercial sale was made in the USA, and as a result JPY Ltd spun off a new company, Threads Software Ltd. It has since licenced nearly 1,000 organisations worldwide with sales currently growing at 200% a year.

</p><p>
From April 2023, Meta’s lawyers made four offers to purchase the domain ‘threads.app’ from Threads Software Ltd. Every offer was declined. It was made clear to Meta’s Instagram that the domain was not for sale.

</p><p>
In July 2023, Meta’s Instagram announced its ‘threads’ social media platform and removed Threads Software Limited from its Facebook platform.

</p><p>
Dr John Yardley, Managing Director of Threads Software Ltd said: “Taking on a US$150 billion company is not an easy decision for us to make. We have invested 10 years in our platform, establishing a recognised brand in the name, Threads. Our business now faces a serious threat from one of the largest technology companies in the world.

</p><p>
“We recognise that this is a classic ‘David and Goliath’ battle with Meta. And whilst they may think they can use whatever name they want, that does not give them the right to use the Threads brand name.

</p><p>
“We want them to stop using the Threads name with immediate effect. If they do not, we will seek an injunction from the UK courts.”

</p><p>
<b>About Threads Software</b>

</p><p>
Threads is a Cloud-based service that captures, transcribes, and organises all of a company’s digital messages (emails and phone calls) into one easily searchable database.

</p><p>
Message meta-data is extracted to automatically and intelligently create a subscriber-specific address book, eliminating the need to manually maintain directories of contacts and companies.

</p><p>
Threads is able to provide high-quality transcriptions by extracting VoIP call and routing data at much greater resolution than most call recording systems. Additionally, by intelligently processing email data, Threads can apply vital <i>contex</i>t to phone calls and further improve its understanding of speech.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome back to <a href="https://zilliz.com/blog?tag=39&amp;page=1">Vector Database 101</a>.</p>
<p>In the previous tutorial, we deep-dived into <a href="https://zilliz.com/blog/hierarchical-navigable-small-worlds-HNSW">Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW)</a>. HNSW is a graph-based indexing algorithm that today is one of the most popular indexing strategies used in <a href="https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-vector-database">vector databases</a>.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://codelabs.milvus.io/">tutorial</a>, we'll switch gears and talk about tree-based vector indexes. Specifically, we'll talk about <strong>Approximate Nearest Neighbor Oh Yeah (Annoy)</strong>, an algorithm that uses a forest of trees to conduct the nearest neighbor search. For those familiar with random forests or gradient-boosted decision trees, Annoy can seem like a natural extension of these algorithms, only for the nearest neighbor search rather than machine learning. As with our HNSW tutorial, we'll first walk through how Annoy works from a high level before developing our own simple Python implementation.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/847199990?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="ANNOY Vector Index | Vector Database Fundamentals"></iframe></p>

<p>While HNSW is built upon the connected graph and skip list, Annoy uses binary search trees as the core data structure. The key idea behind Annoy (and other tree-based indexes) is to repeatedly partition our vector space and search only a subset of the partitions for nearest neighbors. If this sounds like IVF, you're right; the idea is the same, but the execution is slightly different.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/spotify/annoy/master/ann.png">
</p>
<p><sub>Annoy, visualized (from https://github.com/spotify/annoy).</sub></p>
<p>The best way to understand Annoy is to visualize how a single tree is built. However, remember that high-dimensional hyperspaces are very different from 2D/3D Euclidean spaces from an intuitive perspective, so the images below are only for reference.</p>
<p>Let's start with indexing. For Annoy, this is a recursive process where the maximum size of the call stack is the depth of the tree. In the first iteration, two random dataset vectors, <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, are selected, and the full hyperspace is split along a hyperplane equidistant from both <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>. Then, vectors in the "left" half of the hyperspace get assigned to the left half of the tree, while vectors in the "right" half of the subspace are given to the right half of the tree. Note that this can be done without actually computing the hyperplane itself - for every dataset vector, we need to determine whether <strong>a</strong> (left) or <strong>b</strong> (right) is closer.</p>
<p>

<center>
<p>After the first, second, and Nth iteration, respectively. <a href="https://sds-aau.github.io/M3Port19/portfolio/ann/">Source</a>.</p>
</center>
<p>The second iteration repeats this process for both the left and right subtrees generated by the first iteration, resulting in a tree with a depth of two and four leaf nodes. This process continues for the third, fourth, and subsequent iterations until a leaf node has fewer than a pre-defined number of elements K. In the <a href="https://github.com/spotify/annoy/blob/master/src/annoylib.h#L892">original Annoy implementation</a>, <code>K</code> is a variable value that the user can set.</p>
<p>With the index fully built, we can now move on to querying. Given some query vector <strong>q</strong>, we can search by traversing the tree. A hyperplane splits each intermediate node, and we can determine which side of the hyperplane the query vector falls on by computing its distance to the left and right vectors. We repeat this process until we reach a leaf node containing an array of, at most, <code>K</code> vectors. We can then rank and return these vectors to the user.</p>
<p>Now we know how Annoy works, and let's start with the implementation. As usual, we'll first create a dataset of (128 dimensional) vectors:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dataset = np.random.normal(size=(<span>1000</span>, <span>128</span>))
</code></pre>
<p>Let's first define a <code>Node</code> class containing left and right subtrees:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Node</span>(<span>object</span>):
    <span>"""Initialize with a set of vectors, then call `split()`.
    """</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self, ref: np.ndarray, vecs: <span>List</span>[np.ndarray]</span>):
        self._ref = ref
        self._vecs = vecs
        self._left = <span>None</span>
        self._right = <span>None</span>

<span>    @property</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>ref</span>(<span>self</span>) -&gt; <span>Optional</span>[np.ndarray]:
        <span>"""Reference point in n-d hyperspace. Evaluates to `False` if root node.
        """</span>
        <span>return</span> self._ref

<span>    @property</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>vecs</span>(<span>self</span>) -&gt; <span>List</span>[np.ndarray]:
        <span>"""Vectors for this leaf node. Evaluates to `False` if not a leaf.
        """</span>
        <span>return</span> self._vecs

<span>    @property</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>left</span>(<span>self</span>) -&gt; <span>Optional</span>[<span>object</span>]:
        <span>"""Left node.
        """</span>
        <span>return</span> self._left

<span>    @property</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>right</span>(<span>self</span>) -&gt; <span>Optional</span>[<span>object</span>]:
        <span>"""Right node.
        """</span>
        <span>return</span> self._right
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>vecs</code> variable contains a list of all vectors within the node. If the length of this list is less than some value <code>K</code>, then they will remain as-is; otherwise, these vectors will then get propagated to <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, with <code>vecs[0]</code> and <code>vecs[1]</code> remaining as the two randomly selected vectors used to split the hyperplane.</p>
<p>Let's now move to indexing. First, Recall that every node in the tree is split by a hyperplane orthogonal to the line connecting two randomly selected dataset vectors. Conveniently, we can determine which side of the hyperplane a query vector lies on by computing distance. As usual, we'll use NumPy's vectorized math for this:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>_is_query_in_left_half</span>(<span>q, node</span>):
   <span># returns `True` if query vector resides in left half</span>
   dist_l = np.linalg.norm(q - node.vecs[<span>0</span>])
   dist_r = np.linalg.norm(q - node.vecs[<span>1</span>])
   <span>return</span> dist_l &lt; dist_r
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's move to building the actual tree.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random


<span>def</span> <span>split_node</span>(<span>node, K: <span>int</span>, imb: <span>float</span></span>) -&gt; <span>bool</span>:

    <span># stopping condition: maximum # of vectors for a leaf node</span>

    <span># continue for a maximum of 5 iterations</span>

        left_vecs = []
        right_vecs = []

        <span># take two random indexes and set as left and right halves</span>
        left_ref = node._vecs.pop(np.random.randint(<span>len</span>(node._vecs)))
        right_ref = node._vecs.pop(np.random.randint(<span>len</span>(node._vecs)))

        <span># split vectors into halves</span>
        <span>for</span> vec <span>in</span> node._vecs:
            dist_l = np.linalg.norm(vec - left_ref)
            dist_r = np.linalg.norm(vec - right_ref)
            <span>if</span> dist_l &lt; dist_r:
                left_vecs.append(vec)
            <span>else</span>:
                right_vecs.append(vec)

        <span># check to make sure that the tree is mostly balanced</span>
        r = <span>len</span>(left_vecs) / <span>len</span>(node._vecs)
        <span>if</span> r &lt; imb <span>and</span> r &gt; (<span>1</span> - imb):
            node._left = Node(left_ref, left_vecs)
            node._right = Node(right_ref, right_vecs)
            <span>return</span> <span>True</span>

        <span># redo tree build process if imbalance is high</span>
        node._vecs.append(left_ref)
        node._vecs.append(right_ref)

    <span>return</span> <span>False</span>


<span>def</span> <span>_build_tree</span>(<span>node, K: <span>int</span>, imb: <span>float</span></span>):
    <span>"""Recurses on left and right halves to build a tree.
    """</span>
    node.split(K=K, imb=imb)
    <span>if</span> node.left:
        _build_tree(node.left, K=K, imb=imb)
    <span>if</span> node.right:
        _build_tree(node.right, K=K, imb=imb)


<span>def</span> <span>build_forest</span>(<span>vecs: <span>List</span>[np.ndarray], N: <span>int</span> = <span>32</span>, K: <span>int</span> = <span>64</span>, imb: <span>float</span> = <span>0.95</span></span>) -&gt; <span>List</span>[Node]:
    <span>"""Builds a forest of `N` trees.
    """</span>
    forest = []
    <span>for</span> _ <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(N):
        root = Node(<span>None</span>, vecs)
        _build_tree(root, K, imb)
        forest.append(root)
    <span>return</span> forest
</code></pre>
<p>This is a denser code block, so let's walk through it step-by-step. First, given an already-initialized <code>Node</code>, we randomly select two vectors and split the dataset into left and right halves. We then use the function we defined earlier to determine which of the two halves the subvectors belong to. Note that we've added an <code>imb</code> parameter to maintain tree balance - if one side of the tree contains more than 95% of all the subvectors, we redo the split process.</p>
<p>With node splitting in place, the <code>build_tree</code> function will recursively call itself on all nodes. Leaf nodes are defined as those which contain fewer than <code>K</code> subvectors.</p>
<p>Great, so we've built a binary tree that lets us significantly reduce the scope of our search. Now let's implement querying as well. Querying is pretty straightforward; we traverse the tree, continuously moving along the left or right branches until we've arrived at the one we're interested in:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>_query_linear</span>(<span>vecs: <span>List</span>[np.ndarray], q: np.ndarray, k: <span>int</span></span>) -&gt; <span>List</span>[np.ndarray]:
    <span>return</span> <span>sorted</span>(vecs, key=<span>lambda</span> v: np.linalg.norm(q-v))[:k]


<span>def</span> <span>query_tree</span>(<span>root: Node, q: np.ndarray, k: <span>int</span></span>) -&gt; <span>List</span>[np.ndarray]:
    <span>"""Queries a single tree.
    """</span>

    <span>while</span> root.left <span>and</span> root.right:
        dist_l = np.linalg.norm(q - node.left.ref)
        dist_r = np.linalg.norm(q - node.right.ref)
        root = root.left <span>if</span> dist_l &lt; dist_r <span>else</span> root.right

    <span># brute-force search the nearest neighbors</span>
    <span>return</span> _query_linear(root.vecs, q, k)
</code></pre>
<p>This chunk of code will greedily traverse the tree, returning a single nearest neighbor (<code>nq = 1</code>). However, recall that we're often interested in finding multiple nearest neighbors. Additionally, multiple nearest neighbors can live in other leaf nodes as well. So how can we solve these issues?</p>
<p>(Yes, I do realize that the main character's name is spelled "Forrest" in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump">American classic</a>.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://zilliz.com/blog/vector-index">previous tutorial on IVF</a>, recall that we often expanded our search beyond the Voronoi cell closest to the query vector. The reason is due to <em>cell edges</em> - if a query vector is close to a cell edge, it's very likely that some of its nearest neighbors may be in a neighboring cell. These "edges" are much more common in high-dimensional spaces, so a large-ish value of <code>nprobe</code> is often used when a high recall is needed.</p>
<p>We face the same problem for tree-based indexes - some of our nearest neighbors may be outside the nearest leaf node/polygon. Annoy solves this by 1) allowing searches on both sides of a split and 2) creating a <em>forest</em> of trees.</p>
<p>Let's first expand on our implementation in the previous section to search both sides of a split:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>_select_nearby</span>(<span>node: Node, q: np.ndarray, thresh: <span>int</span> = <span>0</span></span>):
    <span>"""Functions identically to _is_query_in_left_half, but can return both.
    """</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> node.left <span>or</span> <span>not</span> node.right:
        <span>return</span> ()
    dist_l = np.linalg.norm(q - node.left.ref)
    dist_r = np.linalg.norm(q - node.right.ref)
    <span>if</span> np.<span>abs</span>(dist_l - dist_r) &lt; thresh:
        <span>return</span> (node.left, node.right)
    <span>if</span> dist_l &lt; dist_r:
        <span>return</span> (node.left,)
    <span>return</span> (node.right,)


<span>def</span> <span>_query_tree</span>(<span>root: Node, q: np.ndarray, k: <span>int</span></span>) -&gt; <span>List</span>[np.ndarray]:
    <span>"""This replaces the `query_tree` function above.
    """</span>

    pq = [root]
    nns = []
    <span>while</span> pq:
        node = pq.pop(<span>0</span>)
        nearby = _select_nearby(node, q, thresh=<span>0.05</span>)

        <span># if `_select_nearby` does not return either node, then we are at a leaf</span>
        <span>if</span> nearby:
            pq.extend(nearby)
        <span>else</span>:
            nns.extend(node.vecs)

    <span># brute-force search the nearest neighbors</span>
    <span>return</span> _query_linear(nns, q, k)


<span>def</span> <span>query_forest</span>(<span>forest: <span>List</span>[Node], q, k: <span>int</span> = <span>10</span></span>):
    nns = <span>set</span>()
    <span>for</span> root <span>in</span> forest:
        <span># merge `nns` with query result</span>
        res = _query_tree(root, q, k)
        nns.update(res)
    <span>return</span> _query_linear(nns, q, k)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we'll add a function to allow us to build the full index as a forest of trees:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>build_forest</span>(<span>vecs: <span>List</span>[np.ndarray], N: <span>int</span> = <span>32</span>, K: <span>int</span> = <span>64</span>, imb: <span>float</span> = <span>0.95</span></span>) -&gt; <span>List</span>[Node]:
    <span>"""Builds a forest of `N` trees.
    """</span>
    forest = []
    <span>for</span> _ <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(N):
        root = Node(<span>None</span>, vecs)
        _build_tree(root, K, imb)
        forest.append(root)
    <span>return</span> forest
</code></pre>
<p>With everything implemented, let's now put it all together, as we've done for IVF, SQ, PQ, and HNSW:</p>

<p>And that's it for Annoy!</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we did a deep dive into Annoy, a tree-based indexing strategy with a playful name. There are better languages than Python for implementing vector search data structures due to interpreter overhead. Still, we use as much numpy-based array math. We can do many optimizations to prevent copying memory back and forth, but I'll leave them as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>In the following tutorial, we'll continue our deep dive into indexing strategies with a rundown of the Vamana algorithm - also known more commonly as <em>DiskANN</em> - a unique graph-based indexing algorithm that is tailored specifically towards querying directly from solid state hard drives.</p>

<p>The group was founded as <i>Razor 2992</i> by Doctor No, Insane TTM and Sector9 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> in October 1985 as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking" title="Software cracking">software cracking</a> group. Shortly after, they changed from 2992 to 1911 which translates to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/777_(number)#Computing" title="777 (number)">777</a> in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" title="Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>.
</p><p>Between 1987 and 1988 the group began to move away from the Commodore 64 and migrated to a new hardware platform, coding demos and cracking games for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" title="Amiga">Amiga</a>. In the very early 1990s Razor 1911 made another transition, this time to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a>, foremost as a cracking group, but still continuing to release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_intro" title="Crack intro">cracktro loaders</a>, demos and music.
</p><p>Razor was a supply group on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk" title="Floppy disk">diskette</a> from 1992 until diskettes were abandoned for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM" title="CD-ROM">CD-ROMs</a>. Throughout the 1990s Razor faced competition from many different groups, ranging from groups such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristar_and_Red_Sector_Incorporated" title="Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated">Tristar &amp; Red Sector inc.</a> (TRSi), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Network_of_Crackers" title="International Network of Crackers">International Network of Crackers</a> (INC) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_(group)" title="Fairlight (group)">Fairlight</a> (FLT) in 1994 to Prestige, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hybrid_(warez)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Hybrid (warez) (page does not exist)">Hybrid</a> (HBD), and others in 1995. Razor was revitalised by new members gained from another group, Nexus, who brought with them some UK suppliers and the leaders The Speed Racer (TSR), Hot Tuna and The Gecko. Razor had a handful of others throughout the 1990s, such as Zodact, ROMKernel, The Renegade Chemist (TRC), The WiTcH KiNG, Butcher, SwiTch, Marauder, and Randall Flagg.
</p><p>Razor 1911 took a break from the demoscene in 1992. In 1993 a new demogroup calling itself Razor 1911 formed, in which Colorbird was the only original member of Razor 1911. Razor 1911 was still active as a software cracking group.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1995 diskette releases were rapidly being supplanted by CD-ROMs, and Razor 1911 moved into the CD-ripping scene. The crew that led Razor into this new chapter included members such as TSR, Pharaoh, Fatal Error, GRIZZLY, Suspicious Image, Third Son, Hot Tuna, Beowulf, Pitbull, Bunter, Manhunter, Niteman, Vitas, Mausioso and The Punisher.
</p><p>Razor once again took on a new challenge when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660" title="ISO 9660">ISO</a> scene was formed. Razor 1911 began to release ISOs when they became the standard of the day, led most significantly by The Punisher. He was instrumental in Razor's recovery and its solid performance in the ISO scene. Following The Punisher's retirement, Razor was led by various different people and underwent some internal problems in the form of leadership challenges. This was solved when Pitbull, an old Razor member from the 1990s, took over the leadership role. The FBI claimed him to still be the leader of Razor at the time when "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Buccaneer" title="Operation Buccaneer">Operation Buccaneer</a>", an international anti-piracy operation which led to raids at the homes of over 60 piracy suspects worldwide in 2001, was carried out even though NFOs and scene activity at the time points out The Renegade Chemist as actual leader of the group.
</p><p>Sean Michael Breen was convicted in 2004 to "50 months in prison and three years of supervised release, for violating the criminal copyright laws as a member of the first computer game piracy ring on the Internet, and for defrauding Cisco Systems".<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> The press release alleges them to be the leader of the group, although their nickname is not mentioned.

<p>On June 22, 2006, Razor 1911 started releasing games again. They have been releasing games fairly consistently ever since, and as of 2010 are among the most prolific groups at cracking new releases.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>On April 1, 2011, Razor 1911 "cracked" the TV show 101% on the French TV channel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolife_(TV_channel)" title="Nolife (TV channel)">Nolife</a>, inducing many unwanted "bugs" and behaviors in the show. While this was a joke, the intro contained a real code giving unlimited access to the paid replay service for one day.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>On April 22, 2011, Razor 1911's demo division won the public choice award<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> during the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awards.scene.org/">Scene.org Awards</a> ceremony at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gathering_(computer_party)" title="The Gathering (computer party)">The Gathering</a> for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64k_intro" title="64k intro">64k intro</a> "Insert No Coins" coded by Rez with music from Dubmood.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I spent almost two years building/optimizing a partial WebRTC stack @ Twitch using <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">pion</a>.
Our use-case was quite custom and we ultimately scrapped it, but your millage may vary.</p>
<h2 id="why-webrtc">Why WebRTC?</h2>
<p>Google released WebRTC in 2011 as a way of fixing a very specific problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we build Google Meet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back then, the web was a very different place.
Flash was the only way to do live media and it was a <em>mess</em>.
HTML5 video was primarily for pre-recorded content.
It personally took me until 2015 to write a <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3hqfkw/the_csgo_client_embeds_the_twitch_html5_player/">HTML5 player for Twitch</a> using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API">MSE</a>, and we’re still talking 5+ seconds of latency on a good day.</p>
<p>Transmitting video over the internet <em>in real-time</em> is hard.</p>
<p>You need a tight coupling between the video encoding and the network to avoid any form of queuing, which adds latency.
This effectively rules out TCP and forces you to use UDP.
But now you also need a video encoder/decoder that can deal with packet loss without spewing artifacts everywhere.</p>

Example of Artifacts caused by packet loss.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google (correctly) determined that it would be impossible to solve these problems piecewise with new web standards.
The approach instead was to create <a href="https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/">libwebrtc</a>, the defacto WebRTC implementation that still ships with all browsers.
It does everything, from networking to video encoding/decoding to data transfer, and it does it remarkably well.
It’s actually quite a feat of software engineering, <em>especially</em> the part where Google managed to convince Apple/Mozilla to embed a full media/networking stack into their browsers.</p>
<p>My favorite part about WebRTC is that it manages to leverage existing standards.
WebRTC is not really a protocol, but rather a collection of protocols: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8445">ICE</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5389">STUN</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5766">TURN</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6347">DTLS</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3550">RTP/RTCP</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3711">SRTP</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4960">SCTP</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4566">SDP</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762">mDNS</a>, etc.
Throw a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">Javascript API</a> on top of these and you have WebRTC.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://quic.video/blog/replacing-webrtc/layers.png" alt="WebRTC protocols and layers">
</p><figcaption><a href="https://hpbn.co/webrtc/">Source</a>. That’s a lot of protocols layered on top of each other.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="why-not-webrtc">Why not WebRTC?</h2>
<p>I wouldn’t be writing this blog post if WebRTC was perfect.
The core issue is that WebRTC is not a protocol; it’s a monolith.</p>
<p>WebRTC does a lot of things, let’s break down it down piece by piece:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#media">Media</a>: a full capture/encoding/networking/rendering pipeline.</li>
<li><a href="#data">Data</a>: reliable/unreliable messages.</li>
<li><a href="#p2p">P2P</a>: peer-to-peer connectability.</li>
<li><a href="#sfu">SFU</a>: a relay that selectively forwards media.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="media">Media</h3>
<p>The WebRTC media stack is designed for conferencing and does an amazing job at it.
The problems start when you try to use it for anything else.</p>
<p>My final project at Twitch was to reduce latency by replacing HLS with WebRTC for delivery.
This seems like a no-brainer at first, but it quickly turned into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTnJunbpSJchdj8XI3GU9Fo-RUUFBqLO1AhlaKk5Alo/edit?usp=sharing">death by a thousand cuts</a>.
The biggest issue was that the user experience was just terrible.
Twitch doesn’t need the same aggressive latency as Google Meet, but WebRTC is hard-coded to compromise on quality.</p>
<p>In general, it’s quite difficult to customize WebRTC outside of a few configurable modes.
It’s a black box that you turn on, and if it works it works.
And if it doesn’t work, then you have to deal with the pain that is <a href="https://github.com/webrtc-sdk/libwebrtc">forking libwebrtc</a>… or just hope Google fixes it for you.</p>
<p>The protocol has some wiggle room and I really enjoyed my time tinkering with <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">pion</a>.
But you’re ultimately bound by the browser implementation, unless you don’t need web support, in which case you don’t need WebRTC.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>WebRTC also has a data channel API, which is particularly useful because <a href="#webtransport">until recently</a>, it’s been the only way to send/receive “unreliable” messages from a browser.
In fact, many companies use WebRTC data channels to avoid the WebRTC media stack (ex. Zoom).</p>
<p>I went down this path too, attempting to send each video frame as an unreliable message, but it didn’t work due to fundamental flaws with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9260.html">SCTP</a>.
I won’t go into the detail in this post, but I eventually hacked “datagram” support into SCTP by breaking frames into unreliable messages below the MTU size.</p>
<p>Finally! UDP* in the browser, but at what cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>a convoluted handshake that takes at least 10 (!) round trips.</li>
<li>2x the packets, because libsctp immediately ACKs every “datagram”.</li>
<li>a custom SCTP implementation, which means the browser can’t send “datagrams”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oof.</p>
<h3 id="p2p">P2P</h3>
<p>The best and worst part about WebRTC is that it supports peer-to-peer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity">ICE handshake</a> is extremely complicated, even from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling">application’s point of view</a>.
Without going into detail, there’s an explosion of permutations that you need to handle based on the network topology.
Some networks block P2P (ex. symmetric NATs) while others outright block UDP, forcing you to use a TURN server a <a href="https://twitter.com/HCornflower/status/894600051506515968">non-insignificant amount of time</a>.</p>
<p>Most conferencing solutions are client-server anyway, relying on their own private network instead of public transit (aka a CDN).
However the server is still forced to perform the complicated ICE handshake which has major architecture ramifications, but I’ll save that for another blog post.</p>
<p>Note that there are rumblings of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/p2p-webtransport/">P2P WebTransport</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-seemann-quic-nat-traversal/">P2P QUIC</a>, but I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p>
<h3 id="sfu">SFU</h3>
<p>Last but not least, WebRTC scales using SFUs (Selective Forwarding Units).</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://quic.video/blog/replacing-webrtc/sfu.png" alt="SFU example"></p><figcaption><p><a href="https://blog.livekit.io/scaling-webrtc-with-distributed-mesh/">Source</a>. Participants send to a central server,
rather than directly to each other.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem with SFUs is subtle: they’re custom.</p>
<p>It requires a lot of business logic to determine <em>where</em> to forward packets.
A single server like that diagram won’t scale, nor will all of the participants be located in the same geo.
Each SFU needs to be made aware of the network topology and the location of each participant <em>somehow</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a good SFU will avoid dropping packets based on dependencies, otherwise you waste bandwidth on undecodable packets.
Unfortunately, determining this requires parsing each RTP packet on a <em>per-codec</em> basis.
For example, here’s a <a href="https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/+/refs/heads/main/modules/rtp_rtcp/source/video_rtp_depacketizer_h264.cc">h.264 depacketizer</a> for libwebrtc.</p>
<p>But the biggest issue at Twitch was that SFUs share very little in common with CDNs.
One team is optimizing WebRTC, another team is optimizing HTTP, and they’re not talking to each other.</p>
<p>This is why HLS/DASH uses HTTP instead: <strong>economies of scale</strong></p>
<h2 id="replacing-webrtc-1">Replacing WebRTC</h2>
<p>Okay enough ranting about what’s wrong, let’s fix it.</p>
<p>First off, <strong>WebRTC is not going anywhere</strong>. It does a fantastic job at what it was designed for: conferencing.
It will take a long time before anything will reach feature/latency parity with WebRTC.</p>
<p>Before you can replace <strong>Web</strong>RTC, you need <strong>Web</strong>Support.
Fortunately, we now have <strong>Web</strong>Codecs and <strong>Web</strong>Transport.</p>
<h2 id="webcodecs">WebCodecs</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API">WebCodecs</a> is a new API for encoding/decoding media in the browser.
It’s remarkably simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture input via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a> or a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia">media device</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoEncoder">VideoEncoder</a>: Input raw frames, output encoded frames.</li>
<li>Transfer those frames somehow. (ex. <a href="#webtransport">WebTransport</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoDecoder">VideoDecoder</a>: Input encoded frames, output raw frames.</li>
<li>Render output via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a> or just marvel at the pixel data.</li>
</ol>
<p>The catch is that the application is responsible for all timing.
That means you need to choose when to render each frame via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame</a>.
In fact, you need to choose when to render each audio <em>sample</em> via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet">AudioWorklet</a>.</p>
<p>The upside is that now your web application gets full control of how to render media.
It’s now possible to implement WebRTC-like behavior, like temporarily freezing video and desyncing A/V.</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://caniuse.com/webcodecs">caniuse</a> for current browser support.</p>
<h2 id="webtransport">WebTransport</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API">WebTransport</a> is a new API for transmitting data over the network.
Think of it like WebSockets, but with a few key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html">QUIC</a> not TCP.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport_API#reliable_transmission_via_streams">Reliable streams</a> that are delivered in order.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-reliable streams</strong> by closing a stream (with an error code) to drop the tail.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport/datagrams">Unreliable datagrams</a> that may be dropped during congestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>QUIC has too many benefits to enumerate, but some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully encrypted</li>
<li>Congestion controlled (even datagrams)</li>
<li>Independent streams (no head-of-line blocking)</li>
<li>1-RTT handshake</li>
<li>Multiplexed over a single UDP port</li>
<li>Transparent network migration (ex. switching from Wifi to LTE)</li>
<li>Used for HTTP/3</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is surprisingly important: WebTransport will share all of the optimizations that HTTP/3 receives.
A HTTP/3 server can simultaneously serve multiple WebTransport sessions and HTTP requests over the same connection.</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://caniuse.com/webtransport">caniuse</a> for current browser support.
Use my <a href="https://docs.rs/webtransport-quinn/latest/webtransport_quinn/">Rust library</a> for servers and native clients!</p>
<h2 id="but-how">But how?</h2>
<p>Okay, so we have WebCodecs and WebTransport, but are they actually useful?</p>
<p>I alluded to the secret behind latency earlier: avoiding queues.
Queuing can occur at any point in the media pipeline.</p>















<table><thead><tr><th>Capture/Encode</th><th>Send/Receive</th><th>Decode/Render</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>—&gt;</td><td>—&gt;</td><td>—&gt;</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Let’s start with the easy one.
<a href="#webcodecs">WebCodecs</a> allows you to avoid queuing almost entirely.</p>















<table><thead><tr><th>Capture/Encode</th><th>Send/Receive</th><th>Decode/Render</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>WebCodecs</strong></td><td>?</td><td><strong>WebCodecs</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The tricky part is the bit in the middle, the network.
It’s not as simple as throwing your hands into the air and proclaiming “UDP has no queues!”</p>
<h3 id="the-internet-of-queues">The Internet of Queues</h3>
<p>The internet is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes">series of tubes</a>.
You put packets in one end and they eventually come out of the other end, kinda.
This section will get an entire blog post in the future, but until then, let’s over-simplify things.</p>
<p>Every packet you send will fight with other packets on the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>If routers have sufficient throughput, <strong>packets arrive on time</strong>.</li>
<li>If routers have limited throughput, <strong>packets will be queued</strong>.</li>
<li>If those queues are full, <strong>packets will be dropped</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There can be random packet loss, but 99% of the time we care about loss due to queuing.
Note that even datagrams may be queued by the network; a firehose of packets is never the answer.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-queuing">Detecting Queuing</h3>
<p>The goal of congestion control is to detect queuing and back off.</p>
<p>Different congestion control algorithms use different signals to detect queuing.
This is a gross oversimplification of a topic with an immense amount of research, but here’s a rough breakdown:</p>



































<table><thead><tr><th>Signal</th><th>Description</th><th>Latency</th><th>Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Packet Loss</td><td>Wait until the queue is full and packets are dropped.</td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat">High</a></td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control">Reno</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUBIC_TCP">CUBIC</a></td></tr><tr><td>ACK Delay</td><td>Indirectly measure the queue size via ACK RTT.</td><td>Medium</td><td><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub45646/">BBR</a>, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/copa/">COPA</a></td></tr><tr><td>Packet Delay</td><td>Indirectly measure the queue size via packet RTT.</td><td>Low</td><td><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-rmcat-gcc-02">GCC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/EricssonResearch/scream">SCReAM</a></td></tr><tr><td>ECN</td><td>Get told by the router to back off.</td><td>None*</td><td><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9330/">L4S</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>There’s no single “best” congestion control algorithm; it depends on your use-case, network, and target latency.
But this is one area where WebRTC has an advantage thanks to <a href="https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/native-code/rtp-hdrext/transport-wide-cc-02/README.md">transport-wide-cc</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reducing-bitrate">Reducing Bitrate</h3>
<p>Once you detect queuing, the application needs to send fewer bytes.</p>
<p>In some situations we can just reduce the encoder bitrate, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>This only applies to future frames.</li>
<li>We don’t want one viewer to degrade the experience for all.</li>
<li>It’s too expensive to encode on a per-viewer basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, we have to drop encoded media in response to congestion.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental problem with TCP.
Once you queue data on a TCP socket, it can’t be undone without closing the connection.
You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://quic.video/blog/replacing-webrtc/toothpaste.jpg" alt="TCP toothpaste"></p><figcaption><p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shitting-toothpaste-pooping-toothpaste">Source</a>. You earned a meme for making it
this far.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there are actually quite a few ways of dropping media with <a href="#webtransport">WebTransport</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use datagrams and choose which packets to transmit. (like WebRTC)</li>
<li>Use QUIC streams and close them to stop transmissions. (like <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kpugin-rush-00.html">RUSH</a>)</li>
<li>Use QUIC streams and prioritize them. (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PncdrMPVaNc">Warp</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m biased because I made the 3rd one.
WebTransport’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportsendstreamoptions-sendorder">sendOrder</a> can be used to instruct the QUIC stack what should be sent during congestion.
But that deserves an entire blog post on its own.</p>
<h2 id="replacing-webrtc-2">Replacing WebRTC</h2>
<p>But to actually replace WebRTC, we need a standard. Anybody can make their own UDP-based protocol (<em>and they do</em>), using this new web tech (<em>and they will</em>).</p>
<p>What sets <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/moq/about/">Media over QUIC</a> apart is that we’re doing it through the IETF, the same organization that standardized WebRTC… and virtually every internet protocol.</p>
<p>It’s going to take years.<br>
It’s going to take a lot of idiots like myself who want to replace WebRTC. <br>
It’s going to take a lot of companies who are willing to bet on a new standard.<br></p>
<p>And there are major flaws with both <strong>WebCodecs</strong> and <strong>WebTransport</strong> that still need to be addressed before we’ll ever reach WebRTC parity.
To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need better <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportoptions-congestioncontrol">congestion control</a> in browsers.</li>
<li>We need something like <a href="https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/native-code/rtp-hdrext/transport-wide-cc-02/README.md">transport-wide-cc</a> in QUIC: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-smith-quic-receive-ts-00.html">like this proposal</a></li>
<li>We need echo cancellation in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">WebAudio</a>, which might be possible?</li>
<li>We may need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction">FEC</a> in QUIC: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-michel-quic-fec/">like this proposal</a></li>
<li>We may need more encoding options, like non-reference frames or SVC.</li>
<li>Oh yeah and full browser support: <a href="https://caniuse.com/webcodecs">WebCodecs</a> - <a href="https://caniuse.com/webtransport">WebTransport</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-yeah">So yeah…</h2>

Take a modern backend of a single-page Javascript application, for example - it starts out as a single stateless web service that exposes a RESTful HTTP API and uses a relational database as a backing store. The service is composed of a number of components, or libraries, that implement different business capabilities:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>As the number of feature teams contributing to the same codebase increases, its components become increasingly coupled over time. This leads the teams to step on each other’s toes more and more frequently, decreasing their productivity. </p><p>The codebase becomes complex enough that nobody fully understands every part of it, and implementing new features or fixing bugs becomes time-consuming. Even if the backend is componentized into different libraries owned by different teams, a change to a library requires the service to be redeployed. And if a change introduces a bug - like a memory leak - the entire service can potentially be affected by it. Additionally, rolling back a faulty build affects the velocity of all teams, not just the one that introduced the bug.</p><p>One way to mitigate the growing pains of a <em>monolithic</em> backend is to split it into a set of independently deployable services that communicate via APIs.

    </span></p><p>This architectural style is also referred to as the microservice architecture. The term <em>micro</em> can be misleading, though - there doesn’t have to be anything micro about the services. In fact, I would argue that if a service doesn’t do much, it just creates more operational toll than benefits. A more appropriate name for this architecture is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">service-oriented architecture</a>, but unfortunately, that name comes with some old baggage as well. Perhaps in 10 years, we will call the same concept with yet another name, but for now we will have to stick to microservices. </p><p>Breaking down the backend by business capabilities into a set of services with well-defined boundaries allows each service to be developed and operated by a single small team. The reduced team size increases the application’s development speed for a variety of reasons:</p><ul><li>Smaller teams are more effective as the communication overhead grows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">quadratically</a> with the team’s size.</li><li>As each team dictates its own release schedule and has complete control over its codebase, less cross-team communication is required, and therefore decisions can be taken in less time.</li><li>The codebase of a service is smaller and easier to digest by its developers, reducing the time it takes to ramp up new hires. Also, a smaller codebase doesn’t slow down IDEs, which makes the developers more productive. </li><li>The boundaries between services are much stronger than the boundaries between components in the same process. Because of that, when a developer needs to change a part of the backend, they only need to understand a small part of the whole. </li><li>Each service can be scaled independently and adopt a different technology stack based on its own needs. The consumers of the APIs don’t care how the functionality is implemented after all. This makes it easy to experiment and evaluate new technologies without affecting other parts of the system.</li><li>Each microservice can have its own independent data model and data store(s) that best fit its use-cases, allowing developers to change its schema without affecting other services. </li></ul><h2 id="costs"><a href="#costs" aria-label="costs permalink"></a>Costs</h2><p>The microservices architecture adds more moving parts to the overall system, and this doesn’t come for free. The cost of fully embracing microservices is only worth paying if it can be amortized across dozens of development teams. </p><p><strong>Development Experience</strong></p><p>Nothing forbids the use of different languages, libraries, and datastores for each microservice - but doing so transforms the application into an unmaintainable mess. For example, it makes it more challenging for a developer to move from one team to another if the software stack is completely different. And think of the sheer number of libraries - one for each language adopted - that need to be supported to provide common functionality that all services need, like logging.</p><p>It’s only reasonable then that a certain degree of standardization is needed. One way to do that - while still allowing some degree of freedom - is to loosely encourage specific technologies by providing a great development experience for the teams that stick with the recommended portfolio of languages and technologies.</p><p><strong>Resource Provisioning</strong></p><p>To support a large number of independent services, it should be simple to spin up new servers, data stores, and other commodity resources - you don’t want every team to come up with their own way of doing it. And once these resources have been provisioned, they have to be configured. To be able to pull this off, you will need a fair amount of automation.</p><p><strong>Communication</strong></p><p>Remote calls are expensive and introduce <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/default-timeouts/">new and fun ways</a> your systems can crumble. You will need defense mechanisms to protect against failures, like timeouts, retries and circuit breakers. You will also have to leverage asynchrony and batching to mitigate the performance hit of communicating across the network. All of which increases the system’s complexity. A lot of what I describe in my <a href="https://understandingdistributed.systems/">book about distributed systems</a> is about dealing with this complexity. </p><p>That being said, even a monolith doesn’t live in isolation as it’s being accessed by remote clients, and it’s likely to use third-party APIs as well. So eventually, these issues need to be solved there as well, albeit on a smaller scale.</p><p><strong>Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment</strong></p><p>Continuous integration ensures that code changes are merged into the main branch after an automated build and test processes have run. Once a code change has been merged, it should be automatically published and deployed to a production-like environment, where a battery of integration and end-to-end tests run to ensure that the microservice doesn’t break any service that depends on it.</p><p>While testing individual microservices is not more challenging than testing a monolith, testing the integration of all the microservices is an order of magnitude harder. Very subtle and unexpected behavior can emerge when individual services interact with each other. </p><p><strong>Operations</strong></p><p>Unlike with a monolith, it’s much more expensive to staff each team responsible for a service with its own operations team. As a result, the team that develops a service is typically also on-call for it. This creates friction between development work and operational toll as the team needs to decide what to prioritize during each sprint. </p><p>Debugging systems failures becomes more challenging as well - you can’t just load the whole application on your local machine and step through it with a debugger. The system has more ways to fail, as there are more moving parts. This is why good logging and monitoring becomes crucial at all levels.</p><p><strong>Eventual Consistency</strong></p><p>A side effect of splitting an application into separate services is that the data model no longer resides in a single data store. Atomically updating records stored in different data stores, and guaranteeing strong consistency, is slow, expensive, and hard to get right. Hence, this type of architecture usually requires embracing eventual consistency.</p><h2 id="practical-considerations"><a href="#practical-considerations" aria-label="practical considerations permalink"></a>Practical Considerations</h2><p>Splitting an application into services adds a lot of complexity to the overall system. Because of that, it’s generally best to start with a monolith and split it up only when there is a good reason to do so. </p><p>Getting the boundaries right between the services is challenging - it’s much easier to move them around within a monolith until you find a sweet spot. Once the monolith is well matured and growing pains start to rise, then you can start to peel off one microservice at a time from it. </p><p>You should only start with a microservice first approach if you already have experience with it, and you either have built out a platform for it or have accounted for the time it will take you to build one. </p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
        

        

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I saved my company half a million dollars in about five minutes. This is more money than I've made for my employers over the course of my entire career because this industry is a sham. I clicked about five buttons.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why happened and why it's a disgrace that it was even possible.</p>
<h2 id="i-background">I. Background</h2>
<p>Let's start with some background, because it is fucking <em>wild</em> that an inefficiency that took me five minutes to solve in a GUI configuration panel was allowed to persist. We <em>cancelled someone's contract</em> the week before I did this. <em>Someone lost their job</em> because no one could get their act together long enough to click the button I told them to click.</p>
<p>A few years ago, this company decided that it wanted to create an analytics platform, following the decision to become more "data driven". They hired some incredibly talented people to make this happen, and then like five times as many idiots.</p>
<p>At the time this was happening, I had just graduated and joined the organization as a data scientist. We, of course, did not do any data science, because the organization did not require any data science to be done - what they actually needed to do was fire most of the staff in every team, leaving behind the two people who actually had good domain knowledge, then allow them to collaborate with good engineering teams to build sensible processes and systems. Instead, they hired a bunch of Big Firm Consultants. You can see where this is going already.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, at the time I was young and took the organization at its word. Executives would tell us constantly how excited they were for us to roll out new A.I initiatives (then tell us there was no time, so could we please get that report to them in a spreadsheet), and I'd ask for some sort of compute to <em>perform</em> some machine learning, or even set up data pipelines.</p>
<p>It never worked. Instead, we were told that we just had to wait for the Advanced Analytics Platform (AAP) to be deployed. You see, it's December, and it's launching in January.</p>
<p>Then in January I was told to be patient, it was coming in March.</p>
<p>In June, I was told it had been put on hold due to Covid - this was a very convenient excuse because they had absolutely fucked the whole project up already, but it bought some valuable time. By the next December, I had left the organization and the AAP was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>We skip ahead three years. The AAP is finally ready to launch. It turns out none of the features I needed were ever planned, so I guess they were just lying to me before I left.</p>
<p>Four engineers leave the company in the same week, and I speak with the directors because I know they need a <em>real</em> engineer in and they can't find them. I'm a substantially less experienced engineer than many of the readers here, but suffice it to say that I can read documentation without panicking, which is considered S-tier in this country. My conditions - a big pile of money and they had to put me on the AAP team because they're the only team that gets actual toys to play with.</p>
<h2 id="ii-it-fucking-sucks">II. It Fucking Sucks</h2>
<p>It's an insane dumpster fire spiderweb of technical debt and it's only like one week old. Here are some fun details.</p>
<p>I get a friend of mine hired (big fan of nepotism), and he finds, <em>on day one</em>, a file in the project's repository that deletes prod using our CI/CD pipelines if it is ever moved into the wrong folder. It comes complete with the key and password required for an admin account. It was produced by the former lead engineer, who has moved on to a new role before his sins catch up with him.</p>
<p>The entire thing is stitched together by spreadsheets that are parsed by Python, dropped into S3, parsed by Lambdas into more S3, the S3 files are picked up by MongoDB, then MongoDB records are passed by another Lambda into S3, the S3 files are pulled into Snowflake via Snowpipe, the new Snowflake data is pivoted by a Javascript stored procedure into a relational format... and that's how you edit someone's database access. That whole process is to upload like a 2KB CSV to a database that has people's database roles in it.</p>
<p>This is considered <em>more auditable</em>.</p>
<p>Everything is transformed into a CSV because the security team demanded something that could undergo easy scanning for malicious content, then they never deployed the scanning tool, so we have all the downsides of the CSVs and none of the upsides.</p>
<p>Every Lambda function, the backbone of all the ETL pipelines, starts with <code>counter = 1</code> because one of the early iterations <em>used to use a counter</em> and people have just been copying that line over and over. <em>Senior data engineers</em> have been copying that line over and over.</p>
<p>The test suites in the CI/CD pipelines have been failing for months, because someone during debugging chose to use the Linux <code>tee</code> command to log any errors to both <code>stdout</code> and a file at the same time, but <code>tee</code> successfully executing was overwriting the error code from the failing tests.</p>
<p>To get access to the password for any API we need to hit, you search for something like <code>service-password</code> in an AWS service, which returns the value... <code>service-password</code> (as in, literally all the values are the same as the keys), then you use <em>that</em> to look up the actual password in a completely different service. No one knows why we do this.</p>
<p>The script that generates configuration files for our pipelines starts with 600 lines of comments, because senior engineers have been commenting the lines out in case they're needed later. The lines are just setting the same variables to different values, and they're all on GitHub anyway.</p>
<p>This is at an organization that some percentage of readers will recognize on sheer brand strength if they're in my country.</p>
<p>I'm not even getting started, but we have to stop for now because I am going to catch fire. These details are important because now you understand the kind of operational incompetence that allows you to waste so much money on processing &lt;1TB of data per day that it dwarfs your team's salary.</p>
<h2 id="iii-the-budget">III.  The Budget</h2>
<p>The next thing to realize is that this platform never really had a chance of making any money for the organization. They do a little accounting trick (read: lying) which I'll talk about in another post that makes it seem like they've had huge wins, but really this is just many times more expensive than our previous operational model.</p>
<p>The deal is that we pretend the whole team is doing something or other, and we stay within budget because the organization can't afford to spend infinite money on this social fiction. However, the budget for our database costs was being drastically overrun. I'm not sure what the original estimate was, but I think it was intended to cost something like 200K for a year of operations, but we were now close to a million dollars.</p>
<p>Some quick facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>We use Snowflake as our database, which charges you based on the size of the computer you use to run your queries.</li>
<li>You only pay for computers while they're on.</li>
<li>We probably run a few thousand queries per week, mostly developers experimenting with little tweaks for PowerBI reports that no one reads, and on average they take about 2 seconds to run.</li>
<li><strong>The computers are set to idle for 10 minutes after every query</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I noticed this about a month into joining the team, and suggested we uh... don't have the computers run for like two orders of magnitude longer than they need to for every query. I literally can't remember what was said, there was some Agile bullshit about doing a discovery piece, then it just never happened.</p>
<h2 id="iv-just-doing-the-fucking-thing">IV. Just Doing The Fucking Thing</h2>
<p>Anyway, <em>months</em> later, they finally give me a card that says "Discovery: Optimise Costs". Now I <em>have</em> to optimize costs so that I have something to say at the next standup, and fortunately I know just the thing! I'll test my hypothesis that this is all a sick joke, and I'm going to push the button that I secretly think should obviously have been pushed.</p>
<p>We've got a new guy on another team who seems excellent, so I ask management if I can give him admin credentials since we need competent people. They say no. I flick him some lower-level database credentials that I <em>technically</em> wasn't told not to do since they aren't admin credentials, and he sanity-checks that it would save money. At 4PM on the last day of the week, I ping a chat full of good engineers and no managers to make sure I'm not about to nuke everything, then just do it.</p>
<h2 id="v-chaos-reigns">V.  Chaos Reigns</h2>
<p>I return to work the following Monday. I <em>suspected</em> that this would save a bunch of money, and guess what, our projected bill dropped from a million to half a million dollars, and everyone is losing their fucking minds.</p>
<p>My team has spun this as a huge cost saving, when <em>really</em> we just applied a fire extinguisher to the pile of money that we had set alight.</p>
<p>Other teams are attacking my team, insisting that it can't be a coincidence that the one new guy joined exactly as we did this, and how was it possible we didn't know how to generate that kind of saving without his help? They are saying this because it makes them seem higher status and their teams only produce money in the land where you lie all day, but it <em>is</em> a fair question.</p>
<p>While my managers are very happy, they quietly suggest it may be unwise to roll out the changes to all the computers (I only did a few to be safe) because it would oversaturate the department to hear about us all day. And invite unwelcome questions. The subtext is that if we do this all slowly enough, it might seem like it took a lot of effort instead of just clicking buttons that I said had to be clicked almost a year ago.</p>
<p>I am asked to write some PowerPoints, which include phrases like "a careful statistical analysis of user usage patterns indicated an opportunity to more effectively allocate resources", implying that nothing was <em>wrong</em>, we just needed to collect more data before deciding not to let the expensive machines idle all day.</p>
<p>Every day, I dread someone asking me to explain what the change was, because I will have to fucking <em>yeet</em> some managers I like under a bus, but they can't resist talking about the change non-stop because it is the closest some of them will ever get to impacting the bottom line. And <em>many of them are actually decent managers</em>, it's just that this whole department, like many departments, is some sort of weird political PsyOp to get executives promoted. It's <em>cosplaying as a real business</em> and the board thinks the costume is convincing. </p>
<h2 id="vi-the-aftermaths-and-takeaways">VI. The Aftermaths and Takeaways</h2>
<p>By identifying a handful of good engineers and going totally rogue, we outperformed the entire department pretty effortlessly. The competent people are there, just made totally impotent by the organization, and I'm still convinced that this place is probably better than the median organization.</p>
<p>I ask management for a 30K raise after saving 500K and my message is still unread. I suspect I will eventually receive either nothing or 5K.</p>
<p>I have even more meetings now because everyone wants to talk about how we saved the money. I had to make a PowerPoint. Kill me.</p>
<p>I would have been better off <em>not doing anything</em>. Let that be a lesson to you. Do you hear me? I applied myself for <em>five minutes</em> against my own better judgement, had the greatest success of my career, and have immediately been punished for it. <em>Learn from my mistakes, I beg of you.</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://odigos.io/blog/ebpf-instrumentation-faster-than-manual">https://odigos.io/blog/ebpf-instrumentation-faster-than-manual</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38069659">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're developing Odigos, an open-source project for effortless distributed tracing. See more at <a href="https://github.com/keyval-dev/odigos">https://github.com/keyval-dev/odigos</a>.</p>
<p>Distributed tracing tracks the journey of requests as they move through a distributed system, offering insights for debugging, performance optimization, and end-to-end visibility. It is crucial for gaining in-depth insights into request flows within complex distributed systems.</p>
<p>However, there are two ways in which it can suck: extensive code changes (requires manual instrumentation), and a significant performance impact.</p>
<p>Odigos addresses the code change challenge by using eBPF for automating tracing without any manual effort or code changes. We generate traces in OpenTelemetry format, ensuring compatibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. You can read more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442603">here</a></p>
<p>That leaves the performance issues, which we’ve been working on. Our performance tests, which we’ll go into below, show that eBPF-based automatic instrumentation is over 20x faster than manually instrumenting code. This is achieved by separating data recording and data processing, eliminating extra workload, object allocation, and network calls during application runtime.</p>
<p>As a result, you can have the best of both worlds: automated distributed tracing with minimal performance overhead.</p>
<h2>How we tested</h2>
<p>Benchmarking latency is not a trivial task. Latency can be measured in many different ways, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Our testing is inspired by this excellent talk by Gil Tene called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ8ydIuPFeU">How NOT to Measure Latency</a>. We are using a <a href="http://hdrhistogram.org/">High Dynamic Range Histogram</a> to visualize the results and <a href="https://github.com/giltene/wrk2">wrk2</a> to generate load.</p>
<p>In order to reduce noise as much as possible, we are running each test on a dedicated AWS bare metal instance (c5n.metal) with Intel Xeon Platinum 8000 series (Skylake-SP) processor.</p>
<p>For the target application, we are using a simple Go HTTP server written in Go 1.21 that returns a simple JSON response.</p>
<h2>Test results</h2>
<p>Each test is run for 5 minutes and generates 10,000 requests per second.
First, we ran the test without any instrumentation. Then we ran the test with manual instrumentation using <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go">OpenTelemetry Go SDK</a> and finally, we ran the test with <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation">eBPF-based automatic instrumentation</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://odigos.io/images/blog/ebpf-vs-manual/results.png" alt="Test Results"></p>
<p>At the lower percentiles (up to the 99.9th percentile), the overhead of not having instrumentation, manual instrumentation, and eBPF-based automatic instrumentation is similar</p>
<p>However, at the higher percentiles (99.9th percentile and above), manual instrumentation has a significantly higher overhead than eBPF-based automatic instrumentation, which is over 20x faster.</p>
<p>If you're wondering whether the top of the spectrum matters, the answer is yes, especially in distributed environments. The following table shows how many clients will experience the 99th percentile latency according to the number of different services involved in the request (taken from Gil's talk)</p>
<p><img src="https://odigos.io/images/blog/ebpf-vs-manual/p99_is_a_lie.png" alt="p99 is a lie"></p>
<p>For maximum precision and isolation, we are generating traces containing a single span. In a production environment, we anticipate the performance difference to be even greater.</p>
<h2><strong>The performance impact of generating distributed traces</strong></h2>
<p>Let's see what happens inside our application when we generate distributed traces, either manually via SDKs or automatically via something like a Java agent or monkey patching:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Recording data</strong> - Spans objects that contain the relevant data are being created</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining a queue of data</strong> - Spans are being batched in a queue before being sent to the external system</li>
<li><strong>Delivering data to the external system</strong> - The application sends the data in the queue to the external system by making network calls, serializing the data, and sending it over the network.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another consideration to keep in mind is that the application runtime must now manage more objects, which can negatively impact heap size and GC performance, especially in languages with stop-the-world GC like Java. All this can lead to longer GC pauses and decreased performance. We'll dive deeper and explore this topic in a separate blog post. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Unlike metrics and logs, distributed tracing is a stateful signal. Logs are typically written to a file, and metrics are typically pulled from an HTTP endpoint by the monitoring system (for example <code>/metrics</code> endpoint when exposing Prometheus metrics). Distributed tracing is different. It requires the application to actively send batched data to an external system.</p>
<h2>Separation between recording and processing</h2>
<p>When using eBPF to generate distributed traces, we are separating the recording of the data from the processing of the data. The recording of the data is done by the eBPF program and the processing and delivery of the data is done by a different process. This means that the application runtime does no additional work, creates no additional objects, and makes no additional network calls. The only additional overhead (compared to not having any instrumentation) is the overhead of invoking eBPF programs (context switching from user space to kernel space).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Traditionally, there has been a tradeoff between automated distributed tracing and performance.</p>
<p>Odigos solves this problem by providing a way to automate distributed tracing that actually improves performance. This is because we use eBPF-based automatic instrumentation to  reduce the overhead of generating distributed tracing data.</p>
<p><strong>As a result, you can now have the best of both worlds: automated distributed tracing without any performance overhead</strong>.</p>
<h2>More updates coming soon</h2>
<p>eBPF-based automatic instrumentation is a game-changer, enabling us to generate distributed traces <strong>without code changes</strong> or <strong>performance impact</strong>. We're just getting started and will bring this to more programming languages soon. Stay tuned!</p>

And yet, today, the number of American public companies stands at <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html">fewer than 4,000</a>. How can that be?</p><p>One answer is that the private-equity industry is devouring them. When a private-equity fund buys a publicly traded company, it takes the company private—hence the name. (If the company has not yet gone public, the acquisition keeps that from happening.) This gives the fund total control, which in theory allows it to find ways to boost profits so that it can sell the company for a big payday a few years later. In practice, going private can have more troubling consequences. The thing about public companies is that they’re, well, public. By law, they have to disclose information about their finances, operations, business risks, and legal liabilities. Taking a company private exempts it from those requirements.</p><p>That may not have been such a big deal when private equity was a niche industry. Today, however, it’s anything but. In 2000, private-equity firms managed about 4 percent of total U.S. corporate equity. By 2021, that number was closer to 20 percent. In other words, private equity has been growing nearly five times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/stock-market-inflation-interest-rates-recession/672612/">James Surowiecki: The method in the market’s madness</a></p><p>Elisabeth de Fontenay, a law professor at Duke University who studies corporate finance, told me that if current trends continue, “we could end up with a completely opaque economy.”</p><p>This should alarm you even if you’ve never bought a stock in your life. One-fifth of the market has been made effectively invisible to investors, the media, and regulators. Information as basic as who actually owns a company, how it makes its money, or whether it is profitable is “disappearing indefinitely into private equity darkness,” as the Harvard Law professor John Coates writes in his book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-problem-of-twelve-when-a-few-financial-institutions-control-everything-john-coates/9798987053546?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Problem of Twelve</em></a>. This is not a recipe for corporate responsibility or economic stability. A private economy is one in which companies can more easily get away with wrongdoing and an economic crisis can take everyone by surprise. And to a startling degree, a private economy is what we already have.</p><p>A<span>merica learned </span>the hard way what happens when corporations operate in the dark. Before the Great Depression, the whole U.S. economy functioned sort of like the crypto market in 2021. Companies could raise however much money they wanted from whomever they wanted. They could claim almost anything about their finances or business model. Investors often had no good way of knowing whether they were being defrauded, let alone whether to expect a good return.</p><p>Then came the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. From October to December of 1929, the stock market lost 50 percent of its value, with more losses to come. Thousands of banks collapsed, wiping out the savings of millions of Americans. Unemployment spiked to 25 percent. The Great Depression generated a crisis of confidence for American capitalism. Public hearings revealed just how rampant corporate fraud had become before the crash. In response, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These laws launched a regime of “full and fair disclosure” and created a new government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to enforce it. Now if companies wanted to raise money from the public, they would have to disclose a wide array of information to the public. This would include basic details about the company’s operations and finances, plus a comprehensive list of major risks facing the company, plans for complying with current and future regulations, and documentation of outstanding legal liabilities. All of these disclosures would be reviewed for accuracy by the SEC.</p><p>This regime created a new social contract for American capitalism: scale in exchange for transparency. Private companies were limited to 100 investors, putting a hard limit on how quickly they could grow. Any business that wanted to raise serious capital from the public had to submit itself to the new reporting laws. Over the next half century, this disclosure regime would underwrite the longest period of economic growth and prosperity in U.S. history. But it didn’t last. Beginning in the “Greed Is Good” 1980s, a wave of deregulatory reforms made it easier for private companies to raise capital. Most important was the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which allowed private funds to raise an unlimited amount of money from an unlimited number of institutional investors. The law created a loophole that effectively broke the scale-for-transparency bargain. Tellingly, 1997 was the year the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-post-covid-stock-listing-boom-20220617.html">number</a> of public companies in America peaked.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/private-inequity/570808/">From the November 2018 issue: The death of the IPO</a></p><p>“Suddenly, private companies could raise all the money they want without even thinking about an IPO,” De Fontenay said. “That completely undermined the incentives companies had to go public.” Indeed, from 1980 to 2000, an average of 310 companies went public every year; from 2001 to 2022, only 118 did. The number briefly shot up during the coronavirus pandemic but has since fallen. (Over the same time period, the rate of mergers and acquisitions <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/01/2015-mergers-acquisitions/423096/">soared</a>, which also helps explain the decline in public companies.)</p><p>Meanwhile, private equity has matured into a multitrillion-dollar industry, devoted to making short-term profits from highly leveraged transactions, operating with almost no regulatory or public scrutiny. Not all private-equity deals end in calamity, of course, and not all public companies are paragons of civic virtue. But the secrecy in which private-equity firms operate emboldens them to act more recklessly—and makes it much harder to hold them accountable when they do. Private-equity investment in nursing homes, to take just one example, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/WP_118-Appelbaum-and-Batt-2-rb-Clean.pdf">has grown</a> from about $5 billion at the turn of the century to more than $100 billion today. The results have not been pretty. The industry seems to have recognized that it could improve profit margins by cutting back on staffing while relying more on psychoactive medication. Stories abound of patients being <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/opioid-overdoses-bedsores-and-broken-bones-what-happened-when-a-private-equity-firm-sought-profits-in-caring-for-societys-most-vulnerable/2018/11/25/09089a4a-ed14-11e8-baac-2a674e91502b_story.html">rushed</a> to the hospital after being overprescribed opioids, of bedside call buttons so <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/when-private-equity-takes-over-a-nursing-home">poorly attended</a> that residents suffer in silence while waiting for help, of nurses being <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/5843893/nursing-homes-workers-coronavirus/">pressured</a> to work while sick with COVID. A 2021 study <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/digest/202104/how-patients-fare-when-private-equity-funds-acquire-nursing-homes">concluded</a> that private-equity ownership was associated with about 22,500 premature nursing-home deaths from 2005 to 2017—<em>before</em> the wave of death and misery wrought by the pandemic.</p><p>Eventually, the public got wind of what was happening. The pandemic death count focused attention on the industry. Journalists and watchdog groups exposed the worst of the behaviors. Policy makers and regulators, at long last, began to take action. But by then, much of the damage had been done. “If we had some form of disclosure, we probably would have seen regulatory action a decade earlier,” Coates told me. “But instead, we’ve had 10-plus years of experimentation and abuse without anyone knowing.”</p><p>Something similar could be said about any number of industries, including <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24976">higher education</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/alden-global-capital-killing-americas-newspapers/620171/">newspapers</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-private-equity/561758/">retail</a>, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/how-private-equity-ruined-fairway/606625/">grocery stores</a>. Across the economy, private-equity firms are known for laying off workers, evading regulations, reducing the quality of services, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/private-equity-firms-bankruptcies-plunder-book/673896/">bankrupting companies</a> while ensuring that their own partners are paid handsomely. The veil of secrecy makes all of this easier to execute and harder to stop.</p><p>Private-equity funds dispute many of the criticisms of the industry. They argue that the horror stories are exaggerated and that a handful of problematic firms shouldn’t tarnish the rest of the industry, which is doing great work. Freed from onerous disclosure requirements, they claim, private companies can build more dynamic, flexible businesses that generate greater returns for shareholders. But the lack of public information makes verifying these claims difficult. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/ReplicatingPE_201512_3859877f-bd53-4d3e-99aa-6daec2a3a2d3.pdf">Most</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=473341">careful</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597259">academic</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/30225708">studies</a> find that although private-equity funds slightly outperformed the stock market on average prior to the early 2000s, they no longer do so. When you take into account their high fees, they appear to be a worse investment than a simple index fund.</p><p>“These companies basically get to write their own stories,” says Alyssa Giachino, the research director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “They produce their own reports. They come up with their own numbers. And there’s no one making sure they are telling the truth.”</p><p>I<span>n the Roaring ’20s,</span> the lack of corporate disclosure allowed a massive financial crisis to build up without anyone noticing. A century later, the growth of a new shadow economy could pose similar risks.</p><p>The hallmark of a private-equity deal is the so-called leveraged buyout. Funds take on massive amounts of debt to buy companies, with the goal of reselling in a few years at a profit. If all of that debt becomes hard to pay back—because of, say, an economic downturn or rising interest rates—a wave of defaults could ripple through the financial system. In fact, this has happened before: The original leveraged buyout mania of the 1980s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-10-29-op-140-story.html">helped spark</a> the 1989 stock-market crash. Since then, private equity has grown into a $12 trillion industry and has begun raising much of its money from unregulated, nonbank lenders, many of which are owned by the same private-equity funds taking out loans in the first place.</p><p>Meanwhile, interest rates have reached a 20-year high, posing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-exits-sink-to-one-of-lowest-points-in-over-a-decade-86b684b6">a direct threat</a> to private equity’s debt-heavy business model. In response, many private-equity funds have migrated toward even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-26/private-equity-is-piling-debt-on-itself-like-never-before?sref=BGQFqz7X">riskier forms</a> of backroom financing. Many of these involve taking on even more debt on <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/afc90e17-253d-49a7-bc39-dc5fbe31e648">the assumption</a> that market conditions will soon improve enough to restore profitability. If that doesn’t happen—and many of these big deals fail—the implications could be massive.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-hospitals-health-care/675779">Joe Nocera and Bethany McLean: What financial engineering does to hospitals</a></p><p>The industry counters that private markets are a better place for risky deals precisely because they have fewer ties to the real economy. A traditional bank has a bunch of ordinary depositors, whereas if a private-equity firm goes bust, the losers are institutional investors: pension funds, university endowments, wealthy fund managers. Bad, but not catastrophic. The problem, once again, is that no one knows how true that story is. Banks have to disclose information to regulators about how much they’re lending, how much capital they’re holding, and how their loans are performing. Private lenders sidestep all of that, meaning that regulators can’t know what risks exist in the system or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackstones-first-quarter-earnings-plunge-real-estate-slowdown-2023-04-20/">how tied they are</a> to the real economy.</p><p>“Everything could be just fine,” says Ana Arsov, a managing director at Moody’s Investors Service who leads research on private lending. “But the point is that we don’t have the information we need to assess risk. Who is making these loans? How big are they? What are the terms? We just don’t know. So the worry is that the leverage in the system might grow and grow and grow without anyone noticing. And we really don’t know what the effects could be if something goes wrong.”</p><p>The government appears to be at least somewhat <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/2023/spsept2023.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20findings%20of,to%20their%20reliance%20on%20leverage">aware</a> of this problem. In August, the SEC <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-private-fund-advisers-082323">proposed</a> a new rule requiring private-equity fund advisers to give more information to their investors. That’s better than nothing, but it hardly addresses the bad behavior or systemic risk. Nearly a century ago, Congress concluded that the nation’s economic system could not survive as long as its most powerful companies were left to operate in the shadows. It took the worst economic cataclysm in American history to learn that lesson. The question now is what it will take to learn it again.</p><hr><p><em><small>This article originally stated that Ana Arsov works for Moody's Analytics.

<p>Between now and the end of October, we’ll be running a series of regular articles and videos, focusing on different aspects of the platform. Keep checking in <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/5">here</a>.</p>



<h2>A little history</h2>



<p>Way back in June 2019, we launched Raspberry Pi 4, the first true PC-class Raspberry Pi computer. With a quad-core Arm Cortex-A72 processor clocked at 1.5GHz, it was roughly forty times faster than the original Raspberry Pi model from 2012. In many ways the timing was perfect: in March the following year, schools closed, and millions of schoolchildren around the world were sent to study from home. Tens of thousands of them were able to rely on a Raspberry Pi 4 as their primary PC.</p>

</p><figcaption>Watch Raspberry Pi 5 show you all of its bits without talking</figcaption></figure>







<p>In the four years since then, Raspberry Pi 4, and its derivatives Raspberry Pi 400 and Compute Module 4, have become firm favourites of enthusiasts, educators, and professional design engineers worldwide. Modern Raspberry Pi 4 computers run 20% faster than the launch variant, with a core clock speed of 1.8GHz. And, despite the well publicised challenges that have affected the electronics supply chain over the last two years, we’ve made and sold over 14 million units of Raspberry Pi 4 in that time.</p>



<p>But time doesn’t stand still, and neither does our community’s appetite for performance. And since 2016 — the era of Raspberry Pi 3 — we’ve been quietly working on a much more radical overhaul of the Raspberry Pi platform. Today, that effort bears fruit, with the launch of Raspberry Pi 5: compared to Raspberry Pi 4, we have between two and three times the CPU and GPU performance; roughly twice the memory and I/O bandwidth; and for the first time we have Raspberry Pi silicon on a flagship Raspberry Pi device.</p>



<h2>New platform, new chipset</h2>



<p>Three new chips, each designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi 5 program, come together to deliver a step change in performance.</p>



<h3>BCM2712</h3>


<div>

<p>BCM2712 is a new 16-nanometer application processor (AP) from Broadcom, derived from the 28-nanometer BCM2711 AP which powers Raspberry Pi 4, with numerous architectural enhancements. At its heart is a quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 processor, clocked at 2.4GHz, with 512KB per-core L2 caches, and a 2MB shared L3 cache. Cortex-A76 is three microarchitectural generations beyond Cortex-A72, and offers both more instructions per clock (IPC) and lower energy per instruction. The combination of a newer core, a higher clock speed, and a smaller process geometry yields a much faster Raspberry Pi, and one that consumes much less power for a given workload.</p>



<p>Our newer, faster CPU is complemented by a newer, faster GPU: Broadcom’s VideoCore VII, developed here in Cambridge, with fully open source Mesa drivers from our friends at Igalia. An updated VideoCore hardware video scaler (HVS) is capable of driving two simultaneous 4Kp60 HDMI displays, up from single 4Kp60 or dual 4Kp30 on Raspberry Pi 4. A 4Kp60 HEVC decoder and a new Image Sensor Pipeline (ISP), both developed at Raspberry Pi, round out the multimedia subsystem. To keep the system supplied with memory bandwidth, we have a 32-bit LPDDR4X SDRAM subsystem, running at 4267MT/s, up from an effective 2000MT/s on Raspberry Pi 4.</p>



<h3>RP1</h3>



<p>Previous Raspberry Pi generations were built on a <em>monolithic</em> AP architecture: while some peripheral functions were provided by an external device (the Via Labs VL805 USB controller and hub on Raspberry Pi 4, and the Microchip LAN951x and LAN7515 USB hub and Ethernet controller chips on earlier products), substantially all of the I/O functions were integrated into the AP itself. Fairly early in the history of Raspberry Pi, we realised that as we migrated the AP to progressively newer process nodes, this approach would eventually become both technically and economically unsustainable.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi 5, in contrast, is built on a disaggregated <em>chiplet</em> architecture. Here, only the major fast digital functions, the SD card interface (for board layout reasons), and the very fastest interfaces (SDRAM, HDMI, and PCI Express) are provided by the AP. All other I/O functions are offloaded to a separate I/O controller, implemented on an older, cheaper process node, and connected to the AP via PCI Express.</p>



<p>RP1 is our I/O controller for Raspberry Pi 5, designed by the same team at Raspberry Pi that delivered the RP2040 microcontroller, and implemented, like RP2040, on TSMC’s mature 40LP process. It provides two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 interfaces; a Gigabit Ethernet controller; two four-lane MIPI transceivers for camera and display; analogue video output; 3.3V general-purpose I/O (GPIO); and the usual collection of GPIO-multiplexed low-speed interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C, I2S, and PWM). A four-lane PCI Express 2.0 interface provides a 16Gb/s link back to BCM2712.</p>



<p>Under development since 2016, RP1 is by a good margin the longest-running, most complex, and (at $15 million) most expensive program we’ve ever undertaken here at Raspberry Pi. It has undergone substantial evolution over the years, as our projected requirements have changed: the C0 step used on Raspberry Pi 5 is the third major revision of the silicon. And while its interfaces differ in fine detail from those of BCM2711, they have been designed to be very similar from a functional perspective, ensuring a high degree of compatibility with earlier Raspberry Pi devices.</p>



<h3>DA9091</h3>



<p>BCM2712 and RP1 are supported by the third new component of the chipset, the Renesas DA9091 “Gilmour” power-management IC (PMIC). This integrates eight separate switch-mode power supplies to generate the various voltages required by the board, including a quad-phase core supply, capable of providing 20 amps of current to power the Cortex-A76 cores and other digital logic in BCM2712.</p>

<p>Like BCM2712, DA9091 is the product of a multi-year co-development effort. Working closely with the Renesas team in Edinburgh allowed us to produce a PMIC which is precisely tuned for our needs. And we were able to squeeze in two frequently requested features: a real-time clock (RTC), which can be powered by an external supercapacitor or a rechargeable lithium-manganese cell; and a PC-style power button, supporting hard and soft power-off and power-on events.</p>



<p>Two other elements of the chipset have been retained from Raspberry Pi 4. The Infineon CYW43455 combo chip provides dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 with Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE); while the chip itself is unchanged, it is provided with a dedicated switched power supply rail for lower power consumption, and is connected to BCM2712 by an upgraded SDIO interface which supports DDR50 mode for higher potential throughput. As before, Ethernet connectivity is provided by a Broadcom BCM54213 Gigabit Ethernet PHY; this now sits at a jaunty 45-degree angle, a first for Raspberry Pi, and a source of enduring disappointment for orthogonal-layout enthusiast and CTO (Software) Gordon Hollingworth.</p>



<h2>Form-factor evolution</h2>



<p>On the outside, Raspberry Pi 5 closely resembles its predecessors. But, while retaining the overall credit-card-sized footprint, we’ve taken the opportunity to update some elements of the design, to align with the capabilities of the new chipset.</p>



<p>We’ve removed the four-pole composite video and analogue audio jack from the board. Composite video, now generated by RP1, is still available from a pair of 0.1”-spaced pads on the bottom edge of the board.</p>



<p>We now sport a pair of FPC connectors, in the space formerly occupied by the four-pole jack and camera connector. These are four-lane MIPI interfaces, using the same higher-density pinout found on various generations of Compute Module I/O board; and they are bi-directional (transceiver) interfaces, meaning that each one can connect either to a CSI-2 camera or to a DSI display. The space on the left of the board formerly occupied by the display connector now contains a smaller FPC connector which provides a single lane of PCI Express 2.0 connectivity for high-speed peripherals.</p>

<p>The Gigabit Ethernet jack has returned to its classic position in the bottom right corner of the board, after a brief sojourn in the top right on Raspberry Pi 4. And it’s brought with it the four-pin PoE connector, simplifying the board layout at the cost of a compatibility break with our existing PoE and PoE+ HATs.</p>



<p>Finally, we’ve grown a pair of mounting holes for a heatsink, as well as JST connectors for the RTC battery (two pins), Arm debug and UART (three pins), and fan with PWM control and tacho feedback (four pins).</p>



<h2>Designed in Cambridge, manufactured in Wales</h2>



<p>Like all flagship Raspberry Pi products, Raspberry Pi 5 is built at the Sony UK Technology Centre in Pencoed, South Wales. We have been working with Sony since the launch of the first Raspberry Pi computer in 2012, and we’re firm believers in the benefits of manufacturing our products within a few hours’ drive of our engineering design centre in Cambridge: a decade of frequent interaction with the Sony team has helped us understand how to design products that can be built reliably, cheaply, and at massive scale.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi 5 marks the introduction of a number of manufacturing innovations. One of these is intrusive reflow for connectors, which improves the mechanical quality of the product, increases throughput, and eliminates the costly and energy-intensive selective- or wave-solder process from the production flow. Others include fully routed panel singulation for cleaner board edges, and a new approach to production test inspired by our experiences testing our RP2040 microcontroller at scale.</p>



<h2>Accessories, accessories, accessories</h2>



<p>Every new flagship Raspberry Pi product is accompanied by new accessories, and Raspberry Pi 5 is no exception. Layout changes, new interfaces, and much higher peak performance (and a smaller increase in peak power consumption) have led us to redesign some existing accessories, and to develop some entirely new ones.</p>



<h3>Case</h3>



<p>The updated case for Raspberry Pi 5, priced at $10, builds on the aesthetic of its Raspberry Pi 4 predecessor, but adds a host of new usability and thermal-management features.</p>



<p>An integrated 2.79 (max) CFM fan, with fluid dynamic bearings selected for low noise and an extended operating lifetime, connects to the four-pin JST connector on Raspberry Pi 5 to provide temperature‑controlled cooling. Air is drawn in through a 360‑degree slot under the lid, blown over a heatsink attached to the BCM2712 AP, and exhausted through connector apertures and vents in the base.</p>

<p>We’ve lengthened the case, and tweaked the retention features, to make it possible to insert the Raspberry Pi 5 board without removing the SD card. And by removing the top of the case, it is now possible to stack multiple cases, as well as to mount HATs on top of the fan, using spacers and GPIO header extensions.</p>



<p>Like all our plastic products, the new case is manufactured by our friends at <a href="https://www.t-zero.co.uk/">T-Zero</a>, in the West Midlands, UK.</p>



<h3>Active Cooler</h3>



<p>Raspberry Pi 5 has been designed to handle typical client workloads, uncased, with no active cooling. Users who wish to use the board uncased under continuous heavy load, without throttling, have the option of adding a $5 Active Cooler. This attaches to the board via two new mounting holes, and connects to the same four-pin JST connector as the case&nbsp;fan.</p>


<div>

<p>A radial blower, again selected for low noise and extended operating lifetime, pushes air through an extruded and milled aluminium heatsink. Both the case and the Active Cooler are able to keep Raspberry Pi 5 well below the thermal throttle point for typical ambient temperatures and worst-case loads. The cooling performance of the Active Cooler is somewhat superior, making it particularly suitable for overclockers.</p>



<h3>27W USB-C Power Supply</h3>



<p>Raspberry Pi 5 consumes significantly less power, and runs significantly cooler, than Raspberry Pi 4 when running an identical workload. However, the much higher performance ceiling means that for the most intensive workloads, and in particular for pathological “power virus” workloads, peak power consumption increases to around 12W, versus 8W for Raspberry Pi 4.</p>



<p>When using a standard 5V, 3A (15W) USB-C power adapter with Raspberry Pi 5, by default we must limit downstream USB current to 600mA to ensure that we have sufficient margin to support these workloads. This is lower than the 1.2A limit on Raspberry Pi 4, though generally still sufficient to drive mice, keyboards, and other low‑power peripherals.</p>

<p>For users who wish to drive high-power peripherals like hard drives and SSDs while retaining margin for peak workloads, we are offering a $12 USB-C power adapter which supports a 5V, 5A (25W) operating mode. If the Raspberry Pi 5 firmware detects this supply, it increases the USB current limit to 1.6A, providing 5W of extra power for downstream USB devices and 5W of extra on-board power budget: a boon for those of you who want to experiment with overclocking your Raspberry Pi 5.</p>



<p>It should be noted that users have the option to override the current limit, specifying the higher value even when using a 3A adapter. In our testing, we have found that in this mode Raspberry Pi 5 functions perfectly well with typical configurations of higher-power USB devices, and all but the most pathological workloads.</p>



<h3>Camera and display cables</h3>



<p>The new, higher-density pinout of the MIPI connectors means that an adapter is required to connect our own cameras and displays, and third-party products, to Raspberry Pi 5.</p>



<p>To support existing camera and display owners, we are offering FPC camera and display cables, which convert from the higher-density format (now referred to as “mini”) to the older lower-density format (now referred to as “standard”). These cables are available in 200mm, 300mm, and 500mm lengths, priced at $1, $2, and $3 respectively.</p>

<p>Camera Module 3, the High-Quality Camera, the Global Shutter Camera, and the Touchscreen Display will all ship with both a standard-to-standard and a 200mm mini-to-standard cable.</p>



<h3>PoE+ HAT</h3>



<p>From early 2024, we will be offering a new PoE+ HAT. This supports the new location for the four-pin PoE header, and has an L-shaped form factor which allows it to sit inside the Raspberry Pi 5 case without interfering mechanically or disrupting airflow.</p>


<div>

We don’t know yet what the production version will look like, but we do know that it won’t look like this.</figcaption></figure></div>






<p>The new PoE+ HAT integrates a planar transformer into the PCB layout, and utilises an optimised flyback converter architecture to sustain high efficiency across the whole zero to 25W range of output powers.</p>



<h3>M.2 HATs </h3>



<p>One of the most exciting additions to the Raspberry Pi 5 feature set is the single-lane PCI Express 2.0 interface. Intended to support fast peripherals, it is exposed on a 16-pin, 0.5mm pitch&nbsp;FPC connector on the left-hand side of the board.</p>



<p>From early 2024, we will be offering a pair of mechanical adapter boards which convert between this connector and a subset of the M.2 standard, allowing users to attach NVMe SSDs and other M.2-format accessories. The first, which conforms to the standard HAT form factor, is intended for mounting larger devices. The second, which shares the L-shaped form factor of the new PoE+ HAT, supports mounting 2230- and 2242-format devices inside the Raspberry Pi 5 case.</p>

<p>Last, but very much not least, we have sourced a Panasonic lithium manganese rechargeable coin cell, with a pre-fitted two-pin JST plug and an adhesive mounting pad. This is priced at $5, and is suitable for powering the Raspberry Pi 5 real-time clock (RTC) when the main power supply is disconnected.</p>



<h2>A newer, better Raspberry Pi OS</h2>



<p>In parallel with the final stages of the Raspberry Pi 5 programme, our software team has been busy developing a new version of Raspberry Pi OS, the official first-party operating system for Raspberry Pi devices. This is based on the most recent release of Debian (and its derivative Raspbian), codenamed “Bookworm”, and incorporates numerous enhancements, notably the transition from X11 to the Wayfire Wayland compositor on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5.</p>



<p>Raspberry Pi OS will launch in mid-October, and will be the sole supported first-party operating system for Raspberry Pi 5. Keep checking back here: we’ll be telling you some more about the new OS, and you’ll be able to download it shortly before Raspberry Pi 5 arrives on the shelves in late October.</p>

	<div>
								


<div><p>Today, President Biden is issuing a landmark Executive Order to ensure that America leads the way in seizing the promise and managing the risks of artificial intelligence (AI). The Executive Order establishes new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy, advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around the world, and more.</p><p>As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive strategy for responsible innovation, the Executive Order builds on previous actions the President has taken, including work that led to voluntary commitments from 15 leading companies to drive safe, secure, and trustworthy development of AI.</p><p>The Executive Order directs the following actions:</p><p><strong>New Standards for AI Safety and Security</strong></p></div>



<p>As AI’s capabilities grow, so do its implications for Americans’ safety and security.&nbsp;<strong>With this Executive Order, the</strong><strong>&nbsp;President directs the&nbsp;</strong><strong>most sweeping&nbsp;</strong><strong>actions&nbsp;</strong><strong>ever taken&nbsp;</strong><strong>to protect Americans from&nbsp;</strong><strong>the potential&nbsp;</strong><strong>risks&nbsp;</strong><strong>of&nbsp;</strong><strong>AI</strong><strong>&nbsp;systems</strong><strong>:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Require that developers of the most powerful AI systems share their safety test results and other critical information with the U.S. government.&nbsp;</strong>In accordance with the Defense Production Act, the Order will require that companies developing any foundation model that poses a serious risk to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety must notify the federal government when training the model, and must share the results of all red-team safety tests. These measures will ensure AI systems are safe, secure, and trustworthy before companies make them public.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Develop standards, tools, and tests to help ensure that AI systems are safe, secure, and trustworthy.</strong>&nbsp;The National Institute of Standards and Technology will set the rigorous standards for extensive red-team testing to ensure safety before public release. The Department of Homeland Security will apply those standards to critical infrastructure sectors and establish the AI Safety and Security Board. The Departments of Energy and Homeland Security will also address AI systems’ threats to critical infrastructure, as well as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks. Together, these are the most significant actions ever taken by any government to advance the field of AI safety.</li>



<li><strong>Protect against the risks of using AI to engineer dangerous biological materials&nbsp;</strong>by developing strong new standards for biological synthesis screening. Agencies that fund life-science projects will establish these standards as a condition of federal funding, creating powerful incentives to ensure appropriate screening and manage risks potentially made worse by AI.</li>



<li><strong>Protect Americans from AI-enabled fraud and deception by establishing standards and best practices for detecting AI-generated content and authenticating official content</strong>. The Department of Commerce will develop guidance for content authentication and watermarking to clearly label AI-generated content. Federal agencies will use these tools to make it easy for Americans to know that the communications they receive from their government are authentic—and set an example for the private sector and governments around the world.</li>



<li><strong>Establish an advanced cybersecurity program to develop AI tools to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical software,&nbsp;</strong>building on the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing AI Cyber Challenge. Together, these efforts will harness AI’s potentially game-changing cyber capabilities to make software and networks more secure.</li>



<li><strong>Order the development of a National Security Memorandum that directs further actions on AI and security,&nbsp;</strong>to be developed by the National Security Council and White House Chief of Staff. This document will ensure that the United States military and intelligence community use AI safely, ethically, and effectively in their missions, and will direct actions to counter adversaries’ military use of AI.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Protecting Americans’ Privacy</strong></p>



<p>Without safeguards, AI can put Americans’ privacy further at risk. AI not only makes it easier to extract, identify, and exploit personal data, but it also heightens incentives to do so because companies use data to train AI systems.&nbsp;<strong>To better protect Americans’ privacy, including from the risks posed by AI, the President calls on Congress to pass bipartisan data privacy legislation to protect all Americans, especially kids, and directs the following actions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Protect Americans’ privacy by prioritizing federal support for accelerating the development and use of privacy-preserving techniques—</strong>including ones that use cutting-edge AI and that let AI systems be trained while preserving the privacy of the training data. &nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Strengthen privacy-preserving research</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and technologies,</strong>&nbsp;such as cryptographic tools that preserve individuals’ privacy, by funding a Research Coordination Network to advance rapid breakthroughs and development. The National Science Foundation will also work with this network to promote the adoption of leading-edge privacy-preserving technologies by federal agencies.</li>



<li><strong>Evaluate how agencies collect and use commercially available information</strong>—including information they procure from data brokers—and<strong>&nbsp;strengthen privacy guidance for federal agencies</strong>&nbsp;to account for AI risks. This work will focus in particular on commercially available information containing personally identifiable data.</li>



<li><strong>Develop guidelines for federal agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy-preserving techniques,&nbsp;</strong>including those used in AI systems. These guidelines will advance agency efforts to protect Americans’ data.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Advancing Equity and Civil Rights</strong></p>



<p>Irresponsible uses of AI can lead to and deepen discrimination, bias, and other abuses in justice, healthcare, and housing. The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken action by publishing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>&nbsp;and issuing an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/16/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-to-strengthen-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-across-the-federal-government/">Executive Order directing agencies to combat algorithmic discrimination</a>, while enforcing existing authorities to protect people’s rights and safety.&nbsp;<strong>To ensure that AI advances equity and civil rights, the President directs the following additional actions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Provide clear guidance to landlords, Federal benefits programs, and federal contractors&nbsp;</strong>to keep AI algorithms from being used to exacerbate discrimination.</li>



<li><strong>Address algorithmic discrimination&nbsp;</strong>through training, technical assistance, and coordination between the Department of Justice and Federal civil rights offices on best practices for investigating and prosecuting civil rights violations related to AI.</li>



<li><strong>Ensure fairness throughout the criminal justice system&nbsp;</strong>by developing best practices on the use of AI in sentencing, parole and probation, pretrial release and detention, risk assessments, surveillance, crime forecasting and predictive policing, and forensic analysis.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Standing Up for Consumers, Patients, and Students</strong></p>



<p>AI can bring real benefits to consumers—for example, by making products better, cheaper, and more widely available. But AI also raises the risk of injuring, misleading, or otherwise harming Americans.&nbsp;<strong>To protect consumers while ensuring that AI can make Americans better off, the President directs the following actions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Advance the responsible use of AI&nbsp;</strong>in healthcare and the development of affordable and life-saving drugs. The Department of Health and Human Services will also establish a safety program to receive reports of—and act to remedy – harms or unsafe healthcare practices involving AI.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Shape AI’s potential to transform education&nbsp;</strong>by creating resources to support educators deploying AI-enabled educational tools, such as personalized tutoring in schools.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Supporting Workers</strong></p>



<p>AI is changing America’s jobs and workplaces, offering both the promise of improved productivity but also the dangers of increased workplace surveillance, bias, and job displacement.&nbsp;<strong>To mitigate these risks, support workers’ ability to bargain collectively, and invest in workforce training and development that is accessible to all, the President directs the following actions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers&nbsp;</strong>by addressing job displacement; labor standards; workplace equity, health, and safety; and data collection. These principles and best practices will benefit workers by providing guidance to prevent employers from undercompensating workers, evaluating job applications unfairly, or impinging on workers’ ability to organize.</li>



<li><strong>Produce a report on AI’s potential labor-market impacts</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>study and identify options for strengthening federal support for workers facing labor disruptions</strong>, including from AI.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Promoting Innovation and Competition</strong></p>



<p>America already leads in AI innovation—more AI startups raised first-time capital in the United States last year than in the next seven countries combined.&nbsp;<strong>The Executive Order ensures that we continue to lead the way in innovation and competition through the following actions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Catalyze AI research across the United States&nbsp;</strong>through a pilot of the National AI Research Resource—a tool that will provide AI researchers and students access to key AI resources and data—and expanded grants for AI research in vital areas like healthcare and climate change.</li>



<li><strong>Promote a fair, open, and competitive AI ecosystem&nbsp;</strong>by providing small developers and entrepreneurs access to technical assistance and resources, helping small businesses commercialize AI breakthroughs, and encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to exercise its authorities.</li>



<li><strong>Use existing authorities to expand the ability of highly skilled immigrants and nonimmigrants with expertise in critical areas to study, stay, and work in the United States</strong>&nbsp;by modernizing and streamlining visa criteria, interviews, and reviews.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Advancing American Leadership Abroad</strong></p>



<p>AI’s challenges and opportunities are global.&nbsp;<strong>The Biden-Harris Administration will continue working with other nations to support safe, secure, and trustworthy deployment and use of AI worldwide. To that end, the President directs the following actions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Expand bilateral, multilateral, and multistakeholder engagements to collaborate on AI</strong>. The State Department, in collaboration, with the Commerce Department will lead an effort to establish robust international frameworks for harnessing AI’s benefits and managing its risks and ensuring safety. In addition, this week, Vice President Harris will speak at the UK Summit on AI Safety, hosted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</li>



<li><strong>Accelerate development and implementation of vital AI standards</strong>&nbsp;with international partners and in standards organizations, ensuring that the technology is safe, secure, trustworthy, and interoperable.</li>



<li><strong>Promote the safe, responsible, and rights-affirming development and deployment of AI abroad to solve global challenges,&nbsp;</strong>such as advancing sustainable development and mitigating dangers to critical infrastructure.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ensuring Responsible and Effective Government Use of AI</strong></p>



<p>AI can help government deliver better results for the American people. It can expand agencies’ capacity to regulate, govern, and disburse benefits, and it can cut costs and enhance the security of government systems. However, use of AI can pose risks, such as discrimination and unsafe decisions.&nbsp;<strong>To ensure the responsible government deployment of AI and modernize federal AI infrastructure, the President directs the following actions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Issue guidance for agencies’ use of AI,&nbsp;</strong>including clear standards to protect rights and safety, improve AI procurement, and strengthen AI deployment. &nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Help agencies acquire specified AI products and services</strong>&nbsp;faster, more cheaply, and more effectively through more rapid and efficient contracting.</li>



<li><strong>Accelerate the rapid hiring of AI professionals</strong>&nbsp;as part of a government-wide AI talent surge led by the Office of Personnel Management, U.S. Digital Service, U.S. Digital Corps, and Presidential Innovation Fellowship. Agencies will provide AI training for employees at all levels in relevant fields.</li>
</ul>



<div><p>As we advance this agenda at home, the Administration will work with allies and partners abroad on a strong international framework to govern the development and use of AI. The Administration has already consulted widely on AI governance frameworks over the past several months—engaging with Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, the UAE, and the UK. The actions taken today support and complement Japan’s leadership of the G-7 Hiroshima Process, the UK Summit on AI Safety, India’s leadership as Chair of the Global Partnership on AI, and ongoing discussions at the United Nations.</p><p>The actions that President Biden directed today are vital steps forward in the U.S.’s approach on safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. More action will be required, and the Administration will continue to work with Congress to pursue bipartisan legislation to help America lead the way in responsible innovation.</p><p>For more on the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to advance AI, and for opportunities to join the Federal AI workforce, visit <a href="https://ai.gov/">AI.gov</a>.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>In 1985, shortly after the release of </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-windows-10" rel="">Windows 1.0</a><span>, Bill Gates set Min Lee on a mission to find a partner for a digital encyclopedia product that would serve as a reference companion to Microsoft’s productivity applications. Lee then approached Britannica, the undisputed leader in the encyclopedia market, who’d recently released a new version of the fifteenth edition of their encyclopedia. Microsoft proposed a partnership to produce a multimedia CD-ROM version of the Encyclopædia Britannica. In exchange for non-exclusive rights to Britannica’s text, Microsoft would pay Britannica a royalty on each copy of the CD-ROM product sold. Britannica immediately declined Lee’s proposal. Britannica’s director of public relations at the time, Larry Grinnell, said: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>The Encyclopædia Britannica has no plans to be on a home computer. And since the market is so small, only 4 or 5 percent of households have computers, we would not want to hurt our traditional way of selling.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>While this might seem insane now, this was not at all insane in 1985. Home computers weren’t yet common, and computers capable of any sort of multimedia were even less common. Microsoft was a much smaller company than it would be in a few short years, and it was a company known primarily for </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/history-of-basic-part-1" rel="">BASIC</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/disk-operating-systems" rel="">MS-DOS</a><span>. Britannica had no readily apparent reason to fear competition from Microsoft and little reason to desire a partnership with a young company. Britannica was </span><em>the </em><span>encyclopedia. They controlled the market, charged extremely high prices, and had strong and stable profits. Britannica was also a company that was led by its sales organization. Traditionally, encyclopedias were something sold not bought. A person didn’t walk into a bookstore and buy the set; a door-to-door salesman showed up.</span></p><div id="youtube2--lSLzYKVd2s" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;-lSLzYKVd2s&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-lSLzYKVd2s?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>For Britannica, losing its sales people was a real fear. Would they defect if they learned that a cheaper product with the same information was being sold? Would they wish to be associated with a CD-ROM product instead of the stately and serious books they were selling?</p><p><span>Also in 1985, Grolier’s released two electronic forms of its own encyclopedia.

This search went on for four years until Microsoft was able to strike a deal with Funk &amp; Wagnall’s which was nearly bankrupt at the time. With the deal in place, Microsoft began project Gandalf. Whether in hope of remaining competitive with Grolier’s or something they’d intended but chose to keep secret, Britannica did release their own multimedia CD-ROM encyclopedia in 1989 under the Compton brand name. The Compton product was a free add-on to print encyclopedias from Britannica, but a standalone CD-ROM version retailed for $895 (around $2221 in 2023).</p><p>The Funk &amp; Wagnall’s name wasn’t well regarded so the Gandalf team knew that it wouldn’t be part of their own product’s name. Lee, Gates, and the team also knew that simply putting the text on a disc wasn’t enough. This would be a new kind of encyclopedia with search, hyperlinks, graphics, sound, video, and interactivity; an encyclopedia designed with images, illustrations, and maps in mind from the start. Despite having both passion and ambition, this was a relatively high risk project and the team was small. When the project had first started, printed encyclopedia sets generally sold at a price above $1000 (nearly $3000 in 2023). With Grolier’s and Compton’s both having been on the market, the common price had steadily fallen to just under $400 (around $941 in 2023). The profit that might have been was clearly reduced, and a race to the bottom had begun. Until October of 1991, project Gandalf’s team had consisted of fewer than 4 full-time employees at any one time. This started to increase as the project took more form, and the editorial team at Microsoft became the largest editorial team of any encyclopedia publisher over the product’s lifetime.</p><p>To make this encyclopedia work, several DLLs were created in C that extended Multimedia Viewer. These were then used with SGML text files and an Access database. The resulting product was Microsoft Encarta which  included fourteen thousand media elements, five thousand photos, one hundred animations, and seven hours of sound. Getting all of this together was a difficult process for the team. For each image, animation, or audio clip included, something had to be removed. CD-ROM storage is very much a zero sum game.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png" width="735" height="692" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:692,&quot;width&quot;:735,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:583672,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7769ee51-e1fe-40b5-af3c-adbe0467ece5_735x692.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>PC Magazine, 22nd of December 1992</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>At launch in March of 1993, Encarta was $395 (around $841 in 2023). Over the first six months following release, it gained just three percent market share. Compton’s had reacted to Microsoft’s entrance by dropping their price to $129 (around $274 in 2023) for anyone who claimed to own a competitor’s product. Retail outlets didn’t exert much effort to have customers prove the claim, and Compton’s started to sell very well. The Encarta sales team was eager to drop the price to compete, and Encarta was then sold at $99 (around $210 in 2023) for the holiday season. By the year’s end, Encarta was the best selling CD encyclopedia on the market with more than three hundred fifty thousand copies sold. Encarta quickly became a product bundled with multimedia PCs, and revenue was brought in as people bought newer editions. This first edition was followed by the “1994” edition later in 1993, and a release was made yearly thereafter. For many people, Encarta was the first practical reason to purchase a CD-ROM drive for a computer. While audio CDs had been introduced in Japan in 1982 with Europe and North America following in 1983, they didn’t overtake vinyl in the USA until 1988. CDs surpassed audio cassettes in 1992.

In 1990, Britannica’s annual revenues were $650 million (about $1.5 billion in 2023). This figure dropped to $345 million for 1996 (around $677 million in 2023). Britannica sold the Compton’s digital product line to the Chicago Tribune for $57 million in 1993 (around $112 million in 2023) as they had finally relented and released CD-ROM version with their primary brand for $1200 (around $2492 in 2023). This failed and the price was dropped to $995 in 1995 (around $2009 in 2023). The sales force was furious, the product didn’t sell despite the price reduction, and in August, Britannica closed two-thirds of its sales offices. It launched a web version of its product in October.  By December, things were bleak and a sale of Britannica to Jacob E. Safra was announced the 19th of December in 1995.</p><p><span>While Britannica was imploding, Microsoft’s efforts were going strong. Encarta was ported to the Macintosh in 1994. Encarta Atlas was introduced in 1995 and the product was made fully 32 bit using C++ and MFC. In 1996, Encarta expanded to two CDs. This again posed a difficult challenge. Stub articles had to be added to the first CD, and then upon clicking to expand an article the user was prompted to switch discs. How does navigating backward happen? Does the user get prompted to switch discs again? Does the user get a stub? Should the prior article be cached? When is any one of these options appropriate? All difficult choices. Figuring out when and where to make this happen wasn’t easy. Disc swapping was later ameliorated as hard disks grew in size and full installation became possible, but this wasn’t yet so. A virtual globe was added in 1997. Through the late 1990s, content was added to Encarta from both Collier’s and New Merit Scholar’s encyclopedias as Microsoft gained the rights to their respective texts. In 2000, Encarta became available on the web. Full access to the web was restricted to paid subscribers with a smaller subset of the encyclopedia made available to all. This also provided article updates to locally installed versions if users wanted it and had a subscription. 3D Virtual Tours were added to Encarta in 2001. Interestingly, Encarta was also available in Windows Live Messenger via </span><code>encarta@conversagent.com </code><span>or </span><code>encarta@botmetro.net</code><span>. Over the lifetime of Encarta, the encyclopedia expanded to 5 CDs or a DVD. The product was also available in three versions: Standard, Deluxe, Reference Library. The technical side of the program also changed to web technologies (Trident, HTML, CSS, Flash) and C# over time despite being available entirely locally on DVD. The team approached programming technologies very pragmatically attempting to choose the right tool for any given task as opposed to dogmatically choosing a single tool.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png" width="800" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26c25a32-7c0d-49b4-a67b-5a60bf1bbe45_800x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Encarta 98, Virtual Globe, Grand Canyon</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Unlike many products, Encarta’s ship dates were fixed. The product always had to be ready for “</span><em>back to school.</em><span>” Yet, this was also a product shipped on read-only media before cheap internet access existed, and therefore showstopping bugs couldn’t be present. When bugs did ship, they were often known to the team. So, if you walked through a wall in the Parthenon, the team knew this could happen. The key was that a bug couldn’t be so bad that it ruined the experience. The product was extremely rich in visuals, audio, and interactivity and therefore it could be (and by many on the design team certainly was) considered a work of art. People on the team lost hours over single pixel imperfections, over sluggishness or glitching in palette swapping, and over bugs in navigation history. People on the team would sometimes work for twenty four hours straight and sleep at their desks in attempts to get things ready to ship, and often enough entire articles or even features had to be pushed to a later edition.</span></p><p>Despite the Encarta team having grown and become international with localization teams around the globe, Encarta wasn’t a massive source of revenue for Microsoft. It had a large amount of overhead and the educational market was rather thin. Many of the people on the team could have received pay raises or promotions rather quickly if they’d transferred to other teams, but the Encarta team had rather low turnover. The sense that I get is that this was quite a dedicated team who enjoyed the work that they were doing and the product that they made. Several members mentioned that a rather serious occupational hazard was getting lost in content while working. They’d be editing something or testing something and find themselves having lost an hour just reading the encyclopedia they were working on, an eerily modern and relatable issue.</p><p>On the 9th of March in 2000, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Nupedia. This was an online encyclopedia where articles were written by volunteers who had subject matter expertise (with preference for PhDs). Those articles were then reviewed by editors, and approved articles were subsequently published online and licensed as free content. Apparently, encyclopedias are difficult to make. In it’s first year of operation, Nupedia had only 21 articles. On the 10th of January in 2001, Sanger proposed a wiki that would server as an upstream content source for Nupedia. Wikipedia was launched on the 15th of January in 2001. Wikipedia’s growth was explosive. In its first month, it gained 200 articles. By January of 2002, Wikipedia included more than 20000 articles. Nupedia was dissolved in September of 2003 following a server crash.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png" width="1456" height="899" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:899,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:258987,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916f8b32-2f25-45f2-bd06-8e04f526d287_1678x1036.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Wikipedia in January of 2002</figcaption></figure></div><p>Microsoft had completely revolutionized and democratized the encyclopedia market, made CDs common, and made human knowledge searchable. Unfortunately, Wikipedia continued to grow, and Encarta sales declined. Encarta was discontinued on the 31st of October in 2009. </p><p>Many reasons are given for Encarta’s demise. Wikipedia’s effect on the market cannot be discounted, but it also wasn’t the only cause. Google offered Wikipedia results and many more sites besides. People paying for an internet connection could simply search a topic or a question and be presented with millions of potential information sources. Personally, I find this disappointing. Encarta’s information was more engaging and more fun to explore. There were many rainy days in my youth where I could be found exploring Encarta 94 or 97. Encarta also had a better user experience than the web. There weren’t banner ads, pop ups, cookie notices, donation requests, or any other annoyance. A person could simply use a searchable, linked, multimedia encyclopedia.</p><p>I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, many of you were present for time periods I cover, and a few of you are mentioned by name in my articles. All corrections to the record are welcome; feel free to leave a comment.</p></div></div>]]></description>
