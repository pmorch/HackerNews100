            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quake II Rerelease Game Source</h2>
<p dir="auto">This repository contains the game code for the 2023 rerelease of Quake II, for users who wish to mod the game, along with the original game code that was use for reference. Mods can be loaded into the rerelease the same way as the original game: launch the game with <code>+set game mymod</code> or type <code>game mymod</code> into the console while the game is running. We recommend installing mods into your <code>%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake II</code> directory to ensure the original game files do not get modified.</p>
<p dir="auto">id Software is unable to provide support for this release, however we urge you to take advantage of the depth of community-driven resources already available.</p>
<p dir="auto">The rerelease of Quake II uses a new version of the API to communicate between the server &amp; the game module. It also introduces a very thin "client game" module, akin to Quake III Arena's cgame module, to allow for extended modding opportunities that change previously hardcoded client behavior. It also has a new network protocol, version 2023.</p>
<p dir="auto">This codebase is a combination of the separate game modules that were part of the original game: baseq2, ctf, rogue, and xatrix. It requires a C++17 compiler. In cases of conflicting spawnflags, maps were modified in order to resolve issues, so original expansion pack maps may not load correctly with this DLL. The combined FGD as used for development is also available for users wishing to make new maps. A modified TrenchBroom Quake II <code>gameconfig.cfg</code> is included as there are modified textureflags.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because the game export interface has changed, existing mods may be able to be moved over to support the API changes. However, in order to support all expansion packs under one codebase and new features in the rerelease, there have been some major changes to structure and layout, so old mods wishing to use the new codebase may need to be rewritten.</p>
<p dir="auto">The API changes discussed here are written from the perspective of the game DLL.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling</h2>
<p dir="auto">The game DLL has only been tested with Clang, VS2019 and VS2022.</p>
<p dir="auto">The code can compile under both C++17 and C++20. Using C++20 allows you to skip <code>fmtlib</code> as a dependency.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Required preprocessor definitions</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>GAME_INCLUDE</code> must be defined, tells <code>game.h</code> that this is the game DLL compiling it.</li>
<li><code>KEX_Q2GAME_EXPORTS</code> must be defined, tells <code>game.h</code> that we are exporting the <code>GetGameAPI</code> function.</li>
<li><code>KEX_Q2GAME_DYNAMIC</code> must be defined. The game DLL supports static linking on console platforms, but is always dynamic on PC.</li>
<li><code>NO_FMT_SOURCE</code>: this is only here because of a limitation in the internal build system. It must be defined.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Optional preprocessor definitions</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>KEX_Q2_GAME</code>: must be defined if compiling for Kex. This changes the behavior of the <code>say</code> command to go through the lobby.</li>
<li><code>KEX_Q2GAME_IMPORTS</code>: only used by engine, tells <code>game.h</code> that we are importing <code>GetGameAPI</code>.</li>
<li><code>USE_CPP20_FORMAT</code>: if explicitly defined, C++20's <code>&lt;format&gt;</code> library will be used instead of <code>fmtlib</code>; otherwise <code>fmtlib</code> usage will be autodetected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt">fmtlib</a>: If <code>USE_CPP20_FORMAT</code> is not set, the library needs to be available in the <code>fmt</code> subdirectory.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp">jsoncpp</a>: Must be placed inside <code>json</code> subdirectory.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both of these can also be installed via vcpkg: <code>vcpkg install jsoncpp:x64-windows fmt:x64-windows</code></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Windows (Visual Studio 2019 / 2022):</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We recommend placing the source in a subfolder within a mod directory. For example, alongside <code>baseq2</code>, make a folder called <code>mymod</code>, enter that folder, make a folder called <code>src</code>, and copying the contents of the <code>rerelease</code> directory into the newly-created <code>src</code> subfolder.</li>
<li>Open <code>game.sln</code></li>
<li>Build solution</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Debugging the DLL is possible when attaching to the engine EXE. Note that if you are using VS2022 Hot Reload, due to an internal Hot Reload issue, current edits will be lost when disconnecting from the server, or changing levels using the <code>map</code> command.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">40hz Tickrate Support</h2>
<p dir="auto">As part of this release, all internal logic in the game DLL has been adjusted to run at 40hz compared to the original 10hz of the original engine. This provides a better gameplay experience, and allows maps and game logic to run at more precise steps than the original 100ms. 40hz was chosen as it is a multiple of the original 10hz, operates at an integral 25ms step, and was the best balance between bandwidth and CPU concerns around the original tech.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Print Adjustments</h2>
<p dir="auto">As part of the API cleanup, the game DLL no longer uses varargs in any of its functions. Varargs are compiler-specific and not very portable, so instead, the onus is on the caller to handle formatting. As a bonus, this allows the game DLL to more easily hook in modern formatting providers; the game DLL uses <code>fmt</code> almost exclusively. Several built-in types, like <code>edict_t</code> and <code>vec3_t</code>, can be formatted directly.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Math Changes</h2>
<p dir="auto">Since C++ is now used in the game DLL, math functions were made constexpr where appropriate, and operator overloads are used to make math easier to work with and closer to QuakeC. For instance, <code>VectorMA(a, s, b, c)</code> can now be written as <code>c = a + (b * s)</code>, which expresses the operation better.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Changes</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>qboolean</code>, which was aliased to <code>int32_t</code>, is now instead aliased to <code>bool</code>. This type should be equivalent to C's <code>_Bool</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Info Keys</h2>
<p dir="auto">In the original Quake II, all infokey values are purely ASCII with upper bits stripped. Kex and the Quake II rerelease engine supports UTF-8 for things like player names, which necessated a change to the way info keys work. Instead of implementing a whole UTF-8 system in the game DLL, these functions are now imports, so the engine is in control of the parsing and string management.</p>
<p dir="auto">Userinfo variables are now suffixed with a number for split screen support. For instance, <code>name</code> and <code>skin</code> have become <code>name_0</code> and <code>skin_0</code> for the first player, <code>name_1</code> and <code>skin_1</code> for the second player, and so on.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Extensions</h2>
<p dir="auto">In an attempt to remain compatible with future community engines, all engine interfaces contain stubbed functions for GetExtension. This is currently unused and will only return nullptr, however other engines may wish to support returning named structs containing extra function pointers based on string parameters. This is similar to <code>getextension</code> that has become standard in many QuakeC environments.</p>
<p dir="auto">Conforming engines should return nullptr if an extension is not supported, otherwise they should return a non null pointer value that is relevant to the requested feature. Supporting engines should use namespaces for features to prevent name collisions around common and possibly incompatible implementations.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Player Movement</h2>
<p dir="auto">Player movement ("pmove") is now handled as an export in both <code>game_export_t</code> <em>and</em> <code>cgame_export_t</code>. This allows a game module to modify physics while still working with client prediction. Pmove also received several upgrades, such as more bits for flags and full float positioning.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because a lot of movement quirks in Quake II were indirectly caused by the compression, these behaviors were retained. Trick jumping is now an explicit movement type, to allow for things like the Mega Health box jumps to still work. Some fixes were made, like jumping higher below the 0 z point of the map.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Frame visibility</h2>
<p dir="auto">As part of network improvements, some changes were made to the "entity is visible to client in frame" methods:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Split-screen support since all clients share a frame.</li>
<li>Entities with shadows will be visible if their shadows may be visible to a player.</li>
<li>Sound attenuation culling is now calculated formulaically to match the sound system, and takes loop_attenuation into account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Entity linkage</h2>
<p dir="auto">To fix a legacy bug where lasers only relied on one position for culling, RF_BEAM entities now set their <code>absmin</code> &amp; <code>absmax</code> properly. This can cause them to be a bit inflated if they are angled, but should not cause any issues otherwise.</p>
<p dir="auto">In a similar vein, <code>gi.linkentity</code> no longer automatically sets <code>old_origin</code> for beams. This is to make it a bit easier to work with beams, as otherwise you'd be forced to link twice to get it linked into the world correctly. This <em>might</em> break old mods that depends on this behavior.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Audio positioning</h2>
<p dir="auto">Entity spatialization underwent an overhaul (<code>CL_GetEntitySoundOrigin</code> mainly).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Brush models will use the closest point on the bmodel's absmin/absmax to the listener's origin. This allows moving brush models with sounds to make consistent sounds, and be full volume if you are inside of them.</li>
<li>Beams now support <code>s.sound</code>, and plays their sound on the nearest point between the two beam origins.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As a secondary fix to the above, <code>S_StartSound</code> has slightly different logic now surrounding what origin to pick when playing a sound:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="if (entnum < MAX_EDICTS &amp;&amp; (origin || fixed_origin))
{
	// [Paril-KEX] if we can currently see the entity in question
	// and it's a bmodel or beam, don't use a fixed origin so it sounds correct
	if (!fixed_origin &amp;&amp; entnum > 1 &amp;&amp; (cl_entities[entnum].serverframe == cl.frame.serverframe || 
		(cl_entities[entnum].current.solid == PACKED_SOLID_BSP || (cl_entities[entnum].current.renderfx &amp; RF_BEAM))))
	{
		ps->fixed_origin = false;
	}
	else
	{
		VectorCopy (origin, ps->origin);
		ps->fixed_origin = true;
	}
}
else
	ps->fixed_origin = false;"><pre><span>if</span> (entnum &lt; MAX_EDICTS &amp;&amp; (origin || fixed_origin))
{
	<span><span>//</span> [Paril-KEX] if we can currently see the entity in question</span>
	<span><span>//</span> and it's a bmodel or beam, don't use a fixed origin so it sounds correct</span>
	<span>if</span> (!fixed_origin &amp;&amp; entnum &gt; <span>1</span> &amp;&amp; (cl_entities[entnum].<span>serverframe</span> == cl.<span>frame</span>.<span>serverframe</span> || 
		(cl_entities[entnum].<span>current</span>.<span>solid</span> == PACKED_SOLID_BSP || (cl_entities[entnum].<span>current</span>.<span>renderfx</span> &amp; RF_BEAM))))
	{
		ps-&gt;<span>fixed_origin</span> = <span>false</span>;
	}
	<span>else</span>
	{
		<span>VectorCopy</span> (origin, ps-&gt;<span>origin</span>);
		ps-&gt;<span>fixed_origin</span> = <span>true</span>;
	}
}
<span>else</span>
	ps-&gt;fixed_origin = <span>false</span>;</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><code>fixed_origin</code> is set to <code>flags &amp; SND_EXPLICIT_POS</code> for svc_sound packets, and is <code>false</code> otherwise. If the playsounds' <code>fixed_origin</code> field is set, then the <code>ps-&gt;origin</code> value will <em>always</em> be used over automatically trying to determine its position.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Client entity adjustments</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Beam origin points are interpolated if they exist between frames.</li>
<li><code>TE_ELECTRIC_SPARKS</code> and <code>TE_SCREEN_SPARKS</code>/<code>TE_SHIELD_SPARKS</code> will only play sounds once on any given frame.</li>
<li>Entities will never play the same footstep sound twice in a row.</li>
<li>Beams now squash the ends of their beams so they don't intersect walls or end early.</li>
<li>Alpha and transparency settings now get copied over to all sub-modelindices.</li>
<li>Lightramps are now interpolated, which looks nicer and helps with epilepsy.</li>
<li><code>delta_angles</code> are interpolated now, although this is never used at all in the game.</li>
<li><code>screen_blend</code> and <code>damage_blend</code> are interpolated now, but only if the frame prior didn't have a clear color.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configstrings</h2>
<p dir="auto">Configstrings have been overhauled. There is now a theoretical maximum of <code>32767</code> entries, although you are still bound by the game APIs value of <code>MAX_CONFIGSTRINGS</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The maximum length of a configstring has increased from <code>64</code> to <code>96</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The API now canonizes that certain spans (<code>CS_STATUSBAR</code> and <code>CS_GENERAL</code>) can span multiple lines. A <code>CS_SIZE</code> function is provided to calculate the total size (in bytes) that can be written to for a given configstring ID.</p>
<p dir="auto">A convenience function, <code>CS_REMAP</code>, is provided to help remap old configstring IDs to new ones. This is used in our engine to provide old demo support.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>MAX_MODELS</code>, <code>MAX_SOUNDS</code> and <code>MAX_IMAGES</code> have been increased from 256 to 8192, 2048, and 512, respectively.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CS_STATUSBAR</h3>
<p dir="auto">This entry now spans entries 5 to 58 instead of 5 to 28, giving you an effective size of 5184 bytes (minus one for the null terminator) for the statusbar strings, up from 1536 bytes.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CS_SHADOWLIGHTS</h3>
<p dir="auto">This new span each consists of a shadow light entry. Its format is semicolon-separated numerical values, in the following type &amp; order:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>int entity_order</li>
<li>int type (0 = point, 1 = cone)</li>
<li>float radius</li>
<li>int resolution</li>
<li>float intensity</li>
<li>float fade_start</li>
<li>float fade_end</li>
<li>int lightstyle</li>
<li>float coneangle</li>
<li>float direction_x</li>
<li>float direction_y</li>
<li>float direction_z</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CS_WHEEL_WEAPONS</h3>
<p dir="auto">This new span consists of entries for the weapon wheel. It consists of pipe-separated integral values, in the following order:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>CS_ITEMS item index</li>
<li>CS_IMAGES image index</li>
<li>CS_WHEEL_AMMO ammo index (or -1 for no ammo)</li>
<li>minimum ammo to use weapon</li>
<li>whether the weapon is on the powerup wheel or the weapon wheel</li>
<li>additional sort integer</li>
<li>quantity to warn on low ammo on</li>
<li>whether this weapon is droppable or not</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CS_WHEEL_AMMO</h3>
<p dir="auto">This new span consists of entries for the weapon wheel ammo types. It consists of pipe-separated integral values, in the following order:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>CS_ITEMS item index</li>
<li>CS_IMAGES image index</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CS_WHEEL_POWERUPS</h3>
<p dir="auto">This new span consists of entries for the powerup wheel. It consists of pipe-separated integral values, in the following order:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>CS_ITEMS image index</li>
<li>CS_IMAGES image index</li>
<li>if 1, it is a togglable powerup instead of having a count</li>
<li>additional sort integer</li>
<li>whether we can drop this powerup or not</li>
<li>CS_WHEEL_AMMO ammo index, if applicable (-1 for no ammo)</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CS_CD_LOOP_COUNT</h3>
<p dir="auto">Integer which determines how many times to loop the music before switching to the ambient track. Leave blank to use the clients' preferred value, otherwise it is forced to this value (a value of zero means never switch to ambient track).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CS_GAME_STYLE</h3>
<p dir="auto">Inform the client about the type of game being played.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Structures</h2>
<p dir="auto">Quake II has two main shared structures: <code>gclient_t</code> and <code>edict_t</code>. These split off into various other shared structures that have to be the same between the game &amp; server.</p>
<p dir="auto">Like the original release, the "shared" aspects of these structs must be identical, and are stored in <code>game.h</code> as <code>edict_shared_t</code> and <code>gclient_shared_t</code> respectively.</p>
<p dir="auto">The structure changes will be listed from the bottom-up. Full listings of the structures can be found in the source.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">cvar_flags_t</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CVAR_USER_PROFILE (bit 5)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is a new flag that is solely for the client; it indicates that a cvar is treated like userinfo for the purposes of storage, but is not sent to the server like userinfo usually is. For example, this flag is applied to <code>cl_run_N</code>, which controls the individual Always Run flags for each split screen player.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">contents_t</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CONTENTS_PROJECTILECLIP (bit 14)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This new content flag will be collided against by <code>CONTENTS_PROJECTILE</code> entities.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CONTENTS_PLAYER (bit 30)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This special content type flag is set only on player entities, and allows tracing to exclude/include them.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CONTENTS_PROJECTILE (bit 31)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This special content type flag is set only on projectiles, and allows tracing to exclude/include them.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">surfflags_t</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SURF_ALPHATEST (bit 25)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This bit is widely supported by other engines and is supported in the rerelease.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SURF_N64_UV (bit 28)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This flag is specific to N64, and halves texture sizes.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SURF_N64_SCROLL_X (bit 29)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This flag is specific to N64, and causes textures to scroll in the X axis.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SURF_N64_SCROLL_Y (bit 30)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This flag is specific to N64, and causes textures to scroll in the Y axis.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SURF_N64_SCROLL_FLIP (bit 31)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This flag is specific to N64, and flips the scroll axis.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">csurface_t</h2>
<p dir="auto">This structure has undergone canonization of the 3.2x changes by Zoid.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">char[32] name</h3>
<p dir="auto">Uses the proper name length now.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">uint32_t id</h3>
<p dir="auto">This value must represent a unique ID that corresponds to its texinfo. The same ID must always reference the same texinfo, but they don't necessarily have to be sequential. Zero must always mean "no texinfo".</p>
<p dir="auto">This is used by the client for indexing footstep sounds.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">char[16] material</h3>
<p dir="auto">The material ID for this texinfo, from the corresponding <code>.mat</code> file.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">trace_t</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">csurface_t *surface</h3>
<p dir="auto">The only change is a contractual one: this value must never be null.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">cplane_t plane2 / csurface_t *surface2</h3>
<p dir="auto">When a trace impacts multiple planes at the destination, the collision system will now report both of them. The "second best" plane and surface are stored here. <code>surface2</code> <em>must</em> be null if a second surface was not hit.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is used to solve some epsilon issues with the player movement system.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">cvar_t</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">int32_t modified_count</h3>
<p dir="auto">The old <code>qboolean modified;</code> has been changed into an integral value. This value is increased when the cvar has been changed, but is <strong>never</strong> zero. The reason for this is so that "is cvar modified" checks always succeed on the first check, assuming you initialize the last modified value to 0.</p>
<p dir="auto">The function <code>Cvar_WasModified</code> is provided as a convenience function to perform this task for you.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">int32_t integer</h3>
<p dir="auto">A common extension to Quake II, the integral value is stored at the end of the struct for you to use.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">player_state_t</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">int32_t gunskin</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is a new value which sets the skin number used on the weapon.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">int32_t gunrate</h3>
<p dir="auto">This value sets the frame rate (in hz) of the players' weapon. For backwards compatibility, a value of 0 is equivalent to a value of 10. This ia mainly used for the Haste powerup, but in theory it could be used for future mods to have higher tickrate weapons in general.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">float[4] screen_blend / damage_blend</h3>
<p dir="auto">The full-screen <code>blend</code> value was split into two values: <code>screen_blend</code> and <code>damage_blend</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>screen_blend</code> is the same as the original one, and is a full-screen color change. It is mainly used now for full-screen fades. To reduce the amount of screen flashing, the base game avoids flashing the screen whenever possible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>damage_blend</code> is a new type of blend that occurs around the edge of the screen; this is used to replace many events that previously would flash the full screen.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">refdef_flags_t rdflags</h3>
<p dir="auto">The only adjustment to <code>rdflags</code> was the addition of a new flag: <code>RDF_NO_WEAPON_LERP</code>. This occupies bit 4, and can be used to temporarily disable interpolation on weapons.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">short[64] stats</h3>
<p dir="auto"><code>MAX_STATS</code> was increased from 32 to 64. Note that because stats are now handled by the game &amp; cgame modules, you are not limited to a short for the purposes of packing down data/</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">uint8_t team_id</h3>
<p dir="auto">For teamplay-oriented games, the player's team is sent in player state. While the client could derive this from entity state in theory, in practice that's a bit ugly since the players' entity may not even be visible (for instance if you've been gibbed), so this was the cleaner approach.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">usercmd_t</h2>
<p dir="auto">The fields <code>upmove</code>, <code>impulse</code> and <code>lightlevel</code> have been removed.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">button_t buttons</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BUTTON_HOLSTER (bit 2)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This button corresponds to the new <code>+holster</code> command, which will keep the weapon holstered until depressed. It is used by the weapon wheel to allow the player to start switching weapons before the weapon wheel is dismissed.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BUTTON_JUMP (bit 3)</h4>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BUTTON_CROUCH (bit 4)</h4>
<p dir="auto">These two new bits replace <code>usercmd_t::upmove</code>, and determine the players' jumping and crouch states.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">vec3_t angles</h3>
<p dir="auto">These are now full float precision, allowing for players to aim more precisely.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">float forwardmove / sidemove</h3>
<p dir="auto">These are now full float, to allow controller inputs to be more precise.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">uint32_t server_frame</h3>
<p dir="auto">New entry sent along with every usercmd, which tells the server which server frame that the input was depressed on. This is used for integrity checks, as well as for anti-lag hitscan.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">pmove_state_t</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">pmtype_t pm_type</h3>
<p dir="auto">Two new pmove types have been added before <code>PM_SPECTATOR</code>, offsetting it and its subsequent entries by 2.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PM_GRAPPLE (1)</h4>
<p dir="auto">Used for the grappling hook; it informs client prediction that you should be pulled towards <code>velocity</code> and are not affected by gravity.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PM_NOCLIP (2)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This is what <code>PM_SPECTATOR</code> used to be, and prevents all clipping.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PM_SPECTATOR (3)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This value now represents spectator mode; you cannot enter walls, but can go through brush entities.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">vec3_t origin / vec3_t velocity / vec3_t delta_angles</h3>
<p dir="auto">These fields now have full float precision versus the original release. See <a href="#pmove">Pmove</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">pmflags_t pm_flags</h3>
<p dir="auto">This type has had its capacity increased to <code>int16</code>. The following flags are new or adjusted:</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PMF_NO_POSITIONAL_PREDICTION</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag was originally called <code>PMF_NO_PREDICTION</code>; it now only disables prediction on origin, allowing angles to be predicted. <strong>This is a backwards-incompatible change</strong>, but should have very minimal impact on running old mods. This improves the feeling of the grappling hook.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PMF_ON_LADDER</h4>
<p dir="auto">This bit is used to signal back to the game that we are currently attached to a ladder.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PMF_NO_ANGULAR_PREDICTION</h4>
<p dir="auto">The angular equivalent of <code>PMF_NO_POSITIONAL_PREDICTION</code>.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PMF_IGNORE_PLAYER_COLLISION</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag is input only, and tells Pmove to ignore <code>CONTENTS_PLAYER</code> contents.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PMF_TIME_TRICK</h4>
<p dir="auto">If set, then <code>pm_time</code> is the time remaining to start a trick jump.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">uint16_t pm_time</h3>
<p dir="auto"><code>pm_time</code> is now expressed in milliseconds instead of 8 * ms; since the code clamped subtractions on this to 1, it meant that high framerate players experienced slightly different physics, and in the case of trick jumps, had a smaller time gap to perform them.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">int8_t viewheight</h3>
<p dir="auto">A new field describing the viewheight output; this is for crouch prediction.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">pmove_t</h2>
<p dir="auto">The field <code>viewheight</code> has been removed, since it is now part of <code>pmove_state_t</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">touch_list_t touch</h3>
<p dir="auto">The list of touched entities has been replaced with a list of traces, allowing the game to react better to touches.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">cplane_t groundplane</h3>
<p dir="auto">The plane that you're standing on is now returned by pmove.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">edict_t *player</h3>
<p dir="auto">An opaque handle to the player object, passed back to <code>trace</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">trace / clip</h3>
<p dir="auto"><code>trace</code> is now sent the <code>passent</code> and <code>contentmask</code>, so it can perform more complex tracing routines.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>clip</code> is also now available to pmove, should you need it. It is currently only used in spectator movement, to clip solely against the world and nothing else.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">vec3_t viewoffset</h3>
<p dir="auto">The player's viewoffset is now passed in, to allow for accurate blending. Pmove is now semi-responsible for screen blends.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">vec3_t screen_blend</h3>
<p dir="auto">An output variable containing full-screen blends to apply to the view.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">refdef_flags_t rdflags</h3>
<p dir="auto">An output variable containing flags that should be merged with the server's representation.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">bool jump_sound</h3>
<p dir="auto">An output variable to tell the game to play a jumping sound.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">float impact_delta</h3>
<p dir="auto">When new ground is achieved, the impact is stored here for fall damage checks.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">edict_shared_t</h2>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: the following members of the old <code>edict_t</code> struct have been removed, and were moved server-side:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>link_t area</code></li>
<li><code>int num_clusters</code></li>
<li><code>int clusternums[]</code></li>
<li><code>int headnode</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">sv_entity_t sv</h3>
<p dir="auto">Most of the meat of the bot system is contained in the server code, and doesn't have direct access to the games' representation of the state of the game.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bots use this thin interpretation of the game state data about entities to understand how to use entities to its advantage - similar to how the client receives a thin portion of entities to understand how to render them.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">bool linked</h3>
<p dir="auto">This boolean indicates whether the entity is currently linked into the world or not. It is the replacement of checking for <code>area.prev</code> being non-null.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">svflags_t svflags</h3>
<p dir="auto">For new functionality, some new flags were added to <code>svflags</code>. <strong>This may cause backwards-incompatibility in older mods that have modified this enum!</strong> This enum is server-specific, so it is always incorrect for mods to modify this.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_PLAYER</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag causes the object to be treated as <code>CONTENTS_PLAYER</code> for collision. All players have this flag.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_BOT</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag marks the entity as a bot.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_NOBOTS</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag tells the bot subsystem to ignore this entity.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_RESPAWNING</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag is a hint to the bot subsystem to inform it about how items respawn.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_PROJECTILE</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag treats the entity as <code>CONTENTS_PROJECTILE</code> for collision.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_INSTANCED</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag marks the entity as being instanced - it may be invisible or hidden for certain players.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_DOOR</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag is for the bot subsystem, and informs it that this entity is a door.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_NOCULL</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag overrides the client frame building culling routines, causing an entity to always be sent regardless of where it is (ignoring PVS/PHS, essentially). Its only use in our code is to keep no-attenuation looping speakers in frame always.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SVF_HULL</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag adjusts the servers' method of clipping movement to entities. Normally, only <code>SOLID_BSP</code> entities will use their proper clipping bounds for collision, but if this is set on a <code>SOLID_TRIGGER</code> brush entity, traces will have to collide with the actual BSP tree of the trigger instead of solely touching its bounding box.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is used in our game DLL to allow for certain triggers (like <code>trigger_gravity</code> or <code>trigger_flashlight</code>) to be activated when you are actually touching their brushes, allowing for angled triggers to finally exist.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">entity_state_t</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">uint32_t number</h3>
<p dir="auto">Number was changed to <code>uint32_t</code> (from <code>int32_t</code>) to better represent its use and to only have to catch out of bounds in one direction.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">int32_t skinnum</h3>
<p dir="auto">Skinnum now packs a bit more data into it.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// [Paril-KEX] player s.skinnum's encode additional data

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">effects_t effects</h3>
<p dir="auto">The type <code>effects_t</code> was changed from <code>uint32_t</code> to <code>uint64_t</code> since we have way more effects to express.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_BOB (bit 4)</h4>
<p dir="auto">Bit was unused in Quake II. This was repurposed into a weapon bobbing effect, similar to Quake III.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_POWERSCREEN (bit 9)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This effect uses a different model that is scaled to the monster's size now.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_DUALFIRE (bit 32)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This bit is used for a special effect, similar to <code>EF_QUAD</code>, but for Dualfire Damage.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_HOLOGRAM (bit 33)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This bit is used for the N64 hologram effect; it adds a spinning ball of green particles around the object.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_FLASHLIGHT (bit 34)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This bit marks a player entity as having a flashlight enabled. The effect itself is rendered separately by the client.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_BARREL_EXPLODING (bit 35)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This effect is used before an explobox explodes; it emits steam particles from the barrel, as if it is experiencing a decompression event.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_TELEPORTER2 (bit 36)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This effect is used for the teleporter FX in the N64.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_GRENADE_LIGHT (bit 37)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This effect creates a small light on monster grenades, to make them slightly easier to track visually.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EF_FIREBALL (EF_ROCKET | EF_GIB)</h3>
<p dir="auto">This mutually-exclusive bit combo did nothing in the original game, since these special trails could only render one or the other. In the rerelease, it will render a fireball trail that begins yellow and large, tapering off into an orange trail, to mimick the effect on N64.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">renderfx_t renderfx</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_NO_ORIGIN_LERP (bit 6)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This effect had a confusing name originally. Its name now reflects what it does: it disables origin interpolation.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_BEAM (bit 7)</h4>
<p dir="auto">You can now create custom segmented beams by setting a non-one modelindex on beams.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_CUSTOMSKIN (bit 8)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This effect was unused originally. It is now implemented and works as intended: specifying a <code>skinnum</code> will change the skin on the model to the skin specified in <code>CS_IMAGES + skinnum</code>. For <code>RF_FLARE</code>, <code>frame</code> must be used instead however, as <code>skinnum</code> is used for color data.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_NOSHADOW (bit 13)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This effect was client-only originally.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_CASTSHADOW (bit 14)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This effect marks an entity that casts light in the world; it is only used by <code>dynamic_light</code> (or dynamic <code>light</code> entities), and should not be used otherwise.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_SHELL_LITE_GREEN (bit 19)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This is the equivalent shell color for <code>EF_DUALFIRE</code>.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_CUSTOM_LIGHT (bit 20)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag creates a custom dynamic light at the position of the object. Its used in the N64 campaign, as it has custom light entities (<code>target_light</code>). <code>s.frame</code> is the light's radius, and <code>s.skinnum</code> is the light's current color (packed RGB).</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_FLARE (bit 21)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag marks an entity as being rendered with a flare instead of the usual entity rendering. Flares overload some fields:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>s.renderfx &amp; RF_SHELL_RED</code> causes the flare to have an outer red rim.</li>
<li><code>s.renderfx &amp; RF_SHELL_GREEN</code> causes the flare to have an outer green rim.</li>
<li><code>s.renderfx &amp; RF_SHELL_BLUE</code> causes the flare to have an outer blue rim.</li>
<li><code>s.renderfx &amp; RF_FLARE_LOCK_ANGLE</code> causes the flare to not rotate towards the viewer.</li>
<li><code>s.renderfx &amp; RF_CUSTOMSKIN</code> causes the flare to use the custom image index in <code>s.frame</code>.</li>
<li><code>s.modelindex2</code> is the start distance of fading the flare out.</li>
<li><code>s.modelindex3</code> is the end distance of fading the flare out.</li>
<li><code>s.skinnum</code> is the RGBA of the flare.</li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_OLD_FRAME_LERP (bit 22)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag signals that <code>s.old_frame</code> should be used for the next frame and respected by the client. This can be used for custom frame interpolation; its use in this engine is specific to fixing interpolation bugs on certain monster animations.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_DOT_SHADOW (bit 23)</h4>
<p dir="auto">Draw a blob shadow underneath the entity.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_LOW_PRIORITY (bit 24)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This flag marks an entity as low priority; if the renderer runs out of entity slots, these entities will be eligible for replacement. For instance, a monster is more important than a gib, so gibs are marked low priority so they can be replaced by a monster if the limit is reached.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_NO_LOD (bit 25)</h4>
<p dir="auto">The original MD2 models will be used for LOD. Setting this bit prevents this behavior.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_NO_STEREO (bit 2)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This is an overloaded flag that only applies to non-rendered entities that contain sounds. If set, stereo panning is disabled on this entity.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_STAIR_STEP (bit 26)</h4>
<p dir="auto">The tick rate increase caused a bit of a visual bug with monsters and players: they now stepped up steps within 0.025 seconds instead of 0.1, causing jarring hitching. To fix this, entities set this flag when they detect they have stepped up a stair, and the client will interpolate their height difference over 0.1 seconds.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RF_BEAM_LIGHTNING (RF_BEAM | RF_GLOW)</h4>
<p dir="auto">This mutually-exclusive bit combo causes a laser to become a lightning bolt, for N64 support.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">uint32_t solid</h3>
<p dir="auto">This was changed from <code>int32_t</code> to <code>uint32_t</code>, and now packs more data into it to better represent bounding boxes to clients.</p>
<p dir="auto">For backwards compatibility, 31 is still the magic value used for BSP entities. The actual packed data, however, is now as follows:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="union solid_packed_t
{
    struct {
        uint8_t x;

ent-&gt;mins[<span>2</span>] = -packed.p.zd; ent-&gt;maxs[<span>2</span>] = packed.p.zu - <span>32</span>;</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is similar to Quake III Arena, and essentially allows any integral bbox to make it to the clients unchanged.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">entity_event_t event</h3>
<p dir="auto">Two new events were added:</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EV_OTHER_FOOTSTEP (8)</h4>
<p dir="auto">Allows non-players to send footsteps. They have idle attenuation, whereas regular footsteps have normal attenuation.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EV_LADDER_STEP (9)</h4>
<p dir="auto">Ladder climbing 'footstep' event.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">float alpha</h3>
<p dir="auto">This value allows you to specify exact transparency values for entities. For backwards compatibility, setting it to zero should be equivalent to an unchanged value, but any non-zero value should be respected as changed.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">float scale</h3>
<p dir="auto">This value allows you to scale an entity by the given amount. For backwards compatibility, setting it to zero should be equivalent to an unchanged value, but any non-zero value should be respected as changed.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">uint8_t instance_bits</h3>
<p dir="auto">This value is not meant to be set directly by the game code, but will have non-zero bits set for split-screen players that cannot see this entity.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">float loop_volume / loop_attenuation</h3>
<p dir="auto">Looping noises can now have volume and attenuation explicitly specified. For both, a value of zero indicates default/unchanged, for backwards compatibility. For <code>loop_attenuation</code>, a value of <code>-1</code> indicates full level audio (like <code>ATTN_NONE</code>).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">int32_t owner</h3>
<p dir="auto">An entity's owner is now networked, allowing for it to ignore collision properly.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">int32_t old_frame</h3>
<p dir="auto">Only sent when <code>renderfx &amp; RF_OLD_FRAME_LERP</code> - indicates that this frame is the frame to lerp from.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Import/Exports</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Game Import</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">(read-only) tick_rate / frame_time_s / frame_time_ms</h3>
<p dir="auto">This holds the server's tick variables. They will be set at the start of the server, before <a href="#preinit">PreInit</a>.
<code>tick_rate</code> stores the tick rate, in hz.
<code>frame_time_s</code> is the time a game frame will take in seconds.
<code>frame_time_ms</code> is the time a game frame will take in ms.</p>
<p dir="auto">These are provided pre-calculated for convenience.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Broadcast_Print</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function writes <code>message</code> with the print type of <code>printlevel</code> to all players. See <a href="#print-adjustments">Print Adjustments</a>. This is kept for compatibility purposes, <a href="#loc_print">Loc_Print</a> replaces it.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Com_Print</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function writes <code>message</code> to the server. See <a href="#print-adjustments">Print Adjustments</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Client_Print</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function writes out <code>message</code> with the print type of <code>printlevel</code> to the specified <code>ent</code> player. See <a href="#print-adjustments">Print Adjustments</a>. This is kept for compatibility purposes, <a href="#loc_print">Loc_Print</a> replaces it.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Center_Print</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function writes <code>message</code> to the specified <code>ent</code> player in the center of their screen. See <a href="#print-adjustments">Print Adjustments</a>. This is kept for compatibility purposes, <a href="#loc_print">Loc_Print</a> replaces it.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">sound / positioned_sound</h3>
<p dir="auto">The <code>channel</code> enum has a single new flag:</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CHAN_FORCE_POS (bit 5)</h4>
<p dir="auto">If set (and an origin is <strong>not</strong> supplied), the entity's origin will be forced to be used as the origin point of the sound even if there is a better position available.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">local_sound</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function was introduced to deal with some split-screen issues that popped up. It's designed to mimick <code>localsound</code> of QuakeC; it will directly send a sound packet to the specified player, using a <code>dupe_key</code> if supplied (see <a href="#unicast">unicast</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="#sound--positioned_sound">sound</a> for info about the channels.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">get_configstring</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function fetches a configstring from the servers' current configstring data.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Com_Error</h3>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="#print-adjustments">Print Adjustments</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">clip</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is a new function designed to fit a specific purpose: it will test if the box specified by <code>mins</code> &amp; <code>maxs</code>, moved from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code>, will clip against the specified <code>entity</code> with the given <code>contentmask</code>. As an example, you could use this to detect if an entity is actually intersecting a brush in a trigger instead of just being within its bounding box.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">inPVS / inPHS</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function now accepts a boolean, <code>portals</code>, which changes whether or not it should ignore areaportals.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BoxEdicts</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function was modified with a simple filtering callback, greatly extending its purpose and removing some limitations that would occur with previous uses. The filter callback is called for every entity discovered, and you can choose to include or skip entities that it finds, or even completely abort the search. In addition, you can now call the function with a 0 <code>maxcount</code>, and the function will still continue to filter and find entities, reporting the final count. To match the old behavior, if a non-zero <code>maxcount</code> is supplied, the return count will cap out at <code>maxcount</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that it is disallowed to modify world links (linkentity/unlinkentity, etc) in a filter callback, it can only be used for filtering.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">unicast</h3>
<p dir="auto">The <code>dupe_key</code> parameter is new, and is to solve a very peculiar issue with split screen players. When unicast is used to spawn effects or sounds, it may not be desirable to replay the same effect on multiple split screens, since split screen players are all the same client and share views. For example, if you do a unicast for a <code>TE_BLASTER</code> somewhere in the world for every player, for a split screen client with 4 players, that effect will play 4 times - even though all four players are viewing the same world. The game DLL also has no knowledge or understanding of split screen, so there's no way for the game to work around it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of having the game need to know this kind of implementation detail and prevent double-sending, for effects that are going to potentially be sent to multiple players that <em>may</em> be on a split screen, you can specify a dupe key value. This value, when non-zero, will be marked as "already sent" for that client, and won't be sent again for the next packet if it was already tripped. The game DLL provides the <code>GetUnicastKey</code> global which will give you a rolling value to directly pass into unicast or local_sound.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">WriteFloat</h3>
<p dir="auto">Implemented; this was stubbed out of the old code.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">WritePosition</h3>
<p dir="auto">Now sends full float positions.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">WriteDir / WriteAngle</h3>
<p dir="auto">Unchanged - WriteAngle is for compressed angles, when high precision is not necessary.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">WriteEntity</h3>
<p dir="auto">New function to write an entity, to make it easier to write them without needing to WriteShort directly.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GetExtension</h3>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="#extensions">Extensions</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bot_RegisterEdict</h3>
<p dir="auto">Informs the bot subsystem that an entity needs to be registered.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bot_UnRegisterEdict</h3>
<p dir="auto">Informs the bot subsystem that an entity needs to be unregistered.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bot_MoveToPoint</h3>
<p dir="auto">Forces a bot to move to the specified point.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bot_FollowActor</h3>
<p dir="auto">Forces a bot to follow the specified actor.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GetPathToGoal</h3>
<p dir="auto">The main pathfinding function; with the given pathfinding <code>request</code>, you'll be given <code>info</code> about the operation, the path, etc.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Loc_Print</h3>
<p dir="auto">The new primary entry point for printing. This function replaces all of the others (except Com_Print).
For basic usage, it can be called on an entity (or nullptr for broadcasting) with the correct <code>level</code>, with the message to send in <code>base</code>, and nullptr <code>args</code> along with 0 <code>num_args</code>. For actual localized messages, however, you can send additional arguments via the <code>args</code>/<code>num_args</code> parameters which are sent to the client for further processing.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition to localization, <code>level</code> now has new values and bit flags.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PRINT_TYPEWRITER (4)</h4>
<p dir="auto">Causes the message to be printed out one at a time, like a typewriter. Used for objectives, similar to the N64 version.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PRINT_CENTER (5)</h4>
<p dir="auto">An instant centerprint, like the legacy centerprints.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PRINT_TTS (6)</h4>

<p dir="auto">Message will be sent to all players.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PRINT_NO_NOTIFY (bit 4)</h4>

<p dir="auto">See <a href="#info-keys">Info Keys</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Save Games</h2>
<p dir="auto">One of the major changes to this release of Quake II is the save system. Instead of storing pointer offsets and copies of memory, the level &amp; game data is written to UTF-8 JSON. This makes save data much easier to navigate for a human &amp; developer that wants to look into a bug, while also being quick and efficient for storage.</p>
<p dir="auto">The save system, as a result, no longer interfaces with the filesystem at all. Other mods are not required to use JSON, any text format will work as the server and client do not interact with the data.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Game Export</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">(read-only) apiversion</h3>
<p dir="auto">The version # reported by the server.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PreInit</h3>

<p dir="auto">See <a href="#save-games">Save Games</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CanSave</h3>
<p dir="auto">This new export now dictates whether the game is saveable or not.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ClientChooseSlot</h3>
<p dir="auto">ClientChooseSlot is intended to take in a bunch of information about the client that is connecting, and choose which <code>edict_t</code> entity this player should occupy. It is used in the rerelease to reorder players consistently throughout coop games, and ensure that everybody always gets the correct slot.</p>
<p dir="auto">Callers are given the player's <code>userinfo</code> and <code>social_id</code> (the social ID is a unique value per player on certain platforms), which you can use to find the correct slot from the current saved client data. You're also told whether the client <code>isBot</code>, which should always use non-saved available slots first. The <code>ignore</code> field will give you a list of slots up to <code>num_ignore</code> entities that are already occupied or were reported as such, so they can be safely skipped over. Finally, the <code>cinematic</code> parameters will tell you whether the loaded map is a video, which in most cases reordering will not be necessary.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ClientConnect</h3>
<p dir="auto">The function is now given the <code>social_id</code> and <code>isBot</code> state of the connecting client.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RunFrame</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function now receives a boolean to tell whether the call is from the main game loop, or from some other source (the game is settling, or running frames to advance level transitions). If the latter is occurring, you can use this boolean to speed up level transitions by skipping logic that is not necessary but is CPU-intensive, such as enemies searching for players to attack.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PrepFrame</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function used to be in the server, but is now controlled by the game DLL. It's ran after the game has execute a frame &amp; has sent the packet data over to all players. Things like hit markers and one-shot events are cleared in here.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">edict_size / num_edicts / max_edicts</h3>
<p dir="auto">These were changed to size_t and uint32_t/uint32_t respectively, to better represent their use.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">server_flags</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is an integer shared between server and game, which stores bits for special states that the server cares about.</p>

<p dir="auto">This function is for item instancing; the rerelease of Quake II supports instanced items, which will display only for the players who haven't picked it up yet. For online players, this simply removes the item if you've gotten it, but for split screen players it will show a ghost where the entity was on players that have already picked it up.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GetShadowLightData</h3>
<p dir="auto">This function fetches data for the given shadow light for building client frames.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Player State</h2>

I found that the IP changes very often, and PFSENSE can sometimes get hung up on that, and cause the connection to not work. So I left it in its default configuration which gives PFSENSE an internal IP. Inbound connections are not important on the Verizon connection, however I do still need inbound remote access VPN to work, as well as a connection for some security devices.</p><p>For that to work, I have a site-to-site Wireguard VPN setup to a VPS in Linode. Because my local PFSENSE box is the client, and the VPS is the server, I essentially bypass any NAT. This is very useful if you are stuck with an internet connection with CGNAT. On the VPS, I just have forwarding enabled so I can access my local network, and then I have NGINX Proxy Manager forwarding specific ports all the way through to my home network. This means I use the same IP or DNS record to get into my network no matter what goes on at home, as the tunnel just uses whatever gateway PFSENSE tells it to.</p><p>This is also how you are probably getting to this blog, which is hosted at home.

There is no way to configure via CLI, and the Web interface is the worst I have ever used.</p><p>Under that switch is a Cisco SG300-28 switch. This switch is here simply because I started running out of 1Gb connections on the Dell X1052P. I have a bunch of low bandwidth things connected here, such as IPMI for servers, Printers, etc. This is connected to the Dell switch with a single 1Gb connection. On this switch I also have the second port of the Verizon Gateway connected on a separate VLAN. This lets me connect a device DIRECTLY to the Verizon internet, bypassing PFSENSE. This is useful for a Ripe Atlas network probe that we will get to later, and makes troubleshooting very easy. Its also good for testing external connections, as it completely takes my internal DNS and firewall rules out of the question.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2023/08/2023-07-11-12.33.15.776.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/2023-07-11-12.33.15.776.JPG 600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/2023-07-11-12.33.15.776.JPG 1000w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/2023-07-11-12.33.15.776.JPG 1600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w2400/2023/08/2023-07-11-12.33.15.776.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2023/08/2023-08-10-15.46.40.950.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/2023-08-10-15.46.40.950.JPG 600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/2023-08-10-15.46.40.950.JPG 1000w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/2023-08-10-15.46.40.950.JPG 1600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w2400/2023/08/2023-08-10-15.46.40.950.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Below the SG300 is my favorite switch, the Cisco SX350-24F.

This is really a beast of a CPU for such a small box, and it handles all of the compute heavy VM's on my network that don't need fast networking. The main issue with this host is that the onboard NIC is not supported in ESXi, so I have a 1Gb Intel M.2 NIC sticking out the back. I tried to get a 2.5Gb NIC working, however I never could. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2023/08/2023-08-09-15.00.36.501.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/2023-08-09-15.00.36.501.JPG 600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/2023-08-09-15.00.36.501.JPG 1000w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/2023-08-09-15.00.36.501.JPG 1600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w2400/2023/08/2023-08-09-15.00.36.501.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>To the left are my 2 Lenovo ESXi hosts.

There is a better way to do it, which is to get a Supermicro JBOD control board like the <strong>SuperMicro CSE-PTJBOD-CB2. </strong>However at the time of deploying this system, they were out of stock EVERYWHERE. Even now, they seem to only be available from China. So I just skipped it.</p><p>Below the JBOD is an almost identical Supermicro Chassis, but this one is my NAS.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-codehighlight-theme="base16/nebula" fs-codehighlight-element="code" id="content"><p>When people learn that we were part of a recent YC batch I usually get one of two reactions: "Cool… what is YC?" or "Was YC worth it?".</p><p>‍</p><p>Y Combinator (often just “YC”) is the top startup accelerator in the Bay Area, and arguably the world. It runs two “batches” each year – one in the Summer and one in the Winter. These batches last 3 months and consist of a kickoff retreat, meetups, talks from alumni, partner office hours, and regular group check-ins. (more about what happens <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/about">here</a>)</p><p>They also provide funding. The <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/deal">YC standard deal</a> usually equates to $500k for around 10% of the company. This is why people ask the second question.&nbsp;</p><p>So… was YC worth it? For us, absolutely!</p><p>I understand why people ask. 10% is a meaningful chunk of a company. While $500k sounds generous, many startups with traction could easily raise that money on much better terms. For companies in this position, there’s a difficult calculation to decide whether or not the benefits that come with YC are worth the less-favorable investment terms.</p><p>We, however, were not in this position. Eric and I still had full-time jobs when we were accepted. While we had been meeting regularly for a few months to discuss different ideas, we had absolutely zero traction, no working product, and very little validation. When we completed the application process, we thought of it more as a mental exercise than an actual chance at getting in. Luckily we did get in. This was much more due to our experience (technical background, worked at startups, friends/coworkers for 2+ years) than what we were working on (we pivoted anyway!).</p><p>So what did we get out of the experience?</p><h2>Ability to go full-time</h2><p>Starting a company takes a lot of time and energy. Doing it while having an existing job usually isn’t possible for any significant amount of time. So you’re kind of left choosing between two bad options: not making progress as quickly (working nights and weekends) OR not making any money while you figure out what you’re doing and attempt to fundraise. With YC, we were able to avoid this decision. When we applied and interviewed with YC, we still had our full-time jobs. Once we knew we’d have $500k to kickstart the company, the leap to founding was much less daunting.</p><h2>Overcoming imposter syndrome</h2><p>Even with a stereotypical founder background, I absolutely struggle with imposter syndrome. Am I really smart enough to be starting a company? Do I have the technical skills to hold my own with “10x engineers”? How am I going to figure out how to actually sell this thing? These are doubts I bet most founders experience when starting their journey.&nbsp;</p><p>YC is full of extremely bright founders, many of whom already have impressive achievements. That being said, they’re all trying to figure out the same things. Commiserating with batchmates on a weekly basis normalizes the challenges that you’re facing. Pivots no longer seem like a massive failure and instead feel like part of the process. Listening to raw, unfiltered stories directly from well-known alumni makes you realize that they faced similar challenges throughout their journey.</p><h2>Answering boring questions</h2><p>A critical part to founding and running a company is the business operations. This includes incorporating, tax filing, banking, working with lawyers, hiring contractors, configuring HR systems, and much, much more. With each one of these categories, there are likely dozens of decisions that will need to be made. Some of those are important decisions, others are easily updated in the future and don’t matter that much.</p><p>If you’re going at it alone, you’ll need to figure out which things matter and which don’t. And for the things that matter, you’ll need to figure out what the tradeoffs are between the available options. Most of these decisions are not exciting. They’re not fun to research. It probably ends up in most people Googling for hours and finding conflicting advice. With YC, all of these questions have come up before. After seeing thousands of companies, the YC partners typically know the tradeoffs and have clear recommendations. For the questions that aren’t already documented, you get access to the YC legal team for assistance.</p><h2>Adding legitimacy</h2><p>Attaching the YC brand to your name, both at a company and personal level, provides an immediate level of legitimacy to what you’re working on. Similar to how students from top universities get immediate recognition based on the strength of their program, YC founders also benefit greatly from their association with the accelerator.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s relatively easy to say you’re a “founder”. YC adds legitimacy by confirming that they interviewed you and believe your company is in the top percent of startups that applied. Additionally they have committed to providing $500k, a supportive community, and a wealth of other resources. For anyone looking to measure a company’s likelihood of success (investors, prospective employees, customers, concerned parents), having this additional support makes the company seem significantly more attractive.</p><h2>Founder community</h2><p>The YC community is often referenced as one of the program’s biggest selling points, and this is for good reason. During the batch, we forged strong friendships with many of our batchmates. We continue to meet on a regular basis to share updates, ideas, and provide support to each other. Having other people that can listen and empathize with the challenges you're experiencing goes a long way. While my family and friends have been extremely supportive, they can’t identify with many of the ups and downs of being a founder.</p><p>Not only are you kicking off the startup journey along with hundreds of other founders in your batch, you also have the support and contact information for thousands of alumni. This extremely valuable network provides an opportunity to connect with potential customers, investors, advisors, and future employees. Generally, YC founders are quick to give their time or respond to an email from another founder. This “pay it forward” mentality is part of the magic that makes the YC community so special.</p><p>‍</p><p>So, for us YC was a no-brainer. We were able to take the leap to founding our company, met brilliant batchmates and alumni, and we’ve already benefited greatly from the added legitimacy of being a “YC Company.” Beyond all of this, the founder experience has been more fun and less daunting by having the support of a world class community behind us.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>37081306</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 20:26:37 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license">https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37081306">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When Mitchell and I founded HashiCorp, we made the decision to make our products open source because of a few key beliefs:</p>
<ul>
<li>We believe strongly in freely available source code to make it easy for practitioners to freely download, inspect source code, and solve their own problems.</li>
<li>We believe in building an ecosystem and community around our products to enable broad integrations.</li>
<li>We believe in the importance of transparency for our users.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more than a decade, we’ve continued to build new products and features provided to the community under a free open source license. This has led to a large community of users, contributors, partners, and customers who participate in and benefit from the work on the HashiCorp products.</p>
<p>Our open source model has been made possible by the thousands of commercial customers who partner with us on their mission-critical infrastructure. We invest tens of millions of dollars in research and development in our open source products annually, and our commercial efforts enable us to continue to support, and sponsor, our vibrant community of users.</p>
<p>Our approach has enabled us to partner closely with the cloud providers to enable tight integration for our joint users and customers, as well as hundreds of other technology partners we work closely with. However, there are other vendors who take advantage of pure OSS models, and the community work on OSS projects, for their own commercial goals, without providing material contributions back. We don’t believe this is in the spirit of open source.</p>
<p>As a result, we believe commercial open source models need to evolve for the ecosystem to continue providing open, freely available software. Open source has reduced the barrier to copying innovation and selling it through existing distribution channels. Many vendors have shifted increasingly to closed source for this reason, however we did not feel that would preserve our original goals in adopting open source.</p>
<p>That is why today we are announcing that HashiCorp is changing its source code license from Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0) to the Business Source License (BSL, also known as BUSL) v1.1 on all future releases of HashiCorp products. HashiCorp APIs, SDKs, and almost all other libraries will remain MPL 2.0.</p>
<p>BSL 1.1 is a source-available license that allows copying, modification, redistribution, non-commercial use, and commercial use under specific conditions. With this change we are following a path similar to other companies in recent years. These companies include Couchbase, Cockroach Labs, Sentry, and MariaDB, which developed this license in 2013. Companies including Confluent, MongoDB, Elastic, Redis Labs, and others have also adopted alternative licenses that include restrictions on commercial usage. In all these cases, the license enables the commercial sponsor to have more control around commercialization.</p>
<p>Our implementation of BSL includes additional usage grants that allow for broadly permissive use of our source code. We believe this will offer a fair and sustainable way for HashiCorp to share its source code widely, for free use. We consulted with OSS licensing experts and other industry stakeholders when developing our license, so that our efforts would be in line with industry practices.</p>
<p>Our first goal with this change is to minimize the impact to our community, partners, and customers. We will continue to publish source code and updates for HashiCorp products to our GitHub repository and distribution channels.</p>
<p>End users can continue to copy, modify, and redistribute the code for all non-commercial and commercial use, except where providing a competitive offering to HashiCorp. Partners can continue to build integrations for our joint customers. We will continue to work closely with the cloud service providers to ensure deep support for our mutual technologies. Customers of enterprise and cloud-managed HashiCorp products will see no change as well.</p>
<p>Vendors who provide competitive services built on our community products will no longer be able to incorporate future releases, bug fixes, or security patches contributed to our products.</p>
<p>Our commitment to our community, partners, and customers has not changed. We understand the trust the community places in us and we’ve worked carefully to preserve our original goals in adopting an open approach. We look forward to continuing to invest in the community and our products.</p>
<p>We know there will be additional questions, and we’ve assembled a set of <a href="https://hashi.co/license-faq">frequently asked questions</a> to help you better understand the changes. You can also watch the short video below for more information:</p></section></div></div>]]></description>

      <p><i>August 2023</i>
      </p>

      <p>Bram is one of my heroes. That’s literal and recursive: when I say it,
internally I check before making a frivolous claim, which is a feature of this
particular role-model; “What would Bram do?” is a fixture in me which informs my
choices.</p>

<p>Those who studied <code>vim_dev</code> and the Vim source and docs, accumulated treasure
from a stream of copious messages and spare impressions. But also from what he
omitted: he never appealed to sensationalism or personal judgements.</p>

<p>Even when treated rudely, Bram usually responded only to advance his
understanding of a problem to solve. Bram was one of those humans quietly
providing deep value to the universe, but there was no parade and little
celebrity.</p>

<p>Bram was anchored to reality, directly interested in results and adjusting what
produced them. The “Problem/Solution” mantra in his commit messages is simple
yet profoundly effective. He used that approach to help <a href="https://www.moolenaar.net/albums.html">people in
Uganda</a>, managing resources directly
instead of abstractly.</p>

<p>Bram’s principles (as I observed them) extended beyond mere technical
craftsmanship. The ability to adopt a position of <em>modesty</em> is a mind-trick that
channels an endeavor through a “narrow waist”, a voluntary constraint. That lens
can create a more composable and powerful result. Plugins like
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired">unimpaired</a> riff on the theme. And
this touches on a central point: the main utility—not ideology, but <em>utility</em>—of
“lifestyle software” like Emacs and Vim, is that the ecosystem is alive, and has
escape velocity, so its momentum is self-perpetuated.</p>

<p>Neovim has always been intentionally positioned as a derivative of Vim, which
means simultaneously it both continues and diverges from Vim. I’m convinced that
<a href="https://twitter.com/justinmk/status/1671916719143526400">forks create energy</a>
rather than destroy it. So although we can’t deliver Vim without Bram, we can
continue some essential parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-maintain">Maintenance</a>:
Experimentation is good, and the world needs creative destruction and playful
failures. But Neovim does not represent lust for the new (“neomania”).</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-documented">Documentation</a>:
the habits of Vim documentation are obvious, this is one of the biggest gains
that Nvim acquired by building on vim.</li>
  <li>Extensibility: Bram’s own <a href="http://www.agide.org/">Agide</a> project aspired to
a similar sort of extensibility as Neovim:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Agide is not a monolitic application. Separate tools can be plugged in. Thus
you are not forced to use one editor. … Each tool implements part of the
plugin interface.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-not">Embedding</a>: Vim’s
<a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/531da5955e03afadb2f0cf72264fe8deb4bf430e/runtime/doc/develop.txt#L145-L153">:help design-not</a>
for most of its life proclaimed this tenet of Neovim:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Vim is not a shell or an Operating System. …  This should work the other way
around: Use Vim as a component from a shell or in an IDE.</p>
    </blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RENO, Nev., AUSTIN, Texas, and LUXEMBOURG</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>CIQ, Oracle and SUSE today announced their intent to form the <a href="https://openela.org/">Open Enterprise Linux Association (OpenELA)</a>, a collaborative trade association to encourage the development of distributions compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) by providing open and free Enterprise Linux (EL) source code.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The formation of OpenELA arises from Red Hat’s recent changes to RHEL source code availability</span></span></span><span><span>. In response, CIQ, Oracle and SUSE are collaborating to deliver source code, tools and </span></span><span>systems through OpenELA for the community.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Collaboration is critical to fostering innovation, which is why we welcome everyone to be part of this association and help us uphold open community standards,” said Thomas Di Giacomo, chief technology and product officer of SUSE. “SUSE is a strong believer in making choice happen. Together with the open source community we will redefine what it truly means to be open and deliver a stronger future for EL.”&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Today's announcement marks the beginning of a new era for EL,” said Gregory Kurtzer, CEO of CIQ. “With OpenELA, CIQ, Oracle and SUSE join forces with the open source community to ensure a stable and resilient future for both upstream and downstream communities to leverage Enterprise Linux."</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Many large organizations reached out to us to express the importance of community-driven source code for EL that can act as a starting point for compatible distributions,” said </span></span></span><span>Wim Coekaerts, head of Oracle Linux development, Oracle. “</span><span>OpenELA is our response to this need, and it represents a commitment to helping the open source community continue to develop compatible EL distributions.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Starting later this year, OpenELA will provide sources necessary for downstreams compatible with RHEL to exist, with initial focus on RHEL versions EL8, EL9 and possibly EL7. The project is committed to ensuring the continued availability of OpenELA sources to the community indefinitely.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>OpenELA's core tenets, reflecting the spirit of the project, include full compliance with this existing standard, swift updates and secure fixes, transparency, community, and ensuring the resource remains free and redistributable for all.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>By welcoming other organizations and community members to join and contribute actively, OpenELA seeks to build a robust, community-driven standard that ensures impartiality and equilibrium in the EL ecosystem.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

    <p>Here’s a rant from my <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=tyrone">evil twin</a> Tyromight, which I publish without endorsement as it appears to be an unhinged polemic with no constructive solutions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Say that when people apply for their first driver’s license, 1% get Executive Platinum licenses. For life, they get free use of toll roads and can drive 20% over the speed limit. People argue—<em>fiercely</em> argue—if these should be awarded based on the written test, the driving test, or based on personal essays on <em>What Driving Means to Me</em>.</p>

<p>That would be weird, right?</p>

<p>Or say there’s a school. When kids enter as five-year-olds, the school deems 5% of them to be Gold Elites. They get special lunches and when they graduate as ten-year-olds, get preferred admission to competitive middle schools.</p>

<p>The question is not if Gold Elites should be chosen based on finger-painting or kickball competitions. The question is, why do they exist at all?</p>

<p>What would happen in schools if we lived in a magical dreamworld?</p>

<p>I think the answer is: Each kid gets whatever experiences maximize their potential.</p>

<p>That’s not controversial, is it? <em>Ideally</em>, they’d learn whatever subjects, in whatever style would best help them flourish into rich, happy, successful adults. Alice might spend her first few years in immersive Czech-language math classes and postpone history and science until she’s older. Bob might study everything in parallel with teachers that use puppetry and interpretive dance.</p>

<p>Picture each student as a dot in the space of possible experiences.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/harvard/experiences1small.svg" alt="student dots"></p>

<p>In the real world, there are only so many teachers and classrooms. So perhaps it’s necessary to carve up the space of experiences and create one class for each chunk.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/harvard/experiences2small.svg" alt="student dots partitioned"></p>

<p>(Really, it’s harder than this picture suggests, because many experiences are based on other students. If I want you as my project partner but you want to forget I exist, then something has to give.)</p>

<p>So there are tough questions. What classes should exist? Where do you put the best teachers? Should there be a “gifted” program? Most people acknowledge some tension between what’s best for the “top” students and everyone else. Opinions differ on how to resolve that tension, ranging from “top students in best classrooms with best teachers” to “all students together, with faster students helping others”.</p>

<p>But we agree on the <em>ideal</em>, right? In dreamworld, every kid would follow their own path. There would be no “advanced classes” or “tracks” because those concepts wouldn’t exist.</p>

<p>Now, this dreamworld school would not be a rainbow utopia where all students emerge equal. It’s plausible there would be <em>more</em> variance in outcomes than we have now. But we should still do it if we could.</p>

<p>So if that’s the ideal, then what’s wrong with giving 5% of kids Gold Elite status? Well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s decided by a committee, not something that emerges organically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you <em>must</em> have Gold Elites (why?) you should pick them when they are <em>graduating</em>, not when they start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If someone’s going to make Gold Elites, it damn well shouldn’t be the government or a tax-exempt nonprofit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s pretty much what’s wrong with Harvard. (And high-stakes college admissions in general).</p>

<h2 id="problem-1-gating-mechanisms-are-bad">Problem #1: Gating mechanisms are bad</h2>

<p>In the limit, this is obvious. Imagine a society in which 18-year olds are assessed and then assigned to different career bands. “Alphas” could be senators or CEOs, while “gammas” could pursue dreams of carrying heavy rocks or carrying heavy pieces of wood. It doesn’t matter how the assessment is done, the idea is dystopic.</p>

<p>College isn’t nearly that consequential. But still, the effect of high-stakes college admissions is to make society a bit more like that.</p>

<p>I think that’s bad because I’ve internalized Western individualist values. (Haven’t you?) But there are practical reasons, too.</p>

<p>One is that when gates exist, the people who control them will put their fingers on the scales, creating all sorts of weird distortions and drama. (Witness: How college admissions currently creates all sorts of weird distortions and drama.)</p>

<p>But forget all that. The deeper reason is that <u>prediction is hard</u>.</p>

<p>Yes, grades and test scores and teacher evaluations are correlated with performance in college and beyond. But they are <em>only correlated</em>. When Carl Bernstein was a student at the University of Maryland, he was kicked off the school paper for bad grades. And yet, Carl Bernstein is extremely good at journalism.</p>

<p>Are there <em>any</em> criteria that would have identified what undergraduate Carl Bernstein was capable of? I doubt it. The only way to really know what a human can do is to let them try.</p>

<p>Yes, people will end up in different jobs somehow. But this should be a fluid process, not something controlled by any central authority. Your ability to become a famous journalist should be determined only by <em>how good you are at journalism</em>. Not by your grades or test scores or your ability to convince some committee of your <em>potential</em>.</p>

<p>And when gating functions exist, <em>cui bono</em>?</p>

<p>Well, who has parents to most help and support them in school? Who gets special tutors if they struggle? Who has school counselors trained to win the college admissions game? Who has the time and resources and connections to publish a book of nature photography or start a charity or volunteer in Guatemala or work in a cancer research lab?</p>

<p>We should have a Marxist version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s law</a>, something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a measure becomes a target, the privileged always find a way to win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I think it’s bizarre that so many people have decided that standardized tests must be eliminated since they favor the rich. <em>Everything</em> favors the rich, but surely an SAT-prep course does less than a personal-essay consultant.</p>

<p>But that misses the point. Standardized tests are not the solution. If you eliminate all advantages for privileged students, you’re still handing out gold stars for no reason. High-stake college admissions based on <em>any</em> criteria make society less meritocratic.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-if-there-must-be-gating-mechanisms-they-should-come-as-late-as-possible">Problem #2: If there must be gating mechanisms, they should come as late as possible</h2>

<p>Sometimes you gotta gate.</p>

<p>If a war started tomorrow and everyone was drafted, then the military would have to choose who to train to fly fighter jets and who to train to repair submarines. There’s no getting around it. Aren’t colleges like that?</p>

<p>No. The plain truth is that different colleges mostly teach the same stuff.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? See for yourself. Here are practice exams for first-semester calculus at <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/math1a2020/final/practice1.pdf">Harvard</a> and <a href="https://www.siue.edu/artsandsciences/math/pdf/final1_scan.pdf">Southern Illinois University Edwardsville</a>. I’d say Harvard’s questions are a <em>little</em> harder, and a little “better” (more fun, better reflect core concepts). But mostly the difference is <em>number of pictures of Harvard</em>.</p>

<p>But isn’t the typical student at Harvard better prepared for calculus? Surely that has some impact?</p>

<p>It does! It has a huge impact: At SIU Edwardsville, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/dfr/2021/ReportPDF.aspx?unitId=149231">54%</a> of students graduate within 6 years. At Harvard, it’s <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/what-harvards-graduation-rate">98%</a>. Harvard does not do selective admissions so that it can push the most talented people to their limit.</p>

<p>The hardest part of Harvard is <em>getting in</em>. Do you think every legacy admit student athlete is a genius?</p>

<p>Say Alice wants to study math but she get rejected from Harvard so she goes to SIU Edwardsville. She struggles for a couple of semesters and then something clicks—she <em>gets</em> math and is at the top of the rest of her classes. She does a great research project and several professors say she’s the strongest undergrad to come through in years.</p>

<p>If Alice wants to be a professor, what are her odds of getting into a top program? (Of <em>course</em> a PhD from a top program is necessary to get a job as a professor!) The reality is: Low. Most PhD admissions committees will decide they don’t know what “strongest student at SIU” means, and pick someone “safer”.</p>

<p>If Alice wants to join the New York Times, or get a job at McKinsey, or go to a top law school so she could have a chance at the Supreme Court—same story. When Harvard rejected her, that made it harder for her to pass through <em>other</em> gating functions and many dreams became harder to reach.</p>

<p>High-stakes college admissions means that much of the value of a college degree is determined <em>before students even start college</em>. If you must mark and sort young people, gross, but OK. But why do it at 18 rather than 22? There’s no justification. No one even <em>suggests</em> a justification. Harvard just does it because it can.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-gating-mechanisms-certainly-shouldnt-be-created-by-tax-exempt-nonprofits">Problem #3: Gating mechanisms certainly shouldn’t be created by tax-exempt nonprofits</h2>

<p>Some people say Harvard is a private institution and it can do what it wants. These people are wrong.</p>

<p>For one, companies can’t do whatever they want. Just try starting a restaurant that refuses entry to people over 50.</p>

<p>Anyway, private universities are <em>non-profits</em>. You can’t start a tax-exempt country club. If you could, then every business would be a non-profit and no one would pay taxes and the government would collapse.</p>

<p>When John Paulson donated $400 million to Harvard, that was <em>tax-deductible</em>. If we assume his marginal tax rate was 25%, that’s equivalent to him donating $300 million of after-tax money, and then having the government kick in an extra $100 million. Ivy-league universities also earn insane profits on endowments tax-free and are exempt from local property taxes.</p>

<p>Yes, I know Massachusetts has a weird system of passive-aggressive reduced-rate <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/assessing/payment-lieu-tax-pilot-program">“voluntary” taxes</a> and Harvard pays $4 million a year. Great! After 25 years, they’ll have repaid the subsidy on Paulson’s donation and can start working on the <em>billions</em> they earn each year from their endowment.</p>

<p>Harvard is clear about their educational mission. It is to create “citizen-leaders”.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s preposterous that they have legacy admissions and other criteria that might as well be designed to favor the rich. But even with the fairest possible admissions, Harvard would still be an organization <em>designed to reduce meritocracy</em>, one with the explicit goal of picking a subset of the population and labeling them as winners. And it would still do that while being subsidized by the rest of society.</p>

<p>When you argue about how it does admissions, you’re accepting the premise that it should exist at all. It only seems reasonable because we’ve been indoctrinated since birth with the idea that “Ivy League = prestige”, and humans are programmed to think prestigious things are good.</p>

<h2 id="does-this-matter">Does this matter?</h2>

<p>Everyone is talking about a <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">recent paper</a> that looks at the impact of getting admitted to an Ivy+ (Ivy or similar) school. They looking at the ratios by which Ivy+ grads are represented in different groups relative to all college grads.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Condition</th>
      <th>Ivy+ over-representation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 25% income</td>
      <td>1.8×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 10% income</td>
      <td>3.3×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 1% income</td>
      <td>10.1×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fortune 500 CEOs</td>
      <td>14.5×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 0.1% income</td>
      <td>16.8×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Senators</td>
      <td>31.2×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Attend elite grad school</td>
      <td>32.4×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Journalists at NYT / WSJ</td>
      <td>32.6×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Presidents</td>
      <td>52.1×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Supreme Court justices</td>
      <td>89.2×</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Of course, this isn’t causal. The people who get into Ivy+ schools are smart and rich and would do well no matter what. To estimate the <em>causal</em> impact, they compare two groups:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Those who were put on a waitlist to an Ivy+ school and eventually accepted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who were put on a waitlist to an Ivy+ school but not accepted.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>They make some statistical arguments that these groups are similar, so getting off the waitlist is effectively random. Comparing the two groups, here’s how much they find getting accepted increases your chances of various things.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Condition</th>
      <th>Causal impact of Ivy+ admission</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>“Mean income rank”</td>
      <td>+1.8%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 25% income</td>
      <td>+2.7%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 10% income</td>
      <td>+8.2%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Attend grad school</td>
      <td>+28%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 1% income</td>
      <td>+44%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Attend elite grad school</td>
      <td>+90%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Work at place where many Ivy+ grads work</td>
      <td>+222%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Some point out that Ivy+ admission has little income on mean income rank, and suggest that none of this matters. To this, I have three counterarguments:</p>

<p>First, note—as most journalists did not—that “mean earnings rank” contains the word <em>rank</em>. Your rank is your position on a list of people sorted by incomes. This—unlike mean income—is insensitive to high earners. Roughly speaking, what this says is that for the <em>median person</em>, the causal effect of Ivy+ admissions on income is small.</p>

<p>Second, we don’t have causal estimates for things like becoming a CEO or working at the NYT or becoming a senator. But come on—the causal impacts are strongly correlated with Ivy+ over-representation. And Ivy+ grads are just as over-represented among Senators / NYT journalists / presidents as they are among people who go to elite grad schools.</p>

<p>Third, and most import: These causal estimates are for attending an Ivy+ school, <em>compared to attending a highly selective state school</em> like the University of Michigan. Michigan rejects 80% of applicants! Getting in there is still passing a very difficult gating function. This is all comparing a gold star to a slightly less shiny gold star. Imagine the impact versus places lower down the greasy pole.</p>

<p>Here’s my explanation for what’s happening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most people, even Ivy+ grads, end up in the world of normal jobs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That world is reasonably meritocratic. What matters is mostly your abilities, not your collection of gold stars. (At least, assuming you have  Michigan-tier gold star.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “elite” world is an incestuous shell game.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Harvard <em>exists</em> to make society less meritocratic, and it does that while subsidized by everyone else. Give up. There’s a reasonable argument for putting the top <em>professors</em> together in one school, sure, and maybe even PhD students. But <em>undergraduates</em>? Please. We don’t need to sort and classify 18-year olds. It’s absurd. Stop trying to fix it and get rid of it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>They looked exactly as expected: a wall of white, peppered with black specks for smaller integers. “We expected the black dots to peter out,” Stange said. Rickards added, “I thought maybe it would even be possible to prove they peter out.” He speculated that by looking at charts that synthesized many packings together, the team would be able to prove results that weren’t possible when they looked at any one packing on its own.</p>
<p>While Stange was away, Haag wound up plotting every pair of remainders — about 120. No surprises there. Then she went big.</p>
<p>Haag had been plotting how 1,000 integers interact. (The graph is bigger than it sounds, since it involves 1 million possible pairs.) Then she cranked the dial up to 10,000 times 10,000. In one graph, regular rows and columns of black specks refused to dissolve. It looked nothing like what the local-global conjecture would predict.</p>
<p>The team met on a Monday after Stange returned. Haag presented her graphs, and they all focused on the one with the weird dots. “It was just a continual pattern,” Haag said. “And that was when Kate said, ‘What if the local-global conjecture isn’t true?’”</p>
<p>“This looks like a pattern. It has to continue. So the local-global conjecture must be false,” Stange recalled thinking. “James was more skeptical.”</p>
<p>“My first thought was there must be a bug in my code,” Rickards said. “I mean, that was the only reasonable thing I could think of.”</p>
<p>Within half a day, Rickards came around. The pattern ruled out all pairs where the first number is of the form 8 × (3<em>n</em> ± 1)<sup>2</sup> and the second is 24 times any square. This means 24 and 8 never appear in the same packing. Numbers you’d expect to occur don’t.</p>
<p>“I was kind of giddy. It’s not very often that something really surprises you,” Stange said. “But that’s the magic of playing with data.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02749">July paper</a> outlines a rigorous proof that the pattern they observed continues indefinitely, disproving the conjecture. The proof hinges on a centuries-old principle called quadratic reciprocity that involves the squares of two prime numbers. Stange’s team discovered how reciprocity applies to circle packings. It explains why certain curvatures can’t be tangent to each other. The rule, called an obstruction, propagates throughout the whole packing. “It’s just an entirely new thing,” said <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~lagarias/">Jeffrey Lagarias</a>, a mathematician at the University of Michigan who was a co-author on the 2003 circle-packing paper. “They’ve found it ingeniously,” Sarnak said. “If these numbers did appear, they would violate reciprocity.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Fallout</strong></h2>
<p>A number of other conjectures in number theory may now be in doubt. Like the local-global conjecture, they are hard to prove but have already been shown to hold for virtually all cases and are generally assumed to be true.</p>

<p>For example, Fuchs studies Markov triples, sets of numbers that satisfy the equation <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> = 3<em>xyz</em>. She and others have shown that certain types of solutions are connected for prime numbers greater than 10<sup>392</sup>. Everyone believes the pattern should continue to infinity. But in light of the new result, Fuchs has allowed herself to feel a twinge of doubt. “Maybe I’m missing something,” she said. “Maybe everyone’s missing something.”</p>
<p>“Now that we have a single example where it’s false, the question is: Is it false for these other examples too?” Rickards said.</p>
<p>There’s also Zaremba’s conjecture. It says that a fraction with any denominator can be expressed as a continued fraction that uses only the numbers between 1 and 5. In 2014, Kontorovich and Bourgain showed that Zaremba’s conjecture holds for almost all numbers. But the surprise about circle packing has undermined confidence in Zaremba’s conjecture.</p>
<p>If the packing problem is a harbinger of things to come, computational data may be the tool of its undoing.</p>
<p>“I always find it fascinating when new mathematics is born out of just purely looking at data,” Fuchs said. “Without it, it’s really hard to imagine that [they] would have stumbled upon this.”</p>

<p>Stange added that none of this would have happened without the low-stakes summer project. “Serendipity and an attitude of playful exploration both have such a huge role in discovery,” she said.</p>
<p>“It was pure coincidence,” Haag said.&nbsp;“If I didn’t go big enough, we wouldn’t have noticed it.” The work bodes well for the future of number theory. “You can glean understanding of mathematics through your intuition, through proofs,” Stange said. “And you trust that a lot because you spent a lot of time thinking about it. But you can’t argue with the data.”</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> This limit includes archived teams.</p>

<h2 id="messaging">Messaging</h2>
<h3 id="chat">Chat</h3>
<p>Users who participate in conversations that are part of the chat list in Teams must have an Exchange Online (cloud-based) mailbox for an admin to search chat conversations. That's because conversations that are part of the chat list are stored in the cloud-based mailboxes of the chat participants. If a chat participant doesn't have an Exchange Online mailbox, the admin won't be able to search or place a hold on chat conversations. For example, in an Exchange hybrid deployment, users with on-premises mailboxes might be able to participate in conversations that are part of the chat list in Teams. However, in this case, content from these conversations isn't searchable and can't be placed on hold because the users don't have cloud-based mailboxes.

<p><strong>Microsoft 365 live event limit increases</strong></p>
<p><strong>To continue supporting our customers' needs, we will extend temporary limit increases for live events through December 31, 2023, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Event support for up to 20,000 attendees</li>
<li>50 events can be hosted simultaneously across a tenant</li>
<li>Event duration of 16 hours per broadcast</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Live Events with up to 100,000 attendees can be planned through the Microsoft 365 assistance program.

<h2 id="presence-in-outlook">Presence in Outlook</h2>
<p>Teams presence in Outlook is supported on the Outlook 2013 desktop app and later. To learn more about presence in Teams, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/presence-admins" data-linktype="relative-path">User presence in Teams</a>.</p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>Each team in Microsoft Teams has a team site in SharePoint Online, and each channel in a team gets a folder within the default team site document library. Files shared within a conversation are automatically added to the document library, and permissions and file security options set in SharePoint are automatically reflected within Teams.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Each <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/private-channels" data-linktype="relative-path">private channel</a> has its own SharePoint site (previously called "site collection").</p>
</div>
<p>If you don't have SharePoint Online enabled in your tenant, Microsoft Teams users cannot always share files in teams. Users in private chat also cannot share files because OneDrive for Business (which is tied to the SharePoint license) is required for that functionality.</p>
<p>By storing the files in the SharePoint Online document library and OneDrive for Business, all compliance rules configured at the tenant level will be followed. (For more, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/sharepoint-onedrive-interact" data-linktype="relative-path">How SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams</a>.)</p>
<p>Because Teams runs on a SharePoint Online backend for file sharing, SharePoint limitations apply to the Files section within a Team. Here are the applicable storage limits for SharePoint Online.</p>

  <p>In 2021, researchers made a striking discovery while training a series of tiny models on toy tasks <a key="Grokking"></a>. They found a set of models that suddenly flipped from memorizing their training data to correctly generalizing on unseen inputs after training for much longer. This phenomenon – where generalization seems to happen abruptly and long after fitting the training data – is called <em>grokking</em> and has sparked a flurry of interest <a key="Omnigrok Universality Zhong23 ProgressParity gromov"></a>.</p>
<div>


<p>Do more complex models also suddenly generalize after they’re trained longer? Large language models can certainly seem like they have a rich understanding of the world, but they might just be regurgitating memorized bits of the enormous amount of text they’ve been trained on <a key="Parrots Othello"></a>. How can we tell if they’re generalizing or memorizing? </p>
<p>In this article we’ll examine the training dynamics of a tiny model and reverse engineer the solution it finds – and in the process provide an illustration of the exciting emerging field of mechanistic interpretability <a key="MechInterp ProgressMeasures"></a>. While it isn’t yet clear how to apply these techniques to today’s largest models, starting small makes it easier to develop intuitions as we progress towards answering these critical questions about large language models. </p>

<p>Modular addition is essentially the fruit fly of grokking.<a key="modular"></a> The above line chart comes from a model trained to predict <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mtext> </mtext><mo lspace="0.22em" rspace="0.22em"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow></mo><mtext> </mtext><mn>67</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a + b \bmod 67</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.<a key="67"></a> We start by randomly dividing all the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a, b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> pairs into test and training datasets. Over thousands of training steps, the training data is used to adjust the model into outputting correct answers, while the test data is only used to check if the model has learned a general solution.</p>
<p>The model’s architecture is similarly simple: <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>ReLU</mtext><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">a</mi><mtext>one-hot</mtext></msub><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">b</mi><mtext>one-hot</mtext></msub><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{ReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}_{\text{one-hot}} \mathbf{W}_{\text{input}} + \mathbf{b}_{\text{one-hot}} \mathbf{W}_{\text{input}}\right) \mathbf{W}_{\text{output}}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> — a one-layer MLP with 24 neurons.<a key="playground"></a> All the weights of the model are shown in the heatmap below; you can see how they change during training by mousing over the line chart above. </p>
<div>


<p>The model makes a prediction by selecting the two columns of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>input</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{input}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> corresponding to inputs <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> then adding them together to create a vector of 24 separate numbers. Next it sets all the negative numbers in the vector to 0 and finally outputs the column of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{output}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that’s closest to the updated vector.</p>
<p>The weights of the model are initially quite noisy but start to exhibit periodic patterns as accuracy on the test data increases and the model <animate data-animate="top-switches">switches</animate> to generalizing. By the end of training, each neuron — each row of the heatmap — cycles through high and low values several times as the input number increases from 0 to 66.</p>
<p>This is easier to see if we group the neurons by how often they cycle at the end of training and chart each of them as a separate line:  </p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The periodic patterns suggest the model is learning some sort of mathematical structure; the fact that it happens when the model starts to solve the test examples hints that it’s related to the model generalizing. But <em>why</em> does the model move away from the memorizing solution? And <em>what</em> is the generalizing solution?  </p>
<h3 id="generalizing-with-1s-and-0s">Generalizing With 1s and 0s</h3>
<p>Figuring out both of these questions simultaneously is hard. Let’s make an even simpler task, one where we know what the generalizing solution should look like and try to understand why the model eventually learns it.</p>
<p>We’ll take random sequences of thirty 1s and 0s and train our model to predict if there is an odd number of 1s in the first three digits. e.g. <digits>000110010110001010111001001011</digits> is <digits>0</digits> while <digits>010110010110001010111001001011</digits> is <digits>1</digits> — basically a slightly trickier XOR with some distraction noise. A generalizing model should only use the first three digits of the sequence; if the model is memorizing the training data, it will also use the subsequent distracting digits <a key="ProgressParity TwoCircuits"></a>.   </p>
<p>Our model is again a one-layer MLP, trained on a fixed batch of 1,200 sequences.<a key="sp-model"></a> At first only training accuracy increases — the model is memorizing the training data. As with modular arithmetic, test accuracy is essentially random and then sharply rises as the model learns a general solution.</p>


<p>While <animate data-animate="sp-mem">memorizing</animate> , the model looks dense and noisy with lots of high magnitude weights (shown as dark red and blue squares) spread across the chart below – the model is using all the inputs to make a prediction. As the model <animate data-animate="sp-gen">generalizes</animate> and gets perfect test accuracy, we see all the weights connected to the distracting digits gray out with very low values and the model focusing on the first three digits — mirroring the generalized structure we expected!<a key="sp-solution"></a></p>


<p>With this simplified example it’s easier to see why this happens: we’re pushing our model to do two things during training — output a high probability for the correct label (called minimizing <em>loss</em> <a key="loss"></a>) and have weights with low magnitudes (known as <em>weight decay</em> <a key="sp-l2"></a>). <span>Train loss</span> actually slightly increases before the model generalizes as it exchanges loss related to outputting the correct label for having lower weights. </p>


<p>The sharp drop in <span>test loss</span> makes it appear like the model makes a sudden shift to generalization. But if we look at the weights of the model over training, most of them smoothly interpolate between the two solutions. The rapid generalization occurs when the last weights connected to the distracting digits are pruned by weight decay.</p>


<h3 id="when-does-grokking-happen-">When Does Grokking Happen?</h3>
<p>It’s important to note that grokking is a contingent phenomenon — it goes away if model size, weight decay, data size and other hyper parameters aren’t just right. With too little weight decay, the model can’t escape overfitting the training data.<a key="overfit"></a> Adding more weight decay pushes the model to generalize after memorizing. Increasing weight decay even more causes test and train loss to fall together; the model goes straight to generalizing. And with too much weight decay the model will fail to learn anything. </p>
<p>Below, we’ve trained over a thousand models on the 1s and 0s task with different hyperparameters. Training is noisy so nine models have been trained for each set of hyperparameters. </p>



<p>We can induce memorization and generalization on this somewhat contrived 1s and 0s task — but why does it happen with modular addition? Let’s first understand a little more about how a one-layer MLP can solve modular addition by constructing a generalizing solution that’s interpretable. </p>
<h3 id="modular-addition-with-five-neurons">Modular Addition With Five Neurons</h3>
<p>Recall that our modular arithmetic problem <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mtext> </mtext><mo lspace="0.22em" rspace="0.22em"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow></mo><mtext> </mtext><mn>67</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a + b \bmod 67</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is naturally periodic, with answers wrapping around if the sum ever passes 67. Mathematically, this can be mirrored by thinking of the sum as wrapping <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> around a circle. The weights of the generalizing model also had periodic patterns, indicating that the solution might use this property. </p>
<p>We can train a simpler model with a head start on the problem, constructing an embedding matrix that places <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on a circle using <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cos</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.<a key="unit-circle"></a></p>




<p><br>
Then we train <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{in-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>out-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{out-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in this one-layer MLP:</p>


<p>With just five neurons the model finds a solution with perfect accuracy. </p>
<div>



<p>Eyeballing the trained parameters, all the neurons <animate data-animate="five-neuron-converge">converge</animate> to roughly equal norms. If we directly plot their <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cos</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> components, they’re essentially evenly distributed around a circle: </p>


<p>Connect the adjacent neurons on the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{in-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> circle and an intriguing pattern emerges: <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>out-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{out-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is rotating around the circle twice as fast as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{in-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. </p>
</div>


<p>The details of how this solution works aren’t essential —  check out <a href="#appendix-a-how-the-circular-construction-works">Appendix A</a> to see how the doubled rotation allows the model to map inputs like <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mtext> </mtext><mo lspace="0.22em" rspace="0.22em"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow></mo><mtext> </mtext><mn>67</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1 + 0 \bmod 67</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>  and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>66</mn><mtext> </mtext><mo lspace="0.22em" rspace="0.22em"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow></mo><mtext> </mtext><mn>67</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2 + 66 \bmod 67</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to the same place — but we have found a 20 parameter construction that solves modular addition. Can we find the same algorithm hidden in the 3,216 parameter model we started with? And why does the larger model switch to the generalizing solution after memorizing? </p>

<div>

 

<p>Unlike the constructed solution, where <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>embed</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{embed}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> rotates around the circle once, this model has many different frequencies. </p>
<p>Below, we’ve isolated the frequencies using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).<a key="dft"></a>  This factors out the learned periodic patterns across inputs, leaving us with the equivalent of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{in-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>out-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{out-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from the constructed solution. For each neuron, this gives a <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cos</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> value for every possible periodic frequency from 1 to 33. The wave charts we show above use this to group neurons into frequencies by finding their largest <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cos</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> value across all frequencies.<a key="dft-sort"></a> </p>


<p>Just like in the 1s and 0s task, weight decay encourages this representation to become much sparser as the model <animate data-animate="bot-gen">generalizes</animate> .</p>
<p>Grouping neurons by their final trained frequencies, and plotting the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cos</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> components of the DFT for each neuron, we see the same star shapes from the constructed solution appear.</p>



<p><strong>This trained model is using the same algorithm as our constructed solution!</strong> Below, the contribution to the output generated by the neurons in each frequency are shown and we can see them calculating  <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mi>f</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>q</mi></mrow><mn>67</mn></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> \cos\frac{2\pi (a +  b) freq}{67}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> .<a key="logit-wave"></a>        </p>
<p>Notice what happens to the group of neurons with a frequency of 7 when test loss <animate data-animate="bot-improve">improves</animate> after the short plateau at 45,000 steps — they start to snap into a star shape and their outputs more closely approximate a wave.</p>



<p>To lower loss without using higher weights (which would be punished by weight decay), the model uses several frequencies, taking advantage of constructive interference.<a key="ProgressMeasures"></a> There’s nothing magical about the frequencies 4, 5, 7 and 26 — click through other training runs below to see variations of this algorithm get learned.  </p>

<h3 id="open-questions">Open Questions</h3>
<p>While we now have a solid understanding of the mechanisms a one-layer MLP uses to solve modular addition and why they emerge during training, there are still many interesting open questions about memorization and generalization. </p>
<h4 id="which-model-constraints-work-best-">Which Model Constraints Work Best?</h4>
<p>Directly training the model visualized above — <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>ReLU</mtext><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mtext>one-hot</mtext></msub><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mtext>one-hot</mtext></msub><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{ReLU} \left(a_{\text{one-hot}}\textbf{W}_{\text{input}} + b_{\text{one-hot}}\textbf{W}_{\text{input}} \right) \textbf{W}_{\text{output}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> — does not actually result in generalization on modular arithmetic, even with the addition of weight decay. At least one of the matrices has to be factored:  </p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>embed</mtext></msub><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">

</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> </p>
<p>We observed that the generalizing solution is sparse after taking the discrete Fourier transformation, but the collapsed matrices have high norms. This suggests that direct weight decay on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_\text{output}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>input</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{input}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> doesn’t provide the right inductive bias for the task. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, weight decay does steer a wide variety of models away from memorizing their training data <a key="DoubleDescent double-demystified"></a>. Other techniques that help avoid overfitting include dropout, smaller models and even numerically unstable optimization algorithms <a key="Slingshot"></a>. These approaches interact in complex, non-linear ways, making it difficult to predict <em>a priori</em> which will ultimately induce generalization. Collapsing <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>embed</mtext></msub><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{embed}} \mathbf{W}_{\text{in-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> instead of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>out-proj</mtext></msub><msubsup><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>embed</mtext><mi mathvariant="normal">⊤</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{out-proj}} \textbf{W}_{\text{embed}}^{\top}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, for example, helps in some setups and hurts in others:</p>


<h4 id="why-is-memorization-easier-than-generalization-">Why Is Memorization Easier Than Generalization?</h4>
<p>One theory: there can be many more ways to memorize a training set than there are generalizing solutions. So statistically, memorization should be more likely to happen first, especially if we have no or little regularization. Regularization techniques, like weight decay, prioritize certain solutions over others, for example, preferring “sparse” solutions over “dense” ones.</p>
<p>Recent work suggests that generalization is associated with well-structured representations <a key="EffectiveTheory"></a>. However, it’s not a necessary condition; some MLP variations without symmetric inputs learn less “circular” representations when solving modular addition <a key="Zhong23"></a>. We also observed that well-structured representations are not a sufficient condition for generalization. This small model (trained with no weight decay) starts generalizing, then switches to memorizing with periodic embeddings. </p>



<p>It’s even possible to find hyperparameters where models start generalizing, then switch to memorizing, then switch back to generalizing! <a key="open-q-mem"></a> </p>



<h4 id="what-about-larger-models-">What About Larger Models?</h4>
<p>Does grokking happen in larger models trained on real world tasks? Earlier observations reported the grokking phenomenon in algorithmic tasks in small transformers and MLPs <a key="Grokking ProgressMeasures Zhong23"></a>. Grokking has subsequently been found in more complex tasks involving images, text, and tabular data within certain ranges of hyperparameters <a key="Omnigrok Goldilocks"></a>. It’s also possible that the largest models, which are able to do many types of tasks, may be grokking many things at different speeds during training <a key="quantization"></a>.</p>
<p>There have also been promising results in predicting grokking before it happens. Though some require knowledge of the generalizing solution <a key="ProgressMeasures"></a> or the overall data domain <a key="StructuralGrokking"></a>, some rely solely on the analysis of the training loss <a key="PredictingGrokking"></a> and might also apply to larger models — hopefully we’ll be able to build tools and techniques that can tell us when a model is parroting memorized information and when it’s using richer models.</p>
<p>Understanding the solution to modular addition wasn’t trivial. Do we have any hope of understanding larger models? One route forward — like our digression into the 20 parameter model and the even simpler boolean parity problem — is to: 1) train simpler models with more inductive biases and fewer moving parts, 2) use them to explain inscrutable parts of how a larger model works, 3) repeat as needed. We believe this could be a fruitful approach to better understanding larger models, and complementary to efforts that aim to use larger models to explain smaller ones and other work to disentangle internal representations <a key="explain multiple-choice TMOS"></a>. Moreover, this kind of mechanistic approach to interpretability, in time, may help identify patterns that themselves ease or automate the uncovering of algorithms learned by neural networks.</p>

<div>



<p>It works! But we’re cheating a bit, do you see how <strong>unembed</strong> loops around the circle twice? We need to output a single prediction for “<v></v>“ — not separate predictions for “<v></v>“ and “<v2></v2>“. Directly adding the two predictions for a number together won’t work since they’re on opposite sides of the circles and will cancel each other out. </p>
<p>Instead, let’s incorporate a <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>ReLU</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{ReLU}(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to fix the repeated outputs. </p>


<p>We’ve essentially wrapped the circle around in on itself and the model outputs a single prediction for “<v></v>“.   </p>

<p><a key="modular"></a> In modular addition, we have two input numbers, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and a modulus <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

This type of addition is often called clock-face addition, because when adding two times, we often report the result modulo 12 (i.e. 5 hours after 8 o’clock is 1 o’clock).
<span></span>
Modular addition sounds simple and it is. We can easily train 1,000s of models and treat them like fruit flies in neuroscience: small enough such that it is feasible to extract their <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.add9330">connectome</a> synapse-by-synapse, yet providing new interesting insights about the system more broadly. We can get a good understanding of the small models we’ve trained by visualizing all their internals.</p>
<p><a key="67"></a>67 isn’t a magic number – we could pick many numbers to illustrate grokking, but 67 is not so small that the task is trivial and also not so large that the visualizations are overwhelming. </p>

<p><a key="loss"></a> So far we’ve been charting <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy">accuracy</a>, the percentage of sequences where the correct label is the most likely. Training typically instead optimizes a differentiable objective function. All the models in this post use <a href="https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/loss_functions.html">cross entropy loss</a> which heavily penalizes incorrect predictions with high probabilities. 
<span></span>
Note that while some formulations of loss include a weight decay or regularization term, the loss plots here depict the cross entropy component alone.</p>
<p><a key="sp-l2"></a>
On the 1s and 0s task here, we use L1 weight decay <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="bold">w</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L1(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i} |w_i|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

It pushes for <a href="https://explained.ai/regularization/L1vsL2.html">lots of small weights</a> leading to redundant neurons on this task:

<img src="https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/img/sp-l2.gif"> </p>
<p><a key="overfit"></a> A model overfits the training data when it performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data — this is what we see with our memorizing models. In general, simpler models are less prone to overfitting as, due to their simplicity, decision rules are coarser and are required to make more generalizations. Of course, if a model is too simple for a task, it may not be able to learn good decision rules that capture the nuances of the task. Researchers force models to be simpler through a variety of techniques, including having models with fewer parameters or encouraging the parameters that the model does have to be small in size with weight decay.  </p>

<span></span>
<img src="https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/img/w_embed.png" width="319"></p>
<p><a key="dft"></a> The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY">Discrete Fourier Transform</a> helps analyze the periodic nature of a sequence of values (in this case the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F6_1_cWXE5M7WocUcpQWp3v8z4b1jL20#scrollTo=iSPxi3ElsujY">weights for a particular neuron</a>) by breaking it down into sine and cosine functions. The more periodic a function is, the easier it is to represent with sine and cosines, and the sparser the output of the DFT.</p>
<p><a key="dft-sort"></a> We’ve reindexed the neurons by their final frequency and phase to make this grouping easier to see .</p>
<p><a key="logit-wave"></a>
The model generates probabilities by taking the dot product of the neuron activations for a given input with <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{output}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and softmaxing. If we calculate the dot product using only the activations from neurons of a single frequency, we can see which outputs the frequency group is making more or less likely.<br><span></span>
<a href="#appendix-a-how-the-circular-construction-works">Appendix A</a> explains why these logits form a wave — each group of frequencies is essentially outputting how close the correct answer is to every number on a version of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>embed</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{embed}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with the group’s frequency. </p>
<p><a key="open-q-mem"></a>Both of these models are <a href="https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/PAIR-code/ai-explorables/blob/master/server-side/grokking/MLP_Modular_Addition.ipynb#scrollTo=5hJqK4jx0vC7">quite small</a>. The bottom model has tweaked hyperparameters to encourage eventual generalization: it’s slightly larger to allow it to exit local minimums, it has more training data (making low loss memorizing solutions harder to find) and it has weight decay.    </p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Recently, remarkable progress has been made in automated task-solving through
the use of multi-agent driven by large language models (LLMs). However,
existing LLM-based multi-agent works primarily focus on solving simple dialogue
tasks, and complex tasks are rarely studied, mainly due to the LLM
hallucination problem. This type of hallucination becomes cascading when
naively chaining multiple intelligent agents, resulting in a failure to
effectively address complex problems. Therefore, we introduce MetaGPT, an
innovative framework that incorporates efficient human workflows as a meta
programming approach into LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically,
MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts to
enhance structured coordination. Subsequently, it mandates modular outputs,
empowering agents with domain expertise comparable to human professionals, to
validate outputs and minimize compounded errors. In this way, MetaGPT leverages
the assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, thereby
establishing a framework that can effectively and cohesively deconstruct
complex multi-agent collaborative problems. Our experiments on collaborative
software engineering benchmarks demonstrate that MetaGPT generates more
coherent and correct solutions compared to existing chat-based multi-agent
systems. This highlights the potential of integrating human domain knowledge
into multi-agent systems, thereby creating new opportunities to tackle complex
real-world challenges. The GitHub repository of this project is publicly
available on:<a href="https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.

            <h3>What apps are available on Applite?</h3>
            <p>
              Any application that can be found on the <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew Catalog</a> is available on Applite.
            </p>

            <h3>Is it secure?</h3>
            <p>
              The macOS built-in protection (Gatekeeper and XProtect) will scan the application for potential malware
              the first time you open it and notify you if anything is suspicious. Also, most applications in the Homebrew
              Catalog are notarized, which means they come from a registered developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The apps may not be sandboxed, which allows them to affect your system with elevated privileges.
              Nevertheless, be careful, as some applications may contain malware, especially those that have few downloads.
              Applite itself is also not sandboxed.

            <h2>Advanced FAQ</h2>

            <h3>Can I use Applite with my existing Homebrew installation?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, you can. The first time you open the application, you will be asked if you want to use your own brew
              or if you want to create a new installation just for Applite.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you choose to create a new installation it will be stored at: <code>~/Library/Application Support/Applite/homebrew</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I manage already installed apps with Applite?</h3>
            <p>
              If you chose to use your existing brew installation all casks installed with it will appear in Applite.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any other apps installed manually (e.g. from DMG or PKG files) will not show up as installed in Applite.
              You can add them by reinstalling them. See <a href="https://aerolite.dev/applite/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> page
              for more information on adding already installed apps.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>Reality TV doesn’t need to do much to sensationalize hoarding. Like rubberneckers at a traffic accident, we gaze in horror at “goat paths” hacked between mounds of newspapers, greasy pizza cartons, bills, checks, mustard packets, broken gadgets, old T-shirts, and stained Tupperware. Crawling with rodents and cockroaches, covered in mildew, mold, and bacteria, these mounds are a fire hazard (according to <a href="https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~rek/Projects/MFB_D09.pdf">one study</a>, they cause 24 percent of all avoidable fire deaths) and a fall hazard. They build a wall of shame that blocks the entry of family, friends, even a plumber or electrician. How can people live like this? we murmur.</p>
<p>But many hoarders don’t see their behavior as disordered, and psychology didn’t either—at first. In 2013, the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23599414?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, the holy book of psychiatric diagnoses, was revised to list severe hoarding as a disorder in its own right. To meet the diagnostic criteria, someone must have acquired an unmanageable, even hazardous number of possessions that appear to be useless or of limited value—yet would cause them severe distress if discarded.</p>
		
		
<p>The original understanding of hoarding, however, had nothing to do with clutter; it was financial avarice. King Midas hoarded gold, as did the tight-fisted clergy who, Dante wrote, would be condemned to the fourth circle of hell. Only in the twentieth century did people begin engaging in the eccentric over-accumulation of random, not terribly valuable stuff.</p>
<p>At first, it was called <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23131566?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">Collyer’s syndrome</a>, in honor of Homer and Langley Collyer, brothers who, between 1909 and 1947, slowly buried themselves in their family mansion in Harlem, filling it inch by inch. By midcentury, as mass production and a postwar economic boom made it possible for people of modest means to acquire more and more objects, Collyer’s syndrome became more widespread. Psychologists decided that hoarding must be a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a repeated, ritualized action intended to ward off anxiety.</p>
<p>That categorization held for decades—even though clinical hoarding affects up to 6 percent of the world population, twice as many as OCD. A <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24942483?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">2010 review</a> by David Mataix-Cols at King’s College London noted that at least 80 percent of people who engaged in extreme hoarding didn’t meet the criteria for OCD. They were more prone to depression than those with OCD. They had more difficulty making decisions. They were far less likely to be aware of their behavior as a problem. Genetic linkage studies showed a different pattern of heritability than OCD, and brain scans showed a different <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24939571?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">pattern of activation</a>. Drugs that were successful in treating OCD were not effective for hoarding.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2013, hoarding disorder was sprung free of the OCD category. And it can be connected to an array of causes as motley as the stuff that gets hoarded. It shows up on a continuum, spanning everything from an overcluttered home that’s spun out of control to abject squalor. It can extend to the accumulation of live animals (though that’s a very different proposition).</p>

<p>In families with two or more members who hoard, researchers have identified an allele on chromosome 14 (in <a href="https://phys.org/news/2013-05-hoarding-gene-behavior-doberman-pinschers.html">Doberman Pinschers</a>, hoarding’s been linked to chromosome 7). “More than 80 percent of our subjects reported a first-degree relative with similar problems,” note Randy Frost and Gail Steketee, pioneers in this research, in their book Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things. Hoarders might inherit different ways of processing information, they suggest, or “an intense perceptual sensitivity to visual details… [that] give objects special meaning and value to them.”</p>
<p>Other studies suggest non-genetic causes. Hoarding can also accompany certain traumatic brain injuries, Tourette’s syndrome, ADHD, neurodegenerative disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, clinical depression, and dementia. Childhood poverty, interestingly enough, does not seem to be connected with hoarding. But researchers have found a possible link between hoarding and PTSD among <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430794">Holocaust survivors</a>, and late-onset hoarding has often been linked to loss or trauma. The psychological understanding is that objects are gathered in a futile attempt to fill emotional emptiness—piled up like a barricade to protect oneself against an uncertain future.</p>
<p>If you zoom out from that intimate pain, though, there’s also a big-picture theory: Hoarding is the natural consequence of a consumer society glutted with stuff and running out of landfills.</p>
<p>In “Neurohistory in Action: Hoarding and the Human Past,” the historian Daniel Lord Smail suggests that we stop thinking of biology and culture as separate causes. “Gene expression is intimately tangled up with cultural and individual life circumstances,” he points out. Couldn’t the rise of compulsive hoarding be caused by the ways our physical selves interact with a changing material environment? When we started processing our food, for example, we no longer needed wisdom teeth—so our mouths grew too small to accommodate them. “Social forms and behavioral patterns sculpt the body,” Smail writes.</p>
		
		
<p>Monkeys, crows, squirrels, kangaroo rats, and honeybees all hoard—just as humans have for millennia—as an adaptive way to survive a cold winter or a famine. That is not the kind of hoarding that makes it to a reality TV show. “The compulsive hoarding of useless things seems to be characteristic of only the last century or two—and primarily the last few decades,” Smail notes.</p>
<p>In other words, something has changed—in history and culture—to cause hoarding to emerge as a prevalent psychiatric disorder. Objects have taken on, for those who hoard them, individual personalities with outsized emotional significance. They cannot be casually discarded; they are woven into the person’s very sense of self, promoting comments like, “If I throw too much away, there’ll be nothing left of me.”</p>
<p>Acquisition is the first half of the disorder. People fall in love with stuff they don’t immediately need because it’s free, or it reminds them of a particular experience, or they might need it someday, or they could transform it in some cool way and increase its value. These objects accumulate, and people resist parting with them because of their perceived potential, or their sentimental significance, or their triggered memories, or because it’s wasteful to pile up a landfill with some perfectly good object somebody might need someday. Or because the person who’s hoarding simply doesn’t like being told what to do with their stuff.</p>
<p>Even if they want to downsize (which is rare), there’s the overwhelming difficulty of sorting through the mess. People with severe hoarding disorder tend to be easily distracted and have a hard time focusing and concentrating. Paradoxically, they also tend to be perfectionists, so they’ll put off making decisions rather than risk being wrong. And when it comes to their own stuff, they don’t categorize by type. Rather than see an object as a member of a large group (say, one of 42 black T-shirts), they see it as singular, unique, special. Each black T-shirt is perceived apart from the others and carries its own history, significance, and worth. It’s not even categorized for storage (folded with other black T-shirts in a T-shirt drawer), but rather placed on a pile and retrieved spatially (that particular black T-shirt lives about four inches from the bottom of the corner stack). This leads to a deep aversion to someone touching the piles or sifting through them, unwittingly destroying the invisible ordering system.</p>

<p>As with any condition that becomes a collective fascination, there’s a chicken-or-the-egg question: Is hoarding disorder increasing or has an increase in media coverage just made us more aware of it? Estimates suggest that as many as 19 million Americans have a hoarding disorder. The first task force on hoarding formed in 1989 in Fairfax County, Virginia. There are now more than 100 such organizations in the U.S. By 2020, more than 15% of the U.S. population is expected to be 65 or older—prime age for hoarding. According to the American Psychiatric Association, hoarding disorder affects three times as many people ages 55 to 94 as it does those ages 34 to 44. The disorder may show up in adolescence, but it’s often <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3464334?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">intensified in older age</a>, exacerbated by bereavement, divorce, fuzzy thinking, or financial crisis.</p>
<p>People are living longer and aging at home, where they’re free to amass as much stuff as they like. Sometimes that tendency was held in check by a spouse who’s now gone. Sometimes what’s hoarded are the deceased spouse’s belongings. Or those of a child who has long since grown up and moved out. At a point where people are losing their independence—their work, status, connections, sensory acuity, physical strength, and mental sharpness—hoarding can be a way to shore oneself up, to feel safe, consoled, prepared.</p>
<p>An entire industry has sprung up around hoarding: psychologists, researchers, social workers, public health workers, professional organizers, fire marshals, biohazard cleanup companies, haulers. Why does it bother us so much? There’s an instinctive recoil from the pests and contaminants, of course, not to mention the dreaded fights and physical labor if the person who’s hoarding is a family member.</p>
<p>The disorder’s not just incomprehensible to the rest of us, but intractable. People who hoard are often intelligent, well-educated, and creative, and they don’t want to be “fixed.” If their home reaches a point where city officials force help, it’s likely to be filled again soon after it’s been emptied.</p>

<p>There might be another reason, though, for the general recoil. Several scholars have suggested that hoarding hits a little <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41427074?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">too close to home</a>. We all do daily battle against an excess of stuff. It flows into our homes, brought by FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service, snagged on Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, Freecycle, or a yard sale, inherited or handed down. It piles up in closets, basements, and garages. Almost 10 percent of American households are renting at least one storage space, often for an overflow of stuff, according to a 2015-16 Self Storage Industry Fact Sheet. It is now possible for every American to stand comfortably, at the same time, under the total canopy of self-storage roofing.</p>
<p>Those of us terrified by this prospect watch episodes of Hoarders or Hoarding: Buried Alive and race to declutter, muttering the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43959285?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">KonMari principles</a> as we hunt for sparks of joy amid the detritus. Perhaps Marie Kondo would not have become a multimedia phenomenon in the madly collecting Victorian Age, with its precious cabinets of curiosities, nor in the postwar ’50s, with brightly colored toys and gizmos flying off the factory conveyor belts. But now we are glutted with stuff—and uneasy about the consequences.</p>

<p>In late January 2023, almost 45 GB of source code from the Russian search giant Yandex was leaked on BreachForums by a former Yandex employee. While the leak itself did not contain user data, it reportedly contained the source code for all major Yandex services, including Metrika, which collects user analytics through a widely used SDK, and Crypta, Yandex’s behavioral analytics technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got involved when a fellow privacy researcher reached out to verify what he’d found in a different part of the codebase. After spending the week digging around and verifying his findings, on Friday night I sat down with a glass of wine and decided to dig into something I was curious about. While there has been lots of speculation about what Yandex could do with the massive amounts of data it collects, this is the first time outsiders have been able to peek behind the curtain to confirm it, and what I’ve found is both fascinating and deeply unsettling.</p>

<p>Yandex is Russia’s largest search engine and the massive platform has over 90 other services under its umbrella, including a browser, mail service, cloud platform, maps, and smart devices with Alice, Yandex’s smart assistant. The primary services that we are going to be focusing on are <a href="https://appmetrica.yandex.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AppMetrica</a>, which is Yandex’s app/web analytics service, Crypta, which analyzes user data to identify important user characteristics for generating ad segments, and <a href="https://audience.yandex.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Audiences</a>, which allows users to pull data from several sources to generate their own targeted segments. Most of Yandex’s services are based in Russia but its parent company, Yandex N.V. is based in The Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/russian-internet-giant-yandex-grants-veto-powers-kremlin-linked-body" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yandex granted a “golden share”</a> to the Kremlin-linked Public Interest Foundation (PIF) to “defend the country's interests”. According to <span>The Guardian, </span>Putin has previously expressed concern with “preventing the private data of Russian citizens from falling into foreign hands” and limiting “foreign ownership in strategic tech firms.” The "golden share" gave the PIF “a veto over key company decisions” and the power “to temporarily remove Yandex’s management, block a potential acquisition of the company, and nominate two permanent board members.” The Kremlin has long recognized the importance of Yandex holding vast amounts of Russian user data and has sought to control where it can be sent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, 2022, that dynamic began to flip as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/warnings-raised-over-russian-tech-giant-yandexs-uk-operation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Western countries began to express concern</span></a> about their citizens’ data being sent to Russian servers. Keir Giles, a senior Russia fellow at Chatham House, told <span>The Guardian</span>, “The problem arises when it is a hostile state that wishes to cause us damage and is interested in specific individuals they wish to track in this country…It has the potential to be weaponised against anybody. Do we want, at a time when Russia is considering the UK as an enemy, to be providing all our personal details to a server in Moscow?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2022, the<span> Financial Times</span> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/data-harvesting-code-in-mobile-apps-sends-user-data-to-russias-google/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published findings</a> by privacy researcher Zach Edwards that sounded the alarm about Yandex’s AppMetrica SDK sending app analytics data to Yandex servers in Russia. The SDK is reportedly installed in hundreds of millions of apps globally, including VPNs and apps targeting Ukrainian users. Yandex pushed back that they asked users for consent but experts suggested the SDK merely piggy-backed on the consent the app had obtained. According to the article, ‘“Yandex has acknowledged its software collects “device, network and IP address” information … but it called this data “non-personalised and very limited”. It added: “Although theoretically possible, in practice it is extremely hard to identify users based solely on such information collected. Yandex definitely cannot do this.”’</p>
<p>At the same time, <span>TechCrunch</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/russia-yandex-news-vk/"><span>reported</span></a> that Yandex faced increased pressure from the Russian government, through strict media laws, to spread propaganda about war in Ukraine, while its executives faced sanctions from the EU over spreading that disinformation. Jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/yandex-sells-news-zen-vk/"><span>said in a series of very spicy tweets</span></a> that Yandex’s claim of displaying “News” on its homepage was a “solid shameless lie”. According to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/04/1070352/ukraine-war-russia-tech-industry-yandex-skolkovo/"><span>an article</span></a> from <span>MIT Technology Review</span>, at this time, "Some 70% of the information on Yandex News was coming from state-controlled media sources pushing propaganda”.&nbsp; A former Yandex executive, Grigory Bakunov, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/yandex-sells-news-zen-vk/"><span>suggested</span></a> that Yandex backed itself into this corner by being naive to how the tools they were building could be appropriated and gamed by the Russian government. Yandex, along with other Russian media companies, decided it was smarter to restructure and sell off their politically inconvenient assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By April, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/yandex-engineers-flee-to-turkey-georgia-as-putin-tightens-grip-2022-4"><span>tens of thousands of engineers</span></a>, including several of Yandex’s, had fled the country. According to <span>MIT Technology Review</span>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/04/1070352/ukraine-war-russia-tech-industry-yandex-skolkovo/"><span>government figures showed</span></a> that “about 100,000 IT specialists left Russia in 2022, or some 10% of the tech workforce—a number that is likely an underestimate.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, its CEO, Arkady Volozh, stepped down <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/yandex-ceo-volozh-resigns-after-eu-sanctions-2022-06-03/"><span>after being targeted by EU sanctions</span></a>. There does not appear to be a replacement CEO, leaving control of Yandex to its board.</p>
<p>In August, Yandex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/yandex-news-zen-vk-binding-sale/"><span>finally reached a deal</span></a> to sell its media products News, Zen, and, very surprisingly, the homepage (yandex.ru) to Russian state controlled social media company VK, in exchange for sole ownership of VK’s food delivery app. If you visit yandex.ru now, it redirects to dzen.ru. VK was the obvious potential buyer from the start but the delay in the sale was rumored to be the result of the "golden share", which gave the PIF power to block any potential acquisitions. It’s not clear whether that sale would have included the user data that the News and Zen apps had access to.</p>
<p><span><span>In November, Yandex’s Dutch holding/parent company Yandex N.V. </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/yandex-parent-review-ownership-russian-tech-giant-seek-divestment-2022-11-25/">announced plans</a><span> to "divest ownership and control of most of Yandex Group" and "said in a statement it was reviewing options to 'restructure the group's ownership and governance in light of the current geopolitical environment.'" </span><em><span>Reuters</span></em><span> also </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-kudrin-touch-future-yandex-late-night-meeting-sources-2022-11-25/">reported</a><span> that Putin and his ally, former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, held a late night meeting to discuss the future of Yandex and Kudrin’s potential role in it. In December, Kudrin confirmed that he would be joining Yandex to take on the role of Adviser on Corporate Development, to advise on the restructuring.</span></span></p>
<p>In late January 2023, the Yandex source code was leaked on <em>BreachForums</em>. Software engineer Arseniy Shestakov <a href="https://arseniyshestakov.com/2023/01/26/yandex-services-source-code-leak/"><span>confirmed</span></a> from current and past Yandex employees that the leak is real and reflects code likely dating to the start of war in Ukraine in February 2022. That would mean that someone effectively archived this data on the day Russia invaded Ukraine and held onto it for 11 months. However, the <em>BreachForums</em> post said it dated back to July 2022. I found some Jupyter Notebooks in the Analysis section of Crypta that show outputs with test data dated July 2022, which would align with what the original poster suggested. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/yandex-denies-hack-blames-source-code-leak-on-former-employee/"><span>Yandex confirmed the leak</span></a> but denied that it was hacked, instead blaming it on a former employee, and dismissed that it was a threat to its users or performance.&nbsp;</p>
<h6><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/yandex-denies-hack-blames-source-code-leak-on-former-employee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n3Bg-pj7Ce0mAU7kqQVNI16G37KhwcJLHGXlppzXOWHpbO53YHbkWdSgYWyVcQqG-ZfK6f6kRGcIjV4qBf3E9KQOHjPTIaJnKywAJ_Rhp---4OJQor4JkpfjdTvOHIleBfXDYrK-S20uCthwhm4zFhM" width="622" height="318" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot courtesy of BleepingComputer"></span></a></h6>

<p>At the time of writing, Yandex is still up for sale. Multiple oligarchs have <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/05/04/russian-billionaires-line-up-to-buy-yandex-reports-a81033"><span>expressed interest</span></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-billionaires-bid-stake-yandexs-local-assets-bloomberg-news-2023-05-19/"><span>placed bids</span></a>. In June 2023, <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/06/23/bad-billionaires"><span>Putin approved a bid</span></a> from a “consortium of billionaires” and VTB Bank, but the deal appears to have been rejected by Yandex’s board over sanctions risks, and may also have had something to do with Russian regulations reportedly requiring “foreigners selling their Russian assets to do so at a discount of at least 50 percent. The Kremlin has also imposed a new 10-percent tax on all such transactions.” As of now there are rumors that if a sale cannot be negotiated, nationalization “<a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/07/17/russian-tech-giant-yandex-seeks-new-middlemen-buyers-for-kremlin-handover-reports-a81864"><span>is a very real scenario.</span></a>”</p>
<p>Yandex still seems to be facing internal tensions, because despite Kudrin’s role, in June <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russias-yandex-fined-refusing-share-user-information-with-security-services-2023-06-18/"><span>Yandex was fined</span></a> 2 million roubles in a Moscow court for refusing to share user information with the Federal Security Service (FSB). It will be interesting to see if that resistance changes if Putin approved buyers (or nationalization) succeed. Indeed, Meduza <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/08/08/user-x-with-driver-y-traveled-from-point-a-to-point-b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just reported</a> that because of a new order signed by Russia's Prime Minister, as of September 1, 2023, Yandex will be required to provide the FSB with constant access to data related to its taxi services, many of which operate internationally. Interestingly the reporting also revealed that Yandex stores all of its global customer data in Russia and is not able to separate the Russian data from international data, and that in 2019, according to Yandex's own disclosures, it satisfied about 84% of official requests to share user data with the government.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Codebase</h2>
<p>The code in the Yandex leak is broken down by service. It’s written in a mix of Russian and English, <a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/data-breaches/369966/yandex-data-breach-reveals-source-code-littered-with-racist-language"><span>and reporters have also noted uses of racist language in comments</span></a>. A variety of coding languages are used but primarily Python, C++, and YQL (Yandex Query Language, a flavor of SQL). The leak contained just the code, not a true git repository that would have shown version history, and a few Jupyter Notebooks with data outputs (which appear to be from test and pre-production environments). That means it is possible to say, or make an educated guess, about what the code does, but it isn’t possible to say for sure what portions of the code were actually run or are run currently. I sorted through the Metrika and Crypta source code manually, but there are several portions of Yandex code that I have not had a chance to dig into and hope to in the future.</p>
<h3>Metrika</h3>
<p>The server-side AppMetrica data is processed in a service called Metrika, which encompasses the data from the mobile SDK (the SDK itself <a href="https://github.com/yandexmobile/metrica-sdk-ios"><span>is open source</span></a>) and desktop analytics (<a href="https://metrica.yandex.com/"><span>Yandex Metrica</span></a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some of the raw data fields that AppMetrica logs. Remember that Yandex reportedly said&nbsp;that the data it collects is “non-personalised and very limited”? That does not seem to be the case. You can see in the path at the top that this selection of fields is going into something called an “anonymizer”. But nothing about this level of detail is anonymized when it gets to this point in AppMetrica’s servers, and it never truly gets effectively anonymized.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m25pv_SHqkrG-wc_Sn4DvS7NXb0lYUCTr4VbZId9BQ8cmUwxYIt5S5R0jZ9Db78fqJQLpFv1yc4BLdPcxdXAIP2SWdyp5I-isq-MGCAUOgh_3ouu4SAety5uNutz427Y_9l_MtiFf9xggKZJCASRZUw" width="621" height="388" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>To start with, the unique identifiers at the top of the list (zoomed in below) are getting hashed. That’s nice, and theoretically anonymizing, but they’re still going to be very unique and therefore uniquely identifying (likely more so than before because of the entropy the hashing algorithm adds). This will make incoming data easy to match probabilistically with other data about this device as it comes in, because all the service has to do is hash any incoming identifiers and see if the outputs match. The ability to preserve privacy while allowing new data to be associated with existing data is a major appeal of this anonymization strategy.<span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4XMxwWw6LtcannSbYIgQD8ii6a--VAe4EZfjkvNTPYJ_FJNv-nB-I4rwA7gXzsiTwhetkaQwyyx6GkJAOu5Cy6iJVywuw7pDJIpRBG7DuMl-EZePV1j6uMhDzQNBDQseWIK1jDYh_gYJu_mBImyCxGw" width="617" height="111" loading="lazy"><span></span></p>
<p>AppMetrica is taking in some very precise location data. It’s not that uncommon for app analytics to take in latitude/longitude so that growth and marketing teams can see where the app is being used. What is less normal is taking in a user’s altitude, direction, and speed, which together with a timestamp, provides a disturbingly accurate picture of a user’s movements. Unless the app being used is a fitness or run tracker, or something like Pokemon Go, there aren’t a lot of use cases that justify taking in that data, let alone storing it for AppMetrica’s supposed target audience. With this information, if someone is using your app in an airplane, you could see how high it’s flying, in what direction, at what speed, and possibly predict where it’s going next. That seems like overkill for a growth and marketing team.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QmYY7UnNA1w6ed69fLl2L4Vscr884CYjj7vNU5hQaLNseMknWjV_Uf_d189hOaCKv9a799dL9fmSVUmXH_r4NCm9XeGp9Pf70-pJXLmrX435oMg7sIxhv4_-ehRf140JCBrJ7rHk6IgzQ9tj0pAC2AQ" width="622" height="544" loading="lazy"><span></span></p>
<p>Now let’s take a quick look at how Yandex uses the wifi fields AppMetrica collects. A wifi SSID is the name of a wifi network, so if you’re connected to your home or office network right now, that would be your SSID.<span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WCwj85e1NknZrY2_VptslLW6kWzllL0GSIWTwphzAHH1g4Ua8B1NWNjzYWwn2JYLHax5ak7lpIzMRNv--gTNp1PMPzZngwmEXLsCtzU-ULoAl72gyI79TT3_krbFB7K9AMDjqtpNXftFAg83soQnCew" width="623" height="231" loading="lazy"><span></span></p>
<p>Here are those same fields being used in Crypta. This process selects the `DeviceID` and `OriginalDeviceId`, and whether either of these fields are hashed or not at this point is unclear. It also selects several of the above Wifi fields, and thanks to the hashed or unhashed device id, they are attached to a unique identifier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0CoRwG3OyhG3kqLRsRqhP_1gd8-EA0ZR4EXy0mraaxR-atb3DZhKxgQQrF85qKJVfk191WuakD6nrKxOnwX2Ut7oJCv3xC4DWvXajA7LvCI2xzE_1siDaUFpsfDUIX80_PVVJzJOT-yGphGxQiYVaqw" width="620" height="232" loading="lazy"></span><span></span></p>
<p>Here, still in Crypta, both Device ID and SSID are being matched to a Yandex ID, which will be used to associate any data corresponding to them with several other pools of data Crypta processes. One possible motive to select both fields is that an SSID might have multiple devices associated with it, which could indicate a user with multiple devices, or a household.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9Eb510ju1QPEILE-VrVs2H8vUcFw7M54HBV42l2Yid0sys2H9M891LbbpMcaaiew-u1xOdNEav2IlUY0tYTq2VLId9ZuCLA4xGHBhrRD8ne6oUo-xBBI_CgVTXCT0obzcHnq-D90y3FE2Zy5dC1lpjo" width="624" height="294" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Moving back in the codebase to Metrika, below we have identifiers that come in through a click event, being matched with any ids, hashed two ways or unhashed, until a match is found in the system. This enables that event to be associated with the correct consumer or household. For example, it compares the plain `AndroidId`, the MD5 hash of it, and the SHA1 hash of it. The `Fingerprint` is generated using some of the raw fields seen in the first list, like `ClientIP` and `OSVersion`. Even after anonymization, this data can still be used to identify matches, which is how anonymization is supposed to work. Anonymization should preserve both privacy and functionality. However having what appears to be both hashed and unhashed data types floating around in the same tools undermines that anonymization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QxHOxFxUoSenKSv4KiBmXf-TUXoqrMi-7OfBZyyE9qD2yLKX_5n0fROkHOXcEdjU8wrj7E4ZKWhbHMvhVGLy-8g7NB4BoM5vVfLp4TroQm-l4tZG4f5YEq3X4W9qX4yGxmc1qsZSdbrEaGrqiT-rF0w" width="622" height="512" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>As new information for a consumer comes in, user socio-demographic attributes are updated as needed. The basic attributes shown here are age band (they do have exact age in other parts of the system but it’s a nice attempt at generalizing for privacy purposes) and sex (only male or female). They are both associated with Device ID, which has to get hashed before it’s sent over the buffer, suggesting it was processed and stored unhashed, which is, again, pretty inconsistent and therefore ineffective anonymization.<span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UtFzKrPWN3cgrLUe6uTOZ6aCU_oPA49SK_JtvFY1byyIZrRpZmMxCRG_BlXRLn0DiE6OIxtLtwCsWJD7xni10sdbedWv-jHjOZUXqgITPSDFcKQbQEqNB5vTeZ-AxFIgiEPZC495oXYKc_bzx4NpVSs" width="544" height="555" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Metrika also contains code related to Yandex’s Audiences product which allows users to generate segments for targeted advertising or user profiles using data from AppMetrica, Data Brokers, or uploading their own data. In the first two cases, consumers who end up in the segment don’t have to have used the customer’s product, it can be used to generate fresh leads.</p>
<h3>Crypta</h3>
<p>Crypta is Yandex’s behavioral analytics service, which creates demographic segments for very specific ad targeting, specifically Yandex Ads. It takes data points from all over Yandex’s services and combines it with inferences determined from analyzing behavioral data to create holistic profiles which it uses to create very specific ad segments. Part of the reason that it takes data from all over Yandex’s services is that Yandex places ads all over its services. For example, while using Yandex Navigator, if a user is stopped in traffic, Yandex will start displaying ads.<span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XgIokhUYvWsjJ8rLWNGS6vg6VrqseHTPpYKp6Cfcst0EaO68Hdi4-tDRqimkquv9okvP_UNtau2CJMlsKdZPCSvtRK_UGSb4VWqvfjOG11lZ2dA8B4756L2Bmh3GIHTySXIcq8tIacWefHTbB8F-n5U" width="622" height="307" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Here are some examples of the segments Crypta generates:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/z1X-chlxJFLvv8DmbSFQ__OsffB_N8sghoSHsgB_i7gCROWGl1Xm1GU35HLQUzEcUoD8jDEPz5cMN969E8geMTlJ7jAhgbhwRbWjcUcpzHtwE1amcOMdAOGo4OULBKW-KGcxZWcjCG1zWFhjyaczEhw" width="621" height="328" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The Smokers segment seems to track users who purchase specific smoking products, like e-cigarettes and tobacco. Summer residents uses geolocation data to track which users have dachas (summer homes) and how often they visit them.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nyIqec4EW4i0pfiNYKwnKPbldkVKyGxiyhGSaqHJlAJdWA-WUIEqPQxmK2LWwKAeovq9KY2zz26qVuWmVdeiAmrjC1LSNN9fkrugF3rEjT0Clbo4_Jzv3J4k0PljjBo_UdkZxsuCio9XtIh8nIpRNps" width="623" height="310" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>“Travellers” uses geolocation to track whether a user has traveled from their main region, which Crypta has already determined, to another, and classifies it as domestic or international.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ix7bfMCaugihBKP-hYDSpESnDJJYEkmu_xUkbRyD-Bg4Edmeaz90CiyXOXddAKXukfaqxoDSdLi5M9uY31DuJj0rKTb3teBkKHHKlIzmbIc58_rqE-EH3qXXrjyqg48sUQI2_tSUcVLAtrB9sDbrei4" width="621" height="311" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Mail data appears to pull from email data to track whether a user has any boarding passes, plane tickets or hotel confirmations.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ojMMti31_UGPyeCyBh9ttbzdVOnZT1xwexILkKX_XjfdTSeVsViwslbyYufyxbkYXyjs0ibvjea4ypb7bMmT13c8TJireNf2LJIWu9wI2gGSDyAoZ47FiEK2lQ6fdmchQc8ePXcF0XqARGR0zGOhkVw" width="621" height="424" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The gas station segment seems to track whether a user has visited a gas station.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Fa00eO2c7cZ0UPzjGPBm10VSPD6s_AGKsqamAGqnY4GVGgGg9vf29u8VI6qWcJl1Ilb5z4QodAkse44Ix4udeTeZfuC8DYKK0QMerSm9kEs9iCj61vAbr5MHdH8lQaZ-l480Oiw8oNXmtCcY5ktHZsA" width="624" height="425" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>If Yandex can make these segments it seems pretty plausible that anyone with access to their data could take the same data points and create a segment like “Young Men of Military Age Planning to Leave Russia” or generate segments based around vices and blackmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The below section appears to outline some basic machine learning model training. It seems to leverage some first party data because it knows whether a user did business at the legal office or showed up to their medical clinic appointment or bought something at the pharmacy when it tracks so-called “deep conversions”.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VL5Mb_6TLru8YYNCo5dO1HL4aAMEEpW_2ex31LSxK_A3RFuH3kCQVojn57BkRVOz19lIiaFgOAHJw6Alzt6cKxNzNewovtaQbtajpfe83NxaD61Z8H4fEz_HbU8IQ66XvrkHINV9pJyRLJkecWAz-YA" width="366" height="595" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>This is a very basic example of a household composition stored in Crypta: household id, size, gender, any elderly, any children, but of course Yandex has much more precise information than that.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wi4rT72zCQ0m7Vqc46D8orbI9I6fFzafT6jdoaisQ4yHAWAfNwFOtbxuWrKXq86LR8kqoGY1PvWPY3JlGnmJlv3yODo2-iLaKAATwrk8o2ENLBWU4K3zOEHwI64CDF8tuV0jS8BYKFv2GTehPBEOC7Y" width="602" height="536" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Here is another example of Crypta using AppMetrica wifi data, associated with Device ID, this time tracking connection types for a segment.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DdDseNDOKcONupZ_Nz_u01sf76gcUWikPX0bmq_4MRDVATTx_9-IfhBW1dQJY6sPMStqK1z-YYSBq9ctVEOhpArvwZj_fcqSq8Ofb6tkf81vlFc6lSeJteoyeXdJ-_7tQsd7AIS0BeRfy40Fq_fcg_I" width="428" height="534" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>AppMetrica SSIDs are being used for processing here to presumably deduplicate user records&nbsp; associated with a common wifi access point.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L0PSN6edo2Gn5pm9zUNXQjGLy__aISjhiJdwnOtwJ2vq-S-ABnmCLyLZAnSr6uf2KBUlY1oOcvKYUsW4S25ZsMb-Z9swinsvJRsac-b6N-Hb62QQvNVXBgomYUo4TQtkmW2xawEX5W6uEGWl7EvtWCk" width="622" height="206" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q2TyQi82JYYXwFv11kVAsrBOEu5E80udQZijQVMTL9EggcC-ukFtmeggTGUCcRnx_6EmUb4mAFH04rvfyHzlDy_1EUqibqHlW9HOueB2zMB_Ym42s8Yb_AGjXfESFS1c5NWe8xx_RGOu6PYLuP1PGas" width="580" height="467" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>These are some examples of data pools that Crypta uses for processing for the purposes of its fuzzy matching in graphs. Crypta pulls from email login data, geolocation data for home and work locations, household data, Reqans data (which appears to be search data), and yet again, SSIDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MVmtXcxCOEnbfmWcqOTBftmuOnZYfSH08Bk8KBcKuaTT8IYgvky1ZWEJpW5AKKkSrt2cg2O-QOEOIZyTGTyDmgKu5T9Ybr9gSMZpSMXvu-NKHa1xg1Mc3VgJPfs4Kg_MOuWMm_o3NPPNHVnEuaNfIlo" width="620" height="259" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This is an example of processing the email login data. Email addresses and logins are associated here with Yandex IDs. This means that once any “anonymized” data from AppMetrica is connected to a Yandex ID, Crypta can associate with email and login information, effectively reidentifying it. This is very convenient for law enforcement.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/e5_evztF63y_hVum9CROR_S1mcWvH_9QJrIs0U8nE4sSpP4F4MWlUQZWSdSa2B6Nfi6Idu69senaLzn7GB4Elt2rXlXx0FjMcVO7WEU11BouGYwuPusRblFLgw2_cujTqRqW8wcy7Fm4FPG1hXEIf7I" width="623" height="511" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Here Crypta appears to be trying to pull every type of identifier this developer could think of.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qDUV00XA33f9yIhkPFccpDrClEekbCk-3zgGtWiG2rsJsEDx9qn3N0eTFXwhkiuHBIjsf56-GSxyntXqSOTX797FHD4-KS8Y7O-B79QbEf_SVyD9kda-aNdXcQjo61mhQ1eT5TlLW1WQjE7sAwEenDQ" width="622" height="340" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Yandex uses a “Passport” system to create one Yandex login to rule them all, which can log you in across all Yandex apps and services. This form takes first name, last name, and phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PYKDnssZgM3QoObYDQGdo4EEgpLQrBp9mg9p3sMg5gUAqcDTRH8nzwXlNL4znXJ-KO6xpdnv_MSExE4HLH3jOaGC25k9DOr0hrxmJlJ2O0lKSz1uiu6CxsZ7VlcsuKJj7HXpdinTiIVX1K_w0b2MxuI" width="621" height="380" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Crypta has data from Passport. Here it takes the Passport User ID and matches it to a phone number. The presence of a PASSPORT_PROFILE source type also suggests that that first and last name might be accessible as well, but I did not find any examples of that data being used by Crypta. The fact that there is a source called PASSPORT_PHONE_DUMP suggests that these phone numbers are being extracted at a large scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rEQIhfGwvPxEO7T3nPh_q6ou4TAuFbLceUW7dfOvx5MAxtGKhJleSmQpUchCeLbR5a70YAb-6ksL_LhKXpYyNxPbC0CeE1UrLMFGgtRNg4XEL1HePRx0SGXDwdRRcab-Gh-UG5PiGQE8--ZuQUVvCyU" width="627" height="221" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>One interesting perk of having a codebase is the test data that it comes with. Here you can see a mock up of possible data from Passport for testing purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/P3ztYFp52xJWeMsGL7l490Wi5L-Kv1usBq7-Hxz8Z5ZZvlA-6-sxq_vKnj2rfmpOy-FWRiGGulWLfVNLUxR0lUXH_kNQLfQg2hWFKokB2PuhCpYQzirO3bmAzZWrGe2SZ4IJF1bK3pxiU2S9TQv2IYc" width="623" height="534" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Another example of processing that happens in the graphs section, is taking the latitude and longitude of a user’s predicted home, associated with that user’s Yandex ID, and plotting it on a geo graph.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UGwqcRWO8sRY0IcjxYTlxslC7A_JIDz55gdpwTyhgANg0utt_S9mE0MSF0Yf-2Mcz_XIfZAlZOC06OVbn42jL5unQiqWyF7FAT_L8mIoFSg5vDauehTitPeymaYot-S0b37iy09FfmY92I9LvNtCcdY" width="623" height="369" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Which it then uses to find and plot that user’s (actual not just k) neighbors and their Yandex IDs.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n0ubwxnG1kGWUtnul3Dwnn7m5ppeOzWEl7UeVtDrgqAVA828NLg5pK_kW7Nfc8uedGIv28yrC-325-IIEo2zPnSUwaN35iW2uQPLvDlUkwmGE_eH_Ws3gjKQvu6PenWfJ8yJdaiam2guH6ylRIUEItU" width="624" height="402" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>The process below shows multiple Yandex products being used by Crypta in a fairly creepy way. This screenshot is part of a very long process that involves pulling children and ages from search data based on visits to certain sites, then from AppMetrica, and from the Taxi app, and pulling it all together to create a holistic picture of how many children are in a given household.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/x1OFRlRVKq-JGjykLkjwFkmPcbXS_gSPKedf18Q3KntLdJvI79viCyR5kvet5TocqNdMwcOTSBybKTA7VHovWS0gez9U1dFzBkhdRJKYEKmriB6sIjyFX9Y4igXp2-4KLlMO0NFY9fXOEtcwbZeghQI" width="477" height="490" loading="lazy"></span></p>

<p>If we zoom in on this last section you can see that once you have one kind of ID, whether it’s Household, Passport, Crypta ID, or Yandex ID, you have them all and all of the identifying data associated with them. Which, given the email addresses, phone numbers, household data, and geo data, is pretty effective for re-identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OxIl8cLal5PYRTa6OMLQU7qydjvFT2U1HZezobfAI4g4ywOf8DuOs5LYDuVZtbi00MhTZYoiHC1WQi8QIH1g6xXsvZpPKZUm2hODNZfclzy02WYaYeNIyB0Y6ixua6g7sxCXBoEU9txfD5qI9UxRUVI" width="625" height="318" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Crypta profiles integrate biometric data, most likely from smart speakers that use Yandex’s Alice smart assistant. This smart assistant is supposed to be able to interact appropriately with kids, like playing games or making up fairy tales.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oyz84n0UmHwuv3mn-AwVADrjo3DyuyjWH--Ne1d4bAgomlYvbBSG09mUoUmt9yX8GWq46znt5kTtFgeylNvtMcRNxkmAqXX7MtXOKl7p3KiipCSip4dtnjJbEuPJOP4pAd7ERnXMZtrS_WlKuqJ4n9U" width="617" height="382" loading="lazy"></span></p>

<p>Crypta uses biometric data to identify children and their age range by voice, to further build out the household’s profile for use in ads. That voice biometric data is presumably from the Alice product. It’s not unreasonable for a voice activated product that is supposed to interact appropriately with children to be able to identify their voices, but this isn’t within the Alice app or that function. This data is getting sent outside of that app to Crypta for behavioral analytics to generate ad segments. The section also indicates that socio-demographic data includes actual birth dates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/m04LxL8nZ0bnAWXlBC4_NsQp1xDj_ka_88MITjYyf0D87AfBwBZhQ2Z8Cx6XvSvbUuKAuQYdN24ywwPvMxL_nKrthGI104lY3kVL-zRdM_RE8vkl4yLBT3ufj8VBbJI0bzo-CIaFagnz9I0zXTkIRIc" width="517" height="543" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Crypta has code for a User Interface (UI) portal to display some of its household and user profile information. This BasicInfographicsCard shows marital status, income, has children, and three icons for interests. In case you were wondering what those interests are, below the list of available icons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These individual profiles can be searched by Crypta or Yandex ID, suggesting that Crypta is not just aggregating these segments, but instead making it possible to search for more information on individual consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a list of available app icons, further illustrating the breadth of data sources Yandex has available to associate with individual consumer profiles.</p>

<p>To further build out these profiles, Yandex appears to be able to associate all of the below identifiers to social media accounts like instagram, facebook, and VK.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Matcher</h3>
<p>Matcher is a section of Crypta’s code that syncs fingerprinting events with four major Russian telecoms providers and Intent.ai, outside of Yandex’s own assets. One of these providers, Rostelecom, is Russian state-owned and also provides broadband service to Crimea. This means that fingerprinting events that are synced with this provider through Crypta could be accessible to parts of the Russian state.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nmhUkI3-KhKBWhJs0JZPiC0--r0ST84VC4D60REmbxHZQxVw593Lirtx3Cupw2rHcG3TtxdOxJ5Xkoda8CK93A1dD12stxg4L359-bIYpvjLaVY2M869_MVGMWXe1MmFYSVKFksTbxKWh0bDrsKvY6o" width="622" height="347" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The matcher builds a connection to Rostelecom’s API and passes in a Fingerprint Event. Rostelecom then takes the information from that fingerprint and attempts to match it to a user in its own system. If it finds a match, it returns the ID that Rostelecom has for that user.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The AppMetrica SDKs give Yandex a very broad international reach of data subjects and Yandex has been evasive and misleading about how that data is used. While the data points collected up front are fairly disturbing, that data can say so much more about you when it’s matched and analyzed with other pre-existing data a company already has access to. Yandex makes a few gestures towards anonymization but they are ineffective because hashing isn’t used consistently, and more importantly they collect data that could easily re-identify a user and make sure it is all firmly associated (they refer to it as glueing) through a chain of ids and segments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The matcher process is clear evidence that at least some of the data collected by Yandex could be synced with Russian state owned entities. Yandex also appears to be very, very close to becoming state controlled or nationalized, and it is about to be required to share international user data from its taxi services with the FSB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your company runs an app, pay attention to who runs your SDKs, what data points they may collect and where they are sending your users’ data. Yandex claimed it gets consent through the apps and that it only gets the data app developers choose to send it, throwing the blame right at its partners' doorsteps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a consumer, know that nothing is guaranteed to stay harmless forever. Maybe you trust this app with your data now, but how will you feel when that app gets sold to a company you don’t trust? Or if that company is headquartered in a country that becomes hostile to yours? Or its government starts making concerning demands to turn over user data? In theory you should be able to take your data back if you live in a jurisdiction that requires companies to respect data deletion requests, but the insights derived from that data might be considered that company's work product and not included in that deletion. In the case of the AppMetrica SDKs, you might not even realize a company has your data because they are quietly embedded in another company's app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a former executive pointed out, Yandex got itself into a situation where the Russian state gamed the News algorithms until it was effectively 70% state sponsored propaganda, because they built a tool without considering the risk of how it could be abused by the Russian government. That is how we should think about Yandex's ad tech ecosystem. Yandex built a massive system of data collection and analysis, that commingles Russian and international user data, and it is very likely about to be handed to the Kremlin on a silver platter. The Russian government could do a lot of harm with it. In 2019, <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/08/08/user-x-with-driver-y-traveled-from-point-a-to-point-b#:~:text=A%20year%20later,of%20that%20data." rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yandex turned over taxi data</a> that "<span>helped the authorities&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thebell.io/po-zvonku-ili-po-zaprosu-kak-yandeks-taksi-vydaet-politsii-dannye-polzovatelej" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fabricate</a><span>&nbsp;a criminal case" against a Meduza journalist and revealed a confidential office location.</span> Is improving ad targeting and personalized user experiences really worth the risk of building tools that could be exploited in this way?&nbsp;</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 10:08:10 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/10/workplace_monitoring_select_committee/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/10/workplace_monitoring_select_committee/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37074095">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Companies that monitor their employees should only do so after they consult with and get consent from the staffers they are watching or tracking.</p>
<p>That's according to a report published this week after a year-long inquiry by the department <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/08/uk_beis_split/">formerly known as DCMS</a> into the harms and benefits of connected technologies.</p>
<p>The report also adds that the government should "commission research to improve the evidence base regarding the deployment of automated and data collection systems at work."</p>

    

<p>It cites research from Oxford University's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/a-fairwork-foundation-towards-fair-work-in-the-platform-economy/">Fairwork Project</a> based at the OII, with Dr Matthew Cole testifying that "micro-determination of time and movement tracking through connected devices, which had been introduced to improve productivity, such as in warehouses, had also led to workers feeling alienated and experiencing increased stress and anxiety."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Unless there is a union that is litigating around these things or an existing collective bargaining agreement, there is a lack of enforcement at the state level</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile Dr Asieh Tabaghdehi, a senior lecturer in Strategy and Business Economics at Brunel University London, told the committee that connected tech can lead to "better and more efficient production."</p>
<p>To no one's surprise, Amazon jumped in to argue for monitoring employees in the workplace, the committee noted. It stated that "robotics, machine learning and other technologies" in its fulfilment centers had "reduced the physical burden on employees, reducing walking time and taking on repetitive tasks, and freed them up to focus on more sophisticated tasks beyond the scope of automation."</p>

        


        

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/11989/html/">Evidence</a> from Oxford University's <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/a-fairwork-foundation-towards-fair-work-in-the-platform-economy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fairwork Project</a> cited in the report also notes that the UK GDPR provides a "certain degree of protection for private individuals. However, it is more limited in protecting workers in the workplace."</p>
<p>OII researcher Dr Matthew Cole noted in his evidence that: "Unless there is a union that is litigating around these things or an existing collective bargaining agreement, there is a lack of enforcement at the state level. The UK government could do much better at ensuring protections for worker data and protecting citizens of the UK from global giants like Uber, for example."</p>

        

<p>He added: "There are a few provisions there that specifically deal with subject-access requests and protect workers against algorithmic decision-making, like hiring and firing purely by algorithm, but there is a lack of enforcement."</p>
<h3>What are UK-based workers' rights currently?</h3>
<p>According to current guidance from the government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/monitoring-work-workers-rights/email-cctv-and-other-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">outlining</a> employees' rights in relation to being monitored at work, "Employers must explain the amount of monitoring clearly in the staff handbook or contract." And according to recent ICO guidance, still in draft form, not only do companies need to tell workers that they are being monitored, they need to outline what counts as a "reasonable number of personal emails and phone calls", and if personal emails and calls are not allowed, they need to say so at the outset. Companies might be in breach of the Data Protection Act if they do not do so.</p>
<p>As for covert monitoring, where staff wouldn't be aware it was happening, the draft guidance says it is only allowed under "exceptional circumstances," employers need to be able to justify why it is necessary, and it can't be used to capture communications that workers would reasonably expect to be private, such as personal emails.</p>
<p>If you're not happy about being monitored, you should check your staff handbook or contract to see if the employer is allowed to do this, the gov.UK page advises. "If they're not, the worker might be able to resign and claim unfair ('constructive') dismissal."</p>
<p>The ICO's draft guidance also suggests companies "make sure workers understand what data is being processed during monitoring," and suggests setting up a system to ensure workers "remain aware that monitoring is being conducted."</p>

        

<p>This week's DCMS <a target="_blank" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/41099/documents/200210/default/">report</a>, titled "Connected tech: smart or sinister," recommends the Information Commissioner's Office should develop that existing <a target="_blank" href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/consultations/4021868/draft-monitoring-at-work-20221011.pdf">draft guidance</a> [PDF], "Employment practices: monitoring at work" into a principles-based code for designers and operators of workplace connected tech.</p>
<h3>'We are under constant cyberattack'</h3>
<p>The inquiry looked both at the privacy issues relating to data being gathered by connected tech, and the massive security challenge involved in securing the devices from attackers. It noted that "several features inherent to connected tech … may make it difficult for people to exercise their data rights. First, connected devices are often designed without an obvious or intuitive user interface, like a computer screen."</p>
<p>The Information Commissioner warned that "some of these are just sensors that are collecting and transmitting data about the user with no real ability for the user to meaningfully interact with it", which "does present a number of challenges."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/23/microsoft_highlights_productivity_paranoia/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>The report added: "The majority of submissions to our inquiry cited the risks of excessive surveillance and datafication and the impact on privacy as the primary challenges posed by connected technology."</p>
<p>Also cited was Google's David Kleidermacher, who discussed the extent of the challenge of cyber threats facing businesses in particular: "At Google, given the scale of the services and products that we offer across the world and given that literally every single day, in fact as we sit here right now, we are under constant cyberattack."</p>
<p>Kleidermacher said that while Google could afford to be proactive, most businesses simply had to live within their means and be reactive.</p>
<p>The report suggests the security issues be tackled through the upcoming Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Consumer bill, which makes a big ask – it actually requires that devices be secure by design, which might amuse anyone who's worked in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/21/us_oil_gas_cyber_threats/">SCADA</a> or been tasked with finding cheap webcams. It's a good move from previous voluntary codes of practice, said witnesses, though some argued the Bill did not go far enough in codifying best practice for manufacturers, importers and distributors.</p>

<h3>Why consult about surveillance? Employers and staff have an imbalance in power</h3>
<p>In evidence the Information Commissioner's Office submitted in the inquiry, it said:</p>

<p>Speaking of the ICO, the report has bad news. All that stuff the government plans to do that undermines the ICO's independence, the independence of comms regulator Ofcom, and tweaks made to the Online Safety Bill – it's all going to backfire.</p>
<h3>Data protection law tweaks – but why?</h3>
<p>The committee was vocal about powers the government wants to introduce for the Secretary of State in multiple places which would take away Parliamentary oversight of decisions taken. Reading between the lines, it's the fear the government could, in theory, adjust details – in favor of certain companies, for example – with no recourse to representatives in the form of the Commons and Lords.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/04/05/dataanalysis.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="data analysis"></p><h2 title="Amid inevitable talk of 'red tape' cutting at ruling party conference, data protection experts are concerned">Brexit dividend?

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/06/new_dcms_head_newly_independent/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>The report said the government had "not yet made a compelling case for reform of data protection."</p>
<p>"While we understand that some companies do not share data outside the UK, we are concerned that differing expectations between those companies and companies that do share data outside the UK may give the impression of 'lesser' protections for processing personal data in the UK overall."</p>
<p>The committee added:</p>

<p>The committee cited Trustee of the Carnegie UK Trust William Perrin, who argued that the powers delegated to the Secretary of State in the Online Safety Bill, as have been replicated in the Data Protection and Digital Information (No. 2) Bill, were:</p>

<p><em>The Reg</em> has approached the Cabinet Office for comment.</p>
<p>It also said the Government should commit to ensuring that the Age-Appropriate Design Code –&nbsp;preventing the leakage of data from IoT gadgets used by children – is "strengthened rather than undermined" by data protection reform.</p>
<p>Don't say they didn't warn us. ®</p>

<p dir="auto">To set up your environment, you will need to generate a <code>utils.py</code> file that contains your OpenAI API key and download the necessary packages.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 1. Generate Utils File</h3>
<p dir="auto">In the <code>reverie/backend_server</code> folder (where <code>reverie.py</code> is located), create a new file titled <code>utils.py</code> and copy and paste the content below into the file:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Copy and paste your OpenAI API Key
openai_api_key = &quot;<Your OpenAI API>&quot;
# Put your name
key_owner = &quot;<Name>&quot;

maze_assets_loc = &quot;../../environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets&quot;
env_matrix = f&quot;{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/matrix&quot;
env_visuals = f&quot;{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/visuals&quot;

fs_storage = &quot;../../environment/frontend_server/storage&quot;
fs_temp_storage = &quot;../../environment/frontend_server/temp_storage&quot;

collision_block_id = &quot;32125&quot;

# Verbose 
debug = True"><pre><code># Copy and paste your OpenAI API Key
openai_api_key = "&lt;Your OpenAI API&gt;"
# Put your name
key_owner = "&lt;Name&gt;"

maze_assets_loc = "../../environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets"
env_matrix = f"{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/matrix"
env_visuals = f"{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/visuals"

fs_storage = "../../environment/frontend_server/storage"
fs_temp_storage = "../../environment/frontend_server/temp_storage"

collision_block_id = "32125"

# Verbose 
debug = True
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Replace <code>&lt;Your OpenAI API&gt;</code> with your OpenAI API key, and <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> with your name.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 2. Install requirements.txt</h3>
<p dir="auto">Install everything listed in the <code>requirements.txt</code> file (I strongly recommend first setting up a virtualenv as usual). A note on Python version: we tested our environment on Python 3.9.12.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9d2f0842910c93751efe0f7b34c41c4cea8e228f6392f117136cec9e87f88fc/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f4b6c6175735f4d75656c6c65722e706e67"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9d2f0842910c93751efe0f7b34c41c4cea8e228f6392f117136cec9e87f88fc/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f4b6c6175735f4d75656c6c65722e706e67" alt="Generative Klaus" data-canonical-src="https://joonsungpark.s3.amazonaws.com:443/static/assets/characters/profile/Klaus_Mueller.png"></a>   Running a Simulation</h2>
<p dir="auto">To run a new simulation, you will need to concurrently start two servers: the environment server and the agent simulation server.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 1. Starting the Environment Server</h3>
<p dir="auto">Again, the environment is implemented as a Django project, and as such, you will need to start the Django server. To do this, first navigate to <code>environment/frontend_server</code> (this is where <code>manage.py</code> is located) in your command line. Then run the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python manage.py runserver"><pre><code>python manage.py runserver
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, on your favorite browser, go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/</a>. If you see a message that says, "Your environment server is up and running," your server is running properly. Ensure that the environment server continues to run while you are running the simulation, so keep this command-line tab open! (Note: I recommend using either Chrome or Safari. Firefox might produce some frontend glitches, although it should not interfere with the actual simulation.)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 2. Starting the Simulation Server</h3>
<p dir="auto">Open up another command line (the one you used in Step 1 should still be running the environment server, so leave that as it is). Navigate to <code>reverie/backend_server</code> and run <code>reverie.py</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">This will start the simulation server. A command-line prompt will appear, asking the following: "Enter the name of the forked simulation: ". To start a 3-agent simulation with Isabella Rodriguez, Maria Lopez, and Klaus Mueller, type the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus"><pre><code>base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The prompt will then ask, "Enter the name of the new simulation: ". Type any name to denote your current simulation (e.g., just "test-simulation" will do for now).</p>

<p dir="auto">Keep the simulator server running. At this stage, it will display the following prompt: "Enter option: "</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 3. Running and Saving the Simulation</h3>
<p dir="auto">On your browser, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/simulator_home" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/simulator_home</a>. You should see the map of Smallville, along with a list of active agents on the map. You can move around the map using your keyboard arrows. Please keep this tab open. To run the simulation, type the following command in your simulation server in response to the prompt, "Enter option":</p>

<p dir="auto">Note that you will want to replace <code>&lt;step-count&gt;</code> above with an integer indicating the number of game steps you want to simulate. For instance, if you want to simulate 100 game steps, you should input <code>run 100</code>. One game step represents 10 seconds in the game.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your simulation should be running, and you will see the agents moving on the map in your browser. Once the simulation finishes running, the "Enter option" prompt will re-appear. At this point, you can simulate more steps by re-entering the run command with your desired game steps, exit the simulation without saving by typing <code>exit</code>, or save and exit by typing <code>fin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The saved simulation can be accessed the next time you run the simulation server by providing the name of your simulation as the forked simulation. This will allow you to restart your simulation from the point where you left off.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 4. Replaying a Simulation</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can replay a simulation that you have already run simply by having your environment server running and navigating to the following address in your browser: <code>http://localhost:8000/replay/&lt;simulation-name&gt;/&lt;starting-time-step&gt;</code>. Please make sure to replace <code>&lt;simulation-name&gt;</code> with the name of the simulation you want to replay, and <code>&lt;starting-time-step&gt;</code> with the integer time-step from which you wish to start the replay.</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, by visiting the following link, you will initiate a pre-simulated example, starting at time-step 1:<br>
<a href="http://localhost:8000/replay/July1_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus-step-3-20/1/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/replay/July1_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus-step-3-20/1/</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 5. Demoing a Simulation</h3>
<p dir="auto">You may have noticed that all character sprites in the replay look identical. We would like to clarify that the replay function is primarily intended for debugging purposes and does not prioritize optimizing the size of the simulation folder or the visuals. To properly demonstrate a simulation with appropriate character sprites, you will need to compress the simulation first. To do this, open the <code>compress_sim_storage.py</code> file located in the <code>reverie</code> directory using a text editor. Then, execute the <code>compress</code> function with the name of the target simulation as its input. By doing so, the simulation file will be compressed, making it ready for demonstration.</p>
<p dir="auto">To start the demo, go to the following address on your browser: <code>http://localhost:8000/demo/&lt;simulation-name&gt;/&lt;starting-time-step&gt;/&lt;simulation-speed&gt;</code>. Note that <code>&lt;simulation-name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;starting-time-step&gt;</code> denote the same things as mentioned above. <code>&lt;simulation-speed&gt;</code> can be set to control the demo speed, where 1 is the slowest, and 5 is the fastest. For instance, visiting the following link will start a pre-simulated example, beginning at time-step 1, with a medium demo speed:<br>
<a href="http://localhost:8000/demo/July1_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus-step-3-20/1/3/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/demo/July1_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus-step-3-20/1/3/</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<p dir="auto">We've noticed that OpenAI's API can hang when it reaches the hourly rate limit. When this happens, you may need to restart your simulation. For now, we recommend saving your simulation often as you progress to ensure that you lose as little of the simulation as possible when you do need to stop and rerun it. Running these simulations, at least as of early 2023, could be somewhat costly, especially when there are many agents in the environment.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are two ways to optionally customize your simulations.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Author and Load Agent History</h3>
<p dir="auto">First is to initialize agents with unique history at the start of the simulation. To do this, you would want to 1) start your simulation using one of the base simulations, and 2) author and load agent history. More specifically, here are the steps:</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 1. Starting Up a Base Simulation</h4>
<p dir="auto">There are two base simulations included in the repository: <code>base_the_ville_n25</code> with 25 agents, and <code>base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus</code> with 3 agents. Load one of the base simulations by following the steps until step 2 above.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 2. Loading a History File</h4>
<p dir="auto">Then, when prompted with "Enter option: ", you should load the agent history by responding with the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="call -- load history the_ville/<history_file_name>.csv"><pre><code>call -- load history the_ville/&lt;history_file_name&gt;.csv
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that you will need to replace <code>&lt;history_file_name&gt;</code> with the name of an existing history file. There are two history files included in the repo as examples: <code>agent_history_init_n25.csv</code> for <code>base_the_ville_n25</code> and <code>agent_history_init_n3.csv</code> for <code>base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus</code>. These files include semicolon-separated lists of memory records for each of the agents—loading them will insert the memory records into the agents' memory stream.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 3. Further Customization</h4>
<p dir="auto">To customize the initialization by authoring your own history file, place your file in the following folder: <code>environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets/the_ville</code>. The column format for your custom history file will have to match the example history files included. Therefore, we recommend starting the process by copying and pasting the ones that are already in the repository.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Create New Base Simulations</h3>
<p dir="auto">For a more involved customization, you will need to author your own base simulation files. The most straightforward approach would be to copy and paste an existing base simulation folder, renaming and editing it according to your requirements. This process will be simpler if you decide to keep the agent names unchanged. However, if you wish to change their names or increase the number of agents that the Smallville map can accommodate, you might need to directly edit the map using the <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/" rel="nofollow">Tiled</a> map editor.</p>

<div itemprop="text">
<p>About a week ago, Telegram chats were flooded with news of Russia planning to shut down services that bypass website blocking.</p>
<p>Now, it looks like the country has started doing it.</p>
<h2 id="h-vpn-protocols-not-working-in-russia"><strong>VPN protocols not working in Russia</strong></h2>
<p>More and more mobile users in Russia are reporting that their VPNs aren’t working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subscribers of mobile operators such as MTS (МТС), Beeline (Билайн), MegaFon (МегаФон), Tele2, Yota, and Tinkoff Mobile (Тинькофф Мобайл) have bumped into this problem.</p>
<p>As Russian media reports, subscribers of landline providers currently don’t experience any VPN issues.</p>
<p>Those who were not being able to connect tried replacing their VPN with another one. Unfortunately, this didn’t seem to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The media in Russia reports that the reason behind this is that the country isn’t banning specific VPNs. Instead, it’s<strong> putting restrictions on the <a href="https://vpncentral.com/best-vpn-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protocols</a> these services use</strong>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://appleinsider.ru/tips-tricks/v-rossii-blokiruyut-openvpn-i-wireguard-kak-nastroit-shadowsocks-na-iphone-gde-vzyat-server-i-kak-im-polzovatsya.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appleinsider.ru</a>, the two protocols that are subject to the restrictions are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>OpenVPN</strong></li><li><strong>WireGuard</strong></li></ul>
<p>As some news outlets report, Russia started blocking <a href="https://vpncentral.com/how-does-openvpn-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenVPN</a> first.</p>
<p>Many Russian companies have now encountered problems in their daily operations as both OpenVPN and <a href="https://vpncentral.com/wireguard-vpn-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WireGuard</a> are quite popular in corporate environments.</p>
<p>At the moment, there’s no information about other protocols, but the website notes that Russia may have blocked them as well.</p>
<p>The site also reported that <strong>the restriction currently doesn’t apply to</strong> <strong>Shadowsocks</strong>. It advises Russian citizens who want to bypass geo-restrictions to use it as an alternative to a VPN.</p>
<p>Widely used in <a href="https://vpncentral.com/bypass-censorship-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China</a>, Shadowsocks disguises your traffic as HTTPS, letting it move freely. It encrypts every byte of information, hiding your browsing sessions from prying eyes.</p>
<p>A Russian VPN provider, <strong>Terona VPN</strong>, <strong>confirmed the recent restrictions</strong> and said its users are reporting difficulties using the service. It’s now preparing to switch to new protocols that are more resistant to blocking.</p>

The mind-bending discovery hints at a possible alternate theory of physics that does not depend on the existence of weird unidentified phenomena, such as dark matter, to explain the phenomena we see in space.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Gravity is one of the most familiar forces we experience in our daily lives, but it is also among the toughest to explain. In the standard model of cosmology—a well-tested theoretical framework—gravity is governed by Newtonian laws and Einstein’s theory of general relativity. The standard model also predicts there is an unknown material, called dark matter, that accounts for the vast majority of the universe’s mass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The standard model is a robust theory, but some objects in outer space nevertheless seem to deviate from its gravitational playbook. For this reason, scientists began to develop another explanation of gravity in the 1980s, known as Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), that does not require the existence of dark matter.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Kyu-Hyun Chae, an astronomer at Sejong University, has now put these models to the test by analyzing the accelerations of stars in 26,500 wide binaries located within about 650 light years of Earth using imagery captured by the European Space Agency’s Gaia observatory. Scientists have previously searched for signs of modified gravity in these systems, but Chae took the next step by developing a new code that could account for special details, like the occurrence rate of so-called “nested” binaries in which the loosely orbiting stars also have close stellar companions.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The new data suggests that when the gravitational accelerations of these stars slip below one nanometer per second squared, they begin to move in ways that are more aligned with MOND models than by the standard model. Chae said the findings offer<strong> “</strong>direct evidence for the breakdown of standard gravity at weak acceleration” and reveal “an immovable anomaly of gravity in favor of MOND-based modified gravity,” according to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ace101" target="_blank"><span>a recent study published</span></a> in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“When the results started to show up from my new and more reliable code, my initial reaction was that it was unbelievable,” Chae said in an email to Motherboard. “I was feeling like I was dreaming. It seemed so unreal. This is because my results did not match any previous results.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Several previous results even claimed that the standard gravity was preferred by wide binaries data including Gaia DR3,” he continued. “One group has been claiming an anomaly for some time, but the anomaly seemed not to match well the predictions of existing modified gravity theories. However, those previous studies did not self-calibrate or fully take into account the amount of hidden nested binaries.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Scientists who work with MOND theories often focus on observations of galaxies, but researchers have increasingly looked to wide binaries for anomalies because stellar scales are too small to be affected by dark matter (assuming it exists).&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Testing gravity with wide binaries is interesting because dark matter can play no role in their internal dynamics,” Chae said in the study. “Thus, unlike galaxies and galaxy clusters, there is no need to distinguish predictions of modified gravity and dark matter that appear to overlap and differ only subtly in some cases.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In the new study, Chae reports what he calls “clear evidence” that the movements of binaries at points of weak acceleration seem to sync up with a particular MOND prediction known as AQUAL, according to the study. This discovery suggests that the standard view of gravity cannot account for these motions at low accelerations, which may inspire scientists to rethink aspects of Newton’s inverse square law of gravity and Einstein's general relativity, as well as the necessity of dark matter.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Because a large amount of dark matter—six times the baryonic or ordinary matter based on the standard model—was required by assuming that general relativity was valid in the low acceleration limit, such a need for a large amount of dark matter is no longer valid,” Chae explained. “This does not necessarily preclude the possibility that new particles, such as sterile neutrinos, could not be found. But, it is clear that there is no need for as much dark matter as required by general relativity.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>While the results are tantalizing, Chae said that future observations and theoretical work would be needed to build on the discovery. He also noted that these findings pose a challenge to some parts of the standard model, but that the model is still the best lens with which to view many other phenomena in the universe.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I would like to emphasize that all successful aspects of Newtonian dynamics and general Relativity in the non-MOND regime will continue to be cherished,” Chae told Motherboard. “For example, the description of black holes by general relativity is valid and has nothing to do with the anomaly in the low acceleration limit. We are talking about a revision in the low acceleration limit only.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Even so, any update or revision of the standard model based on these findings would have a profound effect on our conception of the universe.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Because the standard cosmology is based on general relativity, cosmology needs a major revision now,” Chae concluded. “I think we are now entering an extremely exciting period of time. When the ultraviolet catastrophe of Maxwell's theory of electrodynamics was discovered more than a century ago, it eventually led to quantum physics. We are now having a low-acceleration catastrophe of gravity. It is exciting to see what it will lead the world into.”</p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                        <p>The Scripps Instition of Oceanography's innovative Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP)&nbsp;has been towed off into the sunset for the last time. It may well have been the strangest, most recognizable research vessel ever built - and its users remember that it was exceptionally effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more than 50 years, FLIP provided a stable research station at sea for Scripps' scientists and their colleagues from around the world. The one-of-a-kind vessel (technically a platform) could be partially flooded to sink the stern and change the orientation of its buoyancy. In less than an hour, it could transition seamlessly from a horizontal barge for transit into&nbsp;a vertical spar platform for stationary operation. To refloat from vertical to horizontal mode, the crew would pump out the ballast tanks with compressed air,&nbsp;and the vessel's stern would rise back up to the surface.</p>

<p>By design, FLIP was minimally affected by ocean swells, and it provided scientists an extra-stable, extra-quiet platform for sensitive experiments. Physical oceanographic research conducted aboard FLIP produced "exquisite"&nbsp;data, according to ONR&nbsp;Ocean Sensing Battlespace Department director Dr. Tom Drake, and established a "gold standard" for ocean modeling&nbsp;to support U.S. Navy research objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQ5hvltzGEM" width="600"></iframe></p>

<p>“It was like being on land except in the middle of the ocean. It was just glorious,” remembered Scripps oceanographer John Hildebrand, who used the platform's stability and relative silence to study marine mammal sounds. “There were things you could do with it that you couldn’t do any other way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Planning for FLIP's creation began at the&nbsp;National Research Council Committee on Oceanography in the late 1950s, according to Scripps scientist and longtime FLIP researcher Rob Pinkel. The committee's list of top priorities included a deep-diving submersible - the famous Alvin - and FLIP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unique spar platform was designed and built by Scripps, and it launched in 1962. Most of its core mission systems were designed to&nbsp;rotate through 90 degrees, from the air compressors to the galley cabinets.&nbsp;The diesel generators were mounted on gimbals and connected to their fuel and exhaust piping using flexible hoses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P8g6zkxLr4o" width="600"></iframe></p>

<p>“FLIP set the stage for thinking big about what could be done with technology to enable new scientific discoveries,” said Scripps’ Marine Physical Laboratory (MPL) Director Eric Terrill. “It was built in an era of risk-taking; a spirit that we try to embrace to this day and encourage in the next generation of seagoing scientists.”</p>

<p>The venerable spar vessel has been towed off for the last time, but a piece of it remains at Scripps. The institution has arranged for one of FLIP's booms to be removed and mounted onto a pier, where it will continue to be used to deploy instruments into the water.</p>

		<!-- Ad-Auris -->
		
		<p><span>F</span><span>or years,</span> Martin Jugenburg—a Toronto-based plastic and reconstructive surgeon who goes by Dr. 6ix on social media—shared dozens of before-and-after photos and videos on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> of the altered bodies that had passed through his hands. There were tummy tucks, Brazilian butt lifts, and breast augmentations, all of them sorted into a kind of virtual assembly line for his thousands of followers to see.</p>

<p>But many of the women he featured in his posts—sometimes depicted post-op and sedated, their genitals and breasts blurred out—hadn’t consented to having their images circulated, according to an ongoing <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-plastic-surgeon-class-action-1.5376239">class action lawsuit</a>, and some were only alerted of their presence online due to an investigation by CBC journalists. Unbeknownst to his patients and followers, investigators later found that Jugenburg was using a covert network of cameras in his clinic to perform a rigorous feat of surveillance, documenting thousands surgical procedures. Women who realized he had posted images of them told investigators they felt violated; they were upset, embarrassed, and distressed.</p>
<p>Dr. 6ix’s loose approach to respecting patient privacy on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/social-media/">social media</a> is hardly unusual in the world of “med Twitter” and “MedTok,” or medical TikTok. On <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a>, orthopedic surgeons complain about chronic pain “crazies,” nurses mock women who choose to give birth without an epidural, and doctors complain about “liars,” “Googlers,” and patients with conditions they are struggling to diagnose. <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a> is worse. In a post by someone with the username Nurse Johnn, whose derogatory skits about dementia patients he claims are fiction, the nurse mockingly dances in blue-green scrubs on a hospital bed, imitating someone under his care. One nurse filmed themselves holding the hand of a patient they said was dying of <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a>. There is a video of someone in what appears to be a psychiatric crisis and another of a patient having their toenails cut. A Miami-based doctor posted about how he “walks in the footsteps of giants” in reference to porn star Johnny Sins, who impersonates a doctor having sex with his patients.<a name="newsletter"></a></p>
<p>To scroll through many medical social media accounts is to wade into a virtual subculture where patients have become fodder for derision, their privacy and dignity regularly violated. But since there isn’t really any oversight of this virtual world, patients must bear the repercussions. Medical professionals spilling these traumatic, “hilarious” stories about their patients can lead to people not going to the doctor, says Shayna Hermann, a graduate student at the University of North Texas who studies criminology. This means the underlying health issue can “get worse and worse,” she adds—often with dire consequences.</p>

<p><span>T</span><span>he concealment of</span> a patient’s medical information is an ancient custom, for such knowledge is a “holy secret,” according to the Hippocratic Oath. Medical students still refer to a doctrine of “doing no harm” that is based on the Hippocratic oath, and harm, to Hippocrates, included the dissemination of information shared between a patient and their doctor. Otherwise, trust in medicine could be undermined, disrupting treatment and diagnosis. Medicine is about acting but also about not acting.</p>

<p>The Enlightenment enshrined patient confidentiality as one of the formative values of the modern biomedical model. Ideals cherished under liberalism, like the individual’s right to autonomy over their body, would be impossible to respect without the guarantee that their medical records remained private. Those ideas would persist throughout the twentieth century. In 1948, the World Medical Association, an international body that now represents 115 medical associations worldwide, produced the Declaration of Geneva for the purposes of unifying an international standard for medical practice.  The document reads: “I will respect the secrets that are confided in me, even after the patient has died.” Today, a patient’s right to privacy has been legally protected in both Canada and the United States. If it is violated, doctors can be sanctioned and even lose their medical licence, temporarily or permanently. Despite this basis for the preservation of confidentiality, the growing presence of practitioners on social media presents a risk for breaches.</p>
<p>Physicians, like many of us, have used platforms like Twitter and Instagram since their inception, with 90 percent reporting they used social media to find information related to their patients and practice in 2017, according to a report by market analyst Research2Guidance. Today, lists of the top twenty-five “medical influencers” include accounts of family physicians and doctors who have been endorsed by celebrities and have millions of followers. And, at times, their posts contain jokes involving patient information. A 2020 study by Wasim Ahmed of Newcastle University, which analyzed 348 tweets about living patients, found that nearly 47 percent contained details that would likely make patients identifiable to themselves.</p>
<p>In some ways, packaging patient information for public consumption is in line with lesser-known traditions of the medical world. The history of medicine is also a history of performance; health care workers have advanced their careers through the exhibition of less powerful people for hundreds of years. Despite the progress made around patient confidentiality during the Enlightenment, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it wasn’t uncommon for both students and the public to pay an entry fee to witness dissections that took place as part of medical education in Europe. Many people viewed the practice as necessary for scientific advancement, but physicians used, almost universally, bodies of the poorest subjects, stealing cadavers from graves without consent and then displaying them for the public.</p>
<p>In the era before anesthetic was widely used, surgeons would operate on conscious patients before an audience of, at times, 700 to 800 onlookers. In an article for <em>JSTOR Daily</em>, Rebecca Rego Barry wrote that surgeons “seemed to revel in the showmanship aspect of their work,” receiving applause at the moment they entered what one medical college called the “pit.” It was this performative aspect of medicine—perpetrated by practitioners and revered by observers—that helped usher in the era of the celebrity doctor. Of course, the conditions health care professionals train and work in have always encouraged physicians to establish public influence. Canadian hospitals and medical schools reward and publicly promote their most prestigious students, researchers, and clinicians; competition for esteem and funding from donors encourages already-high-achieving people to differentiate themselves and build lucrative research reputations. But television fundamentally changed the way we think about doctors, commodifying the act of giving medical care so that it could be sold as entertainment on a mass scale.</p>
<p>Just look at celebrities like Dr. Drew and Dr. Oz or shows like <em>Dr. 90210</em> and <em>Botched</em>. Every week, viewers tune in to watch the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of patients, despite the criticisms these shows have received for exploitative practices. Reality shows like ABC’s <em>NY Med</em> used footage from actual emergency rooms and operating theatres, sometimes filming surgeries without consent from patients. Joel M. Geiderman, an LA emergency physician, told <em>Emergency Medicine News</em> that he knows people who consented to being filmed while stressed and in the emergency department, then regretted the publicization of their medical treatment in the media. So, while the disclosure of medical secrets to the public is not particularly new, technology has made it much easier. </p>

<p><span>T</span><span>here is certainly</span> a place for doctors online. Medical misinformation and vaccine hesitancy need to be confronted, especially in the era of COVID-19, and many clinicians have made invaluable contributions to online discussions about medical racism, homophobia, ableism, and misogyny. A number of physicians use social media to help patients with conditions underrepresented in medical literature self-advocate. Others advise oppressed patients on how to ensure they’re getting the best care possible and answer pressing questions about the pandemic.</p>
<p>But growing distrust in the medical establishment, which the violation of patient confidentiality encourages, must be reckoned with just as seriously. According to a recent survey by NORC at the University of Chicago, since the start of COVID, 32 percent of respondents decreased their trust in the health care system. This distrust is often particularly present in Black, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities, which have been subjected to medical exploitation, experimentation, and harm for centuries. Research shows suspicion of pharmaceutical companies continues to drive vaccine hesitancy.</p>
<p>“COVID put physicians in the forefront of the cultural mainstream,” says Stephanie Lee, a hematologist at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto. “Everyone was looking to physicians for guidance on what was happening.” She adds that, for many physicians, there was a feedback loop of wanting more attention and likes on social media. While she believes health care practitioners generally have good intentions, “when the well runs dry of content on COVID, people wanted to mine their professional lives to maintain their status. COVID accelerated what was already an issue.”</p>
<p>The targets of these posts are, overwhelmingly, the oppressed. Faithful to the history of medical theatre, women with mental illness and patients who are geriatric, disabled, fat, impoverished, or perceived as uneducated are subjected to the majority of ridicule. And it’s not uncommon for patients in similar situations to see these posts. Reacting to discussions of trans healthcare by physicians on Twitter, one person tweeted, “My lived experience/identity has been distilled to a saccharine and self-serving Aesop[’s fable].” Another nurse, who posted that she knew when patients were faking symptoms, inspired a #PatientsAreNotFaking hashtag used by thousands of people.</p>
<p>“Whenever I see nurses and doctors on TikTok . . . disparaging their patients . . . it makes it hard, for not just me but a lot of people, to be vulnerable to their doctors,” says the University of North Texas’s Hermann. She adds that patients who grew up in poverty, like herself, already distrust health care professionals, and social media has the potential to make it worse. Patients have already expressed a variety of concerns in the comments sections of these platforms: “TikTok singlehandedly made me not seek medical care recently,” wrote one user; another posted about their anxieties around having emergency surgery, writing, “I was literally fearful of my nurses having their phones on them and videoing me while I’m vulnerable.” With no real oversight in place to monitor online behaviour, it’s clear that the regulations around patient confidentiality must evolve to capture these new concerns. </p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association does have a data-stewardship policy that covers patient privacy, but it only mentions the sharing of patient details over email—nothing about social media. The issue has been addressed in the College of the Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario’s new set of guidelines for the use of social media by physicians, which includes the recommendation that doctors “exercise caution when posting information online that relates to an actual patient” and asks them to “bear in mind that an unnamed patient may still be identified through a range of their information such as a description of their clinical condition.” These are, however, just guidelines, and they are still violated constantly online.</p>
<p>Both Hermann and Lee think that social media use should be addressed in medical curricula; hospitals and medical boards already have disciplinary mechanisms in place for violations of patient confidentiality, which should be implemented when health care practitioners post derogatory content online with the same consistency that they are when practitioners are careless with physical copies of patient data. Directives, they added, should take into account that comments deriding or ridiculing sick people in general can be as harmful to the public’s relationship with the medical system as individual violations of patient confidentiality.</p>
<p>Lee believes that, when done correctly, patient narratives shared on social media can have a constructive and positive function. “There’s an opportunity to do a lot of good,” she says.  “But physicians need to take stock of how this is really helping our patients. Is there really a net material benefit to patients by posting this? Is there an alternative way that preserves the patient’s dignity better, maintains their anonymity better?”</p>
<p>Asking for consent to post about a patient online is complicated, however. The power differential between patients and doctors, in most cases, is enormous. It is difficult to imagine conditions in which patients wouldn’t potentially feel coerced into agreeing to let their physician share their information on a public social media account. “Hospital fundraising campaigns share patient information all the time, but the big difference is the patients’ stories are shared after the acute issue has been resolved,” says Lee, adding that, often, those narratives are shared in the patient’s own words, sometimes written in partnership with their former health care providers. “You have to empower the patient to be <em>part</em> of the process, to be part of sharing their story,” she says.</p>
<p><span>I</span><span>n 2021,</span> following his disciplinary hearing at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, Martin Jugenburg was suspended from his job for six months. At some point, he removed all the patient content predating November 2019 from his Instagram account. The committee wrote that there was a “troubling pattern of Dr. Jugenburg pursuing his own interests . . . in publicity and in cultivating a strong social media presence, at the expense of the privacy of his patients.” His “seeming indifference to these issues was appalling and is deserving of significant sanction,” the committee added.</p>

<p>Jugenburg has since resumed his career at the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute and has publicly vowed to fight attempts made by patients to seek financial compensation for the damages done. His Instagram account is still public, and he has begun posting new post-op images of his patients—presumably with permission this time. It’s almost business as usual.</p>
<p>For patients, the situation remains unchanged. Questions about the function of social media in medicine have yet to be posed with seriousness, and solutions have not been identified or implemented. Meanwhile, influencer-doctors continue to practise the tradition of performance, prolonging a hidden history of sickness as spectacle.</p>
<p>“It’s really easy to detach empathy when you’re doing a TikTok. It’s really easy for those viewers to not see that person as a person,” says Hermann. “[But] I think, now, it’s coming to a head.”</p>
