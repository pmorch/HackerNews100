platform never aligned with our values and no longer serves as a space

the Free Software values and to interact with policymakers, 
journalists, and above all, reaching to people who were not yet 
familiar with Free Software and its benefits. The social network was

to explain to users their right to control our technology, and to 
promote software freedom across society, while also encouraging the use 
of alternative, decentralised social media networks.</p><p>However, the current platform direction and climate  combined with an algorithm

        Report: Microsoft declared “the era of AI agents” in May, but enterprise customers aren’t buying.

    <div>
                      
                      
          <p>Microsoft has lowered sales growth targets for its AI agent products after many salespeople missed their quotas in the fiscal year ending in June, according to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-lowers-ai-software-sales-quotas-customers-resist-newer-products">report</a> Wednesday from The Information. The adjustment is reportedly unusual for Microsoft, and it comes after the company missed a number of ambitious sales goals for its AI offerings.</p>
<p>AI agents are specialized implementations of AI language models designed to perform multistep tasks autonomously rather than simply responding to single prompts. So-called “agentic” features have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsofts-vision-for-ai-pcs-looks-a-lot-like-another-crack-at-cortana/">central</a> to Microsoft’s 2025 sales pitch: At its Build conference in May, the company <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/05/19/microsoft-build-2025-the-age-of-ai-agents-and-building-the-open-agentic-web/">declared</a> that it has entered “the era of AI agents.”</p>
<p>The company has promised customers that agents could automate complex tasks, such as generating dashboards from sales data or writing customer reports. At its Ignite conference in November, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-ignite-2025-copilot-and-agents-built-to-power-the-frontier-firm/">announced</a> new features like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot, along with tools for building and deploying agents through Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio. But as the year draws to a close, that promise has proven harder to deliver than the company expected.</p>
<p>According to The Information, one US Azure sales unit set quotas for salespeople to increase customer spending on a product called <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry">Foundry</a>, which helps customers develop AI applications, by 50 percent. Less than a fifth of salespeople in that unit met their Foundry sales growth targets. In July, Microsoft lowered those targets to roughly 25 percent growth for the current fiscal year. In another US Azure unit, most salespeople failed to meet an earlier quota to double Foundry sales, and Microsoft cut their quotas to 50 percent for the current fiscal year.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The sales figures suggest enterprises aren’t yet willing to pay premium prices for these AI agent tools. And Microsoft’s Copilot itself has faced a brand preference challenge: Earlier this year, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/chatgpt-vs-copilot-inside-the-openai-and-microsoft-rivalry">reported</a> that Microsoft salespeople were having trouble selling Copilot to enterprises because many employees prefer ChatGPT instead. The drugmaker Amgen reportedly bought Copilot software for 20,000 staffers, but many employees gravitated toward OpenAI’s chatbot instead, with Copilot mainly used for Microsoft-specific tasks like Outlook and Teams.</p>
<p>A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on the changes in sales quotas when asked by The Information. But behind these withering sales figures may lie a deeper, more fundamental issue: AI agent technology likely isn’t ready for the kind of high-stakes autonomous business work Microsoft is promising.</p>
<h2>The gap between promise and reality</h2>
<p>The concepts behind agentic AI systems <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/hype-grows-over-autonomous-ai-agents-that-loop-gpt-4-outputs/">emerged</a> shortly after the release of OpenAI’s GPT-4 in 2023. They typically involve spinning off “worker tasks” to AI models running in parallel with a supervising AI model, and incorporate techniques to evaluate and act on their own results. Over the past few years, companies like Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">refined</a> those early approaches into far more useful products for tasks like software development, but they are still prone to errors.</p>
<p>At the heart of the problem is the tendency for AI language models to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">confabulate</a>, which means they may confidently generate a false output that is stated as being factual. While confabulation issues have reduced over time with more recent AI models, as we’ve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/new-apple-study-challenges-whether-ai-models-truly-reason-through-problems/">seen</a> through recent studies, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">simulated reasoning</a> techniques behind the current slate of agentic AI assistants on the market can still make catastrophic mistakes and run with them, making them unreliable for the kinds of hands-off autonomous work companies like Microsoft are promising.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>While looping agentic systems are better at catching their own mistakes than running a single AI model alone, they still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/">inherit</a> the fundamental pattern-matching limitations of the underlying AI models, particularly when facing novel problems outside their training distribution. So if an agent isn’t properly trained to perform a task or encounters a unique scenario, it could easily draw the wrong inference and make costly mistakes for a business.</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/researchers-find-llms-are-bad-at-logical-inference-good-at-fluent-nonsense/">brittleness</a>” of current AI agents is why the concept of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">artificial general intelligence</a>, or AGI, is so appealing to those in the AI industry. In AI, “general intelligence” typically implies an AI model that can learn or perform novel tasks without having to specifically be shown thousands or millions of examples of it beforehand. Although AGI is a nebulous term that is difficult to define in practice, if such a general AI system were ever developed, it would hypothetically make for a far more competent agentic worker than what AI companies offer today.</p>
<p>Despite these struggles, Microsoft continues to spend heavily on AI infrastructure. The company <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2026/earnings-fy-2026-q1">reported</a> capital expenditures of $34.9 billion for its fiscal first quarter ending in October, a record, and warned that spending would rise further. The Information notes that much of Microsoft’s AI revenue comes from AI companies themselves renting cloud infrastructure rather than from traditional enterprises adopting AI tools for their own operations.</p>
<p>For now, as all eyes focus on a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/googles-sundar-pichai-warns-of-irrationality-in-trillion-dollar-ai-investment-boom/">potential bubble</a> in the AI market, Microsoft seems to be building infrastructure for a revolution that many enterprises haven’t yet signed up for.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
<abbr>tl:dr</abbr>: Parenting and leadership is similar. Teach a man to fish, etc.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
I spent a couple of years managing a team, and I entered that role – like many –
without knowing anything about how to do it. I tried to figure out how to be a
good manager, and doing so I ended up reading a lot about <i>servant leadership</i>.
It never quite sat right with me, though. Servant leadership seems to me a lot
like curling parenting: the leader/parent anticipate problems and sweep the way
for their direct reports/children.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, this probably feels very good (initially, anyway) for the direct
reports/children. But the servant leader/curling parent quickly becomes an
overworked single point of failure, and once they leave there is nobody else who
knows how to handle the obstacles the leader moved out of the way for everyone.
In the worst cases, they leave behind a group of people who have been completely
isolated from the rest of the organisation, and has no idea what their purpose
is and how to fit in with the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>
I would like to invent my own buzzword: <i>transparent leadership</i>. In my book, a
good leader
</p>

<ul>
<li>coaches people,</li>
<li>connects people,</li>
<li>teaches people methodical problem solving,</li>
<li>explains values and principles embraced by the organisation to aid them in
making aligned decisions on their own,</li>
<li>creates direct links between supply and demand (instead of deliberately making
themselves a middle man),</li>
<li>allows their direct reports career growth by gradually taking over leadership
responsibilities,</li>
<li>continuously trains their replacement, and</li>
<li>generally makes themselves redundant.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The middle manager that doesn’t perform any useful work is a fun stereotype, but
I also think it’s a good target to aim for. The difference lies in what to do
once one has rendered oneself redundant. A common response is to invent new
work, ask for status reports, and add bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
A better response is to go back to working on technical problems. This keeps the
manager’s skills fresh and gets them more respect from their reports. The
manager should turn into a high-powered spare worker, rather than a paper-shuffler.
</p>

The findings challenge decades of textbook biology and could reshape how researchers think about hair loss and regeneration.</p>


										  

																																																																<p>The team, from L'Oréal Research &amp; Innovation and Queen Mary University of London, used advanced 3D live imaging to track individual cells within living human hair follicles kept alive in culture. The study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65143-x" target="_blank">published</a> in <i>Nature Communications</i>, shows that cells in the outer root sheath—a layer encasing the hair shaft—move in a spiral downward path within the same region from where the upward pulling force originates.</p>
<p>Dr. Inês Sequeira, Reader in Oral and Skin Biology at Queen Mary and one of the lead authors, said, "Our results reveal a fascinating choreography inside the hair follicle. For decades, it was assumed that hair was pushed out by the dividing cells in the hair bulb. We found that instead that it's actively being pulled upwards by surrounding tissue acting almost like a tiny motor."</p>
<p>To test this, the researchers blocked cell division inside the follicle, expecting hair growth to stop. Instead, growth continued nearly unchanged. But when they interfere with actin—a protein that enables cells to contract and move—the hair growth rate dropped by more than 80%.</p>
<p>Computer models confirmed that this pulling force, correlated with coordinated motion in the follicle's outer layers, was essential to match the observed speeds of hair movement.</p>
<p>Dr. Nicolas Tissot, the first author, from L'Oréal's Advanced Research team said, "We use a novel imaging method allowing 3D time lapse microscopy in real-time. While static images provide mere isolated snapshots, 3D time-lapse microscopy is indispensable for truly unraveling the intricate, dynamic biological processes within the hair follicle, revealing crucial cellular kinetics, migratory patterns, and rate of cell divisions that are otherwise impossible to deduce from discrete observations. This approach made it possible to model the forces generated locally."</p>

																																						    

																																																<p>Dr. Thomas Bornschlögl, another lead author, from the same L'Oréal team adds, "This reveals that hair growth is not driven only by cell division—instead, the outer root sheath actively pulls the hair upward. This new view of <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-10-fully-mature-hair-follicles-grown.html?utm_source=embeddings&amp;utm_medium=related&amp;utm_campaign=internal" rel="related">follicle mechanics</a> opens fresh opportunities for studying hair disorders, testing drugs and advancing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."</p>
<p>While the research was carried out on human follicles in lab culture, it offers new clues from hair science and regenerative medicine. The team believes that understanding these mechanical forces could help design treatments that target the follicle's physical as well as biochemical environment. Furthermore, the imaging technique developed will allow live testing of different drugs and treatments.</p>
<p>The study also highlights the growing role of biophysics in biology, showing how mechanical forces at microscopic scale shape the organs we see every day.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="link_wrapped_content">




<p>The price of eggs has nothing on the price of computer memory right now. Thanks to a supply crunch from the “AI” bubble, RAM chips are the new gold, with prices on consumer PC memory kits <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2984629/ram-is-so-expensive-that-stores-are-selling-it-at-market-prices.html">ballooning out of control</a>. In an object lesson in the ridiculousness of an economic bubble, Samsung won’t even sell its memory to… Samsung.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s the situation.</strong> Samsung makes everything from refrigerators to supermassive oil tankers. Getting all that stuff made requires an organization that’s literally dozens of affiliated companies and subsidiaries, which don’t necessarily work as closely or harmoniously as you might assume. For this story, we’re talking about Samsung Electronics, which makes Galaxy phones, tablets, laptops, watches, etc., and Samsung Semiconductor Global, which manufactures memory and other chips and supplies the global market. That global market includes both Samsung subsidiaries and their competitors—laptops from Samsung, Dell, and Lenovo sitting on a Best Buy store shelf might all have Samsung-manufactured memory sitting in their RAM slots.</p>



<p>Samsung subsidiaries are, naturally, going to look to Samsung Semiconductor first when they need parts. Such was reportedly the case for Samsung Electronics, in search of memory supplies for its newest smartphones as the company ramps up production for 2026 flagship designs. But with so much RAM hardware going into new “AI” data centers—and those companies willing to pay top dollar for their hardware—memory manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are prioritizing data center suppliers to maximize profits.</p>



<p>The end result, according to a report from SE Daily <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.sammobile.com/news/rift-emerges-between-samsung-phone-memory-divisions/&amp;xcust=2-1-2998935-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2998935/ram-is-so-expensive-samsung-wont-even-sell-it-to-samsung.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2998935-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="sammobile" target="_blank">spotted by SamMobile</a>, is that Samsung Semiconductor rejected the original order for smartphone DRAM chips from Samsung Electronics’ Mobile Experience division. The smartphone manufacturing arm of the company had hoped to nail down pricing and supply for another year. But reports say that due to “chipflation,” the phone-making division must renegotiate quarterly, with a long-term supply deal rejected by its corporate sibling. A short-term deal, with higher prices, was reportedly hammered out.</p>

					
			


<p>Assuming that this information is accurate—and to be clear, we can’t independently confirm it—consumers will see prices rise for Samsung phones and other mobile hardware. But that’s hardly a surprise. Finished electronics probably won’t see the same meteoric rise in prices as consumer-grade RAM modules, but this rising tide is flooding all the boats. Raspberry Pi, which strives to keep its mod-friendly electronics as cheap as possible, has <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2997505/ai-driven-ram-shortage-hits-raspberry-pi-price-hikes-and-a-new-budget-model.html">recently had to bring prices up</a> and called out memory costs as the culprit. Lenovo, the world’s largest PC manufacturer, is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2986266/lenovo-stockpiles-ram-to-hopefully-keep-laptop-prices-down.html">stockpiling memory supplies</a> as a bulwark against the market.</p>



<p>But if you’re hoping to see prices lower in 2026, don’t hold your breath. According to a forecast <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20251201PD209/2026-memory-dram-demand-nand.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2998935-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2998935/ram-is-so-expensive-samsung-wont-even-sell-it-to-samsung.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2998935-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="digitimes" target="_blank">from memory supplier TeamGroup</a>, component prices have tripled recently, causing finished modules to jump in prices as quickly as 100 percent in a month. Absent some kind of disastrous market collapse, prices are expected to continue rising into next year, and supply could remain constrained well into 2027 or later.</p>

<p>Honda created the first-generation K series engine in 2001 as an official replacement for the aging but highly successful B and H series families in a bid to meet tighter emissions rules while increasing thermal efficiency and real-world flexibility. Honda engineers focused on a clean sheet aluminum block with a deep skirt layout that increased rigidity and supported higher operating speeds without unwanted vibration. They also applied a forged crankshaft and lightweight pistons to cut reciprocating mass and improve throttle response.</p>    <p>Replacing the old belt-driven system is a modern chain-driven dual overhead camshaft setup that allows for a more accurate timing control under high load conditions. The advanced i-VTEC system is the cornerstone of the K-Series, blending variable valve timing, with variable lift control, and variable cam phasing. This system gives the engine a wide torque spread at low and mid-RPM and allows strong breathing at higher RPM without the sharp changeover, compared to     <span data-id="2009854"><a href="https://www.topspeed.com/honda-vtec-history-technology/" target="_blank">how the older VTEC systems operate</a></span>.    </p>

<p> Honda also rotated the engine orientation compared to the B series family, allowing the configuration to pack the intake and exhaust layout more efficiently. This results in improved airflow and easier service access. The engineers designed a tall intake plenum with long runners that improved cylinder filling during everyday driving, and paired it with a free-flowing exhaust manifold that supported consistent scavenging.</p>    <p>The K series also introduced coil-on-plug ignition and a modern electronic throttle, helping the engine management system fine-tune spark and airflow for better drivability and fuel control. Honda debuted the first K-Series K20A in the JDM-exclusive 2001 Honda Stream. This was an ideal compact platform to showcase the new engine architecture before rolling it out to performance models like the     <span data-id="2006228"><a href="https://www.topspeed.com/what-every-enthusiast-should-know-about-the-acura-integra-type-r/" target="_blank">Integra Type R</a></span> and mainstream options like the Civic and Accord. <em>Edmunds</em> consumer reviews of these models consistently award K-Series-powered models with high ratings for maintenance and reliability.    </p>

<p> The K20C is Honda's current-generation of the K-Series range, upgraded to deliver strong real-world efficiency and long-term reliability across the Honda and Acura catalogs. It's also a redesign that meets stricter global emissions rules and tighter thermal demands that come with modern turbocharging.</p>    <p>Key design elements include a reinforced aluminum block that features a closed deck layout, improving cylinder stability under higher combustion pressure, and keeps distortion under control during long and high load cycles. The system also adopts a low-friction rotating assembly with coated pistons and well-balanced rods that reduce heat buildup and wear. The direct injection system used precise multi-hole injectors that improved atomization and allowed cleaner combustion, raising efficiency, and reducing soot formation inside the chambers.</p>

<p> The engineers shape the cylinder head ports through extensive fluid modeling, creating fast and consistent airflow at lower boost pressures. The turbo layout is also intentional, consisting of a compact low-inertia unit that produces quick spooling without heavy thermal strain. The cooling circuit routes coolant through critical areas to stabilize temperature during demanding driving. Honda uses a high-flow intercooling unit to keep intake temperatures low, improve knock resistance, and protect the engine during long climbs or sustained highway use.</p>    <p>The K20C design also incorporates integrated exhaust passages within the head, shortening the distance from the valves to the turbine and reducing unnecessary heat loss. This improves turbo response and emissions control. Honda tunes the valve timing system to prioritize mid-range torque and real-world drivability, instead of chasing peak numbers. In doing so, the powertrain benefits from reduced stress on internal components. The company validates the design through endurance testing that included extended full load sessions and wide temperature swings. Honda and Acura models that     <span data-id="2021701"><a href="https://www.topspeed.com/how-the-civic-type-r-and-si-serve-two-different-drivers/" target="_blank">use the K20C</a></span> benefit from predictable behavior, low maintenance demands, and consistent efficiency because the engine handles high-pressure turbo operation without unusual wear, and it keeps its performance stable over long ownership cycles.    </p>

<p> Honda pushed the first-generation K series engine into manufacturer-backed racing as soon as it proved its durability on the road. The Japanese company's racing division applied the unit as a core part of its return to high-level touring car competition. The engineers developed racing versions of the K20 that kept the production block and head architecture but used reinforced internals, stronger valve springs, revised cam profiles, and higher flow intake and exhaust systems to withstand extended high RPM use.</p>    <p>Honda built these engines for series such as the Japanese Super Taikyu Championship, the British Touring Car Championship, and various regional touring car categories where regulations encouraged production-based units. The     <span data-id="10065"><a href="https://www.topspeed.com/cars/honda/2018-honda-civic-type-r-tcr/" target="_blank">K20-powered Civic race cars</a></span> delivered strong pace because the engine breathed well at sustained RPM and held peak output without overheating or losing consistency during long stints.    </p>

<p> Teams appreciated the stable thermal behavior because Honda used a rigid block design and efficient water and oil channels that kept temperatures predictable under heavy load. Drivers reported sharp throttle response, which helped them control rotation mid-corner and fire out of slow bends with confidence. The wide operating range that came from the     <span data-id="2007610"><a href="https://www.topspeed.com/how-honda-vtec-works/" target="_blank">advanced i-VTEC system</a></span> let engineers tailor cam timing for specific tracks, which improved flexibility during setup and reduced the need for constant gear changes.    </p>    <p>The engine also proved extremely reliable during endurance events where many rivals needed mid-season rebuilds, while K-series units often completed full campaigns with only scheduled maintenance. Honda leveraged this record to promote the K series as a modern performance base, and the company used racing feedback to refine production variants for later models. The engine delivered a strong mix of durability, rev capability, and tuning headroom, establishing it as a respected package in manufacturer-supported racing programs, and independent teams quickly adopted it for club-level and regional championships.</p>

<p> Honda continues to use the K series engine family because the architecture supports modern efficiency targets, strong durability expectations, and flexible integration with hybrid systems, which gives the company a stable foundation for future models across global segments. Honda engineers designed the K layout with a rigid aluminum block, efficient cooling circuits, and low-friction internals, which gives them room to meet tougher emissions rules without redesigning the core structure.</p>    <p>The engine handles high compression ratios, turbocharging, and extended thermal loads with consistent reliability, which helps Honda control warranty exposure and maintain brand trust.

<p>Honda doesn't currently apply its K Series engine to its hybrid portfolio, but this is a factor that can easily change as the brand takes a more aggressive approach to hybridization. Although unconfirmed, it has already expressed a desire to electrify the likes of future Civic Type R and Integra Type S models. The engine supports     <span data-id="2024582"><a href="https://www.topspeed.com/commuter-cars-of-each-decade/" target="_blank">efficient Atkinson cycle</a></span> tuning for hybrid configurations, which boosts fuel economy without harming long-term durability. Honda also values the deep supply chain that supports K series production because it reduces cost and improves manufacturing consistency across multiple regions.    </p>    <p>The engine responds well to continuous improvement, so Honda updates injectors, turbo hardware, valve timing control, and cooling strategies without major structural changes. This approach helps Honda limit development time while raising efficiency and performance for each new generation. Engineers also appreciate the serviceability of the layout because it simplifies maintenance for dealers and     <span data-id="2022904"><a href="https://www.topspeed.com/cheapest-car-to-own-in-2025/" target="_blank">reduces ownership cost for owners</a></span>. Ultimately, the L-Series will be the cornerstone of its future strategies, as it has proven to be a better fit for both hybridization and turbocharging, but the K range's impressive performance abilities, resilience, and market appeal makes it too good an engine for the brand to just ignore.    </p>    <blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Lately I’ve been reading <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/">Sean Goedecke’s</a> essays on being a Staff+ engineer. His work (particularly <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/the-spotlight/">Software engineering under the spotlight</a> and <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/not-your-codebase/">It’s Not Your Codebase</a>) is razor-sharp and feels painfully familiar to anyone in Big Tech.</p><p>On paper, I fit the mold he describes: I’m a Senior Staff engineer at Google. Yet, reading his work left me with a lingering sense of unease. At first, I dismissed this as cynicism. After reflecting, however, I realized the problem wasn’t Sean’s writing but my reading.</p><p>Sean isn’t being bleak; he is accurately describing how to deal with a world where engineers are fungible assets and priorities shift quarterly. But my job looks nothing like that and I know deep down that if I tried to operate in that environment or in the way he described I’d burn out <strong>within months</strong>.</p><p>Instead I’ve followed an alternate path, one that optimizes for <strong>systems over spotlights</strong>, and <strong>stewardship over fungibility</strong>.</p><h2 id="we-live-in-different-worlds">We Live in Different Worlds</h2><p>The foundational reason for our diverging paths is that Sean and I operate in entirely different worlds with different laws governing them.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/about">Sean’s resume</a>, my understanding is that he has primarily worked in <strong>product</strong> teams <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> building for external customers. Business goals pivot quarterly, and success is measured by revenue or MAU. Optimizing for the “Spotlight” makes complete sense in this environment. Product development at big tech scale is a crowded room: VPs, PMs and UX designers all have strong opinions. To succeed, you <em>have</em> to be agile and ensure you are working specifically on what executives are currently looking at.</p><p>On the other hand, I’ve spent my entire career much more behind the scenes: in <strong>developer tools and infra</strong> teams.</p><p>My team’s customers are thousands of engineers in Android, Chrome, and throughout Google <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. End users of Google products don’t even know we exist; our focus is on making sure developers have the tools to collect product and performance metrics and debug issues using detailed traces.</p><p>In this environment, our relationship with leadership is very different. We’re never the “hot project everyone wants,” so execs are not fighting to work with us. In fact, my team has historically struggled to hire PMs. The PM career ladder at Google incentivizes splashy external launches so we cannot provide good “promotion material” for them. Also, our feedback comes directly from engineers. Adding a PM in the middle causes a loss in translation, slowing down a tight, high-bandwidth feedback loop.</p><p>All of this together means our team operates “bottom-up”: instead of execs telling us “you should do X”, we figure out what we think will have the most impact to our customers and work on building those features and tools. Execs ensure that we’re <em>actually</em> solving these problems by considering our impact on more product facing teams.</p><h2 id="compounding-returns-of-stewardship">Compounding Returns of Stewardship</h2><p>In the product environments Sean describes, where goals pivot quarterly and features are often experimental, <strong>speed</strong> is the ultimate currency. You need to ship, iterate, and often move on before the market shifts. But in Infrastructure and Developer Experience, <strong>context</strong> is the currency.</p><p>Treating engineers as fungible assets destroys context. You might gain fresh eyes, but you lose the implicit knowledge of how systems actually break. Stewardship, staying with a system long-term, unlocks compounding returns that are impossible to achieve on a short rotation.</p><p>The first is efficiency via <strong>pattern matching</strong>. When you stay in one domain for years, new requests are rarely truly “new.” I am not just debugging code; I am debugging the intersection of my tools and hundreds of diverse engineering teams. When a new team comes to me with a “unique” problem, I can often reach back in time: <em>“We tried this approach in 2021 with the Camera team; here is exactly why it failed, and here is the architecture that actually works”.</em></p><p>But the more powerful return is <strong>systemic innovation</strong>. If you rotate teams every year, you are limited to solving acute bugs that are visible <em>right now</em>. Some problems, however, only reveal their shape over long horizons.</p><p>Take <strong>Bigtrace</strong>, a project I recently led; it was a solution that emerged solely because I stuck around long enough to see the shape of the problem:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Start of 2023 (Observation):</strong> I began noticing a pattern. Teams across Google were collecting terabytes or even petabytes of performance traces, but they were struggling to process them. Engineers were writing brittle, custom pipelines to parse data, often complaining about how slow and painful it was to iterate on their analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Most of 2023 (Research):</strong> I didn’t jump to build a production system. Instead, I spent the best part of a year prototyping quietly in the background while working on other projects. I gathered feedback from these same engineers who had complained and because I had established long-term relationships, they gave me honest and introspective feedback. I learned what sort of UX, latency and throughput requirements they had and figured out how I could meet them.</p></li><li><p><strong>End of 2023 to Start of 2024 (Execution):</strong> We built and launched Bigtrace, a distributed big data query engine for traces. Today, it processes over <strong>2 billion traces a month</strong> and is a critical part of the daily workflow for 100+ engineers.</p></li></ul><p>If I had followed the advice to “optimize for fungibility” (i.e. if I had switched teams in 2023 to chase a new project) <strong>Bigtrace would not exist.</strong></p><p>Instead, I would have left during the research phase and my successor would have seen the same “noise” of engineers complaining. But without the historical context to recognize a missing puzzle piece, I think they would have struggled to build something like Bigtrace.</p><h2 id="the-power-of-no">The Power of “No”</h2><p>One of the most seductive arguments for chasing the “Spotlight” is that it guarantees resources and executive attention. But that attention is a double-edged sword.</p><p>High-visibility projects are often volatile. They come with shifting executive whims, political maneuvering, and often end up in situations where long-term quality is sacrificed for short-term survival. For some engineers, navigating this chaos is a thrill. For those of us who care about system stability, it feels like a trap.</p><p>The advantage of stewardship is that it generates a different kind of capital: <strong>trust</strong>. When you have spent years delivering reliable tools, you earn the political capital to say “No” to the spotlight when it threatens the product.</p><p>Recently, the spotlight has been on AI. Every team is under pressure to incorporate it. We have been asked repeatedly: <em>“Why don’t you integrate LLMs into Perfetto?”</em> If I were optimizing for visibility, the answer would be obvious: build an LLM wrapper, demo it to leadership, and claim we are “AI-first.” It would be an easy win for my career.</p><p>But as a steward of the system, I know that one of Perfetto’s core values is <strong>precision</strong>. When a kernel developer is debugging a race condition, they need exact timestamps, not a hallucination. Users trust that when we tell them “X is the problem” that it actually <em>is</em> the problem and they’re not going to go chasing their tail for the next week, debugging an issue which doesn’t exist.</p><p>But it’s important not to take this too far: skepticism shouldn’t become obstructionism. With AI, it’s not “no forever” but “not until it can be done right” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>A spotlight-seeking engineer might view this approach as a missed opportunity; I view it as protecting what makes our product great: user trust.</p><h2 id="the-alternate-currency-of-impact">The Alternate Currency of Impact</h2><p>The most common fear engineers have about leaving the “Spotlight” is career stagnation. The logic goes: <em>If I’m not launching flashy features at Google I/O, and my work isn’t on my VP’s top 5 list, how will I ever get promoted to Staff+?</em></p><p>It is true that you lose the currency of “Executive Visibility.” But in infrastructure, you gain two alternate currencies that are just as valuable, and potentially more stable.</p><p><strong>Shadow Hierarchy</strong></p><p>In a product organization, you often need to impress your manager’s manager. In an infrastructure organization, you need to impress <strong>your customers’ managers</strong>.</p><p>I call this the <strong>Shadow Hierarchy.</strong> You don’t need <em>your</em> VP to understand the intricacies of your code. You need the Staff+ Engineers in <em>other</em> critical organizations to <strong>need</strong> your tools.</p><p>When a Senior Staff Engineer in Pixel tells their VP, <em>“We literally cannot debug the next Pixel phone without Perfetto”</em>, that statement carries immense weight. It travels up their reporting chain, crosses over at the Director/VP level, and comes back down to your manager.</p><p>This kind of advocacy is powerful because it is technical, not political. It is hard to fake. When you are a steward of a critical system, your promotion packet is filled with testimonials from the most respected engineers in the company saying, <em>“This person’s work enabled our success”.</em></p><p><strong>Utility Ledger</strong></p><p>While product teams might be poring over daily active users or revenue, we rely on metrics tracking <strong>engineering health</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Utility:</strong> Every bug fixed using our tools is an engineer finding us useful. It is the purest measure of utility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Criticality:</strong> If the Pixel team uses Perfetto to debug a launch-blocking stutter, or Chrome uses it to fix a memory leak, our impact is implicitly tied to their success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ubiquity:</strong> Capturing a significant percentage of the engineering population proves you’ve created a technical “lingua franca”. This becomes especially obvious when you see disconnected parts of the company collaborating with each other, using shared Perfetto traces as a “reference everyone understands”.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scale:</strong> Ingesting petabytes of data or processing billions of traces proves architectural resilience better than any design doc.</p></li></ul><p>When you combine <strong>Criticality</strong> (VIP teams need this) with <strong>Utility</strong> (bugs are being fixed), you create a promotion case that is immune to executive reorganizations.</p><h2 id="archetypes-and-agency">Archetypes and Agency</h2><p><strong>Staff Archetypes</strong></p><p>I am far from the first to notice the idea of “there are multiple ways to be a staff software engineer”. In his book <em><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/">Staff Engineer</a></em>, Will Larson categorizes Staff-plus engineers into four distinct archetypes.</p><p>Sean describes the <strong>Solver</strong> or the <strong>Right Hand</strong>: engineers who act as agents of executive will, dropping into fires and moving on once the problem is stabilized. I am describing the <strong>Architect</strong> or the <strong>Tech Lead</strong>: roles defined by long-term ownership of a specific domain and deep technical context.</p><p><strong>The “Luck” Rebuttal</strong></p><p>I can hear the criticism already: <em>“You just got lucky finding your team. Most of us don’t have that luxury.”</em></p><p>There are two caveats to all my advice in this post. First, the strategy I have employed so far requires a company profitable enough to sustain long-term infrastructure. This path generally does not exist in startups or early growth companies; it is optimized for Big Tech.</p><p>Second, luck <em>does</em> play a role in landing on a good team. It is very hard to accurately evaluate team and company culture from the outside. But while finding the team might have involved luck, staying there for almost a decade was a <strong>choice</strong>.</p><p>And, at least in my experience, my team is not particularly special: I can name five other teams in Android alone <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Sure, they might have a director change here or a VP change there, but the core mission and the engineering team remained stable.</p><p>The reason these teams seem rare is not that they don’t exist, but that they are often ignored. Because they don’t offer the rapid, visible “wins” of a product launch nor are they working on the “shiny cool features”, they attract less competition. If you are motivated by “shipping to billions of users” or seeing your friends and family use something you built, you won’t find that satisfaction here. That is the price of admission.</p><p>But if you want to build long-term systems and are willing to trade external validation for deep technical ownership, you just need to look behind the curtain.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The tech industry loves to tell you to move fast. But there is another path. It is a path where leverage comes from depth, patience, and the quiet satisfaction of building the foundation that others stand on.</p><p>You don’t have to chase the spotlight to have a meaningful, high-impact career at a big company. Sometimes, the most ambitious thing you can do is stay put, dig in, and build something that lasts. To sit with a problem space for years until you understand it well enough to build a Bigtrace.</p></section><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, you can <a href="https://lalitm.com/page/about/#subscribe">subscribe</a> to my weekly roundup of recent posts, or follow via <a href="https://lalitm.com/index.xml">RSS</a>.</em></p></div>]]></description>

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (December 4, 1995) -- Netscape Communications
Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:SUNW), today
announced JavaScript, an open, cross-platform object scripting language
for the creation and customization of applications on enterprise networks
and the Internet.  The JavaScript language complements Java, Sun's
industry-leading object-oriented, cross-platform programming language.  The
initial version of JavaScript is available now as part of the beta version
of Netscape Navigator 2.0, which is currently available for downloading
from Netscape's web site.
</p><p>
In addition, 28 industry-leading companies, including America Online, Inc.,
Apple Computer, Inc., Architext Software, Attachmate Corporation, AT&amp;T;,
Borland International, Brio Technology, Inc., Computer Associates, Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, Iconovex
Corporation, Illustra Information Technologies, Inc., Informix Software,
Inc., Intuit, Inc., Macromedia, Metrowerks, Inc., Novell, Inc., Oracle
Corporation, Paper Software, Inc., Precept Software, Inc., RAD
Technologies, Inc., The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc., Silicon Graphics, Inc.,
Spider Technologies, Sybase, Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Verity, Inc., and
Vermeer Technologies, Inc., have endorsed JavaScript as an open
standard object scripting language and intend to provide it in future products.  The draft
specification of JavaScript, as well as the final draft specification of
Java, is planned for publishing and submission to appropriate standards
bodies for industry review and comment this month.
</p><p>
JavaScript is an easy-to-use object scripting language designed for
creating live online applications that link together objects and resources
on both clients and servers.  While Java is used by programmers to create
new objects and applets, JavaScript is designed for use by HTML page
authors and enterprise application developers to dynamically script the
behavior of objects running on either the client or the server.  JavaScript
is analogous to Visual Basic in that it can be used by people with little
or no programming experience to quickly construct complex applications.
JavaScript's design represents the next generation of software designed
specifically for the Internet and is:
</p><ul>
        <li>  designed for creating network-centric applications
        </li><li>  complementary to and integrated with Java
        </li><li>  complementary to and integrated with HTML
        </li><li>  open and cross-platform.
</li></ul>
Java, developed by Sun, is an object-oriented programming language that
operates independent of any operating system or microprocessor.  Java
programs called applets can be transmitted over a network and run on any
client, providing the multimedia richness of a CD-ROM over corporate
networks and the Internet.  Java has been widely hailed by programmers
because it eliminates the need to port applications, and by managers of
information systems for its potential to lower the costs of distributing
and maintaining applications across the network.

<p>
With JavaScript, an HTML page might contain an intelligent form that
performs loan payment or currency exchange calculations right on the client
in response to user input. A multimedia weather forecast applet written in
Java can be scripted by JavaScript to display appropriate images and sounds
based on the current weather readings in a region.  A server-side
JavaScript script might pull data out of a relational database and format
it in HTML on the fly.  A page might contain JavaScript scripts that run on
both the client and the server.  On the server, the scripts might
dynamically compose and format HTML content based on user preferences
stored in a relational database, and on the client, the scripts would glue
together an assortment of Java applets and HTML form elements into a live
interactive user interface for specifying a net-wide search for
information.
</p><p>
Java programs and JavaScript scripts are designed to run on both clients
and servers, with JavaScript scripts used to modify the properties and
behavior of Java objects, so the range of live online applications that
dynamically present information to and interact with users over enterprise
networks or the Internet is virtually unlimited.  Netscape will support
Java and JavaScript in client and server products as well as programming
tools and applications to make this vision a reality.
</p><p>
"Programmers have been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Java because it
was designed from the ground up for the Internet.  JavaScript is a natural
fit, since it's also designed for the Internet and Unicode-based worldwide
use," said Bill Joy, co-founder and vice president of research at Sun.
"JavaScript will be the most effective method to connect HTML-based content
to Java applets."
</p><p>
Netscape's authoring and application development tools  -- Netscape
Navigator Gold 2.0, Netscape LiveWire and Netscape LiveWire Pro  -- are
designed for rapid development and deployment of JavaScript applications.
Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 enables developers to create and edit
JavaScript scripts, while Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs to
be installed, run and managed on Netscape servers, both within the
enterprise and across the Internet.  Netscape LiveWire Pro adds support for
JavaScript
connectivity to high-performance relational databases from Illustra,
Informix, Microsoft, Oracle and Sybase.  Java and JavaScript support are
being built into all Netscape products to provide a unified, front-to-back,
client/server/tool environment for building and deploying live online

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>OldUnreal just posted this announcement on their <a href="https://discord.gg/thURucxzs6">Discord</a>:</p>

<p>"Welcome Back, Unreal Tournament 2004!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Some of you were probably wondering why we've been so quiet in the past couple of months. Today, we can finally reveal (part of) the answer: we've been working on a new side project! With Epic's blessing and with the help of some new team members, we are bringing Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004) back.</p>

<p>This means that we are going to publish an installer that downloads the original disc image for UT2004, installs the game, and applies patches to it. We are also going to start publishing patches that modernize the game, make it compatible with Windows Vista or later, Linux x86-64 and aarch64 (Raspberry Pi and similar), and Mac OS 10.9 or later, fix bugs, and implement quality-of-life changes.</p>

<p>Yes, you read that right. <strong>UT2004 will soon be available to download once again. Free of charge.</strong> This is a community-run effort but we’re excited to make the game easier to access and play again. We have been working on this for quite some time now and have made enough progress to start inviting the first batch of testers.</p>

<p>Highlights so far include:</p>

<ul>
<li>We now natively support modern Linux and macOS systems with 64-bit Intel and ARM/Apple CPUs</li>
<li>You can now play the game or run a server on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, albeit at a lower frame rate than on a PC!</li>
<li>The Linux and macOS distributions of the patch now include a fully functional UCC with an UnrealScript compiler (UCC make) and texture compression support</li>
<li>The Linux and macOS distributions now use SDL3 instead of SDL1</li>
<li>D3D9Drv and fullscreen support are fully functional in the Windows 64-bit client</li>
<li>We dealt our first (minor) blow to the editor goblin! We fixed several crash bugs, restored some broken functionality, and, most importantly, the editor will no longer freeze for several seconds when you click a viewport</li>
</ul>

<p>❓ Q&amp;A ❓</p>

<p>Some questions might have popped into your head as you read this news. Let us try to answer some of them.</p>

<p>Q: Will the OldUnreal patches be compatible with the latest official version of the game?</p>

<p>A: Yes, for the most part. Unpatched clients can play on patched servers and patched clients can play on unpatched servers.</p>

<p>Most mods should also continue to work as before. The only exceptions are mods that perform game version checks and exclude players with unknown game versions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, AntiTCC is one of those mods.</p>

<p>Q: Will AntiTCC be updated to support the new patches?</p>

<p>A: Yes. Wormbo gave us permission to update AntiTCC. This is still a work in progress, though.</p>

<p>Q: As a server admin, how do I ensure that players with the new version can continue to play on my servers?</p>

<p>A: We're aware of a network compatibility problem caused by an unofficial patch.</p>

<p>This problem results in players with the new version not being able to connect to (some) old servers.</p>

<p>You can mitigate this problem by (re)installing the official 3369.3 version of the offending files on your server.</p>

<p>Similarly, players that have installed this unofficial patch might need to reinstall the official 3369.3 files to play on updated servers.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we're looking into an alternative solution that does not require reinstalling the 3369.3 patch.</p>

<p>Q: Can I apply the OldUnreal patch to the retail version of the game?</p>

<p>A: On Windows: absolutely. Do keep in mind, however, that we do not support 32-bit CPUs.</p>

<p>On other platforms, your mileage may vary. Patching existing Linux/Mac OS X/macOS installations of the game is possible, but it could require a fair amount of manual effort.</p>

<p>We recommend installing the game from scratch following the instructions we provide in our README.</p>

<p>Q: What are your plans for the near future?</p>

<p>A: We are going to address the rough edges and unfinished features in the new version, and try our best to publish a preview installer and patch ASAP.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we will also work on some quality-of-life improvements and on the long list of editor fixes we want to port over from our other projects.</p>

<p>Q: What is the timeline?</p>

<p>A: We are currently inviting server admins and modders to join our internal tester group. We're aiming to release a public test version within the next two months.</p>

<p>Q: How can I contribute?</p>

<p>A: We will be needing testers in the near future. Keep an eye on our Discord server to see when.</p>

<p>Q: Are you getting paid for this project?</p>

<p>A: No. We're doing this for free because we're fans of the game and we like a challenge. In fact, projects like these cost us a bit of money for server hosting, software licenses and subscriptions, certificates, etc, as we independently operate the games ourselves.</p>

<p>Q: Who is responsible for this project?</p>

<p>A: The main developers of the Windows installer and the patches are Buggie, Marco/Dots, Deaod, Metallicafan212, Piglet, CacoFFF, AnthraX, and Smirftsch.</p>

<p>The patch also includes contributions from Wormbo, Shambler, and Ryan C. Gordon (icculus).</p>

<p>We would also like to thank Epic for making this possible.</p>

<p>Please direct all support requests or questions to [us/OldUnreal], not Epic Games."</p>

      <p>by <strong>Samir Talwar</strong></p>
      <p>Tuesday, 25 November 2025 at 09:00 CET</p>

      <p>I remember my first job vividly.</p>
      <p>It helps, of course, that I still consider many of the people I worked with friends, and I know some of them even still read this blog. (Hi!)</p>
      <p>I also think it might have been the beginning of the end. At least, as programming is concerned.</p>
      <h2>Programming in 2025</h2>
      <p>It’s 2025. We write JavaScript with types now. It runs not just in a browser, but on Linux. It has a dependency manager, and in true JavaScript style, there’s a central repository which anyone can push anything to. Nowadays it’s mostly used to inject Bitcoin miners or ransomware onto unsuspecting servers, but you might find a useful utility to pad a string if you need it.</p>
      <p>We don’t <em>write</em> the JavaScript, of course. We ask an autocorrect machine to make it up, and complain at it until it generates something plausible enough. Often, it does, and it only installs a malicious package 20% of the time. 30%, tops.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, when we do need to make manual changes, our editor has our back. The most popular is “VS Code”, which needs only a few gigabytes of RAM to render the text. It ships a web browser, because everything ships a web browser. It can also perform fancy refactoring techniques such as renaming a variable (in a single file).</p>
      <p>In order to test our application, we build it regularly. On a modern computer, with approximately 16 cores, each running at 3 GHz, TypeScript only takes a few seconds to compile and run.</p>
      <p>Once our work is done, we create a “pull request”. This is a way of emulating open-source development inside a single company, which as we know, is the only way to work. Typically, this means that the code is downloaded and built on another computer, and then several hours later, a colleague will come along and ask to change a few words. Once we change these words, the computer builds everything again, and then the next day, the same colleague will allow the code to be merged into the mainline.</p>
      <p>Once it’s merged, we take that JavaScript and package it into a “container”, which is a fancy word for “kitchen sink”. The packaging process takes 20 minutes, because for reasons no one understands, we download the entirety of the Debian package repository every time we do it.</p>
      <p>We also download all the JavaScript dependencies again, of course.</p>
      <p>Then, we take that container, and attempt to push it to a “registry”. Sometimes it works, sometimes a security scanner complains because we have an insecure version of Perl in the container. We don’t need Perl in the container, but it’s there, and no one knows how to get rid of it. So we turn off the scanner.</p>
      <p>Next, we write a lot of YAML to tell something called “k8s” how to run the container. (“K8s” used to stand for something but ever since the wars of 2019, we don’t have enough letters to spell it out, and the true meaning has been lost to time.) Unlike the JavaScript, the YAML is not type-checked, and in fact <em>cannot</em> be, because we use a string templating language to stick bits of YAML inside other YAML. We all agree that this is the best kind of programming.</p>
      <p>We run our k8s cluster in the “Cloud”. It’s a bunch of services that run on Linux, but we don’t run Linux ourselves, we run it on VMs that we rent by the hour for approximately the same cost as buying a computer outright every month. We do this because no one knows how to plug a computer in any more.</p>
      <p>We send the YAML to the cluster, which eats it up, digests it, and then does something random. Hopefully, it will run a program. It might also reject it, run a different program, or shut down something else. As there’s no way of testing this except doing it, there’s no way of telling.</p>
      <p>We therefore have an entirely separate cluster that we use to verify that our sacrifice to the YAML gods is holy.</p>
      <p>There was some programming in here somewhere, but I don’t really remember where.</p>
      <h2>Fifteen years ago</h2>
      <p>Turns out, I’m old now. But not so old that I’ve forgotten how things have changed.</p>
      <p>I started my first <em>real</em>, full-time job in 2010.</p>
      <p>We wrote Java, which is a general-purpose, highly-verbose programming language. It’s mostly type-safe (except <code>null</code>, which we did our best to avoid), and achieves this by making you type out everything so many times and verifying that you didn’t make any mistakes.</p>
      <p>Like JavaScript, it’s fast to compile, taking only a few seconds as well. Of course, this was on my single-core, 2 GHz computer.</p>
      <p>The editor was cool too. We used Eclipse, which was a bit like VS Code. It could also perform refactoring techniques, though it was a bit smarter: it could extract and inline functions, classes, interfaces, etc. It also compiled the code as you typed, so often, you could compile the application and run the tests on every keystroke.</p>
      <p>We wrote tests, of course. Usually first, and ran them constantly. We did this using a strange method called “talking to each other”, in which we’d discuss the functionality at hand, and write it down in code so it could be verified. We’d run these tests constantly; it’d usually take around a minute to run all 10,000 unit tests, but you could be a bit more selective if you were in a hurry.</p>
      <p>Funnily enough, everything ran at about the same speed as it does now. Strange, that.</p>
      <p>Of course, we pushed code directly to trunk. We were pairing, after all. We’d then start work on the next thing, perhaps after a coffee break. Typically, we’d let a tester know so they could check out the changes and take a look.</p>
      <p>Now, we didn’t have containers, so we made these things called “JARs”, which is a big zip file of the application and all its dependencies, pulled from Maven Central. (Maven Central is a bit like NPM but for Java, and also actually vetted submitters and their domain names before allowing them to publish.) This produces a different kind of dependency hell to containers, and I would not wish it upon anybody, but it did, at least, kind of work.</p>
      <p>We’d run that inside a Java server, such as Apache Tomcat, on a Linux VM, on a computer. Deployment was done through “Puppet”; nowadays you’d use Ansible, but whatever.</p>
      <p>The computer was inside a datacentre.</p>
      <p>The datacentre was down the road. If the computer broke, we could go and turn it off and on again.</p>
      <p>And here’s the funny thing: it never broke, because the person who built it did it well, because it wasn’t taxed within an inch of its life, and because we were keeping an eye on it.</p>
      <h2>I miss those days</h2>
      <p>I think back to those days, and remember writing Java, pairing with my old colleagues.</p>
      <p>We were good at it, but the tools also had our backs. Eclipse was dependable; it did so much amazing stuff that I haven’t seen since. Maven is a thoughtful approach to dependency management that solved several problems (such as namespacing, and trust) in elegant ways, and no one has even tried to copy them. And I really, really miss deploying to a real computer, which I own, and can touch.</p>
      <p>It astonishes me every time I realise that builds and deployment have become <em>slower</em> in the last 15 years, not faster. I was able to go from code to shipping in less than a minute back then, and now, it takes hours, or sometimes <em>days</em> to get it merged and deployed. Even pushing an application to k8s is an ordeal. Especially if everything has to go through a staging environment first.</p>
      <p>I don’t really understand why we’ve stopped hiring testers, but I wish we could get back to it. I like having people around who are good at breaking things. It makes me feel safe when they’re on my side.</p>
      <p>Now, some things are better. I’d much rather use Git than Subversion. I actually quite like containers, when they’re built well (i.e. not with a Dockerfile), and deployed sensibly. And I think the Cloud is useful, up to a point, especially when starting out.</p>
      <p>But this world… I do not like it.</p>
      <h2>Where did it all go wrong?</h2>
      <p>I have been trying to figure out what happened, and I think I can point to the catalyst.</p>
      <p>NPM happened.</p>
      <p>Now, this doesn’t mean it’s NPM’s fault, it just means that it made it possible.</p>
      <p>You see, with NPM, node.js (and therefore JavaScript) became a serious programming language, which is both a blessing and a curse.</p>
      <p>We also saw the rise of React, which is possibly the greatest tragedy to ever befall front-end programming (and I say this as a recovering React fan).</p>
      <p>And then, because we could create applications in the browser, we got Electron. Now everything’s a browser!</p>
      <p>I love writing JavaScript, and I’m glad I can run it on the server. But this doesn’t mean I think it’s a good idea to use it for everything.</p>
      <p>I would really like to reset, and go back to using a sensible tool for the job at hand.</p>
      <p>Just a little.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>You have long ago abandoned the JavaScript trademark, and it is causing
widespread, unwarranted confusion and disruption.</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript is the world’s most popular programming language, powering websites
everywhere. Yet, few of the millions who program in it realize that JavaScript
is a trademark you, Oracle, control. The disconnect is glaring: JavaScript has
become a general-purpose term used by countless individuals and companies,
independent of any Oracle product.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle’s hold on the JavaScript trademark clearly fits the legal definition of
trademark abandonment</strong>. A previous
<a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark">blog post</a> addressed this issue, requesting
that you, Oracle, release the trademark. Unsurprisingly, the request was met
with silence. It is therefore time to take active steps in order to bring the
JavaScript trademark into the public domain, where it belongs.</p>
<h2>Trademark abandonment</h2>
<p>Title 15 of the United States Code, section 1127, states:</p>

Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining abandonment under

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>In the case of JavaScript, both criteria apply</strong>.</p>
<h2>Netscape, Sun, Oracle</h2>
<p>The JavaScript trademark is currently held by Oracle America, Inc.
(<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">US Serial Number: 75026640, US Registration Number: 2416017</a>).
How did this come to be?</p>
<p>In 1995, Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems to create interactive
websites. Brendan Eich famously spent only 10 days creating the first version of
JavaScript, a dynamic programming language with a rough syntactic lineage from
Sun’s Java language. As a result of this partnership, Sun held the JavaScript
trademark. In 2009, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and the JavaScript
trademark as a result.</p>
<p>The trademark is simply a relic of this acquisition. Neither Sun nor Oracle has
ever built a product using the mark. Legal staff, year after year, have renewed
the trademark without question. It’s likely that only a few within Oracle even
know they possess the JavaScript trademark, and even if they do, they likely
don’t understand the frustration it causes within the developer community.</p>
<h2>Use it or lose it</h2>
<p><strong>Oracle has abandoned the JavaScript trademark through nonuse.</strong></p>
<p>Oracle has never seriously offered a product called JavaScript. In the 1990s and
early 2000s, Netscape Navigator, which supported JavaScript as a browser
feature, was a key player. However, Netscape’s usage and influence faded by
2003, and the browser saw its final release in 2008. JavaScript, meanwhile,
evolved into a widely used, independent programming language, embedded in
multiple browsers, entirely separate from Oracle.</p>
<p>The most recent
<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">specimen</a>,
filed with the USPTO in 2019, references <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> (a
project created by Ryan Dahl, the author of this letter) and Oracle’s
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html">JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)</a>.
But Node.js is not an Oracle product, and JET is merely a set of JavaScript
libraries for Oracle services, particularly Oracle Cloud. There are millions of
JavaScript libraries; JET is not special.</p>
<p>(Oracle is not even a member of the OpenJS Foundation - the body that the
Node.js project lives under now. Nor does Oracle have any involvement whatsoever
in the development of Node.js.)</p>
<p>Oracle also offers <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/">GraalVM</a>, a JVM that
can execute JavaScript, among other languages. But GraalVM is far from a
canonical JavaScript implementation; engines like V8, JavaScriptCore, and
SpiderMonkey hold that role. GraalVM’s product page doesn’t even mention
“JavaScript”; you must dig into the documentation to find its support.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle’s use of JavaScript in GraalVM and JET does not reflect genuine use of
the trademark.</strong> These weak connections do not satisfy the requirement for
consistent, real-world use in trade.</p>
<h2>A generic term</h2>
<p>A mark can also be considered abandoned if it becomes a generic term.</p>
<p>In 1996, Netscape
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981203070212/http://cgi.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease289.html">announced</a>
a meeting of the ECMA International standards organization to standardize the
JavaScript programming language. Sun (now Oracle), refused to give up the
“JavaScript” mark for this use though, so it was decided that the language would
be called “ECMAScript” instead. (Microsoft happily offered up “JScript”, but
no-one else wanted that.) Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and a
co-signatory of this letter,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200621202321/https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2006-October/000133.html">wrote in 2006</a>
that “<em>ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin
disease</em>.”</p>
<p>Ecma International formed TC39, a technical steering committee, which publishes
ECMA-262, the specification for JavaScript. This committee includes participants
from all major browsers, like Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and Mozilla’s
Firefox, as well as representatives from server-side JavaScript runtimes like
Node.js and Deno.</p>
<p>Oracle’s ownership of the JavaScript trademark only causes confusion. The term
“JavaScript” is used freely by millions of developers, companies, and
organizations around the world, with no interference from Oracle. Oracle has
done nothing to assert its rights over the JavaScript name, likely because they
do not believe their claim to the mark would hold up in court. Unlike typical
trademark holders who protect their trademarks by extracting licensing fees or
enforcing usage restrictions, Oracle has allowed the JavaScript name to be used
by anyone. This inaction further supports the argument that the trademark has
lost its significance and has become generic.</p>
<p>Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community
organizations. These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced
to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around—for
example, <a href="https://jsconf.com/">JSConf</a>. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark
challenge against Oracle, there can be no “JavaScript Conference” nor a
“JavaScript Specification.” The world’s most popular programming language cannot
even have a conference in its name.</p>
<p><strong>There is a vast misalignment between the trademark’s ownership and its
widespread, generic use</strong>.</p>
<h2>Free the mark</h2>
<p><strong>By law, a trademark is abandoned if it is either not used or becomes a generic
term. Both apply to JavaScript.</strong></p>
<p>It’s time for the USPTO to end the JavaScript trademark and recognize it as a
generic name for the world’s most popular programming language, which has
multiple implementations across the industry.</p>
<p>Oracle, you likely have no real business interest in the mark. It’s renewed
simply because legal staff are obligated to renew all trademarks, regardless of
their relevance or use.</p>
<p>We urge you to release the mark into the public domain. However, asking nicely
has been <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark">tried before</a>, and it was met with
silence. If you do not act, we will challenge your ownership by filing a
petition for cancellation with the USPTO.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.

                                            Each machine joins a WireGuard mesh network with automatic peer discovery

                                            across machines.

                                            Unlike traditional orchestrators, there's no central control plane to
                                            maintain. Each machine maintains a synchronised copy of the cluster
                                            state
                                            through peer-to-peer communication, keeping cluster operations
                                            functional
                                            even if some machines go offline.

Dec 3, 2025</p>
<p>Why WinQuake exists and how it works</p><hr>
 

<p>When I took a look at the history of Quake binaries, they all made sense to me. <code>quake.exe</code> was the original release, able to run on DOS and Windows 95. Then came <code>vquake.exe</code> to support the hardware accelerated chip Vérité 1000. Later, <code>glquake.exe</code> generalized hardware acceleration to any vendor providing OpenGL drivers. And to revolutionize Internet deathmatch, id Software released QuakeWorld server and client (<code>qwsv.exe</code> and <code>qwcl.exe</code>).</p>

<p>However, I could not figure out the point of <code>winquake.exe</code>. Until now. Here is what I understood and a little bit of a dive into how it works.</p>

<p>Quake.exe performance</p><hr><p><code>quake.exe</code> runs on both DOS and Windows 95 but how well does it perform? A quick benchmark on my Pentium MMX 233MHz, Matrox Mystique PC (320x200 with 101 screen size) and sound on, showed the following numbers.</p>


<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Configuration</th>
    <th>Framerate</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>quake.exe</code> started from DOS</td>
    <td>
      <span>
         <b>48 fps</b>
      </span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>quake.exe</code> started from Windows 95</td>
    <td>
       <span>
         <b>38 fps</b>
      </span>
     </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<!-- <pre>

233 Mhz quake,exe under dos   48 
        quake,exe under win   38  
</pre> -->
<p>So "framerate" is the beginning of an answer to justify the existence of WinQuake. <code>quake.exe</code> running from <i>Windows 95</i> is roughly 25% slower than the same binary started from DOS. And that is to be expected. <i>Windows 95</i> runs DOS applications in a virtual machine ("DOS BOX"), where memory access, interrupts, and signals are virtualized, which incurs overhead.</p>

<p>Another element of the answer comes from <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake_chunnel">Quake Chunnel</a>. <code>quake.exe</code> can access Windows 95 TCP/IP stack, but only via a convoluted tech from Mpath to bridge a "DOS BOX" to win32 dlls. By having a win32-only application, id Software had guaranteed direct access to <code>winsock.dll</code>.</p>

<p>Last but not least, id Software really wanted Quake to work on Windows NT. Despite their best efforts, the people at DJGPP could not make their DPMI client in <code>quake.exe</code> compatible with the NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM).</p>

  
  <blockquote>
Near pointers don't work under NT - which was a huge disappointment to iD and generated some conference calls to Microsoft.
        
        <p>- Charles Sandmann<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>



<p>How winquake.exe works</p><hr><p>A fun way to start exploring is to first read <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/WQREADME.TXT">WQREADME.TXT</a> and then take a look at all the modes available in <code>winquake.exe</code>. They are configured with the script <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/WQ.BAT">wq.bat</a>.</p>

<pre>Options for running WinQuake:
 wq max:      all features on, but doesn't work on all systems
 wq fast:     maximum speed, but doesn't work on all systems
 wq fastvid:  maximum video speed, but safer, probably slower sound
 wq fastsnd:  maximum sound speed, but safer, probably slower video
 wq safe:     very likely to run, but may be slower
 wq verysafe: almost sure to run, but probably slower, and no sound
</pre>  

<p>Here are the numbers I got for each mode, still with the same Pentium MMX 233MHz machine and same configuration.</p>


<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Configuration</th>
    <th>Framerate</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>wq max</code></td>
    <td>42.4 fps&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq fast</code></td>
    <td>41.8 fps&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq fastvid</code></td>
    <td>
  
      <span>
         <b>45.0 fps&nbsp;</b>
      </span>
    </td> 
    
  
  </tr> 
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq fastsnd</code></td>
    <td>41.8 fps&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq safe</code>
    </td>
    <td>
          <span>
         <b>45.0 fps&nbsp;</b>
      </span>
  </td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq verysafe</code>
    </td>
    
    <td>
    <span>
         <b>40.0 fps*</b>
      </span>
  </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>Impressive. <code>winquake.exe</code> managed to bring up the framerate within 6% of <code>quake.exe</code> running on DOS. Mission accomplished. But how does it works?</p>


<p>winQuake.exe backends</p><hr><p>Each "mode" is configured via command-line flags.  This part reveals there are three types of backend for input controls, audio, and video.</p>

<pre><b>max</b>      winquake                                                              -dinput
<b>fast</b>     winquake 
<b>fastvid</b>  winquake -wavonly
<b>fastsnd</b>  winquake          -nodirectdraw -nowindirect
<b>safe</b>     winquake -wavonly -nodirectdraw -nowindirect 
<b>verysafe</b> winquake                                     -dibonly -nosound -nojoy
</pre>

<p>Amusingly, the mode that provides the highest framerate, <code>fastvid</code> keeps everything default but disables an audio backend!</p> 

<p>"fastvid" was also the name of a <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/fastvid.txt">tool</a> to fix the Pentium Pro abysmal video write speed on chipset that shipped with buggy "Write Posting". The option in <code>qw.bat</code> has nothing to do with it.</p>


<p>Audio backends</p><hr><p>WinQuake can send its sound effects (the music comes from CD tracks) using two audio backends (with <code>-nosound</code> disables sound effects altogether).</p>

<p>The two backends are <i>DirectSound</i> (<code>dsound.h</code> from DirectX) and what id calls <i>wave sound</i> which is in fact <code>winmm.h</code>, the Windows MultiMedia audio API, dating back to Windows 3.1.</p>

<p>If DirectSound is available, WinQuake uses it to provide the lowest latency. However this backend has a higher impact on the CPU and results in 10% lower framerate. With <code>-wavonly</code>, users can force usage of <code>WinMM</code> which results in higher latency but higher framerate.</p>

<p>Input Control backends</p><hr><p>To read user inputs, WinQuake uses either <i>DirectInput</i> (<code>dinput.h</code> from DirectX) or the legacy Windows API <code>winuser.h</code>.

</p><p>By default WinQuake uses <code>winuser.h</code> but usage of DirectInput can be requested via <code>-dinput</code> for slightly smoother motion and responsiveness to fast spinning motions. I suspect it was not enabled by default for cases where DirectX was not installed or perhaps fear of driver problems.</p>

<p>Joystick inputs are handled with <code>joystickapi.h</code>. Likewise, it seems drivers may not have been stable since id provided a way to disable it with <code>-nojoy</code>.</p>

<p>Video backends</p><hr> 
<p>The part that was the most interesting to me was the video backends. WinQuake can operate in five modes using GDI, VGA, VESA, Accelerated VESA, or DirectDraw.</p>

 



<p>DIB video backend</p><hr><p>The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) (<code>wingdi.h</code>) is the foundation to render anything on the desktop in Windows 95. Applications usually did not use it directly but instead called <code>winuser.h</code> (which in turns used low-level <code>wingdi.h</code>).</p>

<p>WinQuake can render to a Device-Independent Bitmaps (DIB) which is a surface to be blitted towards a window though GDI. The surface can be of any dimension so there are no "display mode" to detect here, WinQuake hardcodes its DIB modes to square-pixel resolutions 320x240, 640x480, and 800x600.</p>

<p>Because it is using Windows "by the book", DIB mode is the safest mode that should always work. It is also the slowest way to render to the screen because WinQuake first renders to a DIB that is then sent to the GDI and then sent to the video card.</p>

<p>While slower, it is not devoid of hardware acceleration. Many graphic cards wanting to perform well under Windows 95 had hardware acceleration implementation of crucial functions such as <code>bitBlt</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, DIB mode is the only one able to render in "windowed" mode. Every other mode takes over and renders in "fullscreen" mode. Note that DIB can also render in pseudo-full screen if WinQuake is started with <code>dibonly</code> but this is "faked" with a borderless window covering the whole screen.</p>

  

<p>SciTech's Multi-platform Graphics Library (MGL)</p><hr><p>For everything not DIB, WinQuake uses SciTech's <i>MegaGraph Graphics Library</i>. It was a rather expensive lib ($499 in 1997, $1,000 in 2025)<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> but well worth its price because it brought order into the chaos that was the world of video systems in 1997 if a game operated outside GDI.</p>

<p>WinQuake could find itself having to deal with the following types of video systems.</p>
<pre>1. VBEAF        : VESA Accelerator Function
2. VBE2         : VESA Linear Frame Buffer for direct to VRAM write/read.
3. DirectDraw   : Only available if DirectX is installed.
4. StandardVGA  : That good ol' VGA video mode.
</pre>

<p>When it starts, WinQuake registers the drivers it wants MGL to load (see <code>registerAllDispDrivers</code>). MGL then lists all supported resolutions and pick the highest performance drivers to access each of them (in the order list above).</p>

<pre>void registerAllDispDrivers(void) {
  /* Even though these driver require WinDirect, we register
   * them so that they will still be available even if DirectDraw
   * is present and the user has disabled the high performance
   * WinDirect modes.
   */
  <b>MGL_registerDriver</b>(MGL_VGA8NAME,VGA8_driver);

  if (useWinDirect){
    <b>MGL_registerDriver</b>(MGL_LINEAR8NAME,LINEAR8_driver);
    if (!COM_CheckParm ("-novbeaf"))
      <b>MGL_registerDriver</b>(MGL_ACCEL8NAME,ACCEL8_driver);
  }

  if (useDirectDraw) {
    <b>MGL_registerDriver</b>(MGL_DDRAW8NAME,DDRAW8_driver);
  }
}</pre>


<p>The list of modes and which driver was selected by MGL is available via the command <code>vid_describemodes</code> in Quake console. In the screenshot below, we can see almost the full house of drivers <code>VGA8.DRV</code>, <code>DDRAW.DRV</code>, <code>LINEAR8.DRV</code>, and the windowed DIB modes.</p>

<p>I had never heard of VBE/AF before reading MGL source code. As far as I understand, it never gained much traction and few vendors wrote drivers to support it.</p>


<p>Many games used MGL: WinQuake, Hexen II, Grand Theft Auto, Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow, Total Mayhem, Balls of Steel.</p>



<p>DirectDraw video system</p><hr><p>Microsoft was very much aware that GDI was fine for applications but not enough for video games. Already in Windows 3.1 they had released a game developer SDK called WinG to give a more direct fullscreen access to the screen. The second version of WinG was renamed DirectX and contained the 2D fullscreen API which they called DirectDraw.</p>  



<blockquote>
Although safer and more reliable, Microsoft Windows imposed many restrictions on applications.
One result of this situation was that games, and other high-performance graphics applications,
could no longer access the hardware resources directly in order to maximize performance and
expand functionalities. For several years game programmers continued to exercise the craft in
DOS, and Windows users had to switch to the DOS mode to run games, simulations, and other
graphics programs. The resulting situation implied a major contradiction: a graphical operating
system in which graphics applications would execute with marginal performance
<p>
The first effort in this direction was a product named WinG,
in reference to Windows for Games. WinG was first made available in 1994 and it required Win32
in Windows 3.1. Its main feature is that WinG enabled the game programmer to rapidly transfer
bitmaps from system memory into video memory. This made possible the creation of Windows
games that executed with much better performance.
</p><p>
Microsoft renamed the new version of the Game SDK, calling it DirectX 2. Other versions later
released were named DirectX 3, DirectX 5, DirectX 6, and currently, DirectX 7. 
</p><p>- Feng Yuan, "Windows Graphics Programming Win32 GDI and DirectDraw"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of performance, DirectDraw was a step up from GDI but it was also not guaranteed to work due to driver bugs or if the user had not installed DirectX. It can be disabled with <code>nodirectdraw</code>.</p>

<p>WinDirect video system</p><hr><p>Readers may have picked up on something written earlier that was blatantly wrong. Direct access to the hardware is forbidden to Win32 applications. So how is  MGL able to bypass GDI/DirectDraw and directly hit VBEAF, VBE, and VGA?</p>

<p>That is possible thanks to the secret tech from <i>SciTech</i> called WinDirect. How it works is explained in <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/SciTech%20MGL%20Reference%20Guide%20v4.pdf">SciTech MGL Reference Guide v4.pdf</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
<b>What is WinDirect?</b><p>

A key component of the SciTech MGL, WinDirect is a runtime package for
DOS and Windows 95 that provides direct access to the display hardware
for both 16 and 32-bit applications. Traditionally Windows applications
have had to perform all graphics output using the standard Graphics Device
Interface (GDI). Although the GDI is very extensive and powerful, it is also
not particularly fast for the sort of graphics that real time applications like
interactive video games require.</p><p>

WinDirect breaks this barrier by allowing high performance applications to
shut down the normal GDI interface, and to take over the entire graphics
display hardware just like you would normally do under DOS. Once GDI
has been shut down, interactive graphics applications can re-program the
display controller and write directly to video memory. A WinDirect
application can program any standard VGA graphics mode such as
320x200x256, it can re-program the controller and run standard VGA ModeX
style graphics, or it can call the standard VESA BIOS services to run high
resolution SuperVGA graphics.</p><p>- MGL v4 Programmer Guide<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
 
<p>MGL v4 <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/mgl_v4_programmer_guide.pdf">programmer guide</a>, is a treasure strove of information. If, like me, you wondered what were these <code>WDIR32.DLL</code> and <code>WDIR16.DLL</code> libraries that came with WinQuake, the doc mentions them (<b>W</b>in<b>DIR</b>ect). Likewise, the doc describes <code>PMPRO16.DLL</code> and <code>PMPRO32.DLL</code> as <i>DOS extender independent API for protected mode services</i>. Michael Abrash's Zen Timer is also mentioned in there :)!</p>


<div><p>WinQuake source code does not include MGL. Only the headers and a pre-compiled 32-bit <code>MGLLT.LIB</code> (MGL Lite) are provided to allow compilation. SciTech did eventually publish the source in 2000<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> but it is <a href="http://www.scitechsoft.com/dp_mgl.html">no longer available</a>. What was uploaded on GitHub<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> is v5 which by then had dramatically changed (e.g: WinDirect was gone).</p><p>

Luckily a kind soul has mirrored <a href="http://ftp.lanet.lv/ftp/mirror/x2ftp/msdos/programming/scitech/00index.html">MGL v4</a>. If you want to do your own digging, install mglb405.exe and mgls405.exe. Or just download my installation, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/src.zip">src.rar</a>.</p></div>

<p>Putting it all together</p><hr><p>Overall, <code>winquake.exe</code> was often able to find a fast rendering path, either through DirectDraw or WinDirect. The fallback to DIB mode was not ideal but still a win compared to <code>quake.exe</code>. Add to that the ability to select a sound backend to optimize for framerate or audio latency and the result was a damn good experience that completely justified the effort.</p>

<p>More than 30 years later, you can still run <code>winquake.exe</code> on Windows 11. Fullscreen does not support widescreen but the windowed mode still works flawlessly. As much as Microsoft has been questionable lately, their commitment to backward compatibility is impressive.</p><p>References</p><hr><p id="paperbox"><table><tbody><tr><td><a name="footnote_1"></a><a href="#back_1">^</a></td><td> [1]</td><td><a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.msdos.djgpp/c/VD-mIK56h74/m/P5zE_uabjnEJ">Why did ID choose DJGPP for Quake?</a></td></tr><tr><td><a name="footnote_2"></a><a href="#back_2">^</a></td><td> [2]</td><td><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scitech-releases-mgl-40-opengl-source-code/1100-2467345/">SciTech's MGL price</a></td></tr><tr><td><a name="footnote_3"></a><a href="#back_3">^</a></td><td> [3]</td><td><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/mgl_v4_programmer_guide.pdf">MGL v4 Programmer Guide</a></td></tr><tr><td><a name="footnote_4"></a><a href="#back_4">^</a></td><td> [4]</td><td><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scitech-releases-mgl-40-opengl-source-code/1100-2467345/">SciTech Releases MGL 4.0 OpenGL Source Code</a></td></tr><tr><td><a name="footnote_5"></a><a href="#back_5">^</a></td><td> [5]</td><td><a href="https://github.com/kendallb/scitech-mgl/">SciTech Mult-platform Graphics Library</a></td></tr></tbody></table></p> <hr>

Individual part prices are displayed as light blue points within the gray banding, creating an intensity graph of the price distribution. Dips in the lower price bound typically correspond to sales, or in extreme cases merchant pricing mistakes. Price data includes promos, coupons, rebates, and shipping costs (when available).</p>

<!-- about kea -->
<div>
        <h2>Why Choose Kea?</h2> 
       <div><p>ISC distributes TWO full-featured, open source, standards-based DHCP server distributions: Kea DHCP and ISC DHCP. Kea includes all the most-requested features, is far newer, and is designed for a more modern network environment. ISC announced the <a href="https://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-dhcp-eol/">End of Life</a> for the older ISC DHCP system in 2022. Users of ISC DHCP may find <a href="https://www.isc.org/dhcp_migration/">these resources</a> helpful in migrating their DHCP server deployments to the Kea server.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-the-kea-dhcp-server-different-from-the-older-isc-dhcp">How is the Kea DHCP server different from the older ISC DHCP?</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Modular Component Design, Extensible with Hooks Modules.</strong> The Kea distribution includes separate daemons for a DHCPv4 server, a DHCPv6 server, and a dynamic DNS (DDNS) module. Many optional features are enabled with dynamically-loaded “Hooks Modules,” which you need run only if you are using them. You can write your own hooks modules (in C++) or try some of the hooks we offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On-line Re-configuration with REST API.</strong>
Kea uses a JSON configuration file that can be modified remotely via <code>set</code> commands and reloaded without stopping and restarting the server, an operation that could take quite a while with ISC DHCP.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Designed to Integrate with Your Existing Systems.</strong>
Kea allows you to separate the data from the execution environment, enabling new deployment options. Your network data - leases, host reservation definitions, and most configuration data - can be located separately from the DHCP server itself, using a Kea “backend.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Kea supports two database backends; MySQL and PostgreSQL. Besides the obvious benefits (you avoid JSON formatting errors, you can quickly and easily mine the data for other purposes) using a database backend enables multiple Kea servers to share the data.
Potential benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A shared lease database can provide an alternative strategy for resilience. (See this <a href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/kea-ha-strategies-comparison">Kea HA strategies comparison</a>)</li>
<li>A host reservation database, used with the Host_Cmds hook, allows remote management of host reservations via Stork, and permits multiple Kea servers to use a shared host reservations database.</li>
<li>A configuration database, while currently not supported by Stork, allows use of some configuration elements, such as subnets, across multiple Kea servers. This can make it much easier to add new Kea servers.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Web-based graphical dashboard.</strong>
Kea now has a graphical dashboard for monitoring multiple Kea servers. This system, called Stork, uses agents deployed on the Kea servers to relay information to a centralized management platform, providing the administrator with an easy-to-use quick view of system status and activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modern, higher performance implementation.</strong> Kea is multi-threaded, and when <a href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/kea-performance-optimization">configured for efficient operation</a>, it can be performant enough for a large-scale, short-lease duration environment, which is the most demanding scenario.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The core Kea daemons are open source, shared under MPL2.0 licensing. Kea is developed in the open on ISC’s <a href="https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea">GitLab</a>; we welcome you to open issues and submit patches there. Kea runs on most Linux and Unix platforms, as well as MacOS. If you don’t want to build from our source distribution, we also provide a <a href="https://cloudsmith.io/~isc/repos/">repository of pre-built packages</a> for most popular operating systems.</p>

              <i></i></p><h4>Design</h4>
              <p>Your major design decisions are whether to deploy in pairs for <a href="https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arm/hooks.html#supported-configurations">High Availability</a> and use the default csv file for host and lease data, or to <a href="https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arm/admin.html">install a separate database</a> for a Kea data “backend.” Some of these decisions can limit your performance. See our Knowledgebase for advice on designing for <a href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/kea-performance-optimization">optimal performance</a>.</p>

              <p>The Kea <a href="https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arm/config.html">Administrator Reference Manual (ARM)</a> is the primary reference for Kea configuration. The extensive set of example configuration files in the <a href="https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea/-/tree/master/doc/examples">project repo</a> and our <a href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/single-site-organization">knowledgebase</a> may help you get started. If you are migrating from an existing ISC DHCP deployment, try the Kea <a href="https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/dhcp/-/wikis/kea-migration-assistant">Migration Assistant</a> (a special feature of the ISC DHCP distribution). This will enable you to save your current ISC DHCP server configuration as a Kea configuration file. It will still need some manual adjustment, but this tool should translate the bulk of your configuration.</p>

<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p><em>I would like to share with you this article I wrote about the ACME protocol, which I “fell in love with” about ten years ago. It is for me a way to give back to this fantastic Free Software and Open Protocols developers community.</em></p>
<p><em>This article is about the roots, the conception, the standardization, the relation with its ecosystem and the evolution challenges faced by the ACME protocol.</em></p>
<p><em>To write this article, I had the privilege of interviewing several people who have been involved in the creation and the evolution of ACME: <a href="https://aarongable.com/#about">Aaron Gable</a>, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/12/28/eoy-letter-2023">Sarah Gran</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/jacob-hoffman-andrews">Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</a> and <a href="https://insufficient.coffee/about/">J.C. Jones</a> (more below).</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much to all of you for your time and support! 💚</em></p>
<h2 id="internet-and-network-protocols">Internet and Network Protocols</h2>
<h3 id="open-and-standardized-protocols-at-the-heart-of-the-internets-success">Open and Standardized Protocols at the Heart of the Internet’s Success</h3>
<p>During the 1990s, computing underwent a true revolution driven by the rise and global spread of the Internet. The Internet fulfilled the promise embodied in Sun Microsystems’ slogan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Network_is_the_Computer"><em>“The Network is the Computer”</em></a>.</p>
<p>By interconnecting individual computers, the Internet enabled its users to communicate without limits and without worrying about borders.</p>
<p>This unrestricted interconnection emerged at a pivotal moment in modern history: the opposition between the West and the Eastern Bloc led by the USSR had—albeit temporarily, as we now know—faded away, China was becoming the world’s factory, and the movement and collaboration between people were much freer and open than ever.</p>
<p>The Internet supported a kind of utopia of instant communication and sharing, previously unknown. This utopia was made possible by a set of open and standardized protocols. This was the key to enabling all kinds of different systems to cooperate and communicate seamlessly.</p>
<p>There were, of course, isolationist or monopolistic temptations from certain manufacturers or software editors. But open and standardized protocols ultimately prevailed, enabling unprecedented expansion. Built on top of IP, TCP, UDP, and DNS, among others, the HTTP and HTML duo would propel the Web as the Internet’s preferred communication platform for the next 30 years.</p>
<h3 id="limited-use-of-encryption">Limited Use of Encryption</h3>
<p>The success of this communication utopia was achieved without much concern for ensuring authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of exchanges.</p>
<p>In 2015, only <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview">~40%</a> of websites used encryption. The consequences of this negligence in addressing security risks were confirmed by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013: our data was exposed to anyone who wanted and could intercept and collect it.</p>
<h2 id="lets-encrypt-is-coming">Let’s Encrypt is coming</h2>

<p>When asked about the main obstacles to the widespread adoption of encryption, <a href="https://insufficient.coffee/about/">J.C. Jones</a>, one of the architects of Let’s Encrypt and now one of its site reliability engineers after leading Firefox’s cryptographic team, responds:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.brocas.org/assets/jc-jones100.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“More and more information was flowing across the Web, and most data being transferred did not have integrity or confidential protections from TLS. The biggest stumbling block to using TLS everywhere was obtaining and managing server-side certificates, and so: Let’s Encrypt” –  <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obtaining a certificate was the main obstacle, and this was the priority to address.</p>
<p>This view was shared by a group of partners who, starting in 2013, pooled resources to establish Let’s Encrypt, an automated and free certificate authority. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/12/28/eoy-letter-2023">Sarah Gran</a>, VP of Advancement at Let’s Encrypt, shares:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.brocas.org/assets/sarah-gran100.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Early collaborators included people from Mozilla, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Akamai, Cisco, and the University of Michigan” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s how Let’s Encrypt was born.</p>
<p>In the Web ecosystem, certificate authorities are organizations from which you can obtain a certificate for a domain  after proving you control it.</p>
<p>And so, Let’s Encrypt is since 2015 a certificate authority that delivers for free (as in free beer) TLS Server certificates.</p>
<p>On the legal/administrative side, Let’s Encrypt certificate authority operates for the public’s benefit and is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), a California public benefit corporation.</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">Let’s Encrypt results</a> ten years after its birth, they are really impressive (over 700M active certificates, over <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/sc-letsencrypt">60%</a> of all the public TLS server certificates) and as Sarah Gran points out, so is the global HTTPS usage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When we started issuance, only about 39% of website visits were HTTPS. Today, it’s nearly 95% in the United States, and over 83% globally. We still have work to do, but we are proud of the progress we’ve made over the last ten years” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s Encrypt delivers certificates in a automated manner using the ACME protocol which implies no manual action from the site owner nor the certificate authority. So, let’s speak now a little about the automation aspect!</p>
<h3 id="automation-the-core-of-the-operation">Automation: The Core of the Operation</h3>
<p>From the mid-2020s perspective, the automation at the heart of Let’s Encrypt might seem obvious, but in the first half of the 2010s, it was far from the norm. The ecosystem of public certificate authorities issuing server certificates was no exception.</p>
<p>At first glance, automation appears to be there to help website managers reliably deploy the TLS protocol on their sites, but it was first and foremost an absolute prerequisite for the very viability of the Let’s Encrypt project.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://aarongable.com/#about">Aaron Gable</a>, tech lead of Boulder—the software at the core of Let’s Encrypt—, confirms:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.brocas.org/assets/aaron-gable100.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Automation was always going to be critical to Let’s Encrypt’s success. From the very beginning, we knew that there was no way we could scale manual validation on a non-profit’s budget” – <strong>Aaron Gable</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it is worth noting that Let’s Encrypt has operated on an Internet scale from the start with a small team of about fifteen engineers, or even fewer at launch. For this team, automation was the only viable way to fulfill the immense mission they had set for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="acme">ACME</h2>
<h3 id="the-open-and-automated-protocol-that-powers-lets-encrypt">The Open and automated Protocol That Powers Let’s Encrypt</h3>
<p>When we talk about automation in relation to Let’s Encrypt, we are talking about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555">ACME</a> (Automated Certificate Management Environment).</p>
<p>This protocol allows client software to prove to an ACME-compatible certificate authority that it controls the domain for which it is requesting a certificate.</p>
<p>Sarah Gran clarifies an important point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“An important aspect of how Let’s Encrypt works is that we verify control over a domain, not ownership” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Control vs. ownership of a domain—a nuance everyone should keep in mind.</p>
<p>This proof of control involves the client responding to a challenge issued by the ACME-compatible certificate authority. The challenge can be an HTTP, DNS, or TLS challenge, depending on the client’s choice and certificate authority support. Completing the challenge requires the ACME client to place a value provided by the ACME server—in a standardized HTTP path, a DNS zone, or a TLS response, respectively. All of these operations involve cryptography, of course.</p>
<p>The key point with ACME is that this entire dialogue between the client and the ACME server is executed without any human intervention, enabling the automatic issuance of certificates. Their deployment and integration into the web service can also generally be automated using scripts triggered after issuance.</p>
<p>On the Let’s Encrypt website, you can discover more information about <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/">how ACME works</a> and get more <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/">detailled information</a> about it.</p>
<h3 id="birth-of-acme">Birth of ACME</h3>
<p>One might wonder whether ACME was part of Let’s Encrypt’s design from the beginning.</p>
<p>J.C. Jones confirms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“By late 2014, the idea of an HTTP REST API with “/challenge” and “/certificate” existed, but we hadn’t defined much beyond that. We had a series of in-person meetings, in the Mozilla San Francisco office on Embarcadero and the EFF office in the Tenderloin through the spring of 2015 where we worked out the details” – <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ACME was indeed at the core of Let’s Encrypt from the start and underwent a refinement process to cover all use cases as thoroughly as possible.</p>
<p>To learn more about the roots of ACME and Let’s Encrypt, there is a very informative document to read: the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3319535.3363192">Let’s Encrypt paper</a> for <a href="https://ccs2019.sigsac.org/">ACM CCS 2019</a> in London. It mentions the previous work of two teams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“A group led by Alex Halderman at the University of Michigan and Peter Eckersley at EFF was developing a protocol for automatically issuing and renewing certificates. Simultaneously, a team at Mozilla led by Josh Aas and Eric Rescorla was working on creating a free and automated certificate authority”</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When these two teams discovered each other’s work, they joined forces. ACME and its implementation in Let’s Encrypt were the result of this joint effort supported by the initial partners mentioned above.</p>
<h3 id="securing-the-web-or-the-internet">Securing the Web or the Internet?</h3>
<p>Speaking of use cases, one might wonder whether the Web was Let’s Encrypt’s primary target, or if securing the Internet with its multiple protocols was also part of the objectives.</p>
<p>Sarah Gran provides an unambiguous first-level answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“From Day One, we have sought to get the web to 100% encryption” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when asked about the various types of challenges in the protocol, J.C. Jones offers a nuance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“DNS, TLS-SNI, and HTTP were all in planning in spring 2015, but many of us were less confident in the procedure around the DNS validation. Which is ironic, as it turned out TLS-SNI had a vulnerability so we had to stop using it and our DNS validation was ultimately fine. In general, the collection of us were simply respectful of the great complexity within the DNS” – <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a perspective not often publicly expressed by engineers primarily from the Web: their lack of confidence in implementing a DNS challenge stemmed from their humility regarding the complexity of the DNS ecosystem and the level of expertise required to master it.</p>
<p>The challenge was ultimately met, and this DNS challenge—though not its primary purpose—enabled multiple protocols outside HTTP like SMTP to be secured by ACME.</p>
<h2 id="standardization-and-open-source">Standardization and Open Source</h2>
<h3 id="developed-in-the-open">Developed in the Open</h3>
<p>ACME was documented openly from the start, and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a>, the first open-source ACME client co-developed with the EFF, served as the client side reference implementation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a standardization process through the IETF resulted in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8555/">RFC 8555</a> in March, 2019.</p>
<p>One of the consequences developing an open and standardized protocol was the creation of a multitude of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/">ACME clients covering a very wide range of use cases</a>.</p>
<p>J.C. Jones confirms that this was the goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This is what we foresaw, or at least hoped for. The initial client development often had conversations like, ‘oh, if someone wants that, then they’ll write their own client.’ It was a key part of why the REST API needed to be an IETF standard, and was part of the argument at the IETF BoF that resulted in the formation of the ACME Working Group in Q3 2015” – <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s Encrypt has also always provided constant support to developers by responding in its forum or on its GitHub issue tracker, and all this work has truly paid off. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/10/07/ten-yrs-community-forum">An interesting post</a> has been recently written about support on the Let’s Encrypt blog.</p>
<h3 id="standardization-for-what-benefits">Standardization for what benefits?</h3>
<p>The other question that can be asked is whether or not the standardization process within the IETF has led to an improvement in the ACME protocol thanks to the cooperation that guides this process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/jacob-hoffman-andrews">Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</a>, one of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8555/">RFC 8555</a> authors working for EFF &amp; Let’s Encrypt, confirms an initial benefit that the ACME protocol has been able to derive from its standardization process:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.brocas.org/assets/jacob100.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“One of the big changes was from a validation-first flow to a certificate-request-first flow. In other words, earlier drafts had subscribers requesting validation for domain names and then requesting a certificate once those validations were successful. The final RFC has subscribers request a certificate, and then the CA tells the subscriber what validations are needed. This change originated from within the IETF discussion process, and was intended to make handling of wildcard certificates more natural.” – <strong>Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside this first design improvement, Jacob details a second major improvement of the security of the protocol, improvement that also landed during the IETF standardization process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Another big change, also originated from within the IETF, was to make all requests authenticated, including GET requests. Since ACME is authenticated with signed POSTs, this necessitated the POST-as-GET concept that’s in ACME today” – <strong>Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see there how IETF iterations can challenge the security of a protocol and leads its development to innovative solutions to tackle the challenges it faces!</p>
<p>Last, Jacob adds another information that illustrates the benefits of developing a protocol into the open: it allows the community to evaluate (and sometimes, fix) its security level due to the availability of all materials and often, of the reference implementation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Another very important evolution was the deprecation of the tls-sni-01 challenge method. This was found to be flawed by Frans Rosen, a security researcher. It was replaced with TLS-ALPN-01, developed at IETF with significant input from Google” – <strong>Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lets-encrypt-acme-and-the-public-certificate-authorities-ecosystem">Let’s Encrypt, ACME, and the Public Certificate Authorities Ecosystem</h3>
<p>In 2015, the arrival of Let’s Encrypt in the public certificate authorities ecosystem raised a number of questions.</p>
<p>What level of cooperation or hostility? What impact on the viability of existing certificate authorities?</p>
<p>Here again, the fact that Let’s Encrypt was based on an open protocol, immediately subject to an IETF standardization initiative, enabled collaboration and adoption by the most innovative certificate authorities.</p>
<p>I spoke about the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555/#section-7.3.4">External Account Binding</a> (EAB) option of the protocol with J.C. Jones. EAB is a way for an ACME client to authenticate to an ACME server using an identifier and a key value which are verifiable by the server in a repository it maintains. With EAB, an ACME server can filter who can uses its service which is useful for commercial certificate authorities for example; it is an alternative model to Let’s Encrypt one where anybody can ask for a certificate.</p>
<p>Using the example of EAB, J.C. Jones confirms the collaboration with certificate authorities that happens during the IETF standardization process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“EAB was an early addition at the IETF ACME Working Group. Many in the room were worried that without a means to bind to a payment method, ACME would not get adoption. In fact, some of the counterarguments to forming ACME were blunted by EAB, as such a mechanism wasn’t in the theoretically-competing, already-existent standard: SCEP. SCEP, it was argued, already handled ‘free’ certificate issuance, for private certificate authorities. Anything else needed a feasible path for usage payment.” – <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond billing, the addition of EAB enabled also some commercial certificate authorities to integrate their existing domain control validation systems with ACME, allowing some of them to skip the challenge step of the ACME protocol.</p>
<p>The IETF standardization process, based on an open process, created the necessary discussion space for cooperation among entities that did not necessarily share the same objectives.</p>
<p>The result, ten years after the introduction of ACME and the completion of its standardization process in 2019, is that ACME has become the primary means by which all public certificate authorities—both free and commercial—rely on for their transition to an automated future of issuing short-lived certificates.</p>
<p>Effectively, until early this year, the maximum lifespan of a public TLS server certificate was set to 398 days by the CA/B Forum, the organization that set the rules for public certificate authorities. With the vote of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/2025/04/11/ballot-sc081v3-introduce-schedule-of-reducing-validity-and-data-reuse-periods/">ballot SC081</a> at the CA/B Forum in April 2025, it has been decided that the certificate lifespan will decrease gradually starting March 2026 to reach 47 days in March 2029. The automation provided by ACME seems to be one of the main identified levers to help organizations to adapt to this drastic reduction in the lifespan of public TLS server certificates.</p>
<h3 id="created-at-lets-encrypt-adopted-everywhere">Created at Let’s Encrypt, adopted everywhere</h3>
<p>It is important to note that although ACME was developed by the team managing Let’s Encrypt, this protocol is now one of the main protocols for automated certificate acquisition adopted by all public certificate authorities.</p>
<p>And outside the public certificate authorities ecosystem, I think it’s fair to say that this protocol is also becoming increasingly popular with technical architects in companies with private certificate authorities.</p>
<p>This has been the case in my company for several years now, where we have deployed an ACME endpoint in front of our internal certificate authority. Among the benefits we have seen, we have been able to rely on the vast ACME clients ecosystem in order to provide an ACME client to each OS or middleware that powers our infrastructure. We can see there how certificate obtention agility powered by ACME helps organizations in their journey to global IT agility.</p>
<h2 id="innovation-and-the-adoption-challenge">Innovation and the adoption challenge</h2>
<h3 id="the-ari-episode">The ARI episode</h3>
<p>We may fear that the development of a protocol supported primarily by a team as small as Let’s Encrypt’s will be fairly limited in terms of evolution and innovation.</p>
<p>But the history of ACME shows that its evolution continues after its initial standardization.</p>
<p>In 2025, we saw with the ARI (ACME Renewal Information – <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9773.html">RFC 9773</a>) extension that the ACME protocol continues to evolve. ARI is a way for a certificate authority to suggest a renewal period to its clients, often earlier than they would have determined themselves. This use case is particularly relevant when the certificate authority needs to mass-revoke certificates that, for example, did not comply with the rules the certificate authority must follow when issuing certificates.</p>
<p>More specifically, J.C. Jones and Aaron Gable point two incidents that had to be handled by the Let’s Encrypt team and that were the start for the ARI initiative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Explicitly, as remediation of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619179">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619179</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715672">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715672</a> " <strong>J.C. Jones and Aaron Gabble</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="support-to-encourage-adoption">Support to encourage adoption</h3>
<p>Aaron Gable leads the effort of designing and implementing ARI. But even if a new extension to the protocol has been produced, it can only reach its potential users after ACME clients have implemented it into their code base. As previously said, the team and some community members invest a lot on providing support to the community. In the case of ARI, this support is oriented to the ACME clients developers in order to make these clients ARI aware.</p>
<p>Providing an efficient support and effective resources to the client side ACME actors is a huge part of the challenge in order to keep ACME ecosystem healthy and agile.</p>
<p>As illustrates by Sarah Gran, another way to give momentum to a new feature is to lift certain restrictions on access to the certificate authority:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In order to encourage ARI adoption, we’ve configured Let’s Encrypt to allow subscribers who renew via ARI to bypass our rate limits.” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="client-side-update-challenge">Client Side Update Challenge</h3>
<p>But despite a good support work and incentive measures, Aaron Gable confirms ARI adoption is just at its start:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There is still much progress to be made. Part of the appeal of the Automated Certificate Management Environment is that many users can set-and-forget their client and configuration. This means that most clients never receive software updates, and even client projects that have implemented ARI in their latest version still have massive install bases that aren’t running that version. We’ve worked closely with many clients developers to implement ARI, and contributed implementations ourselves in several cases, but for widespread adoption the whole ecosystem will need to slowly turn over” <strong>– Aaron Gable</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This situation is really shared with a lot of client side softwares that <em>“just work”(c)</em> and it raises some concerns about how to make an ecosystem keeping track with innovation on its client side.</p>
<p>This challenge arises not only in terms of updating the client, but also in terms of updating the configuration. Many ACME clients rely on cron tasks. To have an efficient ARI setup, your task has to run ideally on a daily basis be able to ask the certification authority every day whether the certificate needs to be reissued. This is not the classic cron task setup. So, users have to modify this cron task frequency to reach the ARI goal of certificate reissuance led by certificate authority. Client side ACME setup evolution is a really challenging task.</p>
<h3 id="evolution-on-server-side-acme-implementation">Evolution on server side ACME implementation</h3>
<p>CA/B Forum has recently asked public certificate authorities to adopt <a href="https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2024/07/05/a-brief-history-of-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration/">Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration</a> (MPIC) to guard against BGP attacks. We have asked Aaron Gable about the impacts that kind of measure have had on ACME server side implementation in the Let’s Encrypt infrastructure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We’ve had to make few if any changes to our infrastructure to accommodate recent requirements changes such as MPIC and DNSSEC validation. We innovated MPIC (then called Remote Validation) along with a research team at Princeton, and implemented it in 2020. Our experience already running such a service helped inform the requirements as they were incorporated by the CA/B Forum.” <strong>– Aaron Gable</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lesson learnt here is that being at the edge of the innovation let you shape part of the future of your ecosystem and significantly lower the impact on your infrastructure of many regulatory measures that come into effect over time.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>It is really encouraging to see a lot of innovation in the ACME ecosystem.</p>
<p>So what evolutions can we expect to see in the future?</p>
<p>We have asked the question to Aaron Gable who gave us two upcoming developments:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“We’re currently working on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-profiles/">standardizing</a> <strong>profile selection for ACME</strong>, and our deployment of the early draft of this standard has already brought some much-needed flexibility to the WebPKI, enabling us to make changes to our certificate contents with minimal disruption.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m also excited about a potential future change which would <strong>introduce a ‘pubkey’ identifier type</strong>, along with a set of challenges that allow the client to demonstrate control over the corresponding keypair. This would fix the gap today that presenting a CSR does not actually prove possession of the key in that CSR.” – <strong>Araron Gable</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Fastly has also recently <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/smarter-acme-challenge-for-multi-cdn-world">contributed</a> to ACME in order to improve the <code>dns-01</code> challenge in a multi-cloud and multi-PKI environment. An <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-acme-dns-account-label/">IETF draft</a> describing this <code>dns-account-01</code> challenge is online. This is further proof that the public TLS ecosystem has truly embraced the ACME protocol as its primary automation tool.</p>
<p>Another recent development based on ACME has also shed new light on the potential of this protocol: since 2022, a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-acme-device-attest/">draft</a> is under progress at the IETF in order to write an ACME extension. The goal of this extension is to use ACME to obtain a certificate for a device in order to prove its identity. The challenge is based on device attestation and what’s new in this case is the arrival of a third party, the attestation server.</p>
<p>What is remarkable here is that we are no longer dealing with ACME’s initial use case, namely obtaining TLS server certificates: we can see in this IETF draft the potential of ACME as a challenge-based framework to obtain certificate in very different contexts.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can venture to say that ACME’s future looks bright 😊</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is heartening to see that, 30 years after the widespread adoption of the Internet, open and standardized protocols continue to revolutionize its use.</p>
<p>ACME and its Let’s Encrypt implementation at scale have enabled the widespread adoption of HTTPS, thereby raising the level of security for billions of Internet users and also of private networks.</p>
<p>Having been able to do it inside a non profit organization, providing the Internet with an open and standardized protocol is a great success for all people believing in FreeSoftware and an Open Internet.</p>
<p>As a community, I really think we can thank these organizations, teams, and engineers who continue to uphold the promise of efficiency and Freedom brought about by cooperation around open protocols. They inspire new generations (and older ones I guess 😉) demonstrating big things can still be achevied today in the open for the common good at the Internet scale!</p>
<p>I would like to extend a special thank you to the members of the Let’s Encrypt team, <strong>J.C. Jones</strong>, <strong>Aaron Gable</strong>, <strong>Sarah Gran</strong> and <strong>Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</strong>, for the time and effort they dedicated to answering my questions. Without them, this article would not have been possible.</p>
<p>A big shout out also to <a href="https://github.com/regit">Eric Leblond</a> and <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@doegox">Philippe Teuwen</a> who carefully proofread some early drafts of the article and <a href="https://github.com/phbnf">Philippe Bonnef</a> and <a href="https://thibmeu.com/">Thibault Meunier</a> for proofreading some of the last drafts. They all gave me so valuable and insightful advices 🙏</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!-- OPENING: THE LUNCH -->
        <p>
          I grabbed lunch with a former Microsoft coworker I've always admired—one of those engineers who can take any idea, even a mediocre one, and immediately find the gold in it. I wanted her take on <a href="https://wanderfugl.com/" target="_blank">Wanderfugl</a> 🐦, the AI-powered map I've been building full-time. I expected encouragement. At worst, overly generous feedback because she knows what I've sacrificed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, she reacted to it with a level of negativity I'd never seen her direct at me before.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I finally got her to explain what was wrong, none of it had anything to do with what I built. She talked about Copilot 365. And Microsoft AI. And every miserable AI tool she's forced to use at work. My product barely featured. Her reaction wasn't about me at all. It was about her entire environment.
        </p>

        <h3>The AI Layoffs</h3>

        <p>
          Her PM had been laid off months earlier. The team asked why. Their director told them it was because the PM org "wasn't effective enough at using Copilot 365."
        </p>

        <p>
          I nervously laughed. This director got up in a group meeting and said that someone lost their job over this?
        </p>

        <p>
          After a pause I tried to share how much better I've been feeling—how AI tools helped me learn faster, how much they accelerated my work on Wanderfugl. I didn't fully grok how tone deaf I was being though. She's drowning in resentment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I left the lunch deflated and weirdly guilty, like building an AI product made me part of the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          But then I realized this was bigger than one conversation. Every time I shared Wanderfugl with a Seattle engineer, I got the same reflexive, critical, negative response. This wasn't true in Bali, Tokyo, Paris, or San Francisco—people were curious, engaged, wanted to understand what I was building. But in Seattle? Instant hostility the moment they heard "AI."
        </p>

        <h2>The people at big tech in Seattle are not ok</h2>

        <p>
          When I joined Microsoft, there was still a sense of possibility. Satya was pushing "growth mindset" everywhere. Leaders talked about empowerment and breaking down silos. And even though there was always a gap between the slogans and reality, there was room to try things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I leaned into it. I pushed into areas nobody wanted to touch, like Windows update compression, because it lived awkwardly across three teams. Somehow, a 40% improvement made it out alive. Leadership backed it. The people trying to kill it shrank back into their fiefdoms. It felt like the culture wanted change.
        </p>

        <p>
          That world is gone.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the layoff directive hit, every org braced for impact. Anything not strictly inside the org's charter was axed. I went from shipping a major improvement in Windows 11 to having zero projects overnight. I quit shortly after. In hindsight, getting laid off with severance might've been better than watching the culture collapse in slow motion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then came the AI panic.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you could classify your project as "AI," you were safe and prestigious. If you couldn't, you were nobody. Overnight, most engineers got rebranded as "not AI talent." And then came the final insult: everyone was forced to use Microsoft's AI tools whether they worked or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Copilot for Word. Copilot for PowerPoint. Copilot for email. Copilot for code. Worse than the tools they replaced. Worse than competitors' tools. Sometimes worse than doing the work manually.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you weren't allowed to fix them—that was the AI org's turf. You were supposed to use them, fail to see productivity gains, and keep quiet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, AI teams became a protected class. Everyone else saw comp stagnate, stock refreshers evaporate, and performance reviews tank. And if your team failed to meet expectations? Clearly you weren't "embracing AI."
        </p>

        <p>
          Bring up AI in a Seattle coffee shop now and people react like you're advocating asbestos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Amazon folks are slightly more insulated, but not by much. The old Seattle deal—Amazon treats you poorly but pays you more—only masks the rot.
        </p>

        <h2>Self-Limiting Beliefs</h2>

        <p>
          This belief system—that AI is useless and that you're not good enough to work on it anyway—hurts three groups:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. The companies.</strong><br>
          They've taught their best engineers that innovation isn't their job.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. The engineers.</strong><br>
          They're stuck in resentment and self-doubt while their careers stall.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Anyone trying to build anything new in Seattle.</strong><br>
          Say "AI" and people treat you like a threat or an idiot.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the loop feeds itself:<br>
          Engineers don't try because they think they can't.<br>
          Companies don't empower them because they assume they shouldn't.<br>
          Bad products reinforce the belief that AI is doomed.<br>
          The spiral locks in.
        </p>

        <p>
          My former coworker—the composite of three people for anonymity—now believes she's both unqualified for AI work and that AI isn't worth doing anyway. She's wrong on both counts, but the culture made sure she'd land there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seattle has talent as good as anywhere. But in San Francisco, people still believe they can change the world—so sometimes they actually do.

        <p>
            By combining the language of groups with that of geometry and linear algebra, Marius Sophus Lie created one of math’s most powerful tools.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>In mathematics, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/groups-underpin-modern-math-heres-how-they-work-20240906/">ubiquitous objects called groups</a> display nearly magical powers. Though they’re defined by just a few rules, groups help illuminate an astonishing range of mysteries. They can tell you which polynomial equations are solvable, for instance, or how atoms are arranged in a crystal.</p>
<p>And yet, among all the different kinds of groups, one type stands out. Identified in the early 1870s, Lie groups (pronounced “Lee”) are crucial to some of the most fundamental theories in physics, and they’ve made lasting contributions to number theory and chemistry. The key to their success is the way they blend group theory, geometry and linear algebra.</p>
<p>In general, a group is a set of elements paired with an operation (like addition or multiplication) that combines two of those elements to produce a third. Often, you can think of a group as the symmetries of a shape — the transformations that leave the shape unchanged.</p>
<p>Consider the symmetries of the equilateral triangle. They form a group of six elements, as shown here:</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>(Since a full rotation brings every point on the triangle back to where it started, mathematicians stop counting rotations past 360 degrees.)</p>
<p>These symmetries are discrete: They form a set of distinct transformations that have to be applied in separate, unconnected steps. But you can also study continuous symmetries. It doesn’t matter, for instance, if you spin a Frisbee 1.5 degrees, or 15 degrees, or 150 degrees — you can rotate it by any real number, and it will appear the same. Unlike the triangle, it has infinitely many symmetries.</p>
<p>These rotations form a group called SO(2). “If you have just a reflection, OK, you have it, and that’s good,” said <a href="https://www.unige.ch/math/en/section/enseignants-et-chercheurs-2/anton-alekseev">Anton Alekseev</a>, a mathematician at the University of Geneva. “But that’s just one operation.” This group, on the other hand, “is many, many operations in one package” — uncountably many.</p>
<p>Each rotation of the Frisbee can be represented as a point in the coordinate plane. If you plot all possible rotations of the Frisbee in this way, you’ll end up with infinitely many points that together form a circle.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The_Geometry_of_Groups-crMarkBelan-Desktopv2.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The_Geometry_of_Groups-crMarkBelan-Mobilev2.svg" alt="" decoding="async">    </p>
    </figure>

<p>This extra property is what makes SO(2) a Lie group — it can be visualized as a smooth, continuous shape called a manifold. Other Lie groups might look like the surface of a doughnut, or a high-dimensional sphere, or something even stranger: The group of all rotations of a ball in space, known to mathematicians as SO(3), is a six-dimensional tangle of spheres and circles.</p>
<p>Whatever the specifics, the smooth geometry of Lie groups is the secret ingredient that elevates their status among groups.</p>
<h2><strong>Off on a Tangent</strong></h2>
<p>It took time for Marius Sophus Lie to make his way to mathematics. Growing up in Norway in the 1850s, he hoped to pursue a military career once he finished secondary school. Instead, forced to abandon his dream due to poor eyesight, he ended up in university, unsure of what to study. He took courses in astronomy and mechanics, and flirted briefly with physics, botany and zoology before finally being drawn to math — geometry in particular.</p>
<p>In the late 1860s, he continued his studies, first in Germany and then in France. He was in Paris in 1870 when the Franco-Prussian War broke out. He soon tried to leave the country, but his notes on geometry, written in German, were mistaken for encoded messages, and he was arrested, accused of being a spy. He was released from prison a month later and quickly returned to math.</p>

<p>In particular, he began working with groups. Forty years earlier, the mathematician Évariste Galois had used one class of groups to <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-galois-groups-used-polynomial-symmetries-to-reshape-math-20210803/">understand the solutions to polynomial equations</a>. Lie now wanted to do the same thing for so-called differential equations, which are used to model how a physical system changes over time.</p>
<p>His vision for differential equations didn’t work out as he’d hoped. But he soon realized that the groups he was studying were interesting in their own right. And so the Lie group was born.</p>
<p>The manifold nature of Lie groups has been an enormous boon to mathematicians. When they sit down to understand a Lie group, they can use all the tools of geometry and calculus — something that’s not necessarily true for other kinds of groups. That’s because <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-a-manifold-20251103/">every manifold has a nice property</a>: If you zoom in on a small enough region, its curves disappear, just as the spherical Earth appears flat to those of us walking on its surface.</p>
<p>To see why this is useful for studying groups, let’s go back to SO(2). Remember that SO(2) consists of all the rotations of a Frisbee, and that those rotations can be represented as points on a circle. For now, let’s focus on a sliver of the circle corresponding to very small rotations — say, rotations of less than 1 degree.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lie_Groups-Fig2-crMarkBelan-Desktopv1.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lie_Groups-Fig2-crMarkBelan-Mobilev1.svg" alt="" decoding="async">    </p>
    </figure>

<p>Here, the curve of SO(2) is barely perceptible. When a Frisbee rotates 1 degree or less, any given point on its rim follows a nearly linear path. That means mathematicians can approximate these rotations with a straight line that touches the circle at just one point — a tangent line. This tangent line is called the Lie algebra.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lie_Groups-Fig3-crMarkBelan-Desktopv2.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lie_Groups-Fig3-crMarkBelan-Mobilev2.svg" alt="" decoding="async">    </p>
    </figure>

<p>This feature is immensely useful. Math is a lot easier on a straight line than on a curve. And the Lie algebra contains elements of its own (often visualized as arrows called vectors) that mathematicians can use to simplify their calculations about the original group. “One of the easiest kinds of mathematics in the world is linear algebra, and the theory of Lie groups is designed in such a way that it just makes constant use of linear algebra,” said <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dav/">David Vogan</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Say you want to compare two different groups. Their respective Lie algebras simplify their key properties, Vogan said, making this task much more straightforward.</p>
<p>“The interaction between these two structures,” <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~iozzi/">Alessandra Iozzi</a>, a mathematician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, said of Lie groups and their algebras, “is something that has an absolutely enormous array of consequences.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Language of Nature</strong></h2>
<p>The natural world is full of the kinds of continuous symmetries that Lie groups capture, making them indispensable in physics. Take gravity. The sun’s gravitational pull on the Earth depends only on the distance between them — it doesn’t matter which side of the sun the Earth is on, for instance. In the language of Lie groups, then, gravity is “symmetric under SO(3).” It remains unchanged when the system it’s acting on rotates in three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>In fact, all the fundamental forces in physics — gravity, electromagnetism, and the forces that hold together atomic nuclei — are defined by Lie group symmetries. Using that definition, scientists can <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/lectures/lieg07.pdf">explain basic puzzles about matter</a>, like why protons are always paired with neutrons, and why the energy of an atom comes in discrete quantities.</p>
        
        
<p>In 1918, Emmy Noether <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01989">stunned mathematicians and physicists</a> by proving that Lie groups also underlie some of the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-noethers-theorem-revolutionized-physics-20250207/">most basic laws of conservation</a> in physics. She showed that for any symmetry in a physical system that can be described by a Lie group, there is a corresponding conservation law. For instance, the fact that the laws of physics are the same today as they were yesterday and will be tomorrow — a symmetry known as time translation symmetry, represented by the Lie group consisting of the real numbers — implies that the universe’s energy must be conserved, and vice versa. “I think, even now, it’s a very surprising result,” Alekseev said.</p>
<p>Today, Lie groups remain a vital tool for both mathematicians and physicists. “Definitions live in mathematics because they’re powerful. Because there are a lot of interesting examples and they give you a good way to think about something,” Vogan said. “Symmetry is everywhere, and that’s what this stuff is for.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit">https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46138238">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ghostty is now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#relationship-to-hack-club">fiscally sponsored</a> by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a>, a
registered 501(c)(3) non-profit.</p>
<p>Fiscal sponsorship is a legal and financial
arrangement in which a recognized non-profit extends its tax-exempt status to
a project that aligns with its mission. This allows Ghostty to operate as a
charitable initiative while Hack Club manages compliance, donations,
accounting, and governance oversight.</p>
<p>Being non-profit clearly demonstrates our commitment to keeping Ghostty
free and open source for everyone. It paves the way for a model for sustainable
development beyond my personal involvement. And it also provides important
legal protections and assurances to the people and communities that adopt and
use Ghostty.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-a-non-profit">Why a Non-Profit?</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the project in 2023 and the private beta days of
Ghostty, I've repeatedly expressed my intention that Ghostty legally
become a non-profit. This intention stems from several core beliefs I have.</p>
<p>First, I want to lay bricks for a sustainable future for Ghostty that
doesn't depend on my personal involvement technically or financially.
Financially, I am still the largest donor to the project, and I intend to
remain so, but a non-profit structure allows others to contribute financially
without fear of misappropriation or misuse of funds (as protected by legal
requirements and oversight from the fiscal sponsor).</p>
<p>Second, I want to squelch any possible concerns about a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_scam">"rug pull"</a>.
A non-profit structure provides enforceable assurances: the mission cannot be
quietly changed, funds cannot be diverted to private benefit, and the project
cannot be sold off or repurposed for commercial gain. The structure legally
binds Ghostty to the public-benefit purpose it was created to serve.</p>
<p>Finally, despite being decades-old technology, terminals and terminal-related
technologies remain foundational to modern computing and software
infrastructure. They're often out of the limelight, but they're ever present
on developer machines, embedded in IDEs, visible as read-only consoles for
continuous integration and cloud services, and still one of the primary ways
remote access is done on servers around the world.</p>
<p><strong>I believe infrastructure of this kind should be stewarded by a mission-driven,
non-commercial entity that prioritizes public benefit over private profit.</strong>
That structure increases trust, encourages adoption, and creates the
conditions for Ghostty to grow into a widely used and impactful piece of
open-source infrastructure.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-ghostty">What This Means For Ghostty</h2>
<p>From a technical perspective, nothing changes for Ghostty. Our technical
goals for the project remain the same, the license (MIT) remains the same, and
we continue our work towards better Ghostty GUI releases and
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming">libghostty</a>.</p>
<p>Financially, Ghostty can now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://donate.ghostty.org/">accept tax-deductible donations</a> in the United
States. This opens up new avenues for funding the project and sustaining
development over the long term. Most immediately, I'm excited to begin
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#contributor-compensation">compensating contributors</a>,
but I also intend to support upstream dependencies, fund community events,
and pay for boring operational costs.</p>
<p>All our financial transactions will be transparent down to individual
transactions for both inflows and outflows. You can view our public
ledger at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hcb.hackclub.com/ghostty">Ghostty's page on Hack Club Bank</a>.
At the time of writing, this is empty, but you'll soon see some initial
funding from me and the beginning of paying for some of our operational
costs.</p>
<p>All applicable names, marks, and intellectual property associated with Ghostty have
been transferred to Hack Club and are now owned under the non-profit
umbrella. Copyright continues to be held by individual contributors under
the continued and existing license structure.</p>
<p>From a leadership perspective, I remain the project lead and final authority
on all decisions, but as stated earlier, the creation of a non-profit structure
lays the groundwork for an eventual future beyond this model.</p>
<div><p><strong>Important note: no funds will be sent to me (Mitchell Hashimoto) or used in any way that
personally benefits me.</strong> Since I'm both the largest donor and lead of this project, this is a
legally guaranteed protection. But also for altruistic reasons, all funds will be directed towards
the needs of the project and its community.</p></div>

<h2 id="supporting-hack-club">Supporting Hack Club</h2>
<p>As our fiscal sponsor, Hack Club provides essential services to Ghostty,
including accounting, legal compliance, and governance oversight. To support
this, 7% of all donations to Ghostty go to Hack Club to cover these costs
in addition to supporting their broader mission of empowering young people
around the world interested in technology and coding.</p>
<p>In the words of Zach Latta, Hack Club's founder and executive director
this is a "good-for-good" trade. Instead of donor fees going to a for-profit
management company or covering pure overhead of a single project, the fees
go to another non-profit doing important work in the tech community and
the overhead is amortized across many projects.</p>
<p>In addition to the 7% fees, <strong>my family is personally donating $150,000
directly to the Hack Club project</strong><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> (not to Ghostty within it). Hack Club
does amazing work and I would've supported them regardless of their
fiscal sponsorship of Ghostty, but I wanted to pair these two things
together to amplify the impact of both.</p>

<h2 id="donate">Donate</h2>
<p>Please consider donating to support Ghostty's continued development.</p>
<p>I recognize that Ghostty is already in an abnormally fortunate position
to have myself as a backer, but I do envision a future where Ghostty is
more equally supported by a broader community. And with our new structure,
you can be assured about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#usage-of-funds">usage of your funds</a>
towards public-benefit goals.</p>
<p>This post isn't meant to directly be a <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/advice-for-tech-nonprofits">fundraising pitch</a>
so it is purposely lacking critical details about our funding goals, budget,
project goals, project metrics, etc. I'll work on those in the future.
In the mean time, if you're interested in talking more about supporting
