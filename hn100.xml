            <section>
                <p>In the past few years, I've heard a lot about Avro, Parquet, ORC, Arrow and Feather, but I also keep hearing about Iceberg and Delta Lake. As a "database person", I’ve been struggling to understand all of these different things, and how they relate to Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses (and what exactly <em>are</em> these?). So, I’ve decided to study them, and consolidate my knowledge in writing.</p><p>To do this, I had to review quite a bit of content over the last few weeks. I’ll try to link to most of what I’ve read and watched at the bottom of this article. However, this blog post won’t be 100% comprehensive, or even the best starting point for most people. That’s because I’m writing this for myself. I find that the best way to learn new things is by "forcing myself" to re-explain them to others. Anyhow, I hope this is useful to some people!</p><h2 id="how-data-gets-stored-in-files-and-in-memory">How Data Gets Stored (in Files and in Memory)</h2><p>Let’s start with understanding the different file formats for efficient data access and storage. While some systems mainly operate on data formats that are closed (e.g., SingleStoreDB, where I work, Teradata, SQL Server, Snowflake), others operate on open data formats. And these days, most of them, like Snowflake, Redshift, Athena or Hive, support reading and writing into <em>both</em> open and closed storage formats (although there’s varying limitations around their write/read support on open formats).</p><p>These are some the main open source file formats for storing data efficiently:</p><ul><li><a href="https://avro.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Avro</a> — Binary, Rowstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://parquet.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Parquet</a> — Binary, Columnstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://orc.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache ORC</a> — Binary, Columnstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Arrow</a> — Binary, Columnstore, In-Memory<ul><li>The best way to store Apache Arrow dataframes in files on disk is with <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html?ref=davidgomes.com">Feather</a>. However, it’s also possible to convert to Apache Parquet format and others.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://protobuf.dev/?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Protocol Buffers</a> (Protobuf) — Binary, N/A, In-Memory<ul><li>Protobuf is a language-neutral data structure definition language. Different implementations will store the data differently (it could be row-by-row, i.e., rowstore, or columnstore).</li></ul></li><li>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">CSV</a> — Text, Rowstore/Columnstore, Files)<ul><li>CSV is very different from the others on this list given its structure is extremely trivial. There is, however, a <a href="https://digital-preservation.github.io/csv-schema/?ref=davidgomes.com">"CSV Schema" language</a> definition, but it doesn’t seem to be very popular.</li></ul></li></ul><p>But what do the formats actually imply? <strong>The formats are specifications for how the data should be arranged in actual binary layout.</strong> There is a <a href="https://www.vladsiv.com/big-data-file-formats/?ref=davidgomes.com">really good blog post</a> by Vladimir Sivcevic about Avro vs Parquet vs ORC which explains the layouts ("structure") for each of the file types — I highly recommend reading it. Afterwards, one can understand where the metadata and the actual data should live in the file’s contents, and what the pros/cons of each format are. For instance, Parquet supports really good compression, whereas Avro is more suited for reading specific row blocks (it’s rowstore). However, both support an evolving schema, i.e., the ability to modify the schema of new data without having to rewrite all existing data. In addition, both support file splitting which is essential for parallel processing of data.</p><p>So now we’re starting to understand the most common Big Data file formats. These are really interesting, and you can spend a lot of time studying what makes them so powerful. The main thing to remember, however, is that because they’re open, you can work with these formats from a variety of programming languages and tools. As an example, the <a href="https://github.com/apache/parquet-format?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Parquet’s repository</a> contains the specification for the actual file format, as well as a reference Java implementation. However, there’s libraries for pretty much every language that allow you to read/write from Parquet files.</p><pre><code>"""
The following is a snippet that writes some sample data to a
Parquet file on local disk. It uses Pandas to achieve that.
"""
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pandas as pd
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Create a Pandas DataFrame with sample data
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = {
...     'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
...     'Age': [25, 30, 35],
...     'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']
... }
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame(data)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Write the data frame to a Parquet file
&gt;&gt;&gt; file_path = './sample_table.parquet'
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.to_parquet(file_path, index=False)
</code></pre><p>Presto/Trino, Spark, DuckDB, Hive, Dremio, Impala, AWS Athena and Apache Drill are just some of the engines that can work with Parquet files. I find this fascinating, and I can see how Parquet is very useful for data teams who want to ensure their data can be accessed by many different tools.</p><p>But the file formats are just one layer of the overall data stack. They are helpful for data scientists working on their own, or at a small scale. But by themselves, they don’t really give data engines all they need in order to manage large-scale, evolving datasets. And that’s what higher-level storage layers like the Hive Format, Iceberg and Delta Lake are for.</p><h2 id="data-management-at-scale-%E2%80%94-iceberg-and-delta-lake">Data Management at Scale — Iceberg and Delta Lake</h2><p>So, how can we store many different tables, and evolve the individual schemas of all of these tables, and do things like point-in-time reads, all while partitioning the data efficiently for queries? And how can external tools easily read these schemas? And how should statistics about the data be stored in order to build cost-based query optimizers for this data?</p><p>In order to do all this, we need a higher-level metadata layer around our data files. The file formats described above only specify the layout of one individual file. So, we need a table format of sorts, as well as a schema registry that allows tools to introspect any metadata about our datasets. One example of a schema registry is <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Confluent Schema Registry</a>, which supports Avro and Protobuf, as it is more suited for streaming data which tends to be rowstore.</p><p>When it comes to columnar data, in 2009, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2009/06/10/web/hive-a-petabyte-scale-data-warehouse-using-hadoop/?ref=davidgomes.com">Facebook launched Hive</a> with its own table metadata format (it now supports multiple formats though). Then, over the years, Netflix developed Iceberg to overcome some of Hive’s limitations, specifically around performance and scalability (I highly recommend going into the "Sources" section below for the historical context here). And then Databricks developed and eventually open sourced Delta Lake, which is an alternative to Iceberg. And both Iceberg and Delta Lake use Parquet as their individual file format! Hive, Delta Lake and Iceberg all support support of schema registry or metastore. In Hive, the HMS (Hive MetaStore), can be pretty much any RDBMS. Of course, Iceberg and Delta Lake have similar concepts (<a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog/?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Iceberg Catalogs</a>, <a href="https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Unity Catalog</a>) — and these even allow organizations to manage governance for their data (i.e., who or which teams can access which tables).</p><p>I’m not going to go into the differences between Delta Lake and Iceberg. They essentially solve the same problems, in different ways. There’s also a lot of debate around how "open" Delta Lake is, given its development is not as diverse in terms of contributors as Iceberg’s. And the support for Iceberg across popular data warehouses, and lakehouses is growing very quickly — in the last few years, a lot of different providers announced support for Iceberg (Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake, Athena, Dremio, etc.).</p><p><strong>The important thing to remember is that neither Delta Lake nor Iceberg are query or storage engines in of themselves.</strong> Instead, they’re open specifications that allow query engines to do their job. And they <em>enable</em> a lot of features such as:</p><ul><li>Partitioning<ul><li>In specific, Iceberg supports partitioning evolution. This means that you can change the partitioning scheme (or shard key) of a table without rewriting all the existing data. This was a huge painpoint at Netflix and it was one of the reasons they created Iceberg.</li></ul></li><li>Schema Evolution</li><li>Data Compression</li><li>ACID Transactions around schema changes</li><li>Efficient Query Optimization (things like column pruning, predicate pushdown, and statistics collection to accelerate queries)</li><li>Time travel (point in time queries)</li><li>…</li></ul><p>I studied the Iceberg specification, and I am extremely impressed by its design. It is no wonder that it is becoming extremely popular as a supported format by so many different systems. This will certainly drive products which operate on closed formats to be as performant as possible on their own formats, and to somehow support Iceberg/Delta Lake. However, there's no going back now — Iceberg will become a "checkbox feature", and all database systems will have to support it sooner or later. And can Iceberg eventually replace the closed data formats? This is more complicated, and it probably won't happen due to performance reasons. The truth is that developing a data format for a single query engine, which again only has to operate on that one data format, gives database developers the ability to extract maximum efficiency and innovate more quickly. But who knows!</p><h2 id="and-so-what-are-data-lakes-and-data-lakehouses">And so, what are Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses?</h2><p>Both of these terms have always been a bit confusing to me, but I’m starting to understand them better now.</p><p>So, a Data Lake is where companies store their large amounts of data in some raw format like OCR or Parquet, or even CSV files (picture an S3 bucket with lots of these files). This is different from a Data Warehouse where companies are storing this data in a more structured way (schematized SQL tables and database schemas). And Data Lakehouses are basically the conjunction between a Data Lake, and the ability to do things like running SQL queries, running batch jobs, and setting up data governance schemes. These can now be built on top of a Data Lake with Iceberg together with some query engine and other "add-ons", whereas before you’d need to adopt a Data Warehouse (or a more classic DMBS) to do these things.</p><p>Data Lakehouses leverage some sort of scalable storage as the location for all the data (HDFS or a Cloud Blob Store like S3). And they’ve optimized their query engines to be very fast on these storage engines. The idea, then, is that data lakehouses are basically the open version of a data warehouse. And finally, some examples of Data Lakehouse products are Databricks and Dremio.</p><p>However, I think the line between a Data Warehouse and a Data Lakehouse is becoming more blurry as certain warehouses such as Snowflake and BigQuery add support for open data formats like Iceberg. This will be very interesting to observe over the years to come!</p><h2 id="that%E2%80%99s-it">That’s it!</h2><p>Thank you for sticking around — hopefully the "Sources" section below is also interesting. I certainly learnt a lot while writing this blog post, as I wrote it for myself more than anything else. As such, I don’t expect others to be able to take too much away from this.</p><p>Feel free to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/davidrfgomes?ref=davidgomes.com">reach out on Twitter</a>!</p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.vladsiv.com/big-data-file-formats/?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.vladsiv.com/big-data-file-formats/</a></li><li>"<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05028?ref=davidgomes.com">An Empirical Evaluation of Columnar Storage Formats", X Zeng, Y Hui, J Shen, A Pavlo, W McKinney, H Zhang, 2023</a><ul><li>This is a very good paper which analyzes the different columnar storage formats, and how they stack up against each other in terms of performance.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-the-parquet-file-format-13adb0206705?ref=davidgomes.com">https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-the-parquet-file-format-13adb0206705</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html?ref=davidgomes.com">https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/operationalizing-the-data/9781492049517/ch04.html?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/operationalizing-the-data/9781492049517/ch04.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-gIUf9e9CCskP6wP-NKRU9VhofMHYjcd&amp;ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-gIUf9e9CCskP6wP-NKRU9VhofMHYjcd</a><ul><li>I watched a few videos, and found the first two on this playlist to be especially helpful.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.databricks.com/discover/data-lakes?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.databricks.com/discover/data-lakes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse</a></li></ul><h3 id="netflix-and-iceberg">Netflix and Iceberg</h3><p>There are a few talks, that if watched in order, will give you a really good historical overview into how Apache Iceberg came to be:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4OU6i4AQsI&amp;ref=davidgomes.com">AWS re:Invent 2015 | (BDT303) Running Spark and Presto on the Netflix Big Data Platform</a><ul><li>This talk from 2015 goes over how Netflix used Spark and Presto at the time, with S3 as their "data warehouse" (the term lakehouse didn’t exist back then).</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/kbajda/presto-summit-2018-09-netflix-iceberg?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.slideshare.net/kbajda/presto-summit-2018-09-netflix-iceberg</a><ul><li>These are the slides from "Presto Summit 2018" introducing Iceberg.

      Daihatsu, the Japanese automaker owned by Toyota, has halted domestic production after admitting it forged the results of safety tests for its vehicles for more than 30 years.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqn7e79b00083b6homjw22qi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The brand, best known for manufacturing small passenger cars, has stopped output at all four of its Japanese factories as of Tuesday, including one at its headquarters in Osaka, a spokesperson told CNN.

      The shutdown will last through at least the end of January, affecting roughly 9,000 employees who work in domestic production, according to the representative.

      The move comes as Daihatsu grapples with a deepening safety scandal that Toyota <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/40238738.html" target="_blank">says</a> “has shaken the very foundations of the company.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqn99fvo000d3b6hdqqk9h21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Last week, Daihatsu <a href="https://www.daihatsu.com/news/2023/20231220-4.html" target="_blank">announced</a> an independent third-party committee had found evidence of tampering with safety tests on as many as 64 vehicle models, including those sold under the Toyota brand.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqnevsee000g3b6hl6pd7pcl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      As a result, Daihatsu said it would temporarily suspend all domestic and international vehicle shipments and consult with authorities on how to move forward.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqnezotj000i3b6h2e6qhxzm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The scandal is another blow to the automaker, which had admitted <a href="https://www.daihatsu.com/news/2023/20230428-4.html" target="_blank">in April</a> to violating standards on crash tests on more than 88,000 cars, mostly sold under the Toyota brand in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand.

      In that case, “the inside lining of the front seat door was improperly modified” for some checks, while Daihatsu did not comply with regulatory requirements for certain side collision tests, it said in a statement at the time.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqnfgufn000o3b6h608w3itz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      In May, the automaker <a href="https://www.daihatsu.com/news/2023/20230519-6.html" target="_blank">said</a> it had discovered more wrongdoing, revealing that it had submitted incorrect data for collision tests on two hybrid electric vehicles. The company said at the time it had stopped shipping and selling those models.

      The latest probe further threatens the company’s reputation. According to a <a href="https://www.daihatsu.com/news/2023/report_1_E.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released last Wednesday by the investigative committee, 174 more cases were found of Daihatsu manipulating data, making false statements or improperly tinkering with vehicles to pass safety certification tests.

      The oldest case was traced back to 1989, with a noted increase in the number of cases since 2014, the report said.

<p><strong>No good deed goes unpunished (at least in Europe)</strong></p>



<p>Those who know me know I wrote my first code in the early 80s, and though I never made a career of it, I dabbled early-on like all the other geeks. In those days, we all wrote and swapped simple games and trivial tools. At that time, it was one of the main functions of the bulletin boards that would one day spawn the internet. The idea we’d pay for software one day was lurking, but free was more the norm. Bandwidth and storage were what was monetized back then. The idea someone might sue us for a program bug or unexpected crash was not even remotely on our minds.</p>



<p>Ah, to be so innocent and naive again.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1250" height="718" src="https://developersalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Coding-old.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://developersalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Coding-old.jpg 1250w, https://developersalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Coding-old-300x172.jpg 300w, https://developersalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Coding-old-1024x588.jpg 1024w, https://developersalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Coding-old-768x441.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px"></figure>







<p>You might be surprised to learn that, as I write, the EU is finalizing rules that will make open-source creators and licensees liable for any user harm their software might cause. The focus for lawmakers is that, like cars and chainsaws, software is complex and can be inherently dangerous. Policymakers believe that consumers are at a disadvantage when things go horribly wrong: how can they prove someone sold them faulty software when they can’t hope to understand how apps work or how they’re created? The solution they’re adopting is to shift the onus to the software and app creators to prove their code didn’t do anything wrong. This will be burdensome but is at least possible if you write and market your own code. But what if you’re just part of a collaborative open source project, give away your app, or if there’s open source code in the product you put on the market? Who gets blamed when open source might be the heart of the problem?</p>



<p><strong>EU policymakers are clear; going forward, someone must be liable for software harm.</strong> Data was lost, customers couldn’t transact, files got garbled, hackers made entries – someone in the software chain must make the user whole. Today you can license-away that liability by putting the onus on the user to accept the risk, since bugs happen and hackers hack. Not your fault, you did your best, and you told the user that upfront. My read of the emerging regime changes that. It forces you to prove your code wasn’t the cause of the harm – “strict liability” in legal circles. Products like cars often get regulated this way. Essentially, the carmaker is at fault when something goes wrong unless they can prove they’re not. It’s a way of shifting societal costs back to the party that profits from the product in question. It allows consumers to be confident that cars are safe, without having an expert reverse engineer them before use or agreeing to accept that the brakes may fail – too bad for you. The carmaker designed and built a complex thing so they should be in the best position to prove they implemented appropriate safeguards.</p>



<p>So, how is open-source software implicated? If a commercial software product causes harm, whoever put the software on the market will soon be strictly liable. You will need to prove that your code wasn’t to blame to escape the costs. But what if you’ve embedded open-source code, used open-source tools, or called open-source APIs? Under the pending rules, you’d be liable for any errors in those sources as well, regardless of whether you directly contributed or not. A license like the one Apache provides won’t help, since state-imposed strict liability isn’t a harm that can be licensed away by private actors. The user must be made whole, and that’s on you. Worse still, how will you in turn identify or sue the collaborator or collaboration that actually wrote the faulty open-source code to recoup your costs? In that case, the license you signed likely insulates your open-source partners from your claims.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/u1UbotkGPqkBI1vLYXUk-N-VVxO8G5bxZ7LxHO-fo8_ddSHqPucKT6pD-qigwr9Gity11btgUM3nPOufuKSpsjo56zvHTS7GO2tOd-bd-5cZJUjkqC_3x89n05KzUOiSVPvfyXTnJ17-TN3iRPe7D2g" alt=""></figure>







<p>Let’s unpack that and put it simply. If a user is harmed by software, the person they paid (targeted ads would count) must compensate them for the harm – unless the software provider can prove their software played no role in the breach/loss/failure/psychological/physical/financial or other harm.<strong> If open source resources are in/called/touched your code, you’re responsible for their performance too.</strong> The open source resource licensed away their liability to you. Oops.</p>



<p>So what will the world look like when this change takes place? First off, despite the fact that many open source tools and resources are more robust and better reviewed than anything you could produce in-house, you’ll need to decide whether you accept the cost if they harm your users. That includes the burden of proving they didn’t, if you think that’s the case. Put another way, it may be hard to prove your code isn’t at fault without reviewing and defending every open source element involved. The open source community will have two choices: leave the licensing regime in place and leave those who use the code to hold the bag, or collaboratively assess and defend projects as claims emerge – even though that kind-of-means you need to assess your licensee’s code to ensure they didn’t just dump their own problem on you. More likely than not the open source community will choose the simpler path, stay the course,&nbsp; and leave others to deal with the new complexities.</p>



<p>The economic impact of this change reduces the value of open source software by placing the burden of bugs and breaches on developers who use and incorporate this code – even if they can prove the open source was at fault. Users must be made whole, open source add-ons have licensed away liability, and so the middle man is on the hook unless they can prove both the open source and closed source code they use is blame free. But that’s not a huge change – just the strict liability burden with open source collaborations getting a free pass. So why am I preaching doom?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/W20MaDgP8fZ7DcxjlXdZxA_u-5spvKAlCIzNJ3EqZ5HRMhY2ngJlglW0BoQxYhj6ADoey5eKVdF_M3KRPBUZQxzGjGGZ88h7lXI-DaXPtK61BPI4_wRuC3EL2E_eV8cRXRpWcJX8SZat5GSV4RXxyys" alt=""></figure>







<p><strong>What if an open source project is used directly by consumers, and causes them harm?</strong> The public policy is clear: they must be compensated. Does it matter if they signed a license or didn’t pay someone? Their business is bankrupt, their files are in a hacker’s hands, or their own customers are suing them. Someone should be strictly liable. But who?</p>



<p>The EU is grappling with that very question, and it culminates in whether “open source” is exempt from liability in a law designed to protect consumers. So far the answer is “probably not?” Exemption means consumers bear the cost – exactly what the law is trying to change. Perhaps if the open source in question remains an academic or research tool, versus reaching consumers, we’re okay? The proof may come when the first consumer demands compensation, and the courts step in. But lawmakers know enough to realize that much of the open source out there – by definition – belongs to no one, or many someones, or really nobody that can be named and made liable. So waiting on a court case might provide clarity but no compensation and no one to even argue the case. Not the clarity a law is designed to provide.</p>



<p>My prediction, for what it’s worth, is that open source’s days outside academia and hobbyists are numbered. At some point, some government authority will require a single throat-to-choke when open source causes consumer harm. <strong>Someone, or some entity, will need to accept financial and legal responsibility for what the project does in consumer hands. No license can insulate them from that.</strong> Given that existing open source licenses don’t contemplate a private purchase, they’ll need to either wind down, release licensees from taking them commercial, or find a means to restrict consumer use (which may be hard with no one in control). Policy makers simply won’t allow a dangerous animal to wander around unchained, and a lack of owner won’t make the situation better.</p>

The milestone gives an opportunity to look back at what once was the largest and most important company in the US (and arguably the world), and how it slowly declined.

Today, it makes just 12% of American steel, around a third of the steel that it made in 1955, and employs around the same number of people as online pet retailer </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)" rel="">Chewy</a><span>.</span></p><p>How did a once mighty industrial titan fall so far? Let’s take a look.</p><p>By the turn of the 20th century, the American steel industry had eclipsed Britain to be the largest and most efficient in the world. In 1896, an engineer for the Pennsylvania Steel Company wrote that “within the last decade America has made marvelous developments in her iron industry, until she now leads the world in the quantity of her products and bows to none in their quality”. Relentless competitors like Andrew Carnegie of Carnegie Steel had, in the course of expanding their steelmaking capacity and acquiring market share, steadily driven down the price of steel, which fell by more than 80% between 1870 and 1896.</p><p>But these successes had come at a cost. Steel production was subject to very large economies of scale - the larger your blast furnaces, and the more Bessemer converters and open hearth furnaces you operated, the cheaper making steel became. And because of the high fixed costs of these facilities, producers were incentivized to keep them full, cutting prices to just above the marginal cost of production in times of low demand. The result was chronic overcapacity and as steelmakers built ever-larger facilities and tried to underprice each other - at the end of the 19th century, nearly half of steelmaking capacity in the US went unused each year.</p><p><span>There was thus a growing desire for consolidation of the industry. If many competing firms were combined, production volumes of the new firm would rise and duplicate plant could be eliminated, enabling even greater economies of scale and lowered costs. The instigating event for such a merger was a&nbsp;banquet of bankers and industrialists in 1900, where Carnegie Steel president Charles Schwab spoke of the potential benefits of industry rationalization via merger. Less than 4 months later, it was done. Organized by JP Morgan, a new company was created by combining Carnegie Steel and Federal Steel, along with a hodgepodge of smaller companies including National Steel, American Sheet Steel, and American Hoop.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-140174766" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/no-inventions-no-innovations-a-history#footnote-2-140174766" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The new company, US Steel, was a monster. The first company to be worth more than $1 billion, the company had 168,000 employees and produced just under 9 million tons of steel annually, over 60% of all the steel in the US. And it quickly grew even larger. By 1917 US Steel (now up to 268,000 employees) was more than </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/09/19/americas-top-50-companies-1917-2017/?sh=378273e16295" rel="">3 times as large</a><span> as the next largest company, AT&amp;T, and had more than 7 times as many employees as Standard Oil when </span><a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,871865,00.html" rel="">it was broken up</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The decades prior to the formation of US Steel were characterized by cutthroat competition, but that ended with the formation of US Steel. The head of the new company, Judge Elbert Gary, was a fundamentally conservative businessman, and his desire was to bring stability to what was a cyclical and chaotic industry. Whereas previously companies like Carnegie Steel would constantly cut prices to achieve greater market share and drive their competitors out of business, Gary set (generally) higher prices, and kept them high even as demand for steel fluctuated. Though its size did give it production cost advantages, these savings were retained as higher profits rather than passed on to the consumer. Gary was, according to former managing director of Carnegie Steel James Gayley, “opposed to the old method of going out into the market and slashing prices in order to get business”. To maintain prices in the face of fluctuating demand, Gary would gather the industry’s leadership together in regular “</span><a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,728689,00.html" rel="">Gary Dinners</a><span>”, where price levels would be agreed upon and Gary would “exhort the chairmen, presidents, or other major owners of steel companies to maintain rank”. Those who refused to cooperate would be “disciplined” by the others. Many former Carnegie Steel executives, schooled in the intense competition of the Carnegie years, were allergic to this strategy, and departed for other steel companies.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png" width="606" height="451" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:451,&quot;width&quot;:606,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Temin 1964 and USGS</figcaption></figure></div><p>Gary proved adept at navigating the company through a cultural climate that was increasingly hostile towards potential monopolies. Under his leadership, the company successfully fought off a Justice Department lawsuit to break up the company as an illegal monopoly. (Perversely, the court ruled that the Gary Dinners proved that US Steel did not have the power to set prices, and thus couldn’t be a monopoly). But other threats proved harder to cope with. US Steel was consistently behind on adopting the latest steelmaking technology, and was often forced to license technologies from more forward-looking companies (some of which were run by former Carnegie men). A 1936 magazine article described early US Steel company policy as “No inventions; no innovations”.</p><p>In 1902, for instance, a man named Henry Grey invented what was known as a “Universal Beam Mill”. At the time, beams were made in the shape of an uppercase I, with a tall vertical web capped with narrow flanges at the top and the bottom. If you wanted wider flanges capable of carrying heavier loads, you would need to weld or rivet steel plates to the beam, an expensive and time-consuming process. The Universal Mill made it possible to roll wide-flange beams in a single operation, eliminating the process of attaching extra steel plates. Grey first brought his mill design to US Steel, but it was rejected by the finance committee. Instead, the first Universal Mill in the US was built by Bethlehem Steel, run by former Carnegie president Charles Schwab. Faced with declining market share in the growing construction steel market (which made heavy use of wide-flange steel beams), US Steel was ultimately forced to license the Universal Mill from Bethlehem in 1926.</p><p>The same pattern repeated for other new technologies. In the 1920s, technology for making large-diameter pipe by electrical resistance welding was invented. Though it was (supposedly) first offered to US Steel, the company again passed, only to adopt it several years later to keep up with its competitors. Around the same time, technology for continuous rolling of wide sheets of steel was invented, which greatly reduced production costs. US Steel had investigated continuous sheet rolling as early as 1902, but had abandoned its efforts. Instead, it was once again forced to license the technology from others to remain competitive (though in fairness, it was one of the first manufacturers to license it).</p><p>More generally, US Steel’s enormous size made it unwieldy and difficult to manage. It took time for information to filter up through the many layers of management between the factory floor and company leadership, and to get all of the disparate operations of the company moving in the same direction. This, on top of the fundamental conservative culture created by Gary, and the lack of top management talent as former Carnegie executives abandoned the company, caused US Steel to steadily lose market share to its more agile rivals. The company continued to grow, but other companies grew faster. By 1941 US Steel’s output had risen to nearly 30 million tons of steel annually, triple what it made when it was founded, but its market share had fallen from over 60% to around 35%.</p><p><span>At the end of WWII, the American steel industry was an unchallenged juggernaut. During the war, American steel production had risen by more than a third, while the steel industries of most other countries had been nearly wiped out. By 1945, America was producing over 60% of the world’s steel. American steelmakers had the latest technology, unparalleled expertise, the largest economies of scale, and easy access to resources such as iron ore and coal. In 1945, the president of the US Steel Export Company George Wolf testified before congress that “the European steel industry is still far behind that of the United States, product, quality, and cost wise”, and that the gap was “an ever-widening one”. Japan, which would later emerge as a steel juggernaut, wasn’t even on the radar, producing just </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/27157/chapter-abstract/196566880?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="">0.56 million tons</a><span> in 1946 against America’s 66 million tons. US Steel continued to dominate the industry, producing more than twice as much steel as the next largest company (Bethlehem Steel), and averaging around 30% of American steel output in the mid-1950s.</span></p><p>With seemingly no rivals on the horizon, American steel companies, including US Steel, became complacent. The post-war years are sometimes described as the “dodo period” of the American steel industry, as it steadily raised prices (steel prices rose at 7% annually between 1947 and 1957) and enjoyed large profits while ignoring the progress that was taking place in other parts of the world.</p><p><span>As American steelmakers built new capacity to meet post-war demand (by 1962 American steel capacity reached 154 million tons annually, nearly twice the production at the end of WWII), they did so using existing steelmaking technology, primarily the open hearth furnace. In an open hearth furnace, a combination of liquid pig iron from a blast furnace and steel scrap is placed in a large crucible, which is then heated using burning gas blown through a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_heat_exchanger" rel="">regenerative heat exchanger</a><span>. In 1954, over 90% of steelmaking capacity in the US was open hearth furnaces, with the balance a mix of electric arc furnaces and Bessemer converters.</span></p><p>But in 1952, a new steelmaking technology appeared, the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF). The BOF was in a sense a refinement of the earlier Bessemer converter, the first technology for mass-producing steel. Whereas the Bessemer converter worked by blowing air through liquid pig iron from below, the BOF worked by blowing pure oxygen into pig iron from above. Oxygen furnaces had been conceived as early as the mid-19th century, but weren’t feasible to build until pure oxygen began to be made on an industrial scale in the 20th century.</p><p>The open hearth furnace replaced Bessemer converters because the latter was difficult to control, tended to result in nitrogen-embrittled steel, and was limited in the types of ore it could use. But open hearths came with drawbacks. They were more expensive to build, ran slower, and required much more fuel than Bessemer converters. Only cheap scrap metal, which could be remelted in an open hearth furnace along with liquid pig iron, made them economical to operate.</p><p>The BOF, by contrast, had many of the benefits of the Bessemer converter (rapid conversion of iron to steel, low fuel and labor costs, comparatively cheaper to build) while eliminating many of its drawbacks (nitrogen embrittlement, limitations on types of ore it could use).</p><p>The first commercial BOF was built in Austria in 1952, and diffused through the industry as other companies experimented with it. By the end of the 1950s, it was clear that the BOF could produce steel more cheaply than the open hearth furnace (and in fact, no new open hearth integrated steelworks were built in the US after 1958).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png" width="540" height="345" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:345,&quot;width&quot;:540,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>But US Steel was once again slow to adopt the technology. Reluctant to abandon expensive open hearths that had years of useful life left, as late as 1962 US Steel executives were arguing that open hearth steel would remain competitive. US Steel didn’t build its first BOF until 1964, well behind other American companies like Kaiser Steel, which by 1964 was making 43% of its steel in BOFs.</p><p>Though US Steel was once again a laggard, it was emblematic of the entire US Steel industry, which was comparatively slow to adopt the BOF. By the time US Steel built its first BOF, the BOF was producing around 17% of steel in the US, compared to around 55% of steel in Japan.</p><p>And the BOF wasn’t the only steel technology where Japan was pushing ahead of America. In pursuit of ever-larger economies of scale, Japan went far beyond the US in the size of its blast furnaces. By the mid-1970s, average blast furnace size at Nippon Steel was 4 times the average at US Steel, and by 1977 more than half the blast furnaces in Japan had a volume of more than 2000 cubic meters, compared to just 2.6% of furnaces in the US. When US Steel had trouble with its own large blast furnace at its Gary Works, it was eventually forced to turn to the Japanese for help, who by then had much more experience than Americans operating very large furnaces.</p><p>A similar trajectory occurred with continuous casting technology, which produced continuous slabs of steel instead of individual ingots, and thus eliminated much of the rolling required for steel production. Though US firms pioneered much of this research, other countries adopted it more quickly. By 1975, only 9% of steel was continuously cast in the US, compared to 31% in Japan and 24% in West Germany. Here again, US Steel lagged, and didn’t widely adopt continuous casting until the early 1990s.</p><p>Thus, by the early 1960s cracks in America’s seemingly unassailable steel industry were beginning to show. Foreign producers like Japan had expanded their industries and adopted the newest steelmaking technology like the BOF and continuous casting. American steelmakers like US Steel, saddled with outdated technology and high labor costs, found themselves under threat from foreign producers for the first time. By 1958 some steelmakers in Germany and Japan were able to compete on price with US producers, and by the mid-1970s input costs for Japanese steel (ore, labor, coking coal, etc.) were nearly half those of US costs. Between 1955 and 1970 steel imports to the US increased by more than factor of 10, going from less than 2% of US production to more than 15%, and continued to rise.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png" width="733" height="463" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:463,&quot;width&quot;:733,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>In the face of foreign pressure, US Steel could no longer maintain the “price leadership” it had in the past, setting whatever price it wanted and encouraging the rest of the industry to follow suit. The company continued to lose ground to its more nimble rivals, who now included overseas competitors. By 1971, it was still the largest steel company in the US, but had been eclipsed in size by Japanese steelmaker </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=goF9w0jocLgC&amp;pg=PA30603&amp;dq=history+of+nippon+steel&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwlp2D35uDAxUgsoQIHXdoAyU4MhDoAXoECAYQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20nippon%20steel&amp;f=false" rel="">Nippon Steel</a><span>. Its annual output of steel was just over 27 million tons, less than it had produced in 1941, and its share of the US market had fallen to around 24%.</span></p><p>The American steel industry responded to the rise of foreign producers not by trying to improve their operations, but by demanding government protection from “unfair” foreign trade practices. In 1968, steel producers in Japan and Europe, at the behest of President Lyndon Johnson, agreed to artificially restrict their steel exports to the US. This was intended to give US producers “breathing room” to modernize their facilities and improve operations, though this didn’t occur (in fact, capital investment by American steelmakers declined after the agreements). And though pressure had been temporarily removed, things were about to get much worse for US Steel and the American steel industry.</p><p><span>Having temporarily fended off foreign threats, American steel production continued to climb. In 1973, right around when Hyman Roth was boasting that their mafia operations were “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmxluz27Q-4" rel="">bigger than US Steel</a><span>”, America produced 137 million tons of steel, more than any other country in the world. While not the unrivaled behemoth it once was, US Steel was still the </span><a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/1973/" rel="">13th largest company in the US</a><span> by revenue, and the largest steelmaker in the US.</span></p><p>It was widely predicted that demand for steel would continue to rise, as it had for most of the 20th century. In 1972, chairman of US Steel Edwin Gott predicted that worldwide demand for steel would rise 25% by 1980. Countries around the world expanded their steelmaking capacity in anticipation.</p><p>Instead, demand for steel stagnated. Between 1973 and 1984 worldwide demand for steel was essentially flat, and in industrialized countries it declined by around 25%. Steelmakers around the world, faced with large amounts of excess capacity, were incentivized to sell steel for just above the variable costs of production, “dumping” it on foreign markets. It’s somewhat unclear if such dumping actually occurred, but steel imports to the US continued to rise through the 1970s even as overall demand dropped. And US Steel was hurt most of all - nearly all of the loss in market share to foreign steelmakers came at the expense of US Steel.</p><p><span>American producers once again demanded government protection from foreign competition. They filed dozens of “antidumping” cases under the Trade Act of 1974, and secured other protectionist measures such as a “</span><a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/1982/ec-19820517-the-steel-trigger-price-mechanism" rel="">trigger price mechanism</a><span>” in 1978 (which prevented foreign steelmakers from selling below their total costs of production) and a new round of voluntary export restrictions in 1984.</span></p><p>These measures helped stave off foreign competition - steel imports declined from 26 million tons in 1984 to 17 million tons in 1989. But they couldn’t stop a threat that was emerging from within the US: the minimill.</p><p>Historically, steel had been produced in large, integrated steelworks. Iron ore would be turned into pig iron in a blast furnace, which would then be turned into steel in an open hearth or basic oxygen furnace. From there, the steel would be cast into ingots or slabs and then rolled into various shapes - wire, rods, plate, beams, sheets, and so on.</p><p>But in the late 1960s, a new type of steelmaking facility began to appear, the minimill. The minimill made steel not by processing iron ore, but by remelting scrap steel in an electric arc furnace. By eliminating the blast furnaces which turned iron ore into pig iron, minimills were not only much cheaper to build than integrated steelworks (as little as 1/10th the cost per ton of steel they produced), but they could profitably be built much smaller. And the scrap steel they required was widely available thanks to the previous transition to the BOF, which used much less scrap than the open hearth it replaced.</p><p>Because scrap steel was often contaminated with other metals such as copper that couldn’t be easily separated, minimill steel was initially lower quality than BOF steel, and minimills were only competitive in products where such quality didn’t matter, like concrete reinforcing steel. But as minimill technology improved, they began to take more and more share from large, integrated steelmakers like US Steel. Between 1974 and 1994 steelmaking capacity of integrated producers fell by more than 50%, while the capacity of minimills increased by 360%, reaching 30% of American steelmaking capacity.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

It cut tens of thousands of jobs and closed dozens of plants, reducing employment from 171,000 in 1979 to less than 21,000 in 1995. It divested many of its auxiliary operations like mines, warehouses, and bridge construction. It abandoned market segments like rebar and heavy structural steel where it couldn’t compete with the minimills, and instead focused on things like sheet steel products (which minimills still had trouble with), concentrating operations in a small number of large plants. By 1985, US Steel had closed more than 150 facilities, and by 1998 its steelmaking capacity was down 71% from its peak in 1973.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png" width="780" height="298" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:298,&quot;width&quot;:780,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>(US Steel was far from the only integrated producer that needed to take such drastic steps.

As imports continued to rise (reaching 37% of US production in 1998), and minimills continued to take market share (electric arc furnaces reached 47% of US production by 2000), US Steel survived where many of its competitors didn’t. Kaiser Steel, the company that had beaten US Steel to the punch in installing BOFs, closed shop in 1983 after 18 quarters of losses.

It was created as a fundamentally conservative reaction to the vicissitudes of the steel industry, and this guided its early years and shaped its culture. The economies of scale it achieved were never passed on to the consumer, and instead it used its size to bully other steelmakers and extract money from consumers. When this stopped working, it used its political influence to prevent consumers from buying low-cost foreign steel. Improving the efficiency of its operations was something it did as a last resort when left with no other options.</p><p>The company’s large size made it unwieldy to manage, and it was late to every major advance in steelmaking technology of the last 100 years, from continuous rolling to the basic oxygen furnace to the minimill. When the company did try its hand at technology innovation, it reliably made missteps. In some cases, like with continuous rolling, it gave up too early, while in other cases it spent many years unsuccessfully developing a technology. In the 1950s, for instance, it spent many years trying to develop an alternative to the BOF that blew oxygen in from the side, long after other producers had given up on the technology. And in the 1970s it tried to develop another alternative to the BOF called Q-BOP that likewise didn’t seem to pan out. As far as I can tell, no major steelmaking technology over the last century came out of US Steel.&nbsp;</p><p>The US Steel of today is a far cry from the industrial giant of the 20th century. But being transformed into a lean, competitive company doesn’t seem to have changed its fundamental culture, a company that's content to be a follower, rather than a leader in technological development and pushing the industry forward.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>The world’s longest land and subsea interconnector started commercial operations today (29<sup>th</sup> December 2023).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>National Grid’s new Viking Link electricity interconnector became operational this afternoon&nbsp;transporting power between the UK and Denmark. The link has a capacity of 1.4 GW and stretches for 475 miles under land and sea to join Bicker Fen substation in Lincolnshire with Revsing substation in southern Jutland, Denmark.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The £1.7 billion&nbsp;project is a joint venture between National Grid and Danish System Operator, Energinet, and has the capacity to transport enough electricity for up to 2.5 million* UK homes, bringing over £500 million of cumulative savings for UK consumers over the next decade* due to cheaper imported power from Denmark.</span></p><p><span>Construction on Viking Link, National Grid’s sixth interconnector,&nbsp;started in 2019, with more than four<strong>&nbsp;</strong>million working hours spent to get to this point.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>National Grid’s interconnector business is run by National Grid Ventures (NGV),&nbsp;which operates outside of National Grid’s core regulated businesses in the UK and US. NGV develops, operates and invests in energy projects, technologies and partnerships to accelerate the development of our clean energy future.</span></p><p><span>Viking Link will bring huge benefits for UK consumers including cheaper, lower carbon power and increased energy security as the UK can call on additional power from Denmark when needed.&nbsp;</span></p><div><p><span>Initially,</span><span> Viking Link will be operating at a capacity of 800MW before increasing up over time to 1.4GW.&nbsp;</span><span>National Grid and Energinet will be working together to bring the asset up to full capacity over the coming year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In its first year of operation Viking Link is expected to save approximately 600,000 tonnes of carbon emissions – this is equivalent to taking roughly 280,000 cars off the road.*</span></p></div><p><span>President of National Grid Ventures Katie Jackson said: “This record-breaking new link is a fantastic example of engineering and collaboration with our partner, Energinet. As we deploy more wind power to meet our climate and energy security targets, connections to our neighbouring countries will play a vital role increasing security of supply and reducing prices for consumers. Stretching further across land and sea than any of our existing links, it connects the UK to clean, green Danish energy, improving security of supply and bringing huge carbon and cost savings for UK consumers.”</span></p><p><span>Viking Link has a converter station on each end of the cable where the power is transformed into the correct frequency before being transported onto each country’s transmission systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;Principal Contractor Siemens Energy built the converter<u>&nbsp;</u>station in the UK while Energinet built the Danish converter station. &nbsp;Siemens Energy have designed, installed and commissioned the electrical assets on both sides.</span></p><p><span>The HVDC offshore cable was manufactured and laid by Prysmian Group</span><s><span>&nbsp;</span></s><span>. The cable was laid on the seabed using a custom-made vessel The Leonardo Da Vinci which was then buried using Asso trenchers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;Prysmian Group manufactured the HVDC land cable which was installed by Balfour Beatty, the offshore section was manufactured and installed by Prysmian Group<u> i</u>n the UK and the Danish land section was manufactured by NKT and installed by Monck.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The UK land cable was made up of 118 sections stretching for 67km between Bicker Fen and Sutton-on-Sea where the subsea cable begins. It was connected to the UK’s National Transmission Network by National Grid Electricity Transmission at the existing Bicker Fen substation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Interconnectors enable the fast, flexible sharing of energy between countries, making them the perfect tool for managing the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The switch on was a proud moment for Managing Director of National Grid Interconnectors Rebecca Sedler.</span></p><div><p><span>She said:&nbsp;"Viking Link is an achievement for both Denmark and the UK, and consumers in both countries will benefit from this infrastructure for many years to come. The hard work and collaboration of our teams, accounting for more than four million labour hours, highlights National Grid’s dedication to the UK’s clean energy transition.”</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;National Grid launched the UK’s first interconnector (IFA) to France in 1986. Since then, it has built five more including a second link with France (IFA2) and further connections with The Netherlands (BritNed), Belgium (Nemo Link) and Norway (North Sea Link).</span></p></div><p><span>Between 2020 and 2030, National Grid expects its interconnectors will have helped the UK to avoid around 100 million tonnes of carbon emissions and by 2030, 90% of the energy imported through the company’s interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources.</span></p><p><span><strong>Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said:</strong></span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Great news today as the new Viking Link interconnector starts to transport energy between Denmark and the UK, under the North Sea.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&nbsp;The 475-mile cable is the longest land and subsea electricity cable in the world and will provide cleaner, cheaper more secure energy to power up to 2.5 million homes in the UK.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&nbsp;It will help British families save £500 million on their bills over the next decade, while cutting emissions.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Earlier this year (2023) National Grid announced joint plans with TenneT for a new 1.8GW interconnector between the UK and The Netherlands, called LionLink. The link would not only join the two countries but also connect to offshore wind generation.&nbsp;LionLink would be the second link between the two countries and is expected to be operational in the early 2030s. A second new link called Nautilus, is also in the planning phase with the potential to connect with Belgium.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To find out more about National Grid Interconnectors, how they work and their role in decarbonising the energy system click&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/national-grid-ventures/interconnectors-connecting-cleaner-future"><span><strong>here</strong></span></a><span>.</span></p>

The narrative in my head played out like this: “was I really so bad that they wouldn’t even tell me no?” It was also a chilling effect for my projects that involved generative AI. I didn’t want to work on them. Every time I logged into my Github, I was reminded of the company because I still had a fork of the take home assignment. It took about a month for my project work to feel normal again, but I shelved some of my LLM projects and moved on. The fire of disappointment had smoldered into an ember of resentment.</p><p id="2323">The resentment that, months later, inspired me to write a message to the team’s Product Manager (PM). I didn’t reach out on Linkedin. It was much more intimate, using my gamer tag. Discord is a social media platform where you can join communities that have chat rooms, forums, video and voice chat. I am a member of 50+ Discord communities, and many of them are dedicated to open source projects or technologies. The PM was in a Discord I was active in for an open source LLM toolset. Seeing that they were still in the server, and not wanting them to entice others to get ghosted. I private messaged them with the story of my experience. Thankfully, he was receptive.</p></div><div><p id="556c">I had finished a 3-hour take home test and went through hours of Zoom interviews. My loop was done. I didn’t feel great about my performance, but didn’t feel bad. I had done well, but not perfect. My experience was not well aligned with the role. They were looking for a senior level engineer they deemed an “AI hacker.” I had spent the previous decade in technical lead roles, spending as much time on technical direction as I have with coding. I was expecting a message in the next two weeks saying “no,” but would be pleasantly surprised if they said “yes.”</p><p id="88bd">Two weeks after my final interview, I hear nothing. I am tired of waiting for the no, so I send an email to the recruiter asking for more details. I thought that something probably happened in the process and I slipped through the cracks, and I want to give them the opportunity to do the right thing. The right thing being not ghosting me. The recruiter never responded.</p><blockquote><p id="35e4">Ugh. That’s tough to hear.</p></blockquote><p id="1b09">The PM says after I tell them about this part in the story.</p><blockquote><p id="7fd0">Let me go talk to our talent team and see what went on here. Really appreciate you sharing this with me.</p></blockquote><figure><figcaption>Ghost in an email shell. Source: Dall-E</figcaption></figure><p id="78fb">There is this sort of liminal space between interpreting behavior as a mistake or malicious, at least for the story I tell in my head. I remind myself of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Hanlon’s razor</a>, “never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by [misunderstanding].” When the weeks passed by with no response from the recruiter, the story in my head solidified — it’s malice. However, after the PM’s attempted reconciliation and more context, it seems like it was probably misunderstanding, or in the actual quote from Wikipedia: “stupidity.” A week after the PM got back to me, I get this email:</p><figure><figcaption>Mixed feelings of 🙏and🖕. Source: Me</figcaption></figure><p id="019a">I didn’t bomb the interview and feedback was generally positive, though vague. Their policy is to not ghost candidates, and it seems I slipped through the cracks. This works for me as closure. I will not be responding to the recruiting manager. I thanked the PM for helping me out, solid person, really appreciate them.</p><h2 id="8aec">Ghost World</h2><p id="b392">I had not been ghosted by an interviewer before. I typically apply to positions where I know people, so that may be why. I reached out to some coding communities I am in to ask for their experiences. Here are the parts of the discussion that stuck out:</p><blockquote><p id="0e93">Almost all of the people i know have been ghosted multiple times by potential employers</p><p id="ebb6">I had an HR lady tell me ‘we’ll definitely reach out one way or another we’re not one of those places that will leave you hanging’ and then proceed to leave me hanging</p><p id="f303">recruiters have really been shit the past couple years with actually responding<br>in the tech world…. Literally every single company i interviewed at (including some really big well known ones) recently have ghosted me</p></blockquote><p id="7def">This is a small sample, and does not include all the people who weren’t ghosted. These people are smart and talented with varying levels of experience.</p><p id="d9bf">Knowing the skillsets of others who got ghosted and my personal experience, here are some of my assumptions about the recruitment ghosting trend:</p><ul><li id="2df6">It has nothing to do with how well you interviewed (you could be 2nd pick and still get ghosted).</li><li id="133b">The majority of people who participated in the interview are not aware of the ghosting. The people who performed the interview probably assume they have humane recruiting practices.</li><li id="85e3">There is no perceived incentive from recruiters to not ghost</li><li id="42d4">Verifying or measuring contact with rejected candidates is not a priority and not done. Even if there is a policy, there is nobody checking to see if it is followed.</li></ul><h2 id="7f40">Nonperformative policy</h2><blockquote><p id="819b">the message that they intended to send to you never made it to your inbox. You were meant to receive our decision with a link to book time for feedback.</p></blockquote><p id="78e2">In Sarah Ahmed’s <em>Complaint! </em>she talks about institutions and their policies, describing many as “nonperformative,” a term which “seemed to capture how saying something was not doing something.” Some policies exist simply to bolster the institutions image, like an anti-bullying policy or inclusion policy.</p><p id="75f5">Nonperformative policies are not necessarily malicious, they come about when there is no investment or measurement into the success of the policy. In my case, the policy to follow up with every candidate was not appropriately measured, therefore allowing me to “slip through the cracks.”</p><p id="4cce">I wonder how many other candidates have slipped through the cracks as well. From the recruiter’s perspective, there is very little incentive to do a final follow up with a rejected candidate. That person is no longer part of the pool of potential candidates, which is the group of people who will make them money. They will definitely prioritize profitable communications over closing the loop with a rejected candidate.</p><h2 id="e7ed"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p id="1410">From a game theory perspective if “winning” is having a job that fits all your wants and needs. Then the best way to win is to look and apply for jobs constantly, not just when you are discontent with your current job. That means a lot of opportunities for learning and improving interviewing skills. When recruiters ghost us, it becomes incredibly difficult to gauge our performance in those interviews and continue to improve.</p><p id="0a9b">The truth is that getting ghosted by recruiters (or anyone) feels bad. Spending 10 hours on an interview process to not even get the time of day for a “no” is an inhumane practice and should be stopped. It cannot just be stopped with a policy, there needs to be measurement of compliance to the policy. The whole thing could be automated rather simply.</p><p id="73d2">We all know that working with recruiters can be frustrating from both a candidate and interviewer perspective. Those of us who perform interviews regularly in our professional lives should be more aware and verify that loops are closed for candidates. I have so many great conversations with potential coworkers, but a lot of times it doesn’t work out. I want those people to be treated with dignity and respect, and the easiest way I can do that is to ping the recruiter I work with on Slack and verify. So, that’s what I’ll do. Thanks for reading.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
		
			
			<div>
				
<p>This December, if there’s one tech New Year’s resolution I’d encourage you to have, it’s switching to the only remaining ethical web browser, <a href="https://firefox.com/">Firefox</a>. According to recent posts on social media, Firefox’s market share is slipping. We should not let that happen. There are two main reasons why switching is important.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2047" height="1356" src="https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k.jpg" alt="A red panda (firefox) resting on a tree branch." srcset="https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k.jpg 2047w, https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k-1440x954.jpg 1440w, https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k-768x509.jpg 768w, https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k-1070x709.jpg 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px"><figcaption>“<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91501748@N07/16071828377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Panda</a>” by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91501748@N07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mathias Appel</a> is marked with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=openverse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC0 1.0</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>1. Privacy</h2>



<p>Firefox is the only major browser not built by a company that makes money from advertising and/or selling your personal data. There’s been a lot of talk about websites tracking users using cookies, fingerprinting and other nefarious technologies that hurt your privacy. But owning the browser puts Google, Apple and Microsoft in a position where they don’t even need those tricks. We need to use browsers that are independent, and right now that means Firefox.</p>



<h2>2. Browser engine monopoly</h2>



<p>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines">lists four browser engines as being “active”</a>. Browser engines are the bits that take a web page’s code and display it on your screen. Ideally, they conform to the official <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> standards, and display all elements as it describes. If that’s the case, web developers can easily write sites that work on all browsers. No proprietary vendor lock-in nonsense, just glorious open standards at work.</p>



<h3>It’s happened before</h3>



<p>In the early 2000’s, Internet Explorer had a massive 95% market share. This meant that many sites were only developed for use with IE. They’d use experimental features that IE supported, in favor of things from the official HTML standard. This was a very bad situation, which hindered the development of the World Wide Web.</p>



<p>Currenty, Chrome, Safari and Edge all use variations of the closely related Webkit and Blink engines. If we want to avoid another browser engine monopoly, we need to support Firefox, and its “Gecko” engine.</p>



<h2>Firefox is actually really good</h2>



<p>If Firefox would be a bad browser, I would not recommend you to switch. It’s fast, has a nice user interface, and feels every bit as modern and elegant as its competition. I’ve been using it as my main browser for a couple of years now, on Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android. As a web developer, I usually have at least three browsers open, but when I go look something up on the web, I pick Firefox.</p>



<p>So please, help save the web by <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">using the best browser out there</a>. It’s an easy thing to do, and it makes a big difference.</p>

It was updated in December 2023.</p><p>We live cheek by jowl with undiscovered worlds. Sometimes the barriers that separate us are thick, sometimes they’re thin, and sometimes they’re breached. That’s when a wardrobe turns into a portal to Narnia, a rabbit hole leads to Wonderland, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABpeLNCuE3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raquel Welch poster</a> is all that separates a prison cell from the tunnel to freedom.</p><h2 id="h-a-fateful-swing-of-the-hammer">A fateful swing of the hammer</h2><p>Those are all fictional examples. But in 1963, that barrier was breached for real. Taking a sledgehammer to a wall in his basement, a man in the Turkish town of Derinkuyu got more home improvement than he bargained for. Behind the wall, he found a tunnel. And that led to more tunnels, eventually connecting a multitude of halls and chambers. It was a huge underground complex, abandoned by its inhabitants and undiscovered until that fateful swing of the hammer.</p><p>The anonymous Turk — no report mentions his name — had found a vast subterranean city, up to 18 stories and 280 feet (76 m) deep and large enough to house 20,000 people. Who built it, and why? When was it abandoned, and by whom? History and geology provide some answers.</p><h2>Fantastically craggy Cappadocia</h2><p>Geology first. Derinkuyu is located in Cappadocia, a region in the Turkish heartland famed for the fantastic cragginess of its landscape, which is dotted with so-called fairy chimneys. Those tall stone towers are the result of the erosion of a rock type known as <em>tuff</em>. Created out of volcanic ash and covering much of the region, that stone, despite its name, is not so tough.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/interior-view.jpeg" alt="derinkuyu" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/interior-view.jpeg 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/interior-view.jpeg?resize=375,281 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/interior-view.jpeg?resize=640,480 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/interior-view.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w"><p><figcaption>Well-lit interior view of the otherwise dark and gloomy underground city of Derinkuyu.

Cappadocia numbers hundreds of subterranean dwellings, with about 40 consisting of at least two levels. None is as large, or by now as famous, as Derinkuyu.</p><h2>Hittites, Phrygians, or early Christians?</h2><p>The historical record has little definitive to say about Derinkuyu’s origins. Some archaeologists speculate that the oldest part of the complex could have been dug about 2000 BC by the Hittites, the people who dominated the region at that time, or else the Phrygians, around 700 BC. Others claim that local Christians built the city in the first centuries AD. </p><p>Whoever they were, they had great skill: the soft rock makes tunneling relatively easy, but cave-ins are a big risk. Hence, there is a need for large support pillars. None of the floors at Derinkuyu have ever collapsed.</p><p>Two things about the underground complex are more certain. First, the main purpose of the monumental effort must have been to hide from enemy armies — hence, for example, the rolling stones used to close the city from the inside. Second, the final additions and alterations to the complex, which bear a distinctly Christian imprint, date from the 6th to the 10th century AD.</p><h2>Hitting bottom in the dungeon</h2><p>When shut off from the world above, the city was ventilated by a total of more than 15,000 shafts, most about 10 cm wide and reaching down into the first and second levels of the city. This ensured sufficient ventilation down to the eighth level.</p><p>The upper levels were used as living and sleeping quarters — which makes sense, as they were the best ventilated ones. The lower levels were mainly used for storage, but they also contained a dungeon.</p><p>In between were spaces used for all kinds of purposes: there was room for a wine press, domestic animals, a convent, and small churches. The most famous one is the cruciform church on the seventh level.</p><h2>If buckets could speak</h2><p>Some shafts went much deeper and doubled as wells. Even as the underground city lay undiscovered, the local Turkish population of Derinkuyu used these to get their water, not knowing the hidden world their buckets passed through. Incidentally, <em>derin kuyu</em> is Turkish for “deep well.”</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img decoding="async" width="3000" height="1697" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg" alt="derinkuyu" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg 3000w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=20,12 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=40,23 40w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=80,45 80w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=160,90 160w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=256,144 256w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=320,180 320w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=375,212 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=640,362 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=768,434 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=1024,579 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derinkuyu-Underground-City.jpeg?resize=1280,724 1280w"><p><figcaption>The subterranean city could house up to 20,000 people, plenty of domestic animals, and enough supplies to wait out an invading army.

Cappadocian winters can get very cold, the summers extremely hot. Below ground, the ambient temperature is constant and moderate. As a bonus, it is easier to store and keep harvest yields away from moisture and thieves.</p><p>Whatever the relevance of its other functions, the underground city was much in use as a refuge for the local population during the wars between the Byzantines and the Arabs, which lasted from the late 8th to the late 12th centuries; during the Mongol raids in the 14th century; and after the region was conquered by the Ottoman Turks.</p><h2>Leaving the “soft” place</h2><p>A visiting Cambridge linguist visiting the area in the early 20th century attests that the local Greek population still reflexively sought shelter in the underground city when news of massacres elsewhere reached them.</p><p>Following the Greco-Turkish War (1919-22), the two countries agreed to exchange minorities in 1923, in order to ethnically homogenize their populations. The Cappadocian Greeks of Derinkuyu left too, and took with them both the knowledge of the underground city and the Greek name of the place: <em>Mαλακοπια (Malakopia)</em>, which means “soft” — possibly a reference to the pliancy of the local stone.</p><p>Derinkuyu is now one of Cappadocia’s biggest tourist attractions, so it no longer counts as an undiscovered world. But perhaps there’s one on the other side of your basement wall.

<p>The Fourth Amendment is rarely a match for the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=third+party+doctrine" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=third+party+doctrine">Third Party Doctrine</a>. In recent years, things have gotten a wee bit better thanks <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/06/22/supreme-court-says-warrants-are-needed-cell-site-location-info/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/06/22/supreme-court-says-warrants-are-needed-cell-site-location-info/">to a couple</a> of Supreme Court rulings. But the operative principle still overrides: whatever we share (voluntarily or not) with private companies can often be obtained without a warrant.</p>
<p>That’s why bills <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/18/ron-wyden-its-time-to-kill-third-party-doctrine-go-back-to-respecting-privacy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/18/ron-wyden-its-time-to-kill-third-party-doctrine-go-back-to-respecting-privacy/">have been introduced</a> to add Fourth Amendment protections to cell location data gathered by phone apps. That’s why there’s been a constant struggle in courts <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/21/wyden-bill-targeting-data-broker-sales-to-law-enforcement-passes-in-the-house/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/21/wyden-bill-targeting-data-broker-sales-to-law-enforcement-passes-in-the-house/">and in Congress</a> to reconcile the Third Party Doctrine with the Fourth Amendment, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/03/25/data-broker-looking-to-sell-real-time-vehicle-location-data-to-government-agencies-including-military/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/03/25/data-broker-looking-to-sell-real-time-vehicle-location-data-to-government-agencies-including-military/">given the vast amount</a> of information and data Americans now share with thousands of third parties.</p>
<p>Then there’s the players in the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/09/yet-another-data-broker-found-to-give-massive-amounts-of-location-info-to-law-enforcement/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/09/yet-another-data-broker-found-to-give-massive-amounts-of-location-info-to-law-enforcement/">Third Party Doctrine market</a>. There’s the government, which wants as much information as it can obtain without having to subject its actions and motives to judicial scrutiny. And there are the private companies, who figure it’s far more cost effective to just give the government what it wants, rather than challenge government requests for data in court. </p>
<p>The private entities involved here probably have more reason than most to not try to piss the government off. Not only are they <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/us-pharmacy-chain-rite-aid-agrees-bankruptcy-mediation-gets-loan-approval-2023-12-19/#:~:text=Rite%20Aid%2C%20which%20operates%20about,filling%20illegal%20or%20suspicious%20prescriptions." data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/us-pharmacy-chain-rite-aid-agrees-bankruptcy-mediation-gets-loan-approval-2023-12-19/#:~:text=Rite%20Aid%2C%20which%20operates%20about,filling%20illegal%20or%20suspicious%20prescriptions.">still struggling to recover from a widespread retail downturn</a> ignited by a worldwide pandemic, but they’re also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/13/1142416718/cvs-walgreens-opioid-crisis-settlement" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/13/1142416718/cvs-walgreens-opioid-crisis-settlement">paying off large settlements to the government</a> for playing things a bit too fast and loose when it came to handing out opioids to Americans.</p>
<p>As Beth Mole reports for Ars Technica (and following on the heels of the news pharmacy chain Rite Aid is facing a five-year facial recognition tech ban), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/cvs-rite-aid-walgreens-hand-out-medical-records-to-cops-without-warrants/" data-type="link" data-id="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/cvs-rite-aid-walgreens-hand-out-medical-records-to-cops-without-warrants/">every major player in the retail pharmacy business has been handing over sensitive medical data to the government</a> without ever demanding to see an actual warrant. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All of the big pharmacy chains in the US hand over sensitive medical records to law enforcement without a warrant—and some will do so without even running the requests by a legal professional, according to a congressional investigation.</em></p>
<p><em>[…]</em></p>
<p><em>They include the seven largest pharmacy chains in the country: CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Cigna, Optum Rx, Walmart Stores, Inc., The Kroger Company, and Rite Aid Corporation. The lawmakers also spoke with Amazon Pharmacy.</em></p>
<p><em>All eight of the pharmacies said they do not require law enforcement to have a warrant prior to sharing private and sensitive medical records, which can include the prescription drugs a person used or uses and their medical conditions. Instead, all the pharmacies hand over such information with nothing more than a subpoena, which can be issued by government agencies and does not require review or approval by a judge.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three chains (CVS, Kroger, and Rite Aid) all told Congress they don’t even do a legal review of the subpoenas handed to them by government agencies. Instead, they apparently assume that if the government’s name is on it, it must be a valid request. The good news, I suppose, is that the other chains are at least involving their lawyers when it comes to data requests. </p>
<p>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) — the medical record privacy law frequently misunderstood (and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=594127581&amp;rlz=1CALAYK_enUS1026&amp;sxsrf=AM9HkKm9ONokuP9V-HtSsqmBSeM4VENMRA:1703730315377&amp;q=%22hippa%22+site:facebook.com&amp;nfpr=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgx_aBirGDAxVDEDQIHQzfDwgQvgUoAXoECAgQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=911&amp;dpr=1#ip=1" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=594127581&amp;rlz=1CALAYK_enUS1026&amp;sxsrf=AM9HkKm9ONokuP9V-HtSsqmBSeM4VENMRA:1703730315377&amp;q=%22hippa%22+site:facebook.com&amp;nfpr=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgx_aBirGDAxVDEDQIHQzfDwgQvgUoAXoECAgQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=911&amp;dpr=1#ip=1">mis-acronymed</a>) by laymen, lawyers, and legislators alike — is of no use here. HIPAA only prevents medical information from being released without permission to private parties not specifically authorized to obtain it. Pretty much any request originating from law enforcement agencies is considered to fall under the “if required by law” exception, even if the requests haven’t actually been vetted by pharmacy company lawyers and/or may not be legitimate demands for sensitive medical info.</p>
<p>The “required by law” phrase is important here. Law enforcement agencies have their own legal interpretations of the Third Party Doctrine, but none of that matters much in the case of HIPAA. All it would take to prevent pharmacy chains from handing out this data without a warrant would be the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) taking this out of the Third Party Doctrine’s hands and placing a presumption of privacy on it. </p>
<p>That’s the gist of the <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24243486/pharmacy-letter.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24243486/pharmacy-letter.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] recently sent to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra by Senator Ron Wyden, Rep. Pramila Jaypal, and Rep. Sara Jacobs. It cites a bit of courtroom and private company precedent to urge this situation along. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We urge HHS to consider further strengthening its HIPAA regulations to more closely align them with Americans’ reasonable expectations of privacy and Constitutional principles. Pharmacies can and should insist on a warrant, and invite law enforcement agencies that insist on demanding patient medical records with solely a subpoena to go to court to enforce that demand. The requirement for a warrant is exactly the approach taken by tech companies to protect customer privacy. In 2010, after just one Federal Court of Appeals held that Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their emails and that the 1986 Congressionally enacted law permitting disclosures of email pursuant to a subpoena was unconstitutional, all of the major free email providers — Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft — started insisting on a warrant before disclosing such data</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks pretty simple. All that’s needed is a change of policy, even if there’s no change in law. The problem with this, though, is that the head of the HHS has had plenty of time to change this policy to erect a higher standard for demands for customers’ information. The letter notes the legislators first informed Becerra of this potential issue in July, following <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/05/how-the-dobbs-decision-will-lead-to-attacks-on-free-speech-or-why-democrats-need-to-stop-undermining-free-speech/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/05/how-the-dobbs-decision-will-lead-to-attacks-on-free-speech-or-why-democrats-need-to-stop-undermining-free-speech/">the <em>Dobbs</em> decision</a> in June, hoping the HHS would erect more protections to prevent people from being prosecuted for obtaining birth control products. </p>
<p>The following months delivered confirmation of the legislators’ concerns. Now, it’s up to the HHS to move forward. While we wait to see whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Becerra#California_Attorney_General_(2017%E2%80%932021)" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Becerra#California_Attorney_General_(2017%E2%80%932021)">a former </a><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/03/08/california-attorney-general-doubles-down-threatening-journalists-possessing-convicted-cops-list/" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Becerra#California_Attorney_General_(2017%E2%80%932021)">prosecutor</a> is willing to elevate the privacy of Americans above the warrantless desires of law enforcement, we can at least be somewhat comforted by the fact that some of these companies are going to be a bit more transparent about their cooperation with the government. CVS, Walgreens, and Kroger have all promised to publish periodic reports about government requests for data. Amazon has gone one step further by notifying customers about government demands for their data.</p>
<p>There’s no reason the government shouldn’t need to secure a warrant to obtain this data. It’s protected by federal law against everyone else patients haven’t specifically granted permission to obtain. The government shouldn’t presume the existence of the Third Party Doctrine means customers’ prescription records are an open book. But it does and that needs to change, either through voluntary action or legislative mandate if the government can’t be talked into respecting the privacy of records most Americans likely assume are already covered by federal privacy protections.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2013/10/09/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/">https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2013/10/09/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38805439">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Josh <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/kroll/software-transparency-debian-openssl-bug/">wrote</a> recently about a serious security bug that appeared in Debian Linux back in 2006, and whether it was really a backdoor inserted by the NSA.   (He concluded that it probably was not.)</p>
<p>Today I want to write about another <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/57135/">incident</a>, in 2003, in which someone tried to backdoor the Linux kernel.   This one was definitely an attempt to insert a backdoor.  But we don’t know who it was that made the attempt—and we probably never will.<br>
<span id="more-8995"></span><br>
Back in 2003 Linux used a system called BitKeeper to store the master copy of the Linux source code.  If a developer wanted to propose a modification to the Linux code, they would submit their proposed change, and it would go through an organized approval process to decide whether the change would be accepted into the master code.   Every change to the master code would come with a short explanation, which always included a pointer to the record of its approval.</p>
<p>But some people didn’t like BitKeeper, so a second copy of the source code was kept so that developers could get the code via another code system called CVS.  The CVS copy of the code was a direct clone of the primary BitKeeper copy.</p>
<p>But on Nov. 5, 2003, Larry McVoy <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/57137/">noticed</a> that there was a code change in the CVS copy that did not have a pointer to a record of approval.  Investigation showed that the change had never been approved and, stranger yet, that this change did not appear in the primary BitKeeper repository at all.  Further investigation determined that someone had apparently broken in (electronically) to the CVS server and inserted this change.</p>
<p>What did the change do?   This is where it gets really interesting.  The change modified the code of a Linux function called wait4, which a program could use to wait for something to happen.  Specifically, it added these two lines of code:</p>
<pre>if ((options == (__WCLONE|__WALL)) &amp;&amp; (current-&gt;uid = 0))
        retval = -EINVAL;
</pre>
<p>[Exercise for readers who know the C programming language: What is unusual about this code?   Answer appears below.]</p>
<p>A casual reading by an expert would interpret this as innocuous error-checking code to make wait4 return an error code when wait4 was called in a certain way that was forbidden by the documentation.   But a really careful expert reader would notice that, near the end of the first line, it said “= 0” rather than “== 0”.   The normal thing to write in code like this is “== 0”, which tests whether the user ID of the currently running code (current-&gt;uid) is equal to zero, without modifying the user ID.  But what actually appears is “= 0”, which has the effect of setting the user ID to zero.</p>
<p>Setting the user ID to zero is a problem because user ID number zero is the “root” user, which is allowed to do absolutely anything it wants—to access all data, change the behavior of all code, and to compromise entirely the security of all parts of the system. So the effect of this code is to give root privileges to any piece of software that called wait4 in a particular way that is supposed to be invalid.  In other words … it’s a classic backdoor.</p>
<p>This is a very clever piece of work.  It looks like innocuous error checking, but it’s really a back door.  And it was slipped into the code outside the normal approval process, to avoid any possibility that the approval process would notice what was up.</p>
<p>But the attempt didn’t work, because the Linux team was careful enough to notice that that this code was in the CVS repository without having gone through the normal approval process.  Score one for Linux.</p>
<p>Could this have been an NSA attack? Maybe. But there were many others who had the skill and motivation to carry out this attack. Unless somebody confesses, or a smoking-gun document turns up, we’ll never know.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/btree.html">https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/btree.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38805383">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>
  Consider this 3-level b+tree. There are two levels of branch pages
  (the root is a branch page), and 5 leaf pages.  Data and keys are
  stored in the leaf pages.
</p>
<p>
  Leaf chaining, ie links between leaf pages for easy sequential
  access, is not supported as it would require the whole tree to
  be rewritten on each update.
</p>
<p>

    <img src="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/how-the-btree-works.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The pages are stored sequentially in the database file. Increasing
  page numbers means increasing file offsets. The meta page includes
  a pointer to the root page, a SHA1 hash, and statistics counters.
</p>
<p>
  When the file is opened it is scanned backwards page by page to
  find a valid meta page, and thus the root of the tree.
</p>
<p>

    <img src="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/sequential-page-view.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  When updating a value in leaf page 8, instead of changing the
  page in-place, a whole new page is appended to the file (here as
  page 12). Because the location of the page is changed, each parent
  page needs to be updated to point to the new locations.
</p>
<p>
  Leaf page 7 is not affected. A new root page is created
  as a copy of the previous root page, only the pointer to branch
  page 6 is updated to point to branch page 11.
</p>
<p>
  Any cursor still having a pointer to root page 9 can traverse the
  tree unaffected by the change. It will see a consistent snapshot
  of the database.  Dashed pages and pointers in the diagram are
  still there in the file, they are just not the last version.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/updated-btree.pdf" title="click for PDF version">
    <img src="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/updated-btree.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  In the file, pages are written sequentially by appending new pages
  to the file. Already written pages are never modified.
</p>
<p>
  After each new generation of the tree is written, there is a meta
  page pointing to the new root.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/flattened-btree-page-structure.pdf" title="click for PDF version">
    <img src="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/flattened-btree-page-structure.png">
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Changing one page (leaf page 8) resulted in 4 new pages being
  appended to the file. This wastes disk space, but writing consecutive
  pages to disk is more efficient than writing random locations.
  And there is no need for a transaction log, because <em>the
  database file <strong>is</strong> the transaction log</em>.

This is one area where market economy works against common good, unfortunately. People who have the knowledge and want to capitalise on it are highly incentivised to preparing beginner level materials and maybe a tiny bit to prepare the something for people who already have a bit of knowledge. After that, the number of people who are your potential target drops off sharply and you would have to increase the price dramatically. And it happens that people will not buy a $200 book even if it had $100k worth knowledge in it.<p>There are some positions available though. For example, I recently found Let over Lambda by Doug Hoyte. Excellent book if you are <i>that</i> kind of programmer.</p><p>Another problem with advanced materials is that frequently people are even unable to recognise them as advanced or valuable. It is easy to look at and evaluate things you have experience with, it is much more difficult to impossible to do the same with stuff that is beyond your experience (also called The Blub Paradox: <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>).</p><p>Personally, I just read a lot. I try to keep an open mind and even if I don't agree fully with the contents of the book, I try to use the ideas as inspirations for my own thinking. You can read codebases written by other people and learn new ideas. Over time, you gather a library of solutions to problems and knowledge of when to and when not to apply them.</p><p>If you do enough of it, you will find useful knowledge in unusual places.

If you're learning functional programming, you can find books on lambda calculus and category theory and more. But ultimately you have to learn how to build good software, and there are scant few books about that out there. In the functional world, I know of two and they're both in Scheme. So the best approach tends to be feet-first into the fire using the language's docs, and hopefully the creator(s) has documents explaining theory and practice.</span></p></div></td></tr>

So, learning another language is, in itself a kind of "advance".  However, for depth, you'd usually want to pick a specific sub-discipline in programming and concentrate on that.  You will have better luck with choosing theoretical disciplines, because those usually are rooted in math, and so have longer history and more systematic approach.  The more "practical" aspects usually follow the arc of having an introductory course (at best) with the next learning stage being an "area of active research" (also, the intro course would typically be bad).</p><p>To give you an example: in college I became interested in regular languages.  So, I was looking to expand my knowledge on the subject.  Out of all things that I could dig up on regular languages two seemed most appealing: approximation of context-free grammars with regular languages and equivalence between generating functions and regular languages.  In a short while I realized that I don't have enough of mathematical background to go after the generative functions part, but the approximation part turn out to be fun and interesting.  I was able to dig up some papers and even try my hand in doing something with the concept.</p><p>You'd have similar success if you went after types in programming languages.  There are plenty of publications, and you will have multiple steps ahead of you before you run up the wall of "area of active research".  My journey down that path started with Benjamin C. Pierce's Types in Programming Languages.</p><p>Another direction you may consider is to try to generalize your knowledge.  For example, of programming languages.  In this regard, I find the book by Shriram Krishamurthy, Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation to be a good introduction to the theoretical side of crafting and evaluation of programming languages.</p><p>There are, also, unfortunately, some areas where a lot of programming work has been done, but very little learning material is available, and, especially nothing deep has been produced.  For example, if you want to go down the system programming route... there are books, that's true, but the level of generalization leaves a lot to be desired.  It's often boggled in all kinds of "practical advise" and very concrete examples based on Linux Kernel code long ago replaced by something else (or worse yet, but original Unix code etc.)</p><p>Or, even worse, if you consider fields like testing.  Or even GUI.  It's surprisingly common and yet surprisingly without much analysis or structure.

In fact the entire EWD archive[1] can be arranged into a course pretty readily, although you'll definitely want to skim or skip large chunks of it. Also some of the papers are just acerbic observations on life, which some people like and some don't.<p>And there's it's big brother <i>Predicate Calculus and Program Semantics</i> by Dijkstra and Scholten that more rigorously formalizes the same approach.</p><p>Dafny[2] is one approach out of Microsoft Research that attempts to provide automated tooling around some of those concepts.</p><p>All of the above are excellent places to start if you're interested in learning how to write better code with the imperative languages that you're actually going to use professionally.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/" rel="nofollow">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://dafny.org/" rel="nofollow">https://dafny.org/</a>

<!-- cache hit 362:single/related:8e3b3346f5d3d88cd2ba442c8d5fbfe4 --><!-- empty -->
<p>In many ways, 2023 was a long-awaited return to normalcy for people who build their own gaming and/or workstation PCs. For the entire year, most mainstream components have been available at or a little under their official retail prices, making it possible to build all kinds of PCs at relatively reasonable prices without worrying about restocks or waiting for discounts. It was a welcome continuation of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/2022-in-gpus-the-shortage-ends-but-higher-prices-seem-here-to-stay/">some GPU trends</a> that started in 2022. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel could release a new GPU, and you could consistently buy that GPU for roughly what it was supposed to cost.</p>
<p>That's where we get into how frustrating 2023 was for GPU buyers, though. Cards like the GeForce RTX 4090 and Radeon RX 7900 series launched in late 2022 and boosted performance beyond what any last-generation cards could achieve. But 2023's midrange GPU launches were less ambitious. Not only did they offer the performance of a last-generation GPU, but most of them did it for around the same price as the last-gen GPUs whose performance they matched.</p>
<h2>The midrange runs in place</h2>
<p>Not every midrange GPU launch will get us a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/07/nvidia-gtx-1060-review/">GTX 1060</a>—a card roughly 50 percent faster than its immediate predecessor and beat the previous-generation GTX 980 despite costing just a bit over half as much money. But even if your expectations were low, this year's midrange GPU launches have been underwhelming.</p>
<p>The worst was probably the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, which sometimes struggled to beat the card it replaced at around the same price. The 16GB version of the card was particularly maligned since it was $100 more expensive but was only faster than the 8GB version in a handful of games.</p>
<p>The regular RTX 4060 was slightly better news, thanks partly to a $30 price drop from where the RTX 3060 started. The performance gains were small, and a drop from 12GB to 8GB of RAM isn't the direction we prefer to see things move, but it was still a slightly faster and more efficient card at around the same price. AMD's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-amds-269-rx-7600-is-a-good-1080p-card-but-the-rtx-4060-looms/">Radeon RX 7600</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amd-rx-7700-xt-and-7800-xt-review-closing-out-the-fine-i-guess-gpu-generation/">RX 7700 XT, and RX 7800 XT</a> all belong in this same broad category—some improvements, but generally similar performance to previous-generation parts at similar or slightly lower prices. Not an exciting leap for people with aging GPUs who waited out the GPU shortage to get an upgrade.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The best midrange card of the generation—and at $600, we're definitely stretching the definition of "midrange"—might be the GeForce RTX 4070, which can generally match or slightly beat the RTX 3080 while using much less power and costing $100 less than the RTX 3080's suggested retail price. That seems like a solid deal once you consider that the RTX 3080 was essentially unavailable at its suggested retail price for most of its life span. But $600 is still a $100 increase from the 2070 and a $220 increase from the 1070, making it tougher to swallow.</p>
<p>In all, 2023 wasn't the worst time to buy a $300 GPU; that dubious honor belongs to the depths of 2021, when you'd be lucky to snag a GTX 1650 for that price. But "consistently available, basically competent GPUs" are harder to be thankful for the further we get from the GPU shortage.</p>
<h2>Marketing gets more misleading</h2>

Sure, under exactly the right conditions in specific games.</p><p>Nvidia</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you just looked at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/nvidias-399-4060-ti-comes-with-no-price-hike-but-mild-performance-improvements/">Nvidia's early performance claims</a> for each of these GPUs, you might think that the RTX 40-series was an exciting jump forward.</p>
<p>But these numbers were only possible in games that supported these GPUs' newest software gimmick, DLSS Frame Generation (FG). The original DLSS and DLSS 2 improve performance by upsampling the images generated by your GPU, generating interpolated pixels that make lower-res image into higher-res ones without the blurriness and loss of image quality you'd get from simple upscaling. DLSS FG generates entire frames in between the ones being rendered by your GPU, theoretically providing big frame rate boosts without requiring a powerful GPU.</p>

<p>The technology is impressive when it works, and it's been successful enough to spawn hardware-agnostic imitators like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/amds-fps-doubling-fsr-3-is-coming-soon-and-not-just-to-radeon-graphics-cards/">the AMD-backed FSR 3</a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-details-game-boosting-frame-generation-tech-that-applies-a-different-technique-extrass-uses-extrapolation-instead-of-amd-and-nvidias-approach-that-uses-interpolation">an alternate implementation from Intel</a> that's still in early stages. But it has notable limitations—mainly, it needs a reasonably high base frame rate to have enough data to generate convincing extra frames, something that these midrange cards may struggle to do. Even when performance is good, it can introduce weird visual artifacts or lose fine detail. The technology isn't available in all games. And DLSS FG also adds a bit of latency, though this can be offset with latency-reducing technologies like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/reflex/">Nvidia Reflex</a>.</p>
<p>As another tool in the performance-enhancing toolbox, DLSS FG is nice to have. But to put it front-and-center in comparisons with previous-generation graphics cards is, at best, painting an overly rosy picture of what upgraders can actually expect.</p>

<p>You probably all know Gentoo Linux as your favourite source-based distribution.
Did you know that our package manager, Portage, already for years also has support for binary
packages, and that source- and binary-based package installations can be freely mixed?</p>

<p>To speed up working with slow hardware and for overall convenience, we’re now also offering
<strong>binary packages for download and direct installation</strong>! For most architectures, this is
limited to the core system and weekly updates - not so for <strong>amd64 and arm64</strong> however. There we’ve got a 
stunning <strong>&gt;20 GByte of packages</strong> on our mirrors, from LibreOffice to KDE Plasma and from Gnome to Docker.
Gentoo stable, updated daily. Enjoy! And <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2023/12/29/Gentoo-binary.html">read 
on for more details!</a></p>

<h2 id="questions--answers">Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

<h3 id="how-can-i-set-up-my-existing-gentoo-installation-to-use-these-packages">How can I set up my existing Gentoo installation to use these packages?</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_quickstart">Quick setup instructions</a> for
the most common cases can be found in our wiki. In short, you need to create a configuration 
file in <code>/etc/portage/binrepos.conf/</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, we have a rather neat <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide">binary package guide</a> on
our Wiki that goes into much more detail.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-have-to-do-with-a-new-stage--new-installation">What do I have to do with a new stage / new installation?</h3>

<p>New stages already contain the suitable <code>/etc/portage/binrepos.conf/gentoobinhost.conf</code>. You are
good to go from the start, although you may want to replace the <code>src-uri</code> 
setting in there with an URI pointing to the corresponding directory on a 
<a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/">local mirror</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>$ emerge -uDNavg @world</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-compile-settings-use-flags--do-the-normal-amd64-packages-use">What compile settings, use flags, … do the ‘‘normal’’ amd64 packages use?</h3>

<p>The binary packages under <code>amd64/binpackages/17.1/x86-64</code> are compiled using
<code>CFLAGS="-march=x86-64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe"</code> and will work with any amd64 / x86-64 machine.</p>

<p>The available useflag settings and versions correspond to the stable packages
of the <code>amd64/17.1/nomultilib</code> (i.e., openrc), <code>amd64/17.1/desktop/plasma/systemd</code>,
and <code>amd64/17.1/desktop/gnome/systemd</code> profiles. This should provide fairly large
coverage.</p>

<h3 id="what-compile-settings-use-flags--do-the-normal-arm64-packages-use">What compile settings, use flags, … do the ‘‘normal’’ arm64 packages use?</h3>

<p>The binary packages under <code>arm64/binpackages/17.0/arm64</code> are compiled using
<code>CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe"</code> and will work with any arm64 / AArch64 machine.</p>

<p>The available useflag settings and versions correspond to the stable packages
of the <code>arm64/17.0</code> (i.e., openrc), <code>arm64/17.0/desktop/plasma/systemd</code>,
and <code>arm64/17.0/desktop/gnome/systemd</code> profiles.</p>

<h3 id="but-hey-thats-not-optimized-for-my-cpu">But hey, that’s not optimized for my CPU!</h3>

<p>Tough luck. You can still compile packages yourself just as before!</p>

<h3 id="what-settings-do-the-packages-for-other-architectures-and-abis-use">What settings do the packages for other architectures and ABIs use?</h3>

<p>The binary package hosting is wired up with the stage builds. Which
means, for about every stage there is a binary package hosting which 
covers (only) the stage contents and settings. There are no further plans 
to expand coverage for now. But hey, this includes the compiler (gcc or
clang) and the whole build toolchain!</p>

<h3 id="are-the-packages-cryptographically-signed">Are the packages cryptographically signed?</h3>

<p>Yes, with the <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/signatures/">same key as the stages</a>.</p>

<h3 id="are-the-cryptographic-signatures-verified-before-installation">Are the cryptographic signatures verified before installation?</h3>

<p>Yes, with one limitation (in the default setting).</p>

<p>Portage knows two binary package formats, XPAK (old) and GPKG (new). Only GPKG supports
cryptographic signing. Until recently, XPAK was the default setting (and it may still
be the default on your installation since this is not changed during upgrade, but only
at new installation).</p>

<p>The new, official Gentoo binary packages are all in GPKG format.
GPKG packages have their signature verified, and if this fails, installation is refused.
To avoid breaking compatibility with old binary packages, by default XPAK
packages (which do not have signatures) can still be installed however.</p>

<p>If you want to require verified signatures (which is something we strongly recommend), 
set <code>FEATURES="binpkg-request-signature"</code> in <code>make.conf</code>. Then, obviously, you can also
only use GPKG packages.</p>

<h3 id="i-get-an-error-that-signatures-cannot-be-verified">I get an error that signatures cannot be verified.</h3>

<p>Try running the Gentoo Trust Tool <code>getuto</code> as root.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>$ getuto</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should set up the required key ring with the Gentoo Release Engineering keys for
Portage.</p>

<p>If you have <code>FEATURES="binpkg-request-signature"</code> enabled in <code>make.conf</code>, then <code>getuto</code>
is called automatically before every binary package download operation, to make sure
that key updates and revocations are imported.</p>

<h3 id="ive-made-binary-packages-myself-and-portage-refuses-to-use-them-now">I’ve made binary packages myself and portage refuses to use them now!</h3>

<p>Well, you found the side effect of <code>FEATURES="binpkg-request-signature"</code>.
For your self-made packages you will need to set up a signing key and have that key
trusted by the anchor in <code>/etc/portage/gnupg</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide">binary package guide</a> on
our Wiki will be helpful here.</p>

<h3 id="my-download-is-slow">My download is slow.</h3>

<p>Then pretty please use a <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/">local mirror</a>
instead of downloading from University of Oregon. You can just edit the URI 
in your <code>/etc/portage/binrepos.conf</code>. And yes, that’s safe, because of the 
cryptographic signature.</p>

<h3 id="my-portage-still-wants-to-compile-from-source">My Portage still wants to compile from source.</h3>

<p>If you use useflag combinations deviating from the profile default, then
you can’t and won’t use the packages. Portage will happily mix and match though
and combine binary packages with locally compiled ones. Gentoo still remains
a source-based distribution, and we are not aiming for a full binary-only 
installation without any compilation at all.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-the-packages-on-a-merged-usr-system">Can I use the packages on a merged-usr system?</h3>

<p>Yes. (If anything breaks, then this is a bug and <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/">should be reported</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-the-packages-with-other-older-or-newer-profile-versions">Can I use the packages with other (older or newer) profile versions?</h3>

<p><strong>No.</strong> That’s why the <code>src-uri</code> path contains, e.g.,  “17.1”.
<strong>When there’s a new profile version, we’ll also provide new, separate package directories.</strong></p>

<h3 id="any-plans-to-offer-binary-packages-of-amd64-">Any plans to offer binary packages of ~amd64 ?</h3>

<p>Not yet. This would mean a ton of rebuilds… If we offer it one day, it’ll 
be at a separate URI for technical reasons.</p>

<p>The advice for now is to stick to stable as much as possible, and locally
add in <code>package.accept_keywords</code> whatever packages from testing you want to use.
This means you can still use a large amount of binary packages, and just
compile the rest yourself.</p>

<h3 id="i-have-found-a-problem-with-portage-or-a-specific-package">I have found a problem, with portage or a specific package!</h3>

<p>Then please <strong>ask for advice</strong> (on IRC, the forums, or a mailing list) and/or 
<a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/"><strong>file a bug!</strong></a></p>

<p>Binary package support has been tested for some time, but with many more people using
it edge cases will certainly occur, and quality bug reports are always appreciated!</p>

<h3 id="any-pretty-pictures">Any pretty pictures?</h3>

<p>Of course! Here’s the amount of binary package data in GByte for each architecture…</p>

<p>The world’s largest traditional entertainment companies face a reckoning in 2024 after losing more than $5 billion in the past year from the streaming services they built to compete with Netflix.</p>
<p>Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Comcast and Paramount—US entertainment conglomerates that have been growing ever larger for decades—are facing pressure to shrink or sell legacy businesses, scale back production and slash costs following billions in losses from their digital platforms.</p>
<p>Shari Redstone, Paramount’s billionaire controlling shareholder, has effectively put the company on the block in recent weeks. She has held talks about selling the Hollywood studio to Skydance, the production company behind <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i>, people familiar with the matter say.</p>
<p>Paramount chief executive Bob Bakish also discussed a possible combination over lunch with Warner CEO David Zaslav in mid-December. In both cases the discussions were said to be at an early stage and people familiar with the talks cautioned that a deal might not materialize.</p>
<p>Beyond their streaming losses, the traditional media groups are facing a weak advertising market, declining television revenues and higher production costs following the Hollywood strikes.</p>
<p>Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, said Paramount’s deal discussions were a reflection of the “complete and utter panic” in the industry.</p>
<p>“TV advertising is falling far short, cord-cutting is continuing to accelerate, sports costs are going up and the movie business is not performing,” he said. “Everything is going wrong that can go wrong. The only thing [the companies] know how to do to survive is try to merge and cut costs.”</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>But as the traditional media owners struggle, Netflix, the tech group that pioneered the streaming model over a decade ago, has emerged as the winner of the battle to reshape video distribution.</p>
<p>“For much of the past four years, the entertainment industry spent money like drunken sailors to fight the first salvos of the streaming wars,” analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in November. “Now, we are finally starting to feel the hangover and the weight of the unpaid bar bill.”</p>
<p>For companies that have been trying to compete with Netflix, Nathanson added, “the shakeout has begun.”</p>
<p>After a bumpy 2022, Netflix has set itself apart from rivals—most notably by being profitable. Earnings for its most recent quarter soared past Wall Street’s expectations as it added 9 million new subscribers—the strongest rise since early 2020, when Covid-19 lockdowns led to a jump.</p>
<p>“Netflix has pulled away,” says John Martin, co-founder of Pugilist Capital and former chief executive of Turner Broadcasting. For its rivals, he said, the question is “how do you create a viable streaming service with a viable business model? Because they’re not working.”</p>
<p>The leading streaming services aggressively raised prices in 2023. Now, analysts, investors and executives predict that consolidation could be ahead next year as some of the smaller services combine or bow out of the streaming wars.</p>
<p>Warner, home to HBO and the Warner Bros movie studio, has made a small profit at its US streaming services this year, in part by raising prices, aggressively culling some series and licensing others to Netflix. However, this has come at a price: Warner lost more than 2 million streaming subscribers in its two most recent quarters.</p>
<p>The company, which merged with rival Discovery last year, has long been rumored as a potential takeover candidate, with Comcast seen as the most likely buyer. But Zaslav in November hinted that his group wanted to be an acquirer instead of a target.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“There are a lot of . . . excess players in the market. So, this will give us a chance not only to fight to grow in the next year, but to have the kind of balance sheet and the kind of stability . . . that we could be really opportunistic over the next 12 to 24 months,” he said on an earnings call.</p>
<p>The terms of the Warner-Discovery merger barred the group from dealmaking for two years. That period expires on April 8.</p>
<p>Disney, the largest traditional media company, is in the midst of a gutting restructuring that has featured 7,000 job cuts and attacks from activist investors. It lost more than $1.6 billion from its streaming businesses in the first nine months of 2023, during which its Disney+ service gained 8 million subscribers. The company says it will turn a profit in streaming in late 2024.</p>
<p>Bob Iger, Disney chief executive, this year openly pondered whether some of its assets still fit within the company, prompting speculation that he was considering disposals. But no deals emerged, leading some investors to conclude there is little appetite among private equity or tech companies for acquiring legacy businesses.</p>
<p>Paramount’s shares have risen almost 40 percent since early November as sale speculation mounted. The stock rose sharply after the Skydance talks were reported, but both Paramount and Warner shares fell after news of their discussions came to light.</p>
<p>Analysts said the two companies’ high debt levels were an immediate concern for investors. “We suspect investors will focus on pro forma leverage above all else,” Citi analysts wrote in a note last week. They estimated that an all-stock combination of Warner and Paramount could yield at least $1 billion of synergies.</p>
<p>But Greenfield said merging two companies with lossmaking streaming services and large portfolios of declining television assets was not the answer to their problems.</p>
<p>“The right answer should be, let’s stop trying to be in the streaming business,” he said. “The answer is, let’s get smaller and focused and stop trying to be a huge company. Let’s dramatically shrink.”</p>
