  <p>What I’ll miss most is the sound of his voice, cooked up in the North Carolina mountains out of remnants from across an ocean. <em>There</em> always <em>thar</em>, <em>fire</em> always <em>far</em>. I loved the phrase <em>ever which a’way but loose</em>. Loved how things <em>liked to happen</em>. How <em>hello</em> was <em>what do you say</em> and how <em>being still</em> meant <em>setting awhile</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even his voice was quiet, throaty and clipped in the way of men in these mountains — a voice meant for conversations beyond a crowd, meant for the group of men eyeing the door, aiming to be outside where it’d be easier to talk about nothing or just as soon not talk at all.&nbsp;</p><p>He could go hours without saying a word, but a flash of wit always waited on his tongue. For nearly 70 years he kept up a constant, good-natured banter with Grandma over anything and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>“I can’t rightly remember,” she said on one of my story-seeking visits.</p><p>“You’re getting too old to remember all that, woman.”</p><p>“I surely am.”</p><p>“I know the feeling.”</p><p>A month before he passed, faded and worn down to a wheelchair, his head still popped up when Grandma walked into the kitchen: “Hey thar, pretty girl.”&nbsp;</p><p>The morning after Grandma called me, I took my boys by to see Papaw for the last time. He’d been unresponsive for a day, but when we entered the bedroom, he was awake again. He couldn’t find his voice — he’d been breathing through his mouth, and his throat was too dry to speak up — so I leaned in. He looked to my sons and said, “Hey, fellers.”</p><p>They waved.&nbsp;</p><p>“I love you,” I told him.</p><p>“Love you, buddy,” he whispered.&nbsp;</p><p>“You done good,” I said because that’s how he would’ve said it, but also because that’s how I meant it. He’d done so much good, even if it couldn’t be listed on official records or captured in the stat sheet of an obituary. The good of his life was ever-rippling water, quiet and steady, and my boys and I would long be swept up in it.&nbsp;</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 03:10:40 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://boehs.org/node/truth-social">https://boehs.org/node/truth-social</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40028338">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><dl><dt><strong><a href="https://boehs.org/locations/">in</a></strong></dt><dd><a href="https://boehs.org/in/blog">blog</a></dd><dt><strong>date</strong></dt><dd><span itemprop="datePublished" content="Sat Apr 13 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)">4/13/2024</span></dd></dl><hr><p>A hot minute ago, there was this interesting trend of Republicans being ostracized by mainstream social media, then forming their own. In these places, their version of the truth can proliferate without the moderation they’ve grown to despise. To do this, the conventional strategy is to reskin open-source social media platforms without attribution. There is, of course, a certain irony to the fact that the labor they exploit is frequently performed by liberals, queers, socialists, and other groups they’ve sworn to destroy, but I digress.</p><p>Luckily, the platforms they leech off are not entirely defenseless. The code of Mastodon is released under the AGPL, a strict open source license that prevents redistribution without disclosure of derivative source code.&nbsp; Both gab and Truth Social have been identified as derivative work of Mastodon, and hence both are bound by the provisions of the AGPL. Mastodon has successfully defended its codebase a number of times, including in 2021, when they successfully convinced Truth Social to release its code. Truth Social continued these releases until December 20th, 2022, when the uploads stopped. How embarrassing.</p><p>To conduct a request under the AGPL, I need to prove that Truth Social uses AGPL licensed code, and that I have accessed said code. The latter is incredibly easy — the login page fetches <code>/api/v1/instance</code>, which is a pretty distinct Mastodon characteristic. Still, what’s to say that they didn’t just do a faithful, clean room implementation of the Mastodon API? The login page source code makes zero reference to ‘Mastodon’, so I was playing with this familiar API looking for a tell.</p><p>Yeah, I think I found it.</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411112921.png"></p><p>With this in mind, I set my sights on the legal department. Somehow, I doubted they would reply to me.</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411113030.png"></p><p>I also started poking around on the frontend, which is unambiguously powered by Soapbox, another piece of software licensed under the AGPL.</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411114228.png"></p><p>They also make “open source” releases of Soapbox. I was curious if these releases would be up-to-date (they aren’t), but what I found was really quite interesting:</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411115229.png"></p><p>Simply uploading your compiled code and calling it “open source” does <em>not</em> count as compliance, even if it was up-to-date.</p><p>At this point, the SFC was taking interest. While I have more than enough grounds for the above request, if they don’t comply, the next challenge before a public exposé is proving that the <em>Mastodon</em> codebase has actually been changed since its last open source release. This, of course, is incredibly plausible, given the frontend code obviously has. But we need proof.</p><p>Kindly, I was provided with a Truth Social account (I do not want my phone number on there, in the event that a little birdie gives maia arson crimew another issue of “<a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/meet-the-shitpoasters/">the shitposters</a>”). I then clicked around, and discovered the following endpoints in a minute:</p><pre><code>/api/v4/truth/ads?device=desktop
/api/v1/truth/policies/pending
/api/v1/truth/carousels/suggestions
/api/v1/truth/policies/pending
/api/v1/groups/tags
</code></pre><p>Unsurprisingly, Mastodon does not have an ads endpoint. It also doesn’t have a v4 API. Neither does the open source release.</p><p>The truth directory does exist. It’s at <code>/app/controllers/api/v1/truth/</code>. Unfortunately for Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the files are missing here.</p><pre><code>$ tree app/controllers/api/v1/truth
app/controllers/api/v1/truth
├── admin
│ &nbsp; └── accounts_controller.rb
├── emails_controller.rb
├── passwords_controller.rb
└── trending
&nbsp; &nbsp; └── truths_controller.rb
$ rg carousels | wc -l
0
</code></pre><p>Of course, Republicans are categorically inclusive, which is why they bundle code from a <em>third</em> fediverse codebase that’s AGPL licensed — Pleroma:</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411135059.png"><br>(nice localization, btw).</p><p>I was, of course, expecting this to go nowhere. I’m just Evan. TMTG could just drag their feet with the hopes that I give up. I, of course, had no intent of doing so — I was very serious when I said that I would take this matter to the press if I had to. Surprisingly, however, this story doesn’t end with a public boxing match between me and the 45th president. I decided that I would give them 7 days before escalating. This weekend, I received an email stating that they had complied — 2 days before my internal deadline. I checked the source code and sure enough, it is up-to-date as far as I can tell. I’ve released it here:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/boehs/truthsocial/tree/main">Automatically updated dump of Truth Social’s source code (reskinned Mastodon)</a></p><p>Once again, this was absolutely not the outcome I expected. Some people might be <em>disappointed</em> by it. I might be relieved. After I sent that email, I was a little worried about what I was getting myself into. The <em>Truth Social Legal Team</em>. Imagine. But it went my way. The real takeaway is that you do have power. Don’t be scared of the big guys. Speak their language, play on their court. Stand up for what you believe in. You can win. Finally, I want to thank Truth Social for complying appropriately. While we couldn’t be further apart politically, I respect that they followed the law in a timely manner without a fight.</p><p>In terms of the code — I haven’t looked at it yet. It’s diverged significantly from Mastodon, but the resemblance is there. They’ve cherry-picked specific commits from upstream, but not all of them. I’m sure there are some <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@bontchev/112257849039442072">goodies to be found</a>. I encourage all of you to go looking for them alongside me, as that is your right. Tell me what you find. God speed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">We technically support building against OpenBLAS as a BLAS provider, but we <strong>strongly discourage it</strong>. The performance offered by OpenBLAS is significantly lower than that of Intel's MKL, regardless of the CPU manufacturer. Furthermore, OpenBLAS enables OpenMP parallelization by default, but unfortunately our matrices are too small to take advantage of OpenMP and we end up with up to 100x slowdown compared MKL in the worst case scenario with the majority of end users not aware of how to debug this issue. How sad.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you <em>really</em> want to use OpenBLAS instead you can do:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBLAS_LIBRARIES=-lblas -DCBLAS_LIBRARIES=-lcblas

<p dir="auto">On MacOS, translateLocally doesn't rely on MKL, but instead on Apple accelerate. If you want to build a portable executable that is able to run on multiple machines, we recommend using Qt's distribution of Qt, as opposed to homebrew's due to issues with <a href="https://github.com/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/issues/69" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/issues/69/hovercard">macdeployqt</a>. To produce a <code>.dmg</code>do:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir build

<span>cd</span> build
cmake ..
cmake --build <span>.</span> -j3 --target translateLocally-bin translateLocally.dmg</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, if you wish to sign and notarize the <code>.dmg</code>for distribution, you may use <a href="https://github.com/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/blob/master/dist/macdmg.sh">macdmg.sh</a></p>

<p dir="auto">translateLocally supports importing custom models. translateLocally uses the <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev">Bergamot</a> fork of <a href="https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev">marian</a>. As such, it supports the vast majority marian models out of the box. You can just train your marian model and place it a directory.</p>

<p dir="auto">The directory structure of a translateLocally model looks like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ tree my-custom-model

└── vocab.deen.spm</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml</code> name is hardcoded, and so is <code>model_info.json</code>. Everything else could have an arbitrary name. translateLocally will load the model according to the settings specified in <code>config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml</code>. These are just normal marian configuration options. <code>model_info.json</code> contains metadata about the model:</p>

<p dir="auto">The process described above will create a model usable by translateLocally, albeit not a very efficient one. In order to create an efficient model we recommend that you quantise the model to 8-bit integers. You can do that by downloading and compiling the <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev">Bergamot</a> fork of marian, and using <code>marian-conv</code> to create the quantised model:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$MARIAN/marian-conv -f input_model.npz -t output_model.bin --gemm-type intgemm8"><pre><span>$MARIAN</span>/marian-conv -f input_model.npz -t output_model.bin --gemm-type intgemm8</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And then changing your configuration <code>config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml</code> to point to this new model, as well as appending <code>gemm-precision: int8shift</code> to it.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>For best results, we strongly recommend that you use student models.</strong> Instructions on how to create one + scripts can be found <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/students/tree/master/train-student">here</a> and a detailed video tutorial and explanations are available <a href="https://nbogoychev.com/efficient-machine-translation/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Student models are typically at least 8X faster than teacher models such as the transformer-base preset.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can further achive another 30%-40% performance boost if you precompute the quantisation multipliers of the model and you use a lexical shortlist. The process for those is described in details at the Bergamot project's <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/students/tree/master/train-student#5-8-bit-quantization">Github</a>. Remember that you need to use the <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev">Bergamot</a> fork of Marian.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example script that converts a marian model to the most efficient 8-bit representation can also be found at Bergamot's <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/students/blob/master/esen/esen.student.tiny11/speed.cpu.intgemm8bitalpha.sh">Github</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><p>Former National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers is pictured before President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden spoke about Middle Class Working Families Task Force, Friday, Jan. 30, 2009, in the East Room of the White House in Washington.

<p>Numerous commentators—especially those defending President Biden’s economic record—have puzzled over why Americans are sour about the state of the U.S. economy. Unemployment rates have returned to pre-pandemic lows, commentators correctly point out, and the official rate of inflation is declining. So why are Americans ignoring the view of many experts that the economy is doing well?</p>

<fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"></fbs-ad>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32163" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32163" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nber.org/papers/w32163" aria-label="striking new paper">striking new paper</a> by a group of economists from Harvard and the International Monetary Fund, headlined by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, the answer is that Americans have figured out something that the experts have ignored: that rising interest rates are as much a part of inflation as the rising price of ordinary goods. “Concerns over borrowing costs, which have historically tracked the cost of money, are at their highest levels” since the early 1980s, they write. “Alternative measures of inflation that include borrowing costs” account for most of the gap between the experts’ rosy pictures and Americans’ skeptical assessment.</p>

<h2><strong>Inflation is not an objective number, but a judgment call</strong></h2>
<p>At the heart of the issue is a misconception that bedevils academics, journalists, and ordinary Americans: the idea that the official inflation rate is an objective number, impervious to human biases, much in the way that someone’s height or weight can be objectively measured with a ruler and a scale.</p>

<p>In fact, the formula used to calculate the inflation rate is <em>subjective</em>. It requires economists to make hundreds of judgment calls about how one assesses the overall trajectory of prices. What goods and services should be included in the “basket” of prices in the formula? How should those goods and services be weighted against each other? How do we account for the fact that <a href="https://freopp.org/inflations-compounding-impact-on-the-poor-f82ea4d61d9b" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://freopp.org/inflations-compounding-impact-on-the-poor-f82ea4d61d9b" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://freopp.org/inflations-compounding-impact-on-the-poor-f82ea4d61d9b" aria-label="poor people consume different things than rich people">poor people consume different things than rich people</a>, or that people in different parts of the country may consume different things in different proportions?</p>

<p>And, most relevant to the new research: What is the best way to <em>measure</em> changes in the price of important things like housing? <a href="https://substack.freopp.org/p/inflation-is-far-worse-than-you-think" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://substack.freopp.org/p/inflation-is-far-worse-than-you-think" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://substack.freopp.org/p/inflation-is-far-worse-than-you-think" aria-label="There has always been considerable debate about this">There has always been considerable debate about this</a>.</p>

<p>The most widely used measure of inflation in the U.S. is the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.toc.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.toc.htm" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.toc.htm" aria-label="Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers">Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers</a>, or CPI-U, which is put out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This formula has undergone <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/historical-changes.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/historical-changes.htm" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/historical-changes.htm" aria-label="numerous revisions">numerous revisions</a> from its creation in 1919 to the present day.</p>
<h2><strong>Consumer prices no longer include the price of money</strong></h2><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"></fbs-ad>
<p>Most notably, as Summers and his coauthors Marijn Bolhuis, Judd Cramer, and Karl Schulz point out, in 1983 the BLS eliminated interest costs from its calculations of consumer price inflation. The argument at the time, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/pir/journal/gj02.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.bls.gov/pir/journal/gj02.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/pir/journal/gj02.pdf" aria-label="made by BLS economist Robert Gillingham">made by BLS economist Robert Gillingham</a>, was that including home mortgage interest rates in the CPI formula was overstating inflation. Instead, Gillingham argued, the BLS should estimate what homeowners could charge if they rented out their homes, and use that to calculate housing inflation.</p>
<p>This change had a huge impact on the calculation of CPI, write Bolhuis et al., because the BLS removed housing prices and financing costs from the official CPI formula, even though everyday Americans still experienced those costs in the real world. “Owners’ equivalent rent”—the new CPI measure—amounts to over a quarter of the Consumer Price Index today.</p>
<p>Bolhuis et al. point out that the elimination of interest costs from CPI isn’t just about housing. “New and used vehicles combine to represent nearly 7 percent of the CPI,” they point out, but “exclude financing costs.” Given that four-fifths of all new cars were purchased using auto loans, this makes no sense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, more people buy consumer goods with credit cards than with cash—and yet the interest costs of credit cards aren’t included in the official BLS formula. “Measurements of the cost of living that exclude financing costs,” Bolhuis et al. argue, “will understate the pressure under which consumers, who rely on credit for many purchases, have found themselves.”</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><p>Inclusive of interest costs, inflation reached 18% in November 2022, and remains elevated.</p><small>NBER.org</small></figcaption></figure><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-2"></fbs-ad>
<h2><strong>What would inflation look like under the pre-1983 formula?</strong></h2>
<p>Bolhuis et al. then went on to see if they could recalculate the official CPI numbers using a pre-1983-like formula that incorporated the cost of mortgage interest, auto loan interest, and credit card interest on the cost of living. They found three things: first, that the pre-1983-like formula led to a dramatically different estimate of inflation in 2022 and 2023, peaking at 18 percent in November 2022.</p>
<p>Second, they found that consumer sentiment—as measured by the widely-used University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment—correlated much more strongly with the pre-1983 CPI formula than it did with the modern one that excludes interest costs.</p>
<p>Third, they found these differences to be also true in Europe: higher interest rates were correlated with lower consumer sentiment, and vice versa. This was an important finding, as some have suggested that the gap between American consumer sentiment and the official government statistics is a result of Americans’ mistrust of institutions and mainstream sources of information. “We find little evidence that the United States, despite its rising partisanship, social distrust, and large reported levels of overall ‘referred pain’ differ meaningfully” in their economic perceptions from those in peer nations.</p>
<p>“Consumers are including the cost of money in their perspective on their economic well-being, while economists are not,” the authors conclude. Since home and auto purchases “are integral to American consumers’ sense of their economic well being but their price is not included in official inflation measures, it is no wonder that sentiment lags traditional measures of economic performance.”</p>
<h2><strong>The gap between CPI and the pre-1983 formula could widen over time</strong></h2><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"></fbs-ad>
<p>There are other obvious problems with relying on the declining <em>rate</em> of official CPI inflation to gauge what consumers should be feeling. Inflation is cumulative; a decline in the rate of inflation does not reverse the price increases from previous years; it simply means that prices are now rising at a slower rate.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the exclusion of interest costs from the CPI and the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cex/cecomparison/pce_profile.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.bls.gov/cex/cecomparison/pce_profile.htm" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/cex/cecomparison/pce_profile.htm" aria-label="Personal Consumption Expenditures">Personal Consumption Expenditures</a> could become a growing problem over time, due to the ever-expanding federal debt.</p>
<p>As the debt increases, the federal government has to borrow more money from U.S. and foreign investors. But as would-be lenders to the U.S. see America as increasingly insolvent, investors will demand higher interest rates to lend us that money. Higher rates of government borrowing lead to higher rates for home mortgages, credit cards, student loans, car loans, and every other form of borrowing. And, as we’ve seen, these higher interest rates lead to higher price inflation, whether or not the Bureau of Labor Statistics recognizes it as such.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Federal Reserve has suppressed these higher interest rates by printing new dollars out of thin air to lend to the U.S. government. But printing new money can also cause inflation, by decreasing the purchasing power of each preexisting dollar in circulation.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-4"></fbs-ad>
<h2><strong>We need a healthier debate on how to measure consumer price inflation</strong></h2>
<p>Those who believe in the primacy of experts have long attacked those who question the accuracy of the BLS’ inflation measures. Balaji Srinivasan, the venture capitalist and entrepreneur, was <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1675863248501874692" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1675863248501874692" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1675863248501874692" aria-label="criticized">criticized</a> by mainstream commentators for investing in <a href="https://truflation.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://truflation.com/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://truflation.com/" aria-label="Truflation">Truflation</a>, an attempt at independently developing a measure of inflation using real-time price data from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>But whether one likes or dislikes Truflation’s methodology, we should be encouraging independent thinking on how best to measure prices in the economy. As the IMF-Harvard analysis shows, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is capable of making misjudgments. My colleagues Jackson Mejia and Jon Hartley at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity <a href="https://freopp.org/inflations-compounding-impact-on-the-poor-f82ea4d61d9b" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://freopp.org/inflations-compounding-impact-on-the-poor-f82ea4d61d9b" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://freopp.org/inflations-compounding-impact-on-the-poor-f82ea4d61d9b" aria-label="have shown">have shown</a> that even relatively low rates of inflation disproportionately harm the poor, because the poor lack the financial wherewithal to absorb higher consumer prices.</p>
<p>It’s important—and healthy—for us to look at different measures of consumer prices. Everyone has a stake in the outcome, especially those who live paycheck to paycheck.</p>

Depression, anxiety, burnout, suicidality, hopelessness, lethargy, anhedonia, feeling flat, worry, and the like are all different flavours of the same phenomena: the negative human response to internal or external stressors. Of course, the causes are always multifactorial. It cannot and should not be oversimplified to family history, genetics, behavioural deficiencies, bad environment or poor social support.</p><p>When I carefully dissect my dark seasons, some common themes often emerge. Work is often the critical exacerbating and perpetuating factor in those dark times. Because as a surgeon I spend the vast majority of my lifetime at work, what happens there influences all other aspects of my life including my marriage, family and social life.</p><p><strong>Here are 3 common things that have thrown me into some dark pit of despair:</strong></p><p>I have lost control of my days. I had worked in a hospital where I was oncall 24/7, 12 days out of 14. I had fortnightly weekends off. When I was preparing for surgical exams, I’d be working and studying from 6.30am to 10pm everyday, seeing my family only on the weekends for lunch. I had worked in a hospital network that covered 4 campuses and drove 500kms a week when covering these sites. I had worked in a hospital where I didn’t get home for days at a time, sleeping overnight in hospital quarters, outpatient clinic benches and in my car. I used to have my sleeping bag, toiletries and change in the boot of my car because I didn’t know if I was going to make it home some nights. Plans change every single day at work because of emergencies. I can’t even be sure what the next hour will bring when I am on call. You might ask, why can’t you work less? It’s not as easy as that. If I decide to work less, who is going to cover the hospital? If the hospital aren’t employing other doctors, we can’t allow patients to go uncovered. I accept the fact that I have a duty of care to be on call. The intensity and personal damage of these on call periods are often forgotten.</p><p>Not only that, we are losing control of health care in general. Everyday, there’s a new form, a new guideline, a new protocol, a new health software, a new policy all dictating, restricting and modifying clinician activities. Some of these policies are written by people who do not see patients. There’s a whole paid industry dedicated to restructuring what doctors and nurses do to reduce costs and increase output.</p><p>Just imagine. I start my days at 6am. I wake up to an email alerting me of the number of discharge summaries that haven’t been completed and the various computer based modules I have to complete (hand washing, privacy, lifting patients, etc). Round starts at 7am. I see 15-20 patients with various travel forms, certificates, scripts that need completing. All to be done via the electronic health system, clunky, not user friendly, takes a long time to log in. Then I start an overbooked operating list at 8am. There are 7 cases booked. I have no say on who gets on the operating list and the order of patients. The first patient haven’t been checked in. The diabetic one is hypoglycaemic. The infant is cranky. The autistic child is running away. The interpreter is not here yet. The computer is still not logging in. The password is expired. I used to be able to arrange the operating list because I know that some operations take longer than others. But now, the bookings office determine that that all my tonsillectomies take 14 minutes because that’s the average time recorded on the computer. The moment I scrub in, the timer starts. The moment I unscrub timer stops. Click. Click. Click. Because the theatre bookings does not take into account the interpreter time, pre-med period or transfer to ICU, the list is running late. The nurse in charge is breathing down my neck to finish on time. I still took about 14 minutes on each case, but the team is delayed by external clinical reasons. The theatre team is anxious to finish, everything is rushed, and mistakes are bound to occur.</p><p>In the mean time, I field 12 phone calls from ED, GP and other units. By now there are 3 patients waiting for me in ED and 1 being flown in from another hospital. The operating list is finished late. I rushed to ED, and gulped down a cup of instant coffee. Then I arrive late to the afternoon clinic, which again is overbooked. Clinic nurses are not happy. I see 8-10 patients while taking more calls. I try to discuss complex surgeries with patients but I keep getting interrupted by calls and paperwork. Then I run back to theatre for an emergency case. By this time I’m set up for failure. I’m tired, cranky and my head is full of jobs to do. I do the afternoon round, see more consults, admit more patients and dictate letters. I have taken up to 70 calls on a 24h on call period. By 6pm I’m totally exhausted. I grab a packet of chips, ginger beer, and start working on the papers I was meant to write up. I review the case notes for the next couple of days. I get home between 7-8pm. Grab dinner and put the kids to bed. I get called back in and I take a patient to theatre for an emergency procedure. I come back just after midnight and sleep. I get called four more times between midnight and 6am.</p><p>6am. Repeat.</p><p>I have lost control of my days and I have lost support. When can I actually find support? I don’t have time to talk to my colleagues about life. I don’t have time with my family. I don’t have time to catch up with friends. Social ties are lost when one stepped into medical school. I’ve lost count of the number of significant life events I have missed (birthdays, anniversaries, reunions, school recitals, first walks, etc.)</p><p>I delivered my third child with my own hands because the obstetrician was stuck in a traffic jam. The following morning I went to work because if I didn’t 12 patients have to miss their surgeries, 2 anaesthetists and about 8 nurses will miss out on their day’s income. More importantly, admin would not be happy because a cancelled operating list is a huge financial loss to the hospital.</p><p>I know where I can get support, but practically, when and how am I going to get that support? </p><p>In addition, doctors who scream for help may be formally reported, therefore having restrictions placed on their practice and then incurring higher medical indemnity fees in some situations. Trainees who ask for help may be labelled as underperforming and have to be commenced on probation or remediation. We may not have practical access to the support that are often advertised. </p><p>Interestingly, the above physical and emotional stressors are reasonably manageable to me. I’m understanding my own physical and emotional limits. These stressors induce  exhaustion, but the excitement of the work and the intellectual challenge of the job bring a lot of personal satisfaction. I do get emotionally shaken at times because I deal with dying cancer patients, emergency airway disasters and sick complex children, but I get by.</p><p>I am realising more and more that what brings me greatest distress is the relentless administrative pressure which take away the meaningful clinical engagement I have with my patients. And I wonder if this is what many young doctors are experiencing as well. Medicine used to be a meaningful pursuit. Now it has become a tiresome industry. The joy, purpose and meaning of medicine has been codified, sterilised, protocolised, industrialised and regimented. Doctors are caught in a web of business, no longer a noble vocation. The altruism of young doctors have been replaced by the shackles of efficiency, productivity and key performance indicators.</p><p>I have little say in organising my very own operating lists or clinics. Even the power to re-order the operating list has been taken from the surgeon. The thing that I love doing (operating &amp; seeing patients) is being measured, recorded and benchmarked. The clinics are overbooked to get numbers through. The paperwork for each patient encounter is increasing with each passing year. There are so many other non-clinical departments dictating what I should do and how best to do it. The mantra is “cost-effectiveness and increased productivity.”</p><p>I went into medicine knowing that I will have to sacrifice much for the sake of my patients. What I am realising is that today in modern medicine, a doctor is just one of the many commodities in this complex industry. It’s no longer about the patient. It’s about the business of hospitals. Patient satisfaction officers, Theatre Utilisation officers, Patient Flow Coordinators. These are all business roles.</p><p>As a surgeon I spent a year in a hospital where I smiled on the way to work and I am so grateful for my job. I looked forward to long days because I knew what I was doing was significant. Another year in another hospital, I dreaded going to work. I hated being on call. I was burned out and I couldn’t control my emotions at work and at home. I’m not inherently an offensive or rude person, I’m just a person pushed to the limits and set to fail because of the circumstances around my work. Same surgeon, different jobs. The forces that pushed me to losing control of my emotions are likely the same forces that might push some of us to suicide. </p><p>To some hospitals and their business, I’m not a Surgeon. I’m just an employee. Overworked, burned out, replaceable. The noble call to Medicine has been suffocated by the bureaucratic force exerting itself as the medical industry. </p><p>Would you agree or disagree with my thoughts? What other “Dark Side of Doctoring” issues can you think of?</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>What’s the catch? Seems to good to be true? Well, this thing sits between your devices and the wall. So you need to neatly run extension cables from every room in the house to the “sun box”, and then run one cable from the box to the panels, and another to the wall (optional, just so it can fall back to pulling power from the wall). Photos of this are coming soon.</p>

<p>Will it ever push power back into the wall? Nope! It’ll only ever draw from the wall in the event that both the sun is down and the battery is dead (so your fridge won’t go off overnight for example).</p>

<p>Is this legal? Yes, see above. No difference to plugging your fridge into your wall, as far as the utility is concerned.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p dir="ltr">The FCC is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/april-2024-open-commission-meeting">set to vote on April 25</a> to restore its authority over the companies we pay to get online, and reinstate federal net neutrality protections that were jettisoned by the Trump administration in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Net neutrality protections are supposed to ensure that we, not the internet service providers (ISPs) we pay to get online, get to decide what we do online.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCC released <a href="http://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401676A1.pdf">its draft rules</a> early in April and there’s much to celebrate in them. Mobile carriers like T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon that have been degrading video quality for mobile users will have to stop. The FCC kept in place state neutrality protections like California’s net neutrality law, allowing for layers of enforcement. The FCC also made it harder for ISPs to evade net neutrality at the point where data enters their networks.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>However, there’s a huge problem: the proposed rules make it possible for mobile ISPs to start picking applications and putting them in a fast lane - where they’ll perform better generally and much better if the network gets congested.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-expands-worlds-first-network-slicing-beta-nationwide">T-Mobile</a>, <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/oss-bss-cx/at-t-tests-gaming-traffic-prioritization-amid-net-neutrality-debate">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/carriers-look-to-offer-fast-lane-access-on-5g-networks-0ab57bcc">Verizon</a> are all testing ways to create these 5G fast lanes for apps such as video conferencing, games, and video where the ISP chooses and controls what gets boosted. They use a technical feature in 5G called network slicing, where part of their radio spectrum gets used as a special lane for the chosen app or apps, separated from the usual internet traffic.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The FCC’s draft order opens the door to these fast lanes, so long as the app provider isn’t charged for them.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">That means we could soon see fast lane offerings like this:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/20240411-mobile2.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Or we could see add-ons like Enhanced Video Conferencing for $10 a month, or one-time 24-hour passes to have Prioritized Online Gaming.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/20240411-mobile1.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">This isn't imagination.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ISPs write about this in their blogs and press releases. They talk about these efforts and dreams openly at conferences, and their equipment vendors plainly lay out how ISPs can chop up internet service into all manner of fast lanes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>These kinds of ISP-controlled fast lanes violate core net neutrality principles and would limit user choice, distort competition, hamper startups, and help cement platform dominance.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Net neutrality means that we, the people who use the internet, get to decide what we do online, without interference from ISPs. ISPs do not get to interfere with our choices by blocking, speeding up or slowing down apps or kinds of apps. Apps compete on a level playing field, and users, not ISPs, determine which apps are successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Letting ISPs decide which apps get to be in a fast lane violates these principles. Apps that are in a fast lane work better than those that are not, especially when the network is busy and apps in the regular lane start suffering. If HBO Max is in a fast lane, it will continue to work well even if the network is busy, while all other video is buffering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Differences in performance, including relative differences in performance, matter. Even small differences in load times affect how long people stay on a site, how much they pay, and whether they’ll come back. Those differences also affect how high up sites show in search results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thus, letting ISPs choose which apps get to be in a fast lane lets them, not users, pick winners and losers online.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2022/05/facebook-google-big-telecoms-want-keep-violating-net-neutrality-europe-regulators">as we’ve seen in the past</a>, programs like this favor the most popular apps, even when the program is supposedly open to all apps in a category and no apps are paying the ISP. So the biggest apps will end up in all the fast lanes, while most others would be left out. The ones left out would likely include messaging apps like Signal, local news sites, decentralized Fediverse apps like Mastodon and PeerTube, niche video sites like Dropout, indie music sites like Bandcamp, and the millions of other sites and apps in the long tail.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Legislators, government agencies, attorneys general in states both red and blue, public interest groups, startups, and open-source technologists are all working to reduce the power and dominance of the biggest platforms. The FCC should be working to help that effort by creating a level playing field and banning these ISP-controlled 5G fast lanes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Meaningful net neutrality protections prohibit ISPs from speeding up and slowing down apps and kinds of apps.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">ISPs can pick winners and losers by putting winners in a fast lane or losers in a slow lane.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a what it would look like if an ISP put everything except YouTube and TikTok in a slow lane.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/20240411-mobile4.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is what it would look like if an ISP put YouTube and TikTok in a fast lane.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img p="" src="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/20240411-mobile4.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s the same picture. The effect is the same. In either case, disfavored apps will find it harder to compete.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meaningful net neutrality protections need to protect against both.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>This is not controversial.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">President Obama’s <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/net-neutrality">November 2014 net neutrality proposal</a> included this protection:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The rules I am asking for are simple, common-sense steps that reflect the Internet you and I use every day.” That included, he said, a brightline ban on ISPs “intentionally slow[ing] down some content or speed[ing] up others — through a process often called “throttling” — based on the type of service or your ISP’s preferences.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even proposed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6393">Republican</a> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1101/text?s=1&amp;r=98">net neutrality</a> <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/files/RepublicanNetworkNeutralityBill-BILLS-114hr-PIH-OpenInternet.pdf">bills</a> prohibited ISPs from speeding up and slowing down apps and kinds of apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many, including me, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/104020490613577/2">thought the 2015 Order did so</a>, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost certainly, the millions of Americans who celebrated the 2015 Open Internet Order and fought the 2017 repeal think that net neutrality protections ban fast lanes and slow lanes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The draft order takes a different approach.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The no-throttling rule that the FCC proposed in October explicitly prohibited ISPs from slowing down apps and classes of apps; it was silent on whether the rule also applies to speeding up.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the mobile ISPs’ public statements about their plans for 5G fast lanes, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10328020156846/1">public</a> <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10401332717347/1">interest</a> <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10330745507976/1">groups</a>, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1215041660232/1">startups</a>, and <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_fcc_title_ii_4224.pdf">members of Congress</a> asked the FCC to clarify in the Order that the no-throttling rule also prohibits ISPs from speeding up apps and classes of apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The draft order did not do that.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401676A1.pdf">draft order</a> acknowledges that some speeding up of apps could violate the no-throttling rule, it added some unclear, nebulous language suggesting that the FCC would review any fast lanes case-by-case, without explaining how it would do that.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> This language gives the FCC maximum flexibility to accept or reject specific fast lanes in the future as it sees fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the draft order, the agency “could” find a violation of the no-throttling rule, if:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">an ISP speeds up specific apps (but not necessarily classes of apps), and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the decision to speed up is “unreasonably discriminatory,” and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the speeding up has the effect of “‘impair[ing] or degrad[ing]’ other … apps not given the same treatment.”&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>In other words, the proposed no-throttling rule is a bright line rule for slow lanes – ISPs can’t slow down apps or kinds of apps; but for fast lanes, it’s a fuzzy, unclear case-by-case standard.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, would it be “unreasonably discriminatory” to create a 5G fast lane that includes the most popular apps in a category since it responds to consumer preferences? Does an unreasonably discriminatory fast lane need to technically degrade or impair the apps that are not in the fast lane for the FCC to find a violation of the no-throttling rule?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>There is no way to predict which kinds of fast lanes the FCC might ultimately find to violate the no-throttling rule. This gives ISPs cover to flood the market with various fast-lane offerings, arguing that their version does not violate the no-throttling rule and daring the FCC to enforce its rule.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">And if the mobile ISPs do this, the cable companies will soon follow. Cable companies have the tech to build their own fast lanes, and increasingly they compete with 5G to the Home services. If T-Mobile and Verizon start selling home plans that have “enhanced streaming video,” you can bet the cable companies will launch their own version.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCC would then investigate these offerings case-by-case in lengthy and costly proceedings. In the meantime, apps that are not in the fast lane will suffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Entrepreneurs and application providers that are not included in a fast lane will have to decide whether to try to get into the fast lane, file an FCC complaint, or just silently suffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies that do file complaints will waste years litigating the meaning of “unreasonably discriminatory,” all the while going up against giant telecoms that stockpile lawyers and lobbyists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unless you are a high-paid telecom lawyer who bills by the hour, the proposed test for what’s a good or bad fast lane is a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Not all 5G slices are harmful.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Just to be clear, net neutrality proponents are not asking the FCC to ban network slicing. There’s lots of ways for ISPs to use slices for things that are not normal internet service such as a dedicated slice for a farming operation using remote controlled tractors, slices for telemetry data and oversight of autonomous cars, or providing a slice for a stadium’s video system at a crowded game.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are good reasons to isolate this kind of traffic, and it can be done without reducing user choice or tilting the online playing field. Under the FCC’s draft order, such services would be so-called enterprise service offerings, to which the Open Internet protections don’t apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But the 5G fast lanes ISPs are imagining for regular internet access – where ISPs decide which apps or kind of apps get a fast lane – would cause real harm and violate the core tenets of net neutrality.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We don’t need our ISP deciding for us what’s important and what’s not; we want our ISP to let us decide and stick to the job of connecting our devices to the services we want to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not even clear why such fast lanes are necessary for consumer internet access. As one industry analyst noted, isn’t 5G already supposed to be the fast lane for everything?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Luckily, there’s still time to fix this.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCC can and should edit the draft order ahead of the vote on April 24 and clarify in the Order that the no-throttling rule also prohibits ISPs from creating fast lanes for select apps or kinds of apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCC just needs to put this fix in the fast lane to get it done before it votes on April 25.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/promoting-fast-open-and-fair-internet">2024 Draft Order</a>, para. 492 (“Our interpretation of “throttling” encompasses a wide variety of conduct that could impair or degrade an end user’s ability to access content of their choosing; thus, we decline commenters’ request to modify the rule to explicitly include positive and negative discrimination of content. We agree, however, with Free Press that a BIAS provider’s “unreasonably discriminatory” decision to speed up specific content, applications, or services could “impair or degrade” other content, applications, or services not given the same treatment.” (footnotes omitted)).</p>
