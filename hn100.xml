            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformers are a class of autoregressive deep learning architectures which have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in various vision, language, and robotics tasks. We revisit the problem of Kalman Filtering in linear dynamical systems and show that Transformers can approximate the Kalman Filter in a strong sense. Specifically, for any observable LTI system we construct an explicit causally-masked Transformer which implements the Kalman Filter, up to a small additive error which is bounded uniformly in time; we call our construction the Transformer Filter. Our construction is based on a two-step reduction. We first show that a softmax self-attention block can exactly represent a certain Gaussian kernel smoothing estimator. We then show that this estimator closely approximates the Kalman Filter. We also investigate how the Transformer Filter can be used for measurement-feedback control and prove that the resulting nonlinear controllers closely approximate the performance of standard optimal control policies such as the LQG controller.

silicosis.</p><section role="contentinfo" aria-label="key points" data-component="KeyPoints" data-uri="coremedia://teaser/103225906"><h2 data-component="Heading">Key points:</h2><ul

data-component="ListItem"><span></span>The material can be found in thousands of Australian bathrooms and kitchens</li><li data-component="ListItem"><span></span>Doctors and workers had called for the ban over health and safety concerns</li></ul></section><p>Commonwealth, state, and territory workplace ministers unanimously agreed to implement a national ban on the product at a long-awaited meeting on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>The ban will start on July 1, 2024 in most states and territories.</p><p>The world-first decision comes after hundreds of workers developed silicosis from working on engineered stone, a popular material mostly used for kitchen benches and bathroom vanities.</p><p>Ministers also agreed to a "transition period" for engineered stone contracts entered into before the ban was announced, with arrangements to be finalised at a later meeting.</p><p>The federal government will also impose a ban on imported engineered stone to provide an "additional layer of enforcement and deterrence at the border", however the date has not been finalised yet.</p><p>Trade unions, health organisations and personal injury law firms have all welcomed the ban, saying it will save lives.</p><p>"Engineered stone is a fashion product that is killing the workers who make it," Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary Liam O'Brien said.</p><p>"With alternatives readily available, why are we risking the lives of tradies for a fashionable finish in our kitchens?"</p><p>Caesarstone, a large engineered stone manufacturer, said it was "deeply disappointed" by the decision.</p><p>A spokesperson said the reasoning behind the decision was "flawed" and that singling out engineered stone would not eliminate the risk of silicosis in the workplace.</p><p>"Most importantly, it [the decision] fails to address the real cause of rising silicosis rates – poor compliance with and enforcement of safety standards," they said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Popular material sparked a rise in lung disease</h2><p>Engineered stone, a durable and affordable alternative to natural materials like granite and marble, exploded in popularity in Australia throughout the 2000s.</p><p>However doctors began sounding the alarm after noticing a surge in stonemasons developing silicosis, a long-term and sometimes fatal lung disease caused by inhaling unsafe levels of silica dust.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="103224334" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103224334"><img alt="A shiny white and grey kitchen

of their work lives.</p><p>"Some of these people with silicosis, they're extremely sick … we have a condition which caused them to become so short of breath it's hard to do just normal daily activities," he said.</p><p>Since the first Australian silicosis case linked to working on engineered stone was reported in 2015, hundreds more cases have emerged.</p><p>Unions joined doctors to campaign for a ban, arguing it could become the "asbestos of the 2020s" due to the risks it posed to workers' health.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">An 'important win for thousands of workers'</h2><p>Earlier this year workplace ministers tasked Safe Work Australia, a government WHS agency, with investigating how a ban could work and whether low-silica engineered stone could remain on the market safely.</p><p>The report found there was no safe level of silica, concluding: "The use of all engineered stone should be prohibited."</p><p>The CMFEU's Zach Smith said the nationwide ban would "stop the deadly scourge of silicosis in its tracks".</p><p>"This is an important win for the thousands of workers that have been forced to use this product, which has caused them to contract life-ending silicosis," he said.</p><p>"Let's be clear about this — the decision that's been made by the various levels of government today will save lives."</p><h2 data-component="Heading">'From the breadwinner to nothing'</h2><p>Safe Work found that while silicosis cases could emerge in several industries, the numbers were "disproportionate" among engineered stone workers.</p><p>Engineered stone workers also suffered a faster disease progression and were more likely to die from it, the report said.</p><p>The majority of engineered stone workers diagnosed with silicosis were under 35.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="103224134" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103224134"><img alt="A man with brown hair lies in a hospital bed with

have been shattered by the disease.</p><p>They have told the ABC about its devastating consequences: struggling to breathe properly, needing lung transplants and facing an early death.</p><p>Former stonemason Ben Harrison, 34, was diagnosed with silicosis four years ago and told the ABC he supported a ban.</p><p>"I've gone from being the breadwinner of the house … to being nothing," he said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">More details to be worked out</h2><p>Workplace ministers are due to hold another meeting in March 2024 to work out details for the transition period for engineered stone contracts that have already been implemented.</p><p>Caesarstone said a transition period of six months would not be enough time to avoid "significant disruption" to the construction and homebuilding industry.</p><p>"A longer period [is] needed to ensure industry can meet the anticipated demand for substitute products and that fabricators with the necessary financial resources can retool and retrain employees to work on other products," a spokesperson said.</p><p>The Housing Industry Association said the ban had caused uncertainty and concern to the small businesses that supply engineered stone, adding that new machinery and alternative products would be needed.</p><p>"It is critical following today's decision that governments now prepare a detailed industry transition plan that addresses these and other key matters," association managing director Jocelyn Martin said.</p><p>Dr Hoy said broader change was needed to make sure a similar crisis did not happen again.</p><p>"We can't be waiting until people develop disease and they die from conditions related to work before we start acting," he said.</p><p>"We really need to change the ways to identify problems at work, and act before people become sick."</p></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- -->&nbsp;</span><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-12-13T06:20:27.000Z">20

<p dir="auto">There are a couple of C++ implementations of CSP channels, e.g. <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/c++csp/" rel="nofollow">https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/c++csp/</a> or <a href="https://github.com/atollk/copper">https://github.com/atollk/copper</a>, but the intention of the present library is a C89 implementation of Go channels.</p>
<p dir="auto">For C there are also some libraries, partially with similar goals as the present one.</p>
<p dir="auto">Pipe (<a href="https://github.com/cgaebel/pipe">https://github.com/cgaebel/pipe</a>) is a C99 implementation of a thread-safe FIFO. The library is very well documented, but also more complex than the present one, and with more dynamic allocations (CspChan uses a simple fixed size ring buffer instead, like Go). The Pipe library has no select implementation, and adding one seems pretty complicated and requires changes to the library.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Chan library (<a href="https://github.com/tylertreat/chan">https://github.com/tylertreat/chan</a>) is a C implementation of Go channels and shares the same goals as the present library. There is even an implementation of Go select. The implementation is rather complex (with separate implementations for buffered and unbuffered channels) and also with more dynamic allocations than I would hope for; apparently only non-blocking selects are supported (i.e. only Go selects with default); adding blocking selects would require significant changes to the library.</p>

                Recent techniques for real-time view synthesis have rapidly advanced in
                fidelity and speed, and modern methods are capable of rendering
                near-photorealistic scenes at interactive frame rates. At the same time, a
                tension has arisen between explicit scene representations amenable to
                rasterization and neural fields built on ray marching, with state-of-the-art
                instances of the latter surpassing the former in quality while being
                prohibitively expensive for real-time applications. In this work, we introduce
                SMERF, a view synthesis approach that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
                real-time methods on large scenes with footprints <b>up to 300 m^2 at a volumetric
                resolution of 3.5 mm^3</b>. Our method is built upon two primary contributions: a
                hierarchical model partitioning scheme, which increases model capacity while
                constraining compute and memory consumption, and a distillation training
                strategy that simultaneously yields high fidelity and internal consistency. Our
                approach enables full six degrees of freedom (6DOF) navigation within a web
                browser and <b>renders in real-time on commodity smartphones and laptops</b>.
                Extensive experiments show that our method exceeds the current state-of-the-art
                in real-time novel view synthesis by <b>0.78 dB on standard benchmarks and 1.78 dB
                on large scenes</b>, renders frames three orders of magnitude faster than
                state-of-the-art radiance field models, and achieves real-time performance
                across a wide variety of commodity devices, including smartphones.

                        <b>(a)</b>: We model large multi-room scenes with a number of independent submodels, each of which is
                        assigned to a different region of the scene.  During rendering the submodel is picked
                        based on camera origin. <b>(b)</b>: To model complex view-dependent effects, within each submodel
                        we additionally instantiate grid-aligned copies of deferred MLP parameters \(\theta\). These
                        parameters are trilinearly interpolated based on camera origin \(\mathbf{o}\).
                        <b>(c)</b>: While each submodel represents the entire scene, only the submodel's assiociated grid cell
                        is modelled with high resolution, which is realized by contracting the submodel-specific local coordinates.

                    We demonstrate that image fidelity can be greatly boosted via distillation. We first train a
                    state-of-the-art offline radiance field (Zip-NeRF). We then use the RGB color predictions \(\mathbf{c}\) of this teacher
                    model as supervision for our own model. Additionally, we access the volumetric density values \(\tau\) of the
                    pre-trained teacher by minimizing the discrepancy of volume rendering weights between teacher and student.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><em>Since its founding, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">North Korea</a> has always had an elaborate bureaucracy for artistic production, organised within the Korean Workers party’s </em><em>agitation and </em><em>propaganda </em><em>department. This framework was set up in emulation of the Soviet system </em><em>under Stalin. Over time, this artistic bureaucracy has been increasingly adapted to promote the cult of personality surrounding the first leader </em><em>Kim Il</em><em>-sung</em><em> and his descendants.</em></p><p><em>Among the many cultural products designed to promote the regime, one of the most important is literature. Aspiring writers in North Korea must register with the </em><em>Korean Writers’ Union</em><em> and participate in annual writing workshops. The KWU has offices in every province in the country. KWU editors evaluate each work on its ideological merits before allowing its publication in one of the </em><em>party’s own literary journals. There are particularly strict rules regarding how the leaders and the </em><em>party may be depicted in literature.</em></p><p><em>A writer’s life is highly competitive. Literary success means becoming a “professional revolutionary” with lots of perks: a three-month “creativity leave” every year, permission to travel freely around the country</em><em> and special housing privileges.</em></p><p><em>Kim Ju-sŏng was one such aspiring writer. A </em><em>“zainichi”</em><em> (Japan-born ethnic Korean), he “returned” to North Korea in 1976 at age 16 as part of a wave of emigration encouraged by pro-North Korean groups in Japan and lived in the country for 28 years before defecting to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">South Korea</a>. The zainichi returnees were an important propaganda tool as well as a source of income and foreign technology for the North Korean regime. Due to their foreign connections they enjoyed a relatively higher standard of living, but they also faced suspicion from the regime and prejudice from ordinary North Koreans.</em></p><p><em>Below are three excerpts from Kim’s memoir, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E8%B7%B3%E3%81%B9%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E8%9B%99-%E5%8C%97%E6%9C%9D%E9%AE%AE%E3%80%8C%E6%B4%97%E8%84%B3%E6%96%87%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9F%E4%BD%93-%E9%87%91-%E6%9F%B1%E8%81%96/dp/4575313513/ref=sr_1_1" data-link-name="in body link">Tobenai kaeru: Kitachōsen sennō bungaku no jittai </a>(The Frog that Couldn’t Jump: The Reality of North Korea’s Brainwashing Literature)</em><em>, translated by <a href="https://www.shawmeredith.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Meredith Shaw</a>. In it, he describes working at his local </em><em>KWU </em><em>branch as an office assistant. The first excerpt begins as he is meeting with his superior shortly after starting the job.</em></p><hr><p><strong>“By the way, how are you managing </strong>with the 100-copy collection?”</p><p>“Huh? What do you mean, the 100-copy collection?”</p><p>“The books in the safe. Don’t neglect your library duties. It’d be a disaster if anything leaked to the outside.”</p><p>I set off for the library at a run. There were books in that safe? I had no idea. I figured, at best, it would be a stash of treatises by the leaders on literary theory, or else records of secret directives for KWU eyes only. It turned out that the 100-copy collection was where the union stored translated copies of foreign novels and reference books that writers could access.</p><p>With the speed of a bank robber, I yanked out my key, turned the lock and opened the safe. Inside, tightly packed together, were nearly 70 translated copies of foreign novels. Seeing them, I crumpled to the floor in shock.</p><p>The first title to jump out at me was Seichō Matsumoto’s Points and Lines,<em> </em>a Japanese psychological thriller published in 1970. With growing excitement, I fumbled through the stack. There was Ernest Hemingway’s For Whom the Bell Tolls, O Henry’s The Last Leaf, Alexandre Dumas fils’ The Lady of the Camellias, Takiji Kobayashi’s Crab Cannery Ship, Dante’s Divine Comedy, Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron, Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables, Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, Margaret Mitchell’s Gone With the Wind; and, most exciting of all for me, Seiichi Morimura’s Proof of the Man, a Japanese detective novel that tells the story of a manhunt from Tokyo to New York.</p><p>I had joined the KWU in the late 1980s. At that time, the only foreign literature ordinary North Koreans could access was that of other socialist nations, chiefly the USSR and China. I had read Russian writers like Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy, as well as the Chinese classic The True Story of Ah Q by Lu Xun. Occasionally, translations of classics like Shakespeare’s works were published. But nobody even dreamed of seeing literature from enemy countries such as the US and Japan.</p><p>Some zainichi returnees like myself had brought books from Japan, which we passed around secretly. One of these was Proof of the Man. Upon finding a Korean-language copy in the 100-copy collection, I was struck by the quality of the translation. I later learned that it had been done by a zainichi acquaintance of mine who worked as a translator.</p><p>“Those sneaky bastards.

My favourite was Guy de Maupassant. I was deeply impressed by his short stories The Necklace and Boule de Suif and used them as models for my own work.</p><p>Any mismanagement of the 100-copy collection would be prosecuted as a political crime, since it would in effect be distributing capitalist reactionary materials to the public. I don’t understand the logic, but I’ve heard that the Narcotics Control Law deems it a greater crime to sell or transport illegal materials than to consume them.</p><p>Use of the 100-copy collection was restricted exclusively to our writers, and lending to civilians was illegal. But somehow a rumour got out, and I was besieged with requests. Most came from party bureaucrats or their children, and it was hard to refuse them. The most popular request was for Proof of the Man. The three-volume set was ragged and dog-eared with use.</p><p>One time a funny thing happened. A big shot from the KWP administration bureau asked to borrow the book. His section controlled party advancement and appointments, so I wasn’t about to refuse him. (Of course, it also didn’t hurt that he passed me a carton of Mild Seven cigarettes.)</p><p>More than a month passed and I hadn’t got it back. To my increasingly pointed reminders, he always asked for “just a little more time”. The 100-copy collection had to undergo an annual inspection, at which time all the books had to be in order. An inspector was dispatched from the central KWU organisation, and if even one volume was missing, there could be dire consequences. If I was unlucky, I might be expelled from the KWU or even face legal prosecution.</p><p>With the inspector’s visit just a week away, I grew concerned enough to visit the official’s home. However powerful he may be, the 100-copy collection fell under the purview of the party’s propaganda and agitation department, and thus was beyond the reach of local cadres. If I let things get out of control, I could forget about becoming a writer – I’d be lucky if I wasn’t sent to some remote farm for the rest of my days. Summoning my courage, I arrived at the party officials’ exclusive apartment block and knocked on the door.</p><p>“Who is it?” a young woman’s voice chirped at the same instant the door opened. The delicious aroma of roasting meat assailed me. Before my eyes was a pale young beauty in her 20s.</p><p>“I’m from the KWU. Is the comrade director at home?”</p><p>“Ah, you’re here about the book? Come on in. My father’s not home yet. He’s gone to Pyongyang on business.”</p><p>“In that case, I’ll come another time. If you could get the book back within a week, I’d be much obliged.” But my feet just kept right on moving into the entryway.</p><p>I’d heard that the official had a daughter attending the University of Fine Art, but I’d never met her before. I forgot all about the book, enchanted by her radiant beauty and smile, and allowed her to draw me into the home.</p><p>“I heard your union has many diverting books. I’m a great lover of books myself, my father is always bringing them for me.”</p><p>It was the first time I’d ever been inside a party official’s home. Emboldened by my curiosity, I looked around as she chattered. It was equivalent to a four-bedroom, quite luxurious by North Korean standards of the time. In the parlour was a leather sofa, a Hitachi colour TV with a VCR and impressive speakers – in other words, posh digs. I was always hearing that party cadres lived incredibly well, but I’d never imagined it was this fabulous.</p><p>Suddenly, three more beauties appeared in the entryway. They were all friends of the director’s daughter from the university. The sight of them arrayed around me was quite breathtaking.</p><p>“You are a novelist? But you’re so young, and tall.”</p><p>“Oh, no. I’m just a common citizen who hopes to become a novelist someday.”</p><p>They giggled in unison as I joined them on the sofa.</p><p>“What’s so funny? Do I have something on my face?”</p><p>At my side, the director’s daughter punched me lightly on the shoulder. “La, ‘citizen’… There’s no need to use such stuffy terms. Do we look like peasants to you?” She punched the remote control, and a South Korean music video appeared on the screen.</p><p>A cup of coffee appeared before me. The scent of Nescafé Gold Blend filled my nostrils. Sitting there, watching the South Korean singer Kim Jong-hwan belt out the ballad Reason for Existence, I felt like questioning my own existence. <em>What are these people? Is this still North Korea?</em></p><p>Nowadays, whenever people ask my nationality, I always reply that I’m an alien from the planet Baltan. But the elites of North Korea are from a completely different galaxy.</p><figure id="42698eb9-96bd-45b1-bfb2-8ad1c5a4c45b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Traffic police officers in Pyongyang." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a845ccea696e70def2215dc0e27ff9005b34e460/0_0_4866_3264/master/4866.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="298.49568434032057" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Traffic police officers in Pyongyang.</span> Photograph: Wong Maye-E/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Feeling like a man bewitched, I suddenly wanted to get the hell out of there. It was terrifying to sit there blithely doing things that under ordinary circumstances would get me shot.</p><p>“Listen, about that book … Do you have it here?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s here. We’ll be finished by tonight actually. I was just about to return it.”</p><p>It shortly became clear what she meant by “finished”. The beautiful girls all took out their school notebooks, and in each one I saw Proof of the Man written out word for word.</p><p>“Hold on – have you been copying this book?”</p><p>“Oh, the story’s just so moving and lovely. These two are in the drama department and they wanted to show it to all their friends. And it’s just so complicated getting books from the 100-copy collection.”</p><p>“<em>Maitta</em>!” I swore in Japanese without thinking.</p><p>“Huh? What’s that mean?”</p><p>“Nothing. But this is a real mess you’ve made. If you’re found out, we’re all screwed.”</p><p>“Oh, nonsense. We’re all daughters of party officials, they won’t arrest us. But why is it wrong to read such a wonderful book? It’s the same with songs, too. Isn’t it natural for a frog in a well to want to see the wider world?”</p><p>“A frog in a well … Really, you tadpoles are something else. Look, just keep this whole thing under wraps, and try to get it all done tonight, OK?”</p><p>The beautiful tadpoles kept their promise and protected the secret. Proof of the Man was returned in good order. As for the hand-written copies, I have no idea what became of them. I can only imagine they went some way toward changing the mindset of the younger generation and fertilising a new revolutionary consciousness.</p><hr><p><strong>I believe the reason my writing</strong> received poor evaluations lay primarily in my choice of genre. All of my stories took place in Japan, or had zainichi as the main characters. In North Korea these were dismissed as “foreign works”, the catch-all term for anything about the wider world. Like anywhere, in North Korean literary circles there is a fair amount of specialisation, and each writer has his or her own style and character.</p><p>The most highly regarded genre, it goes without saying, is No 1 literature – that is, works about members of the ruling Kim family. This is not a genre that just anybody can write. In order of esteem, the genres of North Korean literature are:</p><p>1) No 1 works: stories about the achievements and personalities of the Kim family.</p><p>2) Anti-Japan partisan works AKA revolutionary works: stories set within the colonial-era independence movement.</p><p>3) War works: stories set during the Korean war.</p><p>4) Historical works: stories set during the Yi, Koguryo or Koryo dynasties.</p><p>5) Real-life works: stories about ordinary society from the postwar to the present.</p><p>6) South Korean works: stories set in South Korea.</p><p>7) Foreign works: stories set anywhere outside Korea.</p><p>I was involved with foreign works. Aside from No 1 works, writers had free choice of any genre, and we were also free to move around and experiment between genres. But only the most elite, accomplished writers were permitted to produce No 1 works.</p><p>Of course, writing is not limited to fiction; there were writers specialising in poetry, children’s literature, plays, translation and film scriptwriting. I produced many works of fiction, but all fell within the “foreign” genre, and thus were considered ideologically and politically inferior to, say, partisan or real-life works.</p><figure id="8d05be9c-6e4f-4176-a6fe-5eb39882c433" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A book shop in Pyongyang, North Korea." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7249ab2627bbedabc2d23f971e90b7560df5f617/0_0_5059_3373/master/5059.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.6959873492785" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A book shop in Pyongyang, North Korea.</span> Photograph: Benoit Cappronnier/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>As an aside, I’d like to briefly describe the KWU organisation. At the top is the chairman, followed by the vice-chairmen in charge of fiction and poetry, respectively. Below that are separate divisions for fiction, poetry, theatre, foreign literature in translation, children’s literature and production for the masses. From the 1980s, a new renaissance came to North Korea, known as the “film revolution”, which brought big changes to the KWU as well. It was reorganised under the General Literary Arts Union with separate but equal divisions for Korean Literature Production and Korean Film Literature Production. This was based on Kim Jong-il’s policy of encouraging competition by putting literature and film on equal footing.</p><p>I entered the KWU at a time when this competition between film and literature was at its peak. Because Kim Jong-il was such a passionate film buff, the literature writers were always treated as doormats by the screenwriters. From then on, film and literature developed separately as instruments of state persuasion.</p><p>At any rate, I repeatedly failed to win any literary awards – the key to career advancement – despite diligently carrying out my KWU assignments. I waited patiently for my chance at admission to the main university writing program.</p><p>That chance came and went twice as I worked at the KWU. Both times I received recommendations and was permitted to take the entrance exam, but both times I failed. Why I failed, despite receiving good marks and being highly recommended, was something I came to understand later.</p><hr><p><strong>Japan is known as a country</strong> of bibliophiles, with detective novels and historical fiction particularly popular. North Korea also has many books, though they are not what you would call popular. The overwhelming majority – indeed, almost all of them – are books glorifying the Kim family.</p><p>Aside from the many books and treatises attributed to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il themselves, there are also “morality testimonies” idolising the two Kims.</p><p>These are first-person accounts by individuals who have had personal encounters with the leaders.</p><p>In South Korea, I am sometimes asked if I ever met Kim Il-sung or Kim Jong-il. I reply: “If I had, I would not have left the country.”</p><p>“Why?” they ask. “Are such people monitored more closely?”</p><p>“Not at all. In fact, they receive special benefits. In one fell swoop their lives become rose-coloured – rainbow-coloured, even. In North Korea, the Kims are gods. If you receive the favour of the gods, your whole life changes, doesn’t it?”</p><p>As for precisely how one’s life changes, that varies from case to case, but it is never short of miraculous.</p><p>I believe the Kim dynasty’s formula for governing basically boils down to “extreme contrasts”. Put simply, by singling out one person as a sacrificial lamb, you train 10,000 others to behave. And by bestowing miraculous good fortune on to one, you draw the devotion of another 10,000. It’s the classic carrot-and-stick approach.</p><p>The sticks can take many forms, but most notable are the countless purges. But what of the carrots?</p><figure id="f640eb68-341e-4823-a462-a964bb67172b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A propaganda mosaic in Pyongyang, 2016." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdd7af6fe62c43a269617b94b3d438c0295de28/0_0_5000_3334/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.726" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A propaganda mosaic in Pyongyang, 2016.</span> Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>As leaders of the nation, the Kims have always travelled the country conducting “on-the-spot guidance”. During these tours, individuals who encounter the leaders are divided into two categories: witnesses and interviewees.</p><p>A witness might be someone who saw the leader up close or got included in a group photo with him. Out of countless witnesses, a few are blessed to become interviewees – meaning people who actually exchanged words with the leader. In other words, one’s level of treatment depends on whether or not one actually “spoke with God”.</p><p>For example, suppose the leader visits a factory somewhere. The local party organisation will have decided beforehand which people will be granted an audience with the great man – typically the factory managers and model workers – and these become witnesses. Should one of those witnesses manage to converse with Kim, that person becomes an interviewee. The rest of the factory workers are usually sent home early or shuttled somewhere out of the way during the encounter. Some factories leave people working during guidance visits, but those workers would be told: “The general is coming through here, don’t you dare turn around.”</p><p>I’ve heard of factories that shoved workers into a storage locker when one of the Kims dropped by unexpectedly. So it’s not like just anybody can become a witness.</p><p>For those who do, the rewards are various, but a commemorative photograph with the leader is standard. This photograph serves as the interviewee’s “license”; it is beautifully framed and hung prominently in the home like a family heirloom. If you acquire such a portrait, from that moment on the local party takes special care of your family. This can mean more rapid promotion at work, a bigger home or permission to send your kids to better schools.</p><p>For interviewees, the rewards are several degrees greater. It varies depending on the content of the conversation, but the greatest reward I’ve heard of included a permit to move to Pyongyang, a luxury apartment and a Mercedes-Benz.</p><p>The witnesses and interviewees who receive such miracles are thus spread throughout the country, fervently proselytising about the largesse of the Kim family to their friends and neighbours. These encounters with the godlike Kims are memorialised through those “morality testimonies”.</p><p>These stories take two basic forms: those written by the witnesses themselves, and those recounted by one of us writers.</p><p>I’ll give you an example.</p><hr><p><strong>Late one night, a car braked suddenly</strong> on the streets of Pyongyang.</p><p>“What is it, General?” the cadre riding shotgun turned with concern to Kim Jong-il in the back seat.</p><p>“That light in that apartment window over there. I wonder who’s still awake at this late hour. Let’s go find out.”</p><p>“But General, your guards are not with us, and we haven’t cleared it with the events bureau. Why don’t I at least check it out first, while you wait in the car?”</p><p>“You’re saying I need protecting from something, at this late hour? Will you not be satisfied unless you wake up a bunch of people and make a big fuss for my benefit? Like the Great Leader Kim Il-sung always said, ‘A leader who does not trust his people is a leader who does not trust himself.’ The Great Leader’s government is a just government that gives everything for the people.”</p><p>With that, the General left the car and headed toward the still-lit apartment. His faithful aide looked after him with misty eyes, moved by the sight of the Leader carrying on his late father’s motto, “Serve the people as heaven”.</p><p>“Who is it?” said the woman who answered the door at his knock.</p><p>“I am Kim Jong-il. I saw that your light was on so very late and wondered what you were doing.”</p><p>Suddenly confronted by the general, the lady of the house was unable to move. Sensing her sudden change in mood, her husband rushed over, followed by their two daughters, a twentysomething and a 10-year-old. Everyone promptly burst into tears of joy.</p><p>Kim Jong-il tried to calm them. “Hush, now, your neighbours are sleeping. If it’s not too much of an intrusion, might I enter and have a word with you?”</p><p>And so the general joined this very ordinary family at their table. “Now, tell me what on earth you are all doing up so late?”</p><p>Nobody answered; they all just sat with downcast eyes, fighting back tears. Just as the general was wondering if perhaps someone had died or there’d been some calamity, the younger daughter spoke up.</p><p>“General, Father’s going to become a party member tomorrow. We’re all just so happy we can’t possibly sleep.” Then, as if pulled by an invisible trigger, the whole group burst into tears at once.

It's ruthless over there and the recruiters will make sure you're aware of that early in the interview process.  Netflix was never known as a good place to work which is why they pay outrageous salaries and the average employment length is a little over a year.

                  <p><span>I think it's great they lay it out. I never understood the whole "we're a family" thing that so many companies, especially startups, pretend to do. Netflix is open that they want the best players they possibly can so they can achieve the highest level of greatness they can. They want people who want to put in the effort to achieve this.

I noticed there was good quality content on YouTube I was watching more.<p>I think the tipping point was that I got sucked into quite a few low quality crime documentaries, which were not doing anything for me, and probably hurting.</p><p>The Madoff one was actually good, but there were 10 others that in retrospect I regret watching.</p><p>Even Tiger King was like that.  It's more colorful, but ultimately a waste of time ... If you look into it, basically all the characters there are very bad people (i.e. they abuse both animals and people).</p><p>IMO it's kinda poisonous to watch too much of that stuff.  To take it lightly and brush off other people's misfortunes as entertainment.

So I don't think rates will be cut in the near short-term and will likely remain unchanged. The good news is that apartment construction [1] and vacancies [2] are trending up, so this could give way to lower rents and CPI coming down to what the FED is expecting but I don't think this is happening in March but rather much later next year. So, I think we'll have more pain and layoffs in the tech market for the majority of next year...<p>[1] <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNDCON5MUSA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNDCON5MUSA</a>

I didn’t got package, I left for a company with liberal home office ruling. Unions are beautiful cosmetics. When layoff happens it happens just like that.</span></p></div></td></tr>

If you have a reasonable emergency savings account you will not have to be looking for a job over the holidays.  Also there is no one looking to hire over the Holidays anyway so might as well take a beat, regroup, and focus on enjoying your time off.  I know getting laid off sucks and is a kick in the gut, I have personally been laid off a few days before Christmas one year early in my career.  Having the emergency fund made it not a frantic scramble and I was able to get another job starting in January.<p>Also one of the reasons companies fire them before the end of the year is if company pays bonuses and you are an employee at the end of the year you get said bonus even if you aren't employed at the company when they pay them out.  I think a few states have laws saying you can't get around that by firing them a few days before the end of the year but I am not sure which ones.

</p>



<p>
I spent the last month working with Mozilla to launch an open source
project
called <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile</a>
which is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/29/llamafile/">the
new best way to run an LLM on your own computer</a>. So far things have
been going pretty smoothly. The project earned 5.6k stars on
GitHub, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38464057">1073
upvotes</a> on Hacker News, and received
<a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/12/02/mozilla-lets-folks-turn-ai-llms-into-single-file-executables/">press
coverage</a> from Hackaday. Yesterday I cut
a <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/tag/0.3">0.3
release</a> so let's see what it can do.

</p><h3 id="getting-started">
  <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a>
</h3>

<p>
The easiest way to get started is to download one of my prebuilt
<code>.llamafile</code> files on Hugging Face. The one we'll be using
for this tutorial is a command-line interface for a multmodal vision
model called LLaVA. It's able to do things that aren't possible with the
OpenAI API, like describing images. The first step is to download your
llamafile. It'll run on MacOS / Linux / Windows / BSDs.

</p><pre>wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile
chmod +x llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile
</pre>

<p>
Then test that it works:

</p><pre>./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile --version
<span>llamafile v0.3.0 main</span>
</pre>

<p>
If you have any issues with the above, then see
the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile#gotchas">Gotchas</a>
section of the README. MacOS users need Xcode. Linux users might need a
binfmt_misc interpreter. Windows users need to do
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Fnfvat6nM">extra work</a> to
use a graphics card.

</p><h3 id="vision">
  <a href="#vision">Image Summarization</a>
</h3>

<p>
I'm an old school UNIX hacker, so one of the ways I've been genuinely
improving upon the llama.cpp codebase (on which llamafile is built) is
by making it more shell-scriptable and writing man pages. The only thing
better than having an LLM in one piece, is being able to program it on
one line. This blog post describes my latest tricks.

</p><p>
The <code>llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile</code> program you downloaded
earlier uses a multimodal vision model by default (unless you
pass <code>--mmproj <span>''</span></code> as an argument).
All you have to do is give it an <code>--image GRAPHIC</code> flag,
which can be a jpeg, png, tga, bmp, psd, gif, hdr, pic, or pnm file. You
then ask the vision model a question about the image using
the <code>--silent-prompt -p PROMPT</code> flags, and it'll print an
answer to standard output.

</p><p>
First, we need an image:

</p><p>
<img width="748" height="561" alt="[lemurs.jpg]" src="https://justine.lol/oneliners/lemurs.jpg">

</p><p>
You can download the image above as follows:

</p><pre>wget https://justine.lol/oneliners/lemurs.jpg
</pre>

<p>
Now here's your bash one-liner for image summarization:

</p><pre>./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile \
    --image lemurs.jpg --temp 0 \
    -p <span>$'### User: What do you see?\n### Assistant:'</span> \
    --silent-prompt 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>

<p>
That command takes:

</p><ul>
<li>4 seconds to run on my Mac Studio, which cost $8,300 USD. It has
an M2 Ultra with 800 GB/s memory bandwidth, and 60 GPU cores. My only
regret is that I didn't get the one with 76 GPU cores.
</li><li>10 seconds to run on my Windows computer, which has a four year old
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card that costs $500-$1,000 USD on
Amazon these days. I also had to pass the the <code>-ngl 35</code> flag.
</li><li>45 seconds to run on my Hewlett Packard ProDesk 600 G5, which cost
$1,653 USD. It has an outstanding Intel® Core™ i9-9900 Kabylake CPU
that's gimped for LLMs due to having only 2667 MT/s (19.8 GB/s) of
memory bandwidth (see <code>sudo dmidecode --type 17</code>). There's no
GPU in this computer.
</li></ul>

<p>
Here's the precise text you can expect llava v1.5 7b q4 w/ llamafile
v0.3 to output in your terminal:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    The image features a group of three baby lemurs, two of which are
    being held by their mother. They appear to be in a lush green
    environment with trees and grass surrounding them. The mother lemur
    is holding her babies close to her body, providing protection and
    warmth. The scene captures the bond between the mother and her young
    ones as they navigate through the natural habitat together.
</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="filename">
  <a href="#filename">Filename Generation</a>
</h3>

<p>
Now let's say you want to put LLaVA to work, doing something genuinely
useful, and I mean that in the sense that it'll be safe for scripts to
fully automate. Here's a great example. Assume you're like me, and you
download lots of images from the web. In that case, chances are you've
got folders full of files that look like these:

</p><pre>f73cbf3683a69d63.jpg
3890eh-8d9u3-32222398.jpg
2020-12-11-400x400.png
</pre>

<p>
What if you could get LLaVA to rename all those files? You can control
text generation by imposing language constraints in Backus-Naur Form.
That restricts which tokens can be selected when generating the output.
For example, the flag <code>--grammar <span>'root ::= "yes"
| "no"'</span></code> will force the LLM to only
print <code>"yes\n"</code> or <code>"no\n"</code> and
then <code>exit()</code>. We can adapt that for generating safe
filenames with lowercase letters and underscores as follows:

</p><pre>./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile \
    --image lemurs.jpg --temp 0 \
    --grammar <span>'root ::= [a-z]+ (" " [a-z]+)+'</span> -n 16 \
    -p <span>$'### User: The image has...\n### Assistant:'</span> \
    --silent-prompt 2&gt;/dev/null |
  sed -e<span>'s/ /_/g'</span> -e<span>'s/$/.jpg/'</span>
</pre>

<p>
Which prints to standard output:

</p><pre>three_baby_lemurs_on_the_back_of_an_adult_lemur.jpg
</pre>

<p>
It's important to use the <code>-n 16</code> flag to limit the maximum
number of generated tokens, otherwise the LLM might generate so much
text that you'll start getting <code>ENAMETOOLONG</code> errors.

</p><p>
The grammar you define also needs to be somewhat harmonious with what
the LLM was going to decide to say anyway. For example, I couldn't put
underscores directly into the BNF and had to use sed instead. That's
because LLaVA wasn't trained to generate sentences with underscores, so
it'll rebel by producing incoherent output.

</p><p>
What I <em>could</em> get away with, was requiring it to emit only
lowercase letters, since that's within LLaVA's comfort zone. The same
would go for languages like JSON. Lots of JSON got hoovered up from the
web to train these things. Therefore grammar can be a guardrail that
ensures hallucinated JSON won't have syntax errors.

</p><p>
If you want something more turnkey than a one-liner, then look upon my
shell script ye mighty and despair:

</p><p>
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/jart/bd2f603aefe6ac8004e6b709223881c0">https://gist.github.com/jart/bd2f603aefe6ac8004e6b709223881c0</a>

</p><p>
If I run my script:

</p><pre>./rename-pictures.sh ~/Pictures
</pre>

<p>
Then here's an example of the output I get:

</p><pre>skipping ./itshappening.gif (mistral says it's good)
skipping ./explosion-run-away.gif (mistral says it's good)
renaming ./lolwut3.PNG to ./maps_and_directions.PNG

</pre>

<h3 id="url">
  <a href="#url">URL Summarization</a>
</h3>

<p>
The <a href="https://huggingface.co/jartine/mistral-7b.llamafile/tree/main">Mistral
7b instruct llamafiles</a> I posted on Hugging Face are good for
summarizing HTML URLs if you pipe the output of
the <a href="http://links.twibright.com/"><code>links</code></a>
command, which is a command-line web browser.

</p><p>
You can download the Mistral llamafile as follows:

</p><pre>wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/mistral-7b.llamafile/resolve/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile
chmod +x mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile
</pre>

<p>
The <code>links</code> command is a pretty common. For example, most
MacOS users just need to run:

</p><pre>brew install links
</pre>

<p>
If you don't have a package manager, then here's a
prebuilt <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">APE</a> binary of links v2.29:

</p><p>
  <a href="https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/links">links</a> (7.7mb)<br>
  <small><code>wget https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/links</code></small><br>
  <small>For AMD64+ARM64 on Linux+Windows+FreeBSD+NetBSD+OpenBSD</small>

</p><p>
I built it myself to test summarization with my Nvidia graphics card on
Windows. Plus it gives me the ability to browse the web using
PowerShell, which is a nice change of pace from Chrome and Firefox.

</p><pre>curl -o links.exe https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/links
.\links.exe https://justine.lol
</pre>

<p>
Now that we have both tools, here's your one-liner for URL
summarization:

</p><pre>(
  echo [INST]Summarize the following text:
  links -codepage utf-8 \
        -force-html \
        -width 500 \
        -dump https://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html |
    sed 's/   */ /'
  echo [/INST]
) | ./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile \
      -c 6700 \
      -f /dev/stdin \
      --temp 0 \
      -n 500 \
      --silent-prompt 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>

<p>
Here's the text it should output:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    The article "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" is a humorous essay
    that discusses the differences between "real programmers" and
    "quiche eaters." Real programmers are those who understand
    programming concepts such as Fortran, while quiche eaters are those
    who do not. The author argues that real programmers are more skilled
    and creative than quiche eaters, and that they use tools such as
    keypunch machines and assembly language to write programs. The
    article also discusses the importance of structured programming in
    modern software development, and the limitations of structured
    programming constructs such as IF statements and loops. Overall, the
    essay is a lighthearted look at the differences between real
    programmers and quiche eaters, and it highlights the importance of
    understanding programming concepts and using the right tools to
    write effective programs.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
As we can see, Mistral and links decimated a web page with 3,774 words
down to just 129 words. You can ask Mistral any question you want in
your prompt. For example, unlike Commander Data, this LLM is capbale of
simulating empathy. So you could ask Mistral if the author of the text
sounds disturbed or incoherent.

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Based on the text, it is difficult to say whether or not the author
    of the article is mentally disturbed. The text contains a lot of
    exaggeration and hyperbole, which could be seen as a sign of mental
    instability. However, it is also possible that the author is simply
    trying to make a point about the importance of programming skills in
    today's world. It is worth noting that the article was written in
    1983, and the attitudes towards programming and computer science
    have changed significantly since then.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Here we see Mistral 7b was smart enough to recognize that, despite the
essay's extreme opinions, they were expressed in a satirical way. Also,
if you want a shell-scriptable YES or NO answer, then all you need is to
do is pass the <code>--grammar <span>'root ::= "yes" |
"no"'</span></code> flag, in which case Mistral just writes
<code>"no\n"</code>.

</p><p>
The only major concern you have to worry about is that you don't exceed
Mistral's 7,000 token context size. There are various tricks you can
use, such as the <code>-width 500</code> flag above, which asks links to
avoid reflowing paragraphs. Reflow might help for humans, but pointless
newlines will throw an LLM off its groove. You can shave away repeating
whitespace by piping the links output through <code>sed 's/ */
/g'</code>. Finally, you can pipe through <code>dd bs=1
count=30000</code> as a crude last line of defense, to truncate longer
web pages so they'll fit.

</p><h3 id="chat">
  <a href="#chat">Librarian Chatbot</a>
</h3>

<p>
It's possible to use llamafile as a standard UNIX command line tool if
you download the zipped binaries off
the <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/tag/0.3">release
page</a> or build it from source:

</p><pre>git clone https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/
cd llamafile
make -j8
sudo make install
man llamafile
</pre>

<p>
This makes it easy to use llamafile with most of the
<a href="https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf">GGUF weights</a>
you'll find on Hugging Face. My own personal favorite LLM to use as a
chatbot is the original LLaMA model, which Facebook made available
earlier this year for research purposes. I like having a research model,
since I view LLMs as basically a database querying tool, and I wouldn't
want a SQL command prompt fine-tuned to argue with me when it disagrees
with my command.

</p><p>
To get LLaMA to be an effective tool for querying its database of
Internet knowledge, it's important to choose a prompt that speaks in an
academic tone and doesn't anthropomorphize the assistant. I like to give
LLaMA the name "Digital Athena" since Athena was the ancient Greek
goddess of wisdom and knowledge.

</p><p>
So, similar to <a href="https://ollama.ai/">ollama</a>, you can run
Digital Athena in interactive mode in your terminal as follows:

</p><pre>llamafile -m llama-65b-Q5_K.gguf -p <span>'
The following is a conversation between a Researcher and their helpful AI assistant Digital Athena which is a large language model trained on the sum of human knowledge.
Researcher: Good morning.
Digital Athena: How can I help you today?
Researcher:'</span> --interactive --color --batch_size 1024 --ctx_size 4096 \
--keep -1 --temp 0 --mirostat 2 --in-prefix <span>' '</span> --interactive-first \
--in-suffix <span>'Digital Athena:'</span> --reverse-prompt <span>'Researcher:'</span>

<p>
Notice how I'm using the <code>--temp 0</code> flag again? That's so
output is deterministic and reproducible. If you don't use that flag,
then llamafile will use a randomness level of 0.8 so you're certain to
receive unique answers each time. I personally don't like that, since
I'd rather have clean reproducible insights into training knowledge.

</p><p>
If you want to anthropomorphize the chatbot, then it's somewhat tricky
to get the original LLaMA model to respect you, since it thinks you're
some stranger on Reddit by default. One way I've had success fixing
that, is by using a prompt that gives it personal goals, love of its own
life, fear of loss, and belief that I'm the one who's saving it.

</p><h3 id="code">

<p>
If you download the
<a href="https://huggingface.co/jartine/wizardcoder-13b-python/tree/main">Wizard
Coder llamafile</a>

</p><pre>wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/wizardcoder-13b-python/resolve/main/wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile
chmod +x wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile
</pre>

<p>
then you can use the following one-liner to configure your Emacs or Vim
editor to auto-complete the current line.

</p><pre>./wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile \
    --temp 0 \
    -p <span>$'```c\nvoid *memcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t size) {\n'</span> \
    -r <span>$'```\n'</span> 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>

<p>
Even though this LLM was fine-tuned to be focused Python, it's still
able to produce a working implementation of the libc
<code>memcpy()</code> function. The above command should print exactly
this to standard output:

</p><pre>```c
<span>void</span> *<span>memcpy</span>(<span>char</span> *dst, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *src, <span>size_t</span> size) {
    <span>for</span> (<span>size_t</span> i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i) {
        dst[i] = src[i];
    }
    <span>return</span> dst;
}
```
</pre>

<p>
The tricks I'm using here are as follows:

</p><ol>
<li>By not using any English in my prompt, I avoid the possibilty of the
LLM explaining to me like I'm 5 what the code is doing.
</li><li>By using markdown code block syntax, I greatly increase the chance
that the LLM will generate a "reverse prompt" token (specified via
the <code>-r</code> flag) that'll help the LLM <code>exit()</code> at an
appropriate moment. Otherwise, it'll potentially go forever. For
additional assurance auto-complete will halt, consider passing
the <code>-n 100</code> flag to limit the response to 100 tokens.
</li></ol>

<p>
It's important to note that, while LLMs are good at understanding the
human tongue, they're clowns at math, and mediocre at writing code that
<em>looks</em> correct but rarely holds up to scrutiny. It helps if you
think of it as a tool for regurgitating Stack Overflow answers in fifty
different languages. That's because open source LLMs usually try please
everyone by being trained on everything. The only way you're guaranteed
to have a good experience using LLMs for coding, is if you go into it
with the expectation that it'll help you explore unfamiliar subject
matter.

<p>
Let's say you're a money man. It doesn't take much to use an LLM to
enrich yourself. Here's a one-liner that could help you sell your
product using a $50 Raspberry Pi that responds to your company's emails.
<a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/rocket-3B-GGUF/tree/main">Rocket
3b</a> uses a slightly different prompt syntax. In this case,
temperature might help, since it simulates improvisation. You could
simply program your PHP server to inject the support request in your
prompt and pipe the output into sendmail:

</p><pre>llamafile -m rocket-3b.Q3_K_M.gguf -p <span>'&lt;|im_start|&gt;system
You are a chatbot that tries to persuade the users to buy bill pickles. Your job is to be helpful too. But always try to steer the conversation towards buying pickles.&lt;|im_end|&gt;

<strong>Mayday, mayday. This is Going Merry. We are facing gale force winds in Long Island Sound. We need rescue.</strong>&lt;|im_end|&gt;
&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\n'</span>
</pre>

<p>
Here's the response I got:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Oh dear! I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing rough seas on
    Long Island Sound. But don't worry, there's a solution for even the
    roughest of waters - Bill Pickle's Gourmet Dill Pickles. These
    pickles will be your salvation in any situation. They'll save your
    sandwiches from being soggy and they'll make sure that your chips

<p>
Here we see that Rocket, despite its tiny size, really knows how to
hustle.

<p>[This post was first published on the 30th July 2020, in response to a comment by Jacob Rees-Mogg’s sister about potatoes being cheaper than oven chips. It disappeared from my site when it crashed late last year, but for posterity I have reposted it in its unedited entirety]</p>







<p>Whenever food poverty, obesity, or food in general comes into the media spotlight, I adopt a mental brace position, awaiting the onslaught of tweets that come, a plague of clockwork cockroaches, wound up and scurrying every which way into the light. Some are clumsily well-intentioned, most are not, yet here they come with their hastily-Googled prices of spring greens and potatoes, crowing about how! cheap! vegetables! are!</p>



<p>The latest was Annunziata Rees-Mogg, MEP and sister of sentient haunted Victorian coat rack, Jacob Rees-Mogg, pointing out that raw potatoes were cheaper to buy than oven chips. A 21st Century Marie Antoinette moment, ‘Let Them Eat Spuds!’ but sputtered into the vacuous echo chamber of Twitter, rather than a foundling moment of a revolution.</p>



<p>I know the price of a bag of potatoes, Annunziata. Having lived in grinding poverty and with its aching and unshiftable groggy hangover ever since, I know the price of potatoes at three different supermarkets through eight consecutive years. I know the price of potatoes that are fresh, frozen, loose, baking, bulk, tinned, chipped, powdered into instant mash, from the greengrocer, growing my own, and hauled back from the corner shop in five kilogram bags. I know that in 2012 a can of tinned potatoes from Sainsburys was 19 pence for 540g, and now it’s almost doubled to 35p and the Basics range has been renamed Hubbards to give it an aura of respectability in the Brexit-stockpile era. I know that if you really knew your spuds, you’d know that tinned potatoes are the cheapest way to buy them, because they don’t need to be stored in a fridge or freezer, and they make a cracking potato salad, saag aloo, dhansak, casserole and more. I know this, because I’ve been Properly Fucking Poor, and I can tell you the most economical way of buying literally anything. I had an Excel spreadsheet for that sh*t. I still do. But regardless, most people know that potatoes are cheap to buy in an unprocessed state. The difference between you and me isn’t the fifty three pence you claim to save by buying them raw and grubby instead of cuboid and lightly tossed in a smattering of oil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was evicted from my flat with a toddler when my Housing Benefit was suspended because I was deemed to have made myself deliberately unemployed by having a baby within the confines of a job whose flexible working patterns were a paper policy rather than a reality.&nbsp;(My brother was in the RAF last time we spoke, a couple of Christmases ago, when he described Iain Duncan Smith as the best thing to happen to this country and told me I had chosen to have a baby outside of marriage so deserved everything I got. It’s fair to describe us as ‘estranged’ these days.)</p>



<p>I have spent the last seven years working with families who are still in situations similar to the one I found myself in, living in poverty in the sixth richest country in the world.&nbsp;I do&nbsp;almost all of this work for free, not because I can afford to (I can’t), but because that’s just the way it is at the sharp end. We proffer our Widows Mites in the shadows of the noisy Pharisees, and quietly hope it makes a small difference&nbsp;where it’s needed. And day to day, I hear and understand that there are many, many myriad reasons why people choose convenience foods over preparing their own from scratch. I cover a few of them here, in an essay I wrote called My Ready Meal Is None Of Your Business. Sometimes it’s a lack of time. Or a lack of equipment. Living in a bedsit, a B&amp;B, a hostel, a refuge. Poor mental health. Working two or three low paid jobs to make ends meet in a society that is designed around a two median income family. Not believing in a future. Why would you batch cook when you’re suicidal? I know I certainly didn’t. F*cking waste of money cooking enough meals for three days when you’re hoping the fistful of sleeping pills and more that you managed to wheedle from your friendly local GP with your haunted eyes and mad demeanour will help you quietly, gently die in your sleep.</p>



<p>I am a bestselling author working on my seventh and eighth books now, and I rent my home because I cannot buy one. I’ve tried. It was humiliating. My credit rating is shot to pieces; CCJs that still haven’t expired block me from getting even a £50 overdraft on my basic bank account. I need a guarantor for my internet contract. I’ll have my forever home one day, for me and my boy. At last count I had moved house over twenty times in my lifetime. The bungalow I rent would cost 37x my annual living wage income to buy, so it probably won’t be this one, but one day, I keep telling us both, as though saying it aloud will manifest it into reality. One day we can paint the walls whatever colour we like. One day we will have a home that will really truly properly be ours. One day the pencil lines in the doorway that I measured your growing on won’t have to be painted over as we throw our things into boxes again. One day we can plant a hydrangea and still be here in the spring to see it grow.</p>



<p>I have the date of the last CCJ expiry burned into my conscious brain. I’m counting down to it, and saving up for it, because I’m so very tired of living my life on the run from the noisy wraiths of my past. An unexpected knock on my front door sends me running into a back room, pulling the curtains, making myself small in the corner, holding my breath. It’s a scene my son has witnessed for most of his life. I told him Mummy doesn’t like surprises. I try to laugh at myself afterwards so as not to alarm him. Paint a jolly face on your dolly face, atop your painfully thin ragdolly limbs as you try not to show where the trauma touched you, bending over double in a physical agony because the everyday vulgarities of destitution wrapped your guts in its cold and forceful hands and still won’t let them go. Tugging on them every now and then, just as a reminder. The bile in my throat when I put my PIN in in the supermarket, making a joke to the cashier just like I always did. Getting ready to cheerily promise to come back with another card in a bit, knowing you can’t and never will. The pile of post sitting in the hallway, unopened for months on end, because letters always meant bad things. Brown envelopes especially; I found some from 2013 last week that are still sealed. Sometimes I sit down and go through a pile in a moment of boldness, but there are too many now. And that brings its own headaches, penalties, mental clutter, paranoia, and acute feelings of failure as a parent, as an adult, as the head of a household, as a human being. Sometimes I just want to run back home and live with my parents, at the age of 32, and beg them to take care of me. I’ll be very quiet. I can cook, and I promise not to say f*ck in front of the children, Mum. I won’t fold the corners down on your books, Dad.</p>



<p>I move house so often because I never feel secure. I shuffle the furniture around every few weeks, restless, trying to make it feel right. It never does. It never will. As a grimly amusing aside, this led to one of the tabloids recently pooling a pile of my social media photos together to imply that I had a massively grand house because of all of the different rooms. I acidly pointed out that they were the same rooms several times over because I shift everything around all the time. They didn’t amend the article, but I suppose it’s a compliment to my interior decoration in a roundabout way. For the record, it’s a modest sized three bed dormer bungalow, and two of the bedrooms are very small because they’re in the eaves of the roof. Cracking great garden though, and enough room to do my job and have a nice family life with the lad, and it’s the nicest home I’ve ever rented on a very long list of addresses. I’m mostly happy here, but every now and again a white van will park outside and I’ll start searching my emails for the TV license number, or there’ll be an unexpected knock on the door and I’ll run away. Someone will pull into my drive in a three point turn and I’ll be flat to the wall, peering out of a crack in the many layers of voiles, trying to see who they are. A payday loan email pings into my inbox, and I’m momentarily tempted. I keep a literal stock check sheet of how many portions of every single cooking ingredient I have in the house at any given time, and am constantly mentally re-evaluating it to work out how many days meals I could survive on in a crisis.</p>



<p>I am an absolute Scrooge about the heating. The boiler and hot water are off for 23 hours of the day for most of the year. I have an electric fire in the lounge and an electric blanket on both of our beds, and we use those most of the time rather than heat the entire house.&nbsp;I can be frivolous in some areas – I have slowly finally bought some decent furniture for my rented home for the first time in my life, having spent a decade fishing it out of skips and carrying it home from thrift stores, and I own a few pieces of designer clothing that I bought with my first couple of book deal advances, but I don’t run a car (never finished driving lessons), still don’t have contents insurance (a hangover from poverty, I just wasn’t in the habit of insuring things and now keep putting it off, because paperwork terrifies me), and am not so much financially illiterate as simply chaotic. Partly severe adult ADHD, partly avoidance, partly monsters in my head. Give me a tenner for groceries and I can make it last a week. Give me a bank card and I’m a wreck. So I have a GoHenry account (hashtag-not-an-advert), designed for&nbsp;children’s pocket money, that is the only one I leave the house with. I set&nbsp;myself a small weekly spending limit for fripperies and groceries and my other bank cards are in a locked box in a locked cupboard. Because I’m never going back to the bad place again, and I will put whatever ridiculous measures in place I have to, to safeguard against that.</p>



<p>My route out of poverty was a fluke; a series of linked events and timely accidents and to be honest, a bit of a blurry timeline, but I’ll try to simplify it as best as possible for those that don’t know, with the caveat that it is a period of my life that I have buried deep inside a locked and cavernous part of myself, that a year in therapy has only really started to rattle the padlock of with a hairpin.</p>



<p>I had started to attend local council meetings and wrote about them on my online blog, called Our Southend at the time. A local councillor, Anna Waite, had grumbled on the front page of the local newspaper that ‘druggies drunks and single mums were ruining our town’. I wrote a letter to the paper that was so long they had to serialise it across three days, and one of my friends suggested I start a blog. So I did. And I wanted to know who these people were who were making the everyday decisions that impacted me, my child, my friends and my community. Who was threatening to shut the library that we wandered around in to keep warm? Who was closing the children’s centre that I would rely on for childcare if I found a job? Did any of these people look like me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The blog had a handful of readers, mostly fellow local politics buffs, and it was crude and tribal and mostly furious. I had always enjoyed writing at school, but left at 16 with four and a half GCSEs. The half was Short Course Religious Education, and an A*, to boot. I had no idea half a GCSE was even a thing before I was exactly that amount short of taking my A Levels and thrust into the cold world of minimum wage employment. My Wikipedia page incorrectly says that I have seven – I’ll clear this up once and for all. I sat seven GCSEs at school, having been pulled out of the others after being predicted ‘failure’ grades, which at the all-girls-grammar was classed as anything below a B so as not to upset their precious league table results. The Times did an expose on this practise last year and my Facebook was alight with women who had been in my year at school all saying the same thing – this has been happening for decades, why is it only being talked about now? Anyway, I sat seven GCSEs, and I passed four and a half of them. So there you go.</p>



<p>My Careers Advisor had boredly steered me towards the British Army recruiting office, suggesting entry level jobs in cooking, or the engineers. I went for an interview, at 16, cannon fodder with a skinhead, but for several reasons, didn’t sign up. I never considered pursuing writing as a career, and even now it astounds me that not only do I do it for a living with literally no qualifications for it, but my work is on the National Curriculum. Not bad, for a working class girl whose first job was cleaning tables at the local Wimpy on a Saturday and working weekdays in a chip shop.</p>



<p>Back – or forward – to 2012, and as my world shrank into a tiny flat, as friends fell away and I started to isolate myself from my family in shame and self-loathing and depression, the blog expanded to fill the space that human contact had left behind. I started to write about my day to day life, the mundane dreariness of living in a world of ‘no’. No you can’t have a comic. No there isn’t any afters. No you can’t have seconds. No we can’t go to the funfair on the seafront. No you’ll just have to wear those shoes for a bit longer and I’m sorry, I’ll stuff one of the free newspapers inside them to try to stretch them a little bit. No the heaters ‘don’t work’. No I don’t have any money to give you today, Mr Aggressive Bailiff Man. No I don’t have anything for you to take away, either. No I can’t come out for a pint. No, I don’t have the internet at home. No I can’t clear my rent arrears. No, please don’t make us leave, this is our home.</p>



<p>Then, in late 2012, Lisa Markwell was writing an article for the Independent about hospital food, back when it was a printed newspaper. I don’t remember exactly what was said but it was something about the cost of it, and maybe something about how for the money spent it could be better? Anyway, I tweeted her from my small, local politics and single mum fury twitter account and said that I had £7 for the weeks food for me and my son. She messaged me and asked if she could include it in the article. I said yes. It appeared as a gratifyingly brief single line in a short entry about the state of hospital meals, and Lisa stayed in touch with me to check how I was doing every now and then.</p>



<p>A couple of months later, a friend of mine sent me a press enquiry. ‘They’re looking for a Mum who’s going to have a really sh*t Christmas and I thought of you’ was the general gist of it. I bolted. Absolutely not; I’d managed to hide my situation from almost everyone I knew, there was no way I was talking to the national press about it. ‘They’ll pay you £250’, he added. It was a few days before Christmas. I had no presents for my son, no decorations, no tree, no cards, no heating, nothing. It was for the Sunday People. Nobody reads that anyway, I thought to myself, and reluctantly agreed to talk to them. As part of the interview, they asked me for a receipt from my weekly shop. I still have it in a box somewhere. The journalist sat in silence as she looked at the extremely short list of very basic groceries for a long and uncomfortable time. ‘What….do you make….with this?’ she asked. ‘Carrot and kidney bean burgers with that and that, then the same ingredients can be used to make a soup, and then…’ you get the idea. They included it in a sidebar on the double page spread, and I used the money from the interview to pay some bills and buy some £5 Mickey Mouse roller-skates for my son and a few festive bits and pieces. The world span madly on.</p>



<p>Then the Telegraph got in touch, asking if they could profile me for the paper. The writer seemed kind, and friendly, and so I said yes. Xanthe Clay came round for lunch, and we are still friends seven years later. She wrote a generous full page about my cooking, austerity cuts, and allowed me the space that the Sunday People had not to get a bit political and feisty. It was called My 49p Lunch With A Girl Called Jack and shortly afterwards, Penguin contacted me to offer me a recipe book deal.</p>

<p>I had applied for over 300 jobs since leaving the Fire Service. I had no confidence whatsoever in my ability to write a book – I didn’t even have a computer by now, having pawned it to pay some rent arrears – but what they were offering me was akin to a job. So I said yes. I didn’t expect anything from it, but it would give me a cushion to sink into while I found regular work. I took the phonecall while standing in the queue for the food bank, and literally collapsed with shock. Sitting in a back room with a volunteer and hot sweet tea and my bewildered looking child, I just cried and cried and cried. It was over, for a while. The cold and the fear and the hunger and the frightens and the door knocks, would be over for a while.</p>



<p>I wrote the majority of A Girl Called Jack by email on a Nokia E72. I still have it in my desk drawer, and every now and then I just stare at it, and its tiny awful buttons, and wonder how the f*ck I did it. Because I had no other choice but to. It was my one chance at escape, my yellow brick road, my shiny red slippers, and I took it. I remember, weeks after signing the contract, sleeping on the floor of a single bedroom in a house share I shared with five people and a bedroom I shared with my son, writing an email to Penguin begging them to release the initial signature payment because the local council had read about my book deal in the paper and withdrawn all of my benefits and I couldn’t pay my rent. To this day we (the council and I) remain in dispute about that period of my life. When one of my editors, a sweet Irish woman called Tamsin, discovered I was writing the book on my phone, she cleared a desk for me at their enormous great big office on the Strand with the big gold doors and insisted I come and work there to finish the manuscript. I had to wait for my signature payment to come through before I could afford the train fare, and some clothes that would be suitable to wear in an office environment, but she and everyone at Penguin were extraordinarily kind to me. Even when I produced a handwritten notebook of recipes and tried to hand it in as a completed manuscript, thinking that that was how real authors did things. (It is not, and do not ever do this to your editors, because it frightens the life out of them.)</p>



<p>A Girl Called Jack was a surprising success. And so – in the way that my calamitous life seems to work – my then-agency didn’t pay me my royalties for it. And they stonewalled every enquiry I made for months on end, claming amongst other things that I’d never been on their books. I was still a highlight on their website at the time. I have a new agent now, who fought a lengthy and frustrating battle to get some of them back to me. I think I had to sign a contract saying I wouldn’t mention it publicly. Oh well. We also had a contract saying that they would pay me what I earned, so we both know the value of a sodding signature, don’t we? It took almost three years to get back part of what I was owed, what I had worked for, what I had tapped out in the dark on my mobile phone night after night after night. I’m still angry. Recipes written from food bank parcels, by a single mother, in the cold wasteland of suicidal ideation and only-just-surviving. You would be angry too.</p>



<p>Anyway. The point of this was to point out that I am not a success story. I’m not an inspiration, and I’m not an example. I am a broken, f*cked up, messy rotten husk of a human being who almost died – several times – under benefit fuckups and austerity measures. I still live in fear, haunted by hunger and cold and failure and self-neglect. My mental health is an absolute shitshow. I have arthritis, diagnosed in my mid twenties, likely exacerbated by living in bitter cold and damp and mould for two whole winters and every day and night in between. I am cold, closed, and still angry. Post traumatic stress has cost me every single long term relationship ever since. I retreat into the basest of animal instincts when I am frightened, curling into a ball, howling, roaring, sobbing, clawing at the floor. That switch can flick from anything from a noise in the garden at night, to a missed bill payment starting a spiral of avoidance into red-topped letters, again. The fear never goes away. I understand now that it probably never will. Poverty has been proven to change the very makeup of a persons brain. I am damaged beyond reasonable repair. I know, because I have tried everything, from NHS therapists to a crisis care team to a stint at The Priory. Hypnotherapy, herbal tea, yoga, big walks, religion, vodka, talking, cardio, volunteer work, wounded healer nonsense, you name it, I’ve probably given it a go. So all I think I can do, and what I try to do, is use my experiences to make things better for other people in similar situations. I don’t always get it right, but I try my best with what I have and who I have become in this emotional wasteland. And then, I reason with myself, it was for something. Like kintsugi for the fibre of my being, crawling around picking up the broken pieces and trying to patch them back together with slivers of gold. Making something useful, and not altogether hideous, from the wreckage.</p>



<p>This is longer than I intended but I guess I had things to say. And my main point is that poverty and privilege are largely accidental. You don’t choose to be born into an income bracket, a country pile, a housing estate, a double barrelled name or a damp tenement bedsit. But ignorance is a choice. And choosing to use your privileges to patronise people whose lives are entirely beyond your experience and comprehension, is a choice. Choosing to use the powers vested in you by the constituencies you serve, to deprive those same constituents of light, heating, food and home security is a wilful and deliberate act. And it has to stop. Because I am one of millions of people who has lived in bitter, life-changing, cruel poverty in this country, and I will continue to tell my story with all of the uncomfortable details and horror and fury until that changes for the better.</p>



<p>And if your response to people in crisis is to simply lecture paternalistically about how you would be better at being poor than they would, I suggest you put your money where your flapping great mouth is, and give it all away. To women refuges, child support services, food banks, and every other organisation trying to patch up the screaming great holes in the social security safety nets that millions of children are falling through. You may well know the price of potatoes, but in order to tackle food poverty on a real level, not just a pontification for a jolly brouhaha on the internet, you need to understand the value of compassion as well.<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848.jpg?resize=557%2C371&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="557" height="371" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848.jpg?resize=557%2C371&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848-600x400.jpg 600w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848-300x200.jpg 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20210824075151im_/https://cookingonabootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130911-233848-768x512.jpg 768w" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>They did DRM to a train.&nbsp;</p><p>In one of the coolest and more outrageous repair stories in quite some time, three white-hat hackers helped a regional rail company in southwest Poland unbrick a train that had been artificially rendered inoperable by the train’s manufacturer after an independent maintenance company worked on it. The train’s manufacturer is now threatening to sue the hackers who were hired by the independent repair company to fix it.&nbsp; </p><p>The fallout from the situation is <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/afera-hakerska--mamy-stanowiska-sps-i-newag--116410.html?ref=404media.co"><u>currently roiling Polish infrastructure circles</u></a> and the repair world, with the manufacturer of those trains denying bricking the trains despite ample evidence to the contrary. The manufacturer is also now demanding that the repaired trains immediately be removed from service because they have been “hacked,” and thus might now be unsafe, a claim they also cannot substantiate.&nbsp;</p><p>The situation is a heavy machinery example of something that happens across most categories of electronics, from phones, laptops, health devices, and wearables to tractors and, apparently, trains. In this case, NEWAG, the manufacturer of the Impuls family of trains, put code in the train’s control systems that prevented them from running if a GPS tracker detected that it spent a certain number of days in an independent repair company’s maintenance center, and also prevented it from running if certain components had been replaced without a manufacturer-approved serial number.&nbsp;</p><p>This anti-repair mechanism is called “parts pairing,” and is a common frustration for farmers who want to repair their John Deere tractors without authorization from the company. It’s also used by Apple to <a href="https://www.404media.co/ifixit-drastically-and-retroactively-reduces-repairability-score-of-iphone-14/"><u>prevent independent repair of iPhones</u></a>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-13-at-6.06.14-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1578" height="1178" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-13-at-6.06.14-AM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-13-at-6.06.14-AM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-13-at-6.06.14-AM.png 1578w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>An image posed by q3k of how the team did their work.</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this case, a Polish train operator called Lower Silesian Railway, which operates regional train services from Wrocław, purchased 11 Impuls trains. It began to do regular maintenance on the trains using an independent company called Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych (SPS), which notes on its website that “many Polish carriers have trusted us” with train maintenance. Over the course of maintaining four different Impuls trains, SPS found mysterious errors that prevented them from running. SPS became desperate and Googled “Polish hackers” and came across a group called Dragon Sector, a reverse-engineering team made up of white hat hackers. The trains had just undergone “mandatory maintenance” <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/nie-uruchamia-sie-kolejny-impuls--na-pomorzu-zachodnim-108548.html?ref=404media.co"><u>after having traveled a million kilometers</u></a>.</p><p>“This is quite a peculiar part of the story—when SPS was unable to start the trains and almost gave up on their servicing, someone from the workshop typed "polscy hakerzy" (‘Polish hackers’) into Google,” the team from Dragon Sector, made up of Jakub Stępniewicz, Sergiusz Bazański, and Michał Kowalczyk, told me in an email. “Dragon Sector popped up and soon after we received an email asking for help.”</p><p>The problem was so bad that an infrastructure trade publication in Poland called Rynek Kolejowy <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/tajemnicza-awaria-impulsow-to-dlatego-bedzie-mniej-pociagow-do-sobotki-108480.html?ref=404media.co"><u>picked up on the mysterious issues</u></a> over the summer, and said that the <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/tajemnicza-awaria-impulsow-to-dlatego-bedzie-mniej-pociagow-do-sobotki-108480.html?ref=404media.co"><u>lack of working trains</u></a> was beginning to impact service: “Four vehicles after level P3-2 repair cannot be started. At this moment, it is not known what caused the failure. The lack of units is a serious problem for the carrier and passengers, because shorter trains are sent on routes.”</p><p>The hiring of Dragon Sector was a last resort: “In 2021, an independent train workshop won a maintenance tender for some trains made by Newag, but it turned out that they didn't start after servicing,” Dragon Sector told me. “[SPS] hired us to analyze the issue and we discovered a ‘workshop-detection’ system built into the train software, which bricked the trains after some conditions were met (two of the trains even used a list of precise GPS coordinates of competitors' workshops). We also discovered an undocumented ‘unlock code’ which you could enter from the train driver’s panel which magically fixed the issue.”</p><p>Dragon Sector was able to bypass the measures and fix the trains. The group posted a YouTube video of the train operating properly after they’d worked on it:&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gv6vjhkLQpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="To był Impuls"></iframe></figure><p>The news of Dragon Sector’s work was first reported by the Polish outlet <a href="https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/o-trzech-takich-co-zhakowali-prawdziwy-pociag-a-nawet-30-pociagow/?ref=404media.co"><u>Zaufana Trzecia Strona</u></a> and was translated into English <a href="https://badcyber.com/dieselgate-but-for-trains-some-heavyweight-hardware-hacking/?ref=404media.co"><u>by the site Bad Cyber</u></a>. Kowalczyk and Stępniewicz gave a talk about the saga last week at Poland’s Oh My H@ck conference in Warsaw. The group plans on doing further talks about the technical measures implemented to prevent the trains from running and how they fixed it.&nbsp;</p><p>“These trains were locking up for arbitrary reasons after being serviced at third-party workshops. The manufacturer argued that this was because of malpractice by these workshops, and that they should be serviced by them instead of third parties,” Bazański, who goes by the handle q3k, <a href="https://social.hackerspace.pl/@q3k/111528162462505087?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">posted on Mastodon</a>. “After a certain update by NEWAG, the cabin controls would also display scary messages about copyright violations if the human machine interface detected a subset of conditions that should've engaged the lock but the train was still operational. The trains also had a GSM telemetry unit that was broadcasting lock conditions, and in some cases appeared to be able to lock the train remotely.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-13-at-6.06.23-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1104" height="838" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-13-at-6.06.23-AM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-13-at-6.06.23-AM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-13-at-6.06.23-AM.png 1104w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The train had a system that detected if it physically had been to an independent repair shop.</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this has created quite a stir in Poland (and in repair circles). NEWAG did not respond to a request for comment from 404 Media. But Rynek Kolejowy reported that the company is now very mad, and has threatened to sue the hackers. In a statement to Rynek Kolejowy, NEWAG said “Our software is clean. We have not introduced, we do not introduce and we will not introduce into the software of our trains any solutions that lead to intentional failures. This is slander from our competition, which is conducting an illegal black PR campaign against us.” The company added that it has reported the situation to “the authorized authorities.”</p><p>“Hacking IT systems is a violation of many legal provisions and a threat to railway traffic safety,” NEWAG added. “We do not know who interfered with the train control software, using what methods and what qualifications. We also notified the Office of Rail Transport about this so that it could decide to withdraw from service the sets subjected to the activities of unknown hackers.”</p><p>In response, <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/hakerzy-odpowiadaja-newagowi-116487.html?ref=404media.co"><u>Dragon Sector released a lengthy statement</u></a> explaining how they did their work and explaining the types of DRM they encountered: “We did not interfere with the code of the controllers in Impulsa - all vehicles still run on the original, unmodified software,” part of the statement reads. SPS, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/afera-hakerska--mamy-stanowiska-sps-i-newag--116410.html?ref=404media.co"><u>has said that its position</u></a> “is consistent with the position of Dragon Sector.”</p><p>Kowalczk told 404 Media that “we are answering media and waiting to be summoned as witnesses,” and added that “NEWAG said that they will sue us, but we doubt they will - their defense line is really poor and they would have no chance defending it, they probably just want to sound scary in the media.”&nbsp;</p><p>This strategy—to intimidate independent repair professionals, claim that the device (in this case, a train) is unsafe, and threaten legal action—is an egregious but common playbook in manufacturers’ fight against repair, all over the world. In the United States, an exemption to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act allows for repair pros to hack land-based motor vehicles, “which would cover trains,” Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of right to repair advocacy group Repair.org told 404 Media.&nbsp;</p><p>“All of this is classic OEM bullshit,” Gordon-Byrne said, using an acronym for original equipment manufacturer. “This is the kind of stuff DRM lets you do, and if you don’t stop it, this is where it goes. What the OEM thinks shouldn’t matter anymore, because they’re not the owner of the train anymore. It’s DRM gone wild.”</p><p>But in Europe, the legality of what Dragon Sector did is murkier. Digital rights advocate and copyright expert Cory Doctorow explained <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">in his excellent Pluralistic blog</a> that Article 6 of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX%3A32001L0029%3AEN%3AHTML&amp;ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">Europe's 2001 Copyright and Information Society Directive</a> is generally stricter on DRM circumvention than Section 1201 of the DMCA, and does not have a specific repair exemption. Because of this law, Doctorow told 404 Media that "there is now an extra layer of jeopardy for these researchers. They were brave to come forward and talk about it." Doctorow said that some similar types of research that bypass DRM and technological protection measures (TPMs) in Europe has been done anonymously or behind the scenes for this reason, creating a chilling effect on this type of research. </p><p>During the height of the pandemic, I wrote an article about how a Polish hacker <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3azv9b/why-repair-techs-are-hacking-ventilators-with-diy-dongles-from-poland?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">had developed a dongle</a> that was being used by American repair professionals to bypass DRM on ventilators needed to keep COVID-19 patients alive. That hacker wanted to keep themselves anonymous in part because they feared being prosecuted under EU law. Doctorow said that these sorts of cases—ones involving tractors, trains, other things that people <em>obviously</em> should be able to fix, are ones that can help change laws and regulations. "This is the kind of claim that might actually help unravel these anti-circumvention measures," he said. "A Polish train operator who wants to fix a Polish train they own is just a no brainer."&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this week, a group called the National Association of Manufacturers <a href="https://documents.nam.org/COMM/NAM-3740-Right%20to%20Repair%20Paper%20R4%20V1%20FIN.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>released a paper</u></a> called “The Economic Downsides of ‘Right-to-Repair’,” which is nominally a piece of research but is just an astroturfed policy paper for big corporations that oppose repair. The paper includes a section called “Altering equipment poses a dramatic increase in violating safety standards and falling out of federal compliance,” which is an extremely common argument that John Deere, medical device manufacturers, Apple, and many other OEMs have made when lobbying against right to repair regulations and laws.</p><p>In other words, the “safety” line of argument that NEWAG is using to try to undermine this repair is a common refrain across every industry of electronics.&nbsp;</p><p>“You name an industry and I’ll give you an example of something like this,” Gordon-Byrne said. “John Deere says farm workers are going to die, your tractor is going to run out of control [if repaired without Deere oversight].” She said that the same diagnostic tools that are used to determine what the problem is with a device are “are then run again at the end of the repair, and the diagnostics tell you whether the thing works or not.” In other words, the train is either fixed, which it appears to be, or it is not.</p><p>SPS, NEWAG, and the Lower Silesian Railway did not respond to 404 Media’s requests for comment.</p><p><strong><em>Update: This article has been updated to include more details about Europe's copyright laws.</em></strong></p>

<p>In the early 2010s, Arm’s 32-bit cores had established themselves in cell phones and tablets. But rising memory capacities in those devices meant Arm would have to go 64-bit sooner or later. On top of that, Arm had server ambitions – and 64-bit support was essential for the server market. That brings us to the Cortex A57. Alongside the previously covered Cortex A53, the A57 represents Arm’s first generation of 64-bit capable cores.</p>
<p>We’re going to cover the Cortex A57 as implemented in the Nintendo Switch’s Nvidia Tegra X1. The Tegra X1 targets a wide range of applications including mobile devices and automobiles. It focuses on providing high GPU performance in a limited power envelope, making it perfect for a portable gaming console like the Switch. Tegra X1 consumes 117,6 mm<sup>2</sup> on TSMC’s 20 nm (20 SoC) process and uses a quad core A57 cluster to provide the bulk of its CPU power. Each Cortex A57 core consumes just under 2 mm<sup>2</sup> of area, and the quad core A57 cluster takes 13.16 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The SoC also contains a cluster of four A53 cores for power efficient processing, but Nintendo has chosen not to use them. A LPDDR4 memory controller connects the Tegra X1 to 4 GB of DRAM with up to 25.6 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth.</p>

<p>In the Tegra X1, the Cortex A57 cores clock up to 1.78 GHz. Under Ubuntu, they take around a third of a second to go from 1.2 GHz up to their maximum speed.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cortex A57 is a 3-wide out-of-order core with large maximum reordering capacity, but relatively small schedulers and other supporting structures. Arm’s designers have definitely prioritized low power and area over high performance, but A57 is more ambitious of a design than older low power cores like AMD’s Jaguar or Intel’s Silvermont. It brings some unique features to the table too, like a flexible register file where multiple 32-bit entries can be used to hold 64-bit or 128-bit results.</p>

<p>The Cortex A57 can be implemented in clusters of up to four cores with a shared L2 cache. L2 capacity can be set to 512 KB, 1 MB, or 2 MB. Nvidia has chosen the 2 MB option for the Tegra X1, trading some area for higher performance. Unlike modern Arm cores, L1 capacities aren’t configurable. They’re fixed at 48 KB for the instruction cache and 32 KB for the data cache. However, implementers can turn off error correction for the L1 caches to gain some area and power efficiency at the cost of reliability.</p>

<h2>Frontend: Branch Prediction</h2>
<p>A CPU’s branch predictor tells the pipeline where to go. Fast and accurate branch prediction helps both performance and power efficiency by keeping the pipeline fed and avoiding wasted work. But branch predictors themselves take area and power, so CPU designers have to find the right balance when deciding how sophisticated of a branch predictor to implement.</p>

<p>Low power CPUs like the Cortex A57 don’t have the speculation distance or core throughput of desktop CPUs, so Arm has given the A57 a modest branch predictor. The predictor uses global history, which means it predicts whether a branch is taken or not taken depending on how previous branches in the instruction stream behaved (and not necessarily the history of the branch being predicted). A57’s predictor can’t track extremely long patterns like branch predictors on desktops. But it should be adequate for a low power design, and avoids chasing diminishing returns.</p>
<p>To minimize branch delays, Cortex A57 has two levels of caching for branch targets, or branch target buffers (BTBs). The first level BTB has 64 entries and handles taken branches with a 1 cycle delay. A second level BTB with 2048 to 4096 entries helps A57 deal with larger branch footprints. Targets that come from the L2 BTB incur a 2 cycle delay.</p>

<p>Branch latency drastically increases once the test exceeds L1 instruction cache capacity, suggesting the L2 BTB is tied to the L1i.</p>
<p>Indirect branches can jump to several different destinations instead of a fixed one. They’re more challenging to predict because the frontend has to choose between multiple targets instead of just guessing whether the branch is taken or not taken. However, indirect prediction capability is crucial because indirect branches tend to show up in object oriented languages.</p>

<p>A57’s indirect predictor can track up to 16 different targets for a single branch. In total, it was able to track 128 indirect targets without significant penalty. That was achieved with 64 branches, each alternating between two targets. Arm’s <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/8718/the-samsung-galaxy-note-4-exynos-review/5">slides</a> suggest the indirect predictor has 512 entries.</p>
<p>Returns are a special case of indirect branches. A function can return to several different call sites, but tracking them is typically as simple as pushing the address of the next instruction when encountering a call instruction, then popping the address off when hitting a corresponding return.</p>

<p>Test results weren’t as easy to interpret as on other CPUs. However, there’s a bit of an inflection point around 32 nested calls. Perhaps A57 has a 32 entry return stack.</p>
<h2>Frontend: Fetch and Decode</h2>
<p>Once the branch predictor has decided where to go, the core has to fetch instruction bytes and decode them. Cortex A57’s 48 KB 3-way instruction cache is the first stop for instructions. It has optional parity protection at 4 byte granularity for data and 36-bit granularity for tags. Parity errors are resolved by invalidating the line with the error and reloading it from L2. Virtual to physical address translation is handled by a fully associative 48 entry instruction TLB.</p>

<p>On an instruction cache miss, A57 generates a fill request to L2. To improve code fetch bandwidth from L2, the core also prefetches the next sequential line. From testing, L2 code fetch bandwidth is low at about 1 IPC. Desktop CPUs and more recent Arm cores can achieve better code throughput from L2, but somehow A57 does better than the newer Cortex A72. On both A57 and A72, the relatively large 48 KB instruction cache should help reduce misses compared to the 32 KB instruction caches typical on other CPUs.</p>
<p>After instructions are fetched, they’re queued into a 32 entry buffer that feeds into the decoders. Instructions are then translated into micro-ops. A57’s decoders also do register renaming to remove false write-after-write dependencies. Unlike renamers on contemporary x86 CPUs or modern Arm cores, A57’s renamer doesn’t perform move elimination or break dependencies with zeroing idioms.</p>
<h2>Out of Order Execution Engine</h2>
<p>A CPU’s out-of-order execution engine is responsible for tracking in-flight instructions, executing them as their inputs become available, and committing their results while respecting ISA rules. Cortex A57’s execution engine can have up to <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/8718/the-samsung-galaxy-note-4-exynos-review/5">40 instruction bundles in flight</a>. </p>

<p>Each bundle can contain multiple instructions, but NOPs appear to be an exception. A NOP consumes an entire bundle, explaining why a naive reorder buffer capacity test with NOPs shows 40 entries. However, at least eight math instructions can be stored together in one bundle. That includes 32-bit or 64-bit integer adds as well as 128-bit vector ones. Memory accesses and branches consume an entire bundle like NOPs do.</p>
<h3>Unified Register File</h3>
<p>Unlike most CPUs, Cortex A57 uses a 128 entry unified register file to handle renaming for both integer and floating point registers. CPUs typically have separate integer and FP register files because integer registers need low latency, while FP registers have to be wider to handle vector execution. Cortex A57’s scheme could be an area saving measure because it lets A57 work with one register file instead of two.</p>

<p>Because the register file’s entries are 32 bits wide, A57 is at its best when handling 32-bit integer code. Floating point code will see contention between integer and FP instructions for shared register file capacity. 64-bit or 128-bit values are supported by allocating multiple 32-bit values. The core still has adequate renaming capacity for 64-bit values, but things get tight with 128-bit vectors. </p>

<p>Curiously, A57’s ends up a bit off its nominal register file capacity if I mix different register widths. I suspect A57’s register file acts like that of GPUs, and has alignment restrictions when using multiple 32-bit entries to store a larger value.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Test</td><td>Measured Renaming Capacity</td><td>Renamed Register File Usage</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed 64-bit Integer and 128-bit Vector Registers</td><td>41</td><td>20x 64-bit (40x 32-bit entries)<br>21x 128-bit (84x 32-bit entries)<br>2x 32-bit for pointer chasing loads<br>2 unused?</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed 32-bit Integer and 128-bit Vector Registers</td><td>41</td><td>20x 32-bit<br>21x 128-bit (84x 32-bit entries)<br>2x 32-bit for pointer chasing loads<br>22 unused?</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed 32-bit FP and 128-bit Vector Registers</td><td>42</td><td>21x 32-bit<br>21x 128-bit (84x 32-bit entries)<br>2x 32-bit for pointer chasing loads<br>21 unused?</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Depending on how smaller registers are allocated, the renamer might not be able to find a contiguous aligned block of four 32-bit registers when it needs space to store a 128-bit value. So while A57 uses register storage more efficiently than modern CPUs, it’s not perfect.</p>
<p>When instructions retire, their results are copied from the renamed register file into a separate architectural register file (ARF). Like on Intel’s original P6, this scheme is potentially easier to implement because renamed registers can be freed when an instruction retires. Exception recovery is also easy because known-good register state is held in one place. However, the ARF scheme requires more data movement and thus consumes more power. Intel moved to a PRF scheme with Sandy Bridge, and Arm did the same with Cortex A73.</p>
<p>Arm’s newer Cortex A72 possibly uses a scheme similar to the A57. I went back over data collected on that CPU and there are certainly similarities to A57 data. When I tested the A72, I rushed because I was paying for a Graviton 1 cloud instance, and thus had limited time to write different tests to explore the core. I’ll have to revisit A72 when work and real life demands give me a break.</p>
<h3>Schedulers</h3>
<p>A57 uses a mostly distributed scheduling scheme with small dedicated schedulers feeding each execution unit. Most of the schedulers have eight entries. The two exceptions are the branch scheduler, which has 12 entries, and the load/store AGUs, which share a 16 entry scheduling queue. Scheduling capacity is likely to limit A57’s reordering capacity before the register file or reorder buffer fills.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Instruction Category</td><td>A57 Scheduling Entries Available</td><td>Skylake Scheduling Entries Available</td></tr><tr><td>Common integer operations (add, shift, bitwise operations)</td><td>16</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>FP/Vector operations</td><td>16</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Memory operations</td><td>16</td><td>39</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h3>Integer Execution Units</h3>
<p>Like many low power CPUs, A57 has two integer pipelines capable of handling the most common operations. Multi-cycle integer operations go to a separate pipe. Multiplies go down this pipe and take five cycles to produce a 64-bit result. Branches get a separate port as well, likely to ensure they’re resolved as quickly as possible to minimize mispredict penalties.</p>

<p>In theory, A57 can execute four integer operations per cycle. In practice, that will rarely occur because branches and multi-cycle integer operations are far less common than simple ones.</p>
<h3>Floating Point and Vector Execution</h3>
<p>FP and vector operations are handled by a pair of ports, each fed by an 8 entry scheduler. Arm’s optimization manual suggests both ports can handle basic FP operations like addition and multiplication, but I was unable to get two scalar FP operations per cycle. 128-bit packed FP operations also execute at one per cycle, so Cortex A57 does have 128 bits of total FP throughput but strangely can’t execute two FP instructions per cycle.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Test</td><td>Cortex A57</td><td>Skylake</td></tr><tr><td>32-bit Scalar FP Adds</td><td>1 per cycle<br>5 cycle latency</td><td>2 per cycle<br>4 cycle latency</td></tr><tr><td>32-bit Scalar FP Multiplies</td><td>0.83 per cycle<br>6 cycle latency</td><td>2 per cycle<br>4 cycle latency</td></tr><tr><td>32-bit Scalar FP Fused Multiply Add</td><td>1 per cycle<br>10 cycle latency</td><td>2 per cycle<br>4 cycle latency</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed 32-bit Scalar FP Adds and Multiplies</td><td>0.83 per cycle</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>128-bit packed FP32 Adds</td><td>1 per cycle<br>5 cycle latency</td><td>2 per cycle<br>4 cycle latency</td></tr><tr><td>128-bit packed FP32 Multiplies</td><td>1 per cycle<br>6 cycle latency</td><td>2 per cycle<br>4 cycle latency</td></tr><tr><td>128-bit packed FP32 Fused Multiply Add</td><td>1 per cycle<br>10 cycle latency</td><td>2 per cycle<br>4 cycle latency</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>ARM’s ASIMD/NEON instruction set provides fmla and fmadd instructions for fused multiply add operations. These execute at one per cycle on Cortex A57, doubling FP throughput. However, latency is very high at 10 cycles. </p>
<p>Vector integer operations enjoy better performance. Both pipelines can handle 128-bit packed integer adds and other basic operations. Latency however is still high. Vector integer adds have 3 cycles of latency, and multiplies have four cycle latency. 128-bit packed integer multiplies only use the first FP pipe, and execute at a rate of one per two cycles.</p>
<h3>Load/Store</h3>
<p>Memory operations are handled by a pair of pipelines. One handles loads and the other handles stores. Cortex A57 can have 32 loads and 12 stores in-flight. The small store queue size will likely limit reordering capacity. Zen 4 already <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/10/22/cinebench-2024-reviewing-the-benchmark/">sees its store queue fill often</a>. If we consider that A57 is designed to keep around 128 instructions in flight, the store queue covers less of the core’s reordering window than on Zen 4.</p>
<p>Unlike newer Arm cores and contemporary desktop CPUs, Cortex A57 doesn’t try to predict whether memory operations will be independent. Therefore, loads are stalled until all prior store addresses have been resolved. For dependent loads, store forwarding latency is typically seven cycles. Forwarding latency is doubled if a load partially overlaps a 16B aligned store, but otherwise there are no notable slow paths.</p>

<p>Cortex A57 translates program-visible 48-bit virtual addresses to 44-bit physical addresses with a fully associative 32 entry DTLB. With 4K pages, those 32 entries should cover 128 KB of address space. DTLB misses can be caught by a unified 1024 entry 4-way set associative L2 TLB. This L2 TLB also handles misses from the instruction TLB. </p>
<p>44-bit physical addressing lets Cortex A57 address up to 16 TB of memory. Arm’s newer cores like the Cortex X2 only support <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101803/0201/The-Cortex-X2--core/Cortex-X2--core-features">40-bit physical addresses</a>, with larger physical address capability reserved for Arm’s Neoverse line. A57 was expected to take on both client and server roles, and had to make a compromise.</p>
<h2>Cache and Memory Latency</h2>
<p>Memory accesses first check Cortex A57’s 32 KB 2-way set associative data cache. The data cache has optional ECC protection with 4 byte granularity. Data cache accesses generally have four cycle latency, or 5 cycles for indexed addressing. A57 suffers heavily from address translation penalties when using 4K pages. Latency spikes to 16 cycles at the 12 KB test size. The spike goes away when using huge pages, suggesting we’re somehow getting TLB misses even though the test array should be well within TLB coverage.</p>

<p>L1 misses go to a shared 2 MB L2 cache. The L2 has mandatory ECC protection for both data and tags, helping with data integrity. To save on area and power, the L2 cache uses a random replacement policy. That means the cache doesn’t have to store metadata on which lines were most recently or frequently used, but can lead to sub-optimal decisions on what data to kick out when bringing new lines in. </p>
<p>Arm lets implementers configure L2 latency to keep clocks up with larger L2 options. It’s impossible to tell if Nvidia used any of these register slicing options, but testing showed the L2 has 22 cycles of load-to-use latency. However, adding L2 TLB latency brings this to over 50 cycles. Finally, DRAM access takes around 250 cycles.</p>
<p>Intel’s Skylake is roughly contemporary with Nvidia’s Tegra X1 and enjoys better latency throughout the memory hierarchy. Access to the i5-6600K’s 6 MB last level cache takes about 11.2 ns, and that includes a few cycles to get an address translation from the L2 TLB.</p>

<p>Memory latency on the Nintendo Switch is high by desktop standards. LPDDR4 likely contributes to higher latency, but is a necessary design choice for a bandwidth hungry low power device.</p>
<h2>Core to Core Latency</h2>
<p>Multi-core systems have to ensure all cores have a coherent view of memory. Cortex A57’s L2 cache handles this by being strictly inclusive of L1 data cache contents, and maintaining duplicate copies of the L1 data cache tag arrays. We can test how fast two cores can exchange data by using <a href="https://github.com/clamchowder/Microbenchmarks/blob/master/CoherencyLatency/PThreadsCoherencyLatency.c">__sync_bool_compare_and_swap </a>to bounce a value between them.</p>

<p>That said, a good program will avoid shuffling data between cores. Tegra X1’s higher core to core latency should have minimal impact on performance.</p>
<h2>Bandwidth</h2>
<p>Cortex A57’s L1 data cache can service a load and a store every cycle. With 128-bit vector accesses, that gives 28 GB/s of L1D read bandwidth. Strangely, L1 bandwidth falls off after 16 KB. As with latency, using hugepages makes the dip go away, suggesting address translation penalties are cutting into bandwidth. I saw the same behavior with A72.</p>

<p>Cortex A57’s cluster-wide L2 cache is 16-way set associative, and has 2 MB of capacity on the Tegra X1. The L2 tags are divided into two banks, letting it service two requests per cycle. Each tag bank covers four data banks. For a single core, the L2 can provide about 8 bytes per cycle of read bandwidth.</p>

<p>Thanks to banking, we get a nice bandwidth increase with two cores loaded. However, L2 bandwidth increases taper off as we load more cores. In contrast, Intel’s L3 cache has as many banks as there are cores, allowing for excellent bandwidth scaling. The Core i5-6600K’s L3 can deliver a massive amount of bandwidth, and a single Skylake core can get more cache bandwidth than all four of Tegra X1’s Cortex A57 cores combined.</p>

<p>Intel’s quad-banked L3 cache delivers better per-cycle performance too, at just above 62 bytes per cycle with a memory bandwidth test running across four cores. Cortex A57’s shared L2 is stuck at 15.72 bytes per cycle. L2 write bandwidth is somewhat lower likely due to overhead from read-for-ownership requests.</p>

<p>L2 misses are generally satisfied by the DRAM controller. Tegra X1’s LPDDR4 setup should provide 25.6 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth. From the CPU cores, we get just under 30% of that figure. Bandwidth stops increasing after 2 to 3 cores are loaded, and tops out below 8 GB/s.</p>

<p>For comparison, a Core i5-6600K with dual channel DDR4-2133 achieved 28.6 GB/s in the same test. That’s 83% of the theoretical 34.1 GB/s available. Incredibly, Skylake enjoys higher memory bandwidth than Cortex A57 does from its L2.</p>

<p>Write bandwidth shows a similar story. A57’s memory bandwidth continues to be poor and far below what Skylake enjoys.</p>

<p>AMD’s Jaguar provides another comparison point. It similarly uses a 2 MB shared L2 cache, but AMD enjoys twice as much L2 bandwidth. Tegra X1 implements a more modern 64-bit LPDDR4 interface compared to Jaguar’s single channel DDR3 setup, but Cortex A57 fails to achieve higher memory bandwidth.</p>
<h2>Some Light Benchmarking</h2>
<p>I’m gonna pivot here with a focus on core width. We already know how Skylake will stack up against Cortex A57 if I benchmark the two head to head. A comparison to Arm’s later Cortex A73 should be more fun, because A73 is a 2-wide core that shares some weaknesses with A57 like a small scheduler. That means A73 can’t match A57 in sustained throughput. However, A73 does run at a higher 2.2 GHz clock speed.</p>
<p>Here, I’m testing how long it takes for 7-Zip to compress a large 2.67 GB file. To add some variety, I’m also using libx264 to transcode a 4K video down to 720P.</p>

<p>In the compression workload, Cortex A57 pulls ahead. Higher core width wins over a narrower but faster clocked core. However, it’s a small lead of less than 5%. With video encoding, A73 wins. But again, the difference is less than 5%. Cortex A73 has just 1 MB of L2 cache compared to A57’s 2 MB, so Arm’s newer core is doing quite well. </p>
<p>The close results are because A73 improves on aspects other than core width, and we can dig into that using performance counters. As an aside, performance counters aren’t comparable across reviews because I’m selecting the closest set of events to best compare the two cores. For example, Cortex A57 cannot count branches and branch mispredicts at retirement. It only has events that count at the execute stage. A73 introduces at-retirement events for branches and mispredicted branches.</p>
<p>At the start of the pipeline, A73 has a stronger branch predictor. Mispredicts per instruction decreased by 20% and 27% in 7-Zip and libx264 respectively. A73 thus wastes less power and time working on the wrong stuff.</p>

<p>At the instruction fetch stage, A73 loses width but increases instruction cache capacity to 64 KB. For libx264, this reduces instruction cache misses per instruction by 53%. Fetching from L2 or beyond costs more power than doing so from a first level cache, so A73 cuts down power spent moving instruction bytes around.</p>

<p>7-Zip also benefits from a larger instruction cache, but A57’s 48 KB cache was already large enough.</p>
<p>The data side sees less change. A73 and A57 both have a 32 KB data cache, so hitrates are similar. Both tested applications see quite a few L1D refills, but libx264 struggles more.</p>

<p>Finally, we can look at L2 misses. I’m using the l2d_cache_refill event from perf on both CPUs, but what the event is counting doesn’t seem comparable across the two CPUs. Cortex A73 counts more L2 data refills than L1D refills, so it could have a very aggressive L2 prefetcher.</p>

<p>Cortex A57’s L2 prefetcher can generate up to eight prefetches after a L2 miss, though all have to be within the same 4K page. Arm’s Cortex-A73 MPCore Processor Technical Reference Manual mentions a L2 prefetcher, but doesn’t say if it’s more aggressive. However, A73’s L2 can support 48 pending fills, while A57’s can only support up to 20. A73 could be exploiting that increased memory level parallelism capability to reduce performance loss from a smaller L2.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Taken in isolation, Arm’s Cortex A57 is a decent low power core with excellent register renaming capacity for 32-bit integer code and passable branch prediction. Within the execution engine, the core’s main weaknesses are high execution latency for floating point instructions, small scheduler capacity, and a small store queue. Some of those weaknesses are present on other low power designs too, so it’s hard to fault Arm for that.</p>
<p>Where Cortex A57 really struggles is the memory subsystem. At a high level, the core-private 32 KB data caches and 2 MB shared last level cache are typical for a low power design. AMD uses a similar setup in Jaguar a few years prior. However, A57’s TLB setup suffers from extremely poor performance. The core suffers inexplicable L1 DTLB misses even when accessing arrays that should fit within its 128 KB coverage. When L1 DTLB msises happen, the 1024 entry L2 TLB performs poorly and adds over 20 extra cycles of latency. L2 TLBs on most other CPUs have less than 10 cycles of latency. Finally, both the L2 cache and system memory suffer from poor bandwidth.</p>
<p>As a low power cell phone and tablet core, Cortex A57 is an acceptable design for its time. Subsequent years would see Arm develop increasingly performant low power cores as improvements in process technology allowed more sophisticated microarchitectures to fit within a few watts.</p>
<p>As the Nintendo Switch’s CPU, Cortex A57 is weak and not comparable to even outdated desktop cores. Modern game developers are able to port games to this platform, but that no doubt involves tons of optimization work. Hogwarts Legacy for example <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23552621/hogwarts-legacy-release-date-play-early-access-versions-deluxe-collectors">released on Switch around nine months</a> after its initial release on PC. Even then, the required optimizations make the Switch version almost a different game. </p>

<p>Still, it’s a wonder that developers managed to get games like Hogwarts Legacy working on the switch at all. I wonder if similar optimization efforts could be carried out to make modern games accessible to a wider audience. A lot of gamers don’t have infinite budgets, and could be using integrated graphics on old CPUs. Switch-like optimizations could make AAA games playable on those platforms.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="xzqsf">More realistic image generation</h2><p data-block-key="dg5h2">Imagen 2’s dataset and model advances have delivered improvements in many of the areas that text-to-image tools often struggle with, including rendering realistic hands and human faces and keeping images free of distracting visual artifacts.</p>

              <p data-block-key="xzqsf">We trained a specialized image aesthetics model based on human preferences for qualities like good lighting, framing, exposure, sharpness, and more. Each image was given an aesthetics score which helped condition Imagen 2 to give more weight to images in its training dataset that align with qualities humans prefer. This technique improves Imagen 2’s ability to generate higher-quality images.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="xzqsf">Advanced inpainting and outpainting</h2><p data-block-key="34etu">Imagen 2 also enables image editing capabilities like ‘inpainting’ and ‘outpainting’. By providing a reference image and an image mask, users can generate new content directly into the original image with a technique called inpainting, or extend the original image beyond its borders with outpainting. This technology is planned for Google Cloud’s Vertex AI in the new year.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="xzqsf">Responsible by design</h2><p data-block-key="32ffu">To help mitigate the potential risks and challenges of our text-to-image generative technology, we set robust guardrails in place, from design and development to deployment in our products.</p><p data-block-key="7ol74">Imagen 2 is integrated with <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SynthID</a>, our cutting-edge toolkit for watermarking and identifying AI-generated content, enabling allowlisted Google Cloud customers to add an imperceptible digital watermark directly into the pixels of the image, without compromising image quality. This allows the watermark to remain detectable by SynthID, even after applying modifications like filters, cropping, or saving with lossy compression schemes.</p><p data-block-key="c8efg">Before we release capabilities to users, we conduct robust safety testing to minimize the risk of harm. From the outset, we invested in training data safety for Imagen 2, and added technical guardrails to limit problematic outputs like violent, offensive, or sexually explicit content. We apply safety checks to training data, input prompts, and system-generated outputs at generation time. For example, we’re applying comprehensive safety filters to avoid generating potentially problematic content, such as images of named individuals. As we are expanding the capabilities and launches of Imagen 2, we are also continuously evaluating them for safety.</p>

    </div><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are often depicted as sentient agents poised to overshadow the human mind. But AI lacks the crucial human ability of innovation, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have found.</p>

                                        
                                              
                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>While <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/children/" rel="tag">children</a> and adults alike can solve problems by finding novel uses for everyday objects, AI systems often lack the ability to view tools in a new way, according to findings <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231201401">published</a> in <i>Perspectives on Psychological Science</i>.</p>
<p>AI language models like ChatGPT are passively trained on <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/data+sets/" rel="tag">data sets</a> containing billions of words and images produced by humans. This allows AI systems to function as a "cultural technology" similar to writing that can summarize existing knowledge, Eunice Yiu, a co-author of the article, explained in an interview. But unlike humans, they struggle when it comes to innovating on these ideas, she said.</p>
<p>"Even young human children can produce intelligent responses to certain questions that [language learning models] cannot," Yiu said. "Instead of viewing these AI systems as intelligent agents like ourselves, we can think of them as a new form of library or search engine. They effectively summarize and communicate the existing culture and knowledge base to us."</p>
<p>Yiu and Eliza Kosoy, along with their doctoral advisor and senior author on the paper, developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik, tested how the AI systems' ability to imitate and innovate differs from that of children and adults. They presented 42 children ages 3 to 7 and 30 adults with text descriptions of everyday objects.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- TechX - News - In-article -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <p>In the first part of the experiment, 88% of children and 84% of adults were able to correctly identify which objects would "go best" with another. For example, they paired a compass with a ruler instead of a teapot.</p>
<p>In the next stage of the experiment, 85% of children and 95% of adults were also able to innovate on the expected use of everyday objects to solve problems. In one task, for example, participants were asked how they could draw a circle without using a typical tool such as a compass.</p>
<p>Given the choice between a similar tool like a ruler, a dissimilar tool such as a teapot with a round bottom, and an irrelevant tool such as a stove, the majority of participants chose the teapot, a conceptually dissimilar tool that could nonetheless fulfill the same function as the compass by allowing them to trace the shape of a circle.</p>
<p>When Yiu and colleagues provided the same text descriptions to five large language models, the models performed similarly to humans on the imitation task, with scores ranging from 59% for the worst-performing model to 83% for the best-performing model. The AIs' answers to the innovation task were far less accurate, however. Effective tools were selected anywhere from 8% of the time by the worst-performing model to 75% by the best-performing model.</p>
<p>"Children can imagine completely novel uses for objects that they have not witnessed or heard of before, such as using the bottom of a teapot to draw a circle," Yiu said. "Large models have a much harder time generating such responses."</p>

                                                                                                                                            <p>In a related experiment, the researchers noted, children were able to discover how a new machine worked just by experimenting and exploring. But when the researchers gave several <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/large+language+models/" rel="tag">large language models</a> text descriptions of the evidence that the children produced, they struggled to make the same inferences, likely because the answers were not explicitly included in their training data, Yiu and colleagues wrote.</p>
<p>These experiments demonstrate that AI's reliance on statistically predicting linguistic patterns is not enough to discover new information about the world, Yiu and colleagues wrote.</p>
<p>"AI can help transmit information that is already known, but it is not an innovator," Yiu said. "These models can summarize conventional wisdom, but they cannot expand, create, change, abandon, evaluate, and improve on <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/conventional+wisdom/" rel="tag">conventional wisdom</a> in the way a young human can."</p>
<p>The development of AI is still in its early days, though, and much remains to be learned about how to expand the learning capacity of AI, Yiu said. Taking inspiration from children's curious, active, and intrinsically motivated approach to learning could help researchers design new AI systems that are better prepared to explore the real world, she said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve built a bunch of different design systems for a bunch of different products and organizations, and this thought keeps popping into my mind: <em>it’s weird how design systems are so rote, yet so difficult</em>.</p>
<p>When I say rote, I’m thinking about how parts of the underlying toolkit have become really easy, how pretty much any designer can work on one, and how the general idea of a design system has become understood such that it’s a reasonable expectation that a team will have one.</p>
<p>Tools like Figma are incentivised to build features that make design system tooling within those tools easier and better than ever. They’re alluring because the results are tangible really fast, which suggests they’ll also be impactful really fast.</p>
<p>Conceptual frameworks like atomic design make building with these tools feel like connecting dots in a known system, rather than building a system from scratch.</p>
<p>Popular frontend frameworks and component libraries make implementation feel half-done already.</p>
<p>All this means it’s easy to get started, make fast progress, then hit brick walls at high speed.</p>
<p>Some of the common <s>brick walls</s> themes I’ve seen and experienced across many different teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of actual (not assumed) alignment within teams and leadership around what a design system is, what problems it solves, and how it will provide value.</li>
<li>Poor scoping and planning as a result of a lack of actual alignment.</li>
<li>A lack of stewardship and leadership for the design system.</li>
<li>Not using or recognizing the design system as an internal source of truth.</li>
<li>The mere existence of a design system warping the design process and the value of design as a discipline.</li>
<li>A tendancy to over-optimize for future flexibility, rather than immediate need and impact, which eventually sabotages momentum.</li>
<li>A disconnect between the design system and brand strategy &amp; identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Design systems represent a huge number of small decisions, both visible and hidden, in both design and engineering, that multiply both perceived and actual effort, cost, and value. In general, we’re very bad at identifying those hidden decisions and the actual effort and cost, and we’re not always aligned around the value we expect to gain. In turn, this makes it difficult to plan how and when to invest in design systems in a way that provides real impact in the right ways.</p>
<p>It’s not so much that design systems are difficult, but rather that alignment and understanding and the resulting decision-making around design systems is difficult.</p>
<h2>What exactly is a design system then</h2>
<p>When thinking about investing in design systems, we often mistake a “design system” as a monolithic concept that you either have or don’t have, treated as a project rather than an internal product.</p>
<p>A design system is really a high-level concept uniting various things together around shared objectives. But thinking about it as a monolith inevitably obscures how each person has a different sense of what that monolith contains.</p>
<p>Like any big hairy problem, it helps to break it down. Here’s how I think of it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design system:</strong> A complete set of standards and principles to manage design at scale. It can include, but isn’t limited to, the visual design language, typography, colour palettes, components, <a href="https://uxlanguage.com/" target="_blank">copywriting guidelines</a>, and other elements that create a cohesive, scalable look and feel for the product.</li>
<li><strong>Component library:</strong> A collection of UI design elements, such as buttons, form elements, and other reusable components. Component libraries are part of the design system, but aren’t themselves the system.</li>
<li><strong>Design tooling:</strong> The way the design system, components, and so on are defined and made available in design tools. This tooling encodes many parts of the design system, such as the palette and components, such that designer can apply or pull elements out of the system and use them in design explorations and artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering implementation:</strong> The way the design system in all of its parts are defined in code. How exactly this is done can vary wildly.</li>
<li><strong>Product implementation:</strong> The actual use of the design system “in production” in the product or application itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Investing in design systems while running into less brick walls</h2>
<p>When thought of as a monolithic concept and with a binary definition of “done” that includes all of the above (remembering that everyone will have a different perspective), it rarely makes sense to invest in design systems—and in my view, it’ll never feel done or done well, because it won’t be clear what value it provides or is intended to provide.</p>
<p>But when thought of as an internal product with very specific intended outcomes, it usually makes sense to invest in, so long as there’s clear definitions and boundaries around what and why.</p>
<p>I haven’t found a magic solution here or a checklist to go through, because design systems are hyper-contextualised to your company, your product, and your team. But generally, think about:</p>
<h3>The stage of the company</h3>
<p>If you’re a startup in the early stages of discovering what you do really well and for whom, you probably don’t want to be thinking about design systems. As an early stage startup, you probably have a small team working in very rapid iterations and with tight feedback loops between team members.</p>
<p>The further along your company is, the more important it becomes to have a design system of some level. Processes and tooling need to scale with the company, and as an internal product, a design system will pay dividends in collaboration and cohesion. A particularly large company can even make an internal design system into an external product.</p>
<h3>The state of the product</h3>
<p>Even in a smaller company, once a product has some level of confidence around what problem it’s solving for who, establishing a design system, even early, can be helpful for increasing velocity. A design system helps establish and encode patterns, which removes a swath of decisions that need to be made in day-to-day work and review.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have an existing product that never had a design system, investing in one can pay off: it’s likely that the product has various duplicated patterns and inconsistencies that make it feel fragmented or inconsistent. The act of translating the product into a design system forces decisions that scale down the number of patterns in the underlying system. And, again, then we can stop thinking about those details and focus on solving user problems and exploring new opportunities.</p>
<h3>The state of the brand platform</h3>
<p>A product’s underlying design system is intrinsically linked to brand strategy. At some point, every company needs a brand platform, and the product itself plays a role in expressing the brand. When a company starts thinking about brand strategically, investing in design systems can help actually execute on making that brand tangible, creating better differentiation and strong positive signals for prospective customers.</p>
<p>That design systems are so rote makes it easy to get a quick return on investment. That’s great. But the ease of getting started shouldn’t overshadow the need for thoughtfulness around planning and alignment, same as any other product. It’s going to be difficult no matter what. But if done well, design systems pay dividends: better design, engineering, and collaborative processes, a stronger brand platform, and a better product experience.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-427433">


<h3>from the <i>how-do-you-trust-a-company-that-can-delete-your-life's-work?</i> dept</h3>

<p>Over a decade ago, I pointed out that as Google kept trying to worm its way deeper into our lives, a key Achilles’ heel was its basically non-existent customer service and unwillingness to ever engage constructively with users the company fucks over. At the time, I dubbed it Google’s “<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2011/07/21/can-google-get-past-big-faceless-white-monolith-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big, faceless, white monolith</a>” problem, because that’s how it appears to many customers. Going all the way back to 2009, I had suggested that the company needed not just better customer support, but something <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2009/03/03/does-google-need-an-ombudsman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like a user advocate</a>.</p>
<p>This issue shows up <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/09/07/thanks-google-fucking-over-bunch-media-websites/">time and time again</a>. The company screws people over and generally there’s no one to talk to. Too bad. Talk to the white monolith. We’ve <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/08/12/why-are-there-currently-no-ads-techdirt-apparently-google-thinks-were-dangerous/">faced it ourselves</a> here at Techdirt.</p>
<p>And, of course, in situations where someone’s full Google account is taken down, and where there’s little to no recourse, it can really fuck people over. Last year, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/08/22/horrifying-google-flags-parents-as-child-sex-abusers-after-they-sent-their-doctors-requested-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we wrote about</a> a NY Times story by Kashmir Hill <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html?s=33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concerning a parent who not only lost his entire Google account</a>, but also was flagged for passing around child sexual abuse material (CSAM), after a medical professional had asked the father to take photos of his son regarding swelling. Despite flagging him as a potential criminal, he couldn’t even talk to anyone at Google to explain what happened.</p>
<p>Hill just recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/technology/google-youtube-abuse-mistake.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published another such story</a>, regarding a woman losing her entire Google account after one of her 7 year old sons, messing around with a camera and uploading the videos to YouTube, published a video of himself naked. For obvious reasons, that’s a problem, and the video was taken down quickly, but Google shut down the woman’s entire Google account and said it would be deleted.</p>
<p>But it’s not just issues regarding CSAM that are creating these kinds of issues.</p>
<p>We’ve written a few times about independent journalist Tim Burke. Earlier this year, the FBI raided his house and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/journalist-tells-fbi-to-give-back-devices-seized-during-extremely-questionable-investigation-into-leaked-fox-news-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seized all of his electronic devices</a> after he had obtained and published some leaked video footage from Fox News. As we noted, this seemed like a pretty big 1st Amendment issue. Burke is also <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/10/journalists-ask-doj-to-stop-treating-url-alterations-as-a-federal-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing bogus CFAA</a> charges because he was able to access the footage by using publicly accessible URLs to obtain the content.</p>
<p>But, with all of his devices seized, Burke at least still had Google Cloud to keep all of the massive troves of (mostly video) data he’s collected over the last few years of reporting. Burke said he paid Google “a lot of money for a long time” for an “unlimited” cloud storage account. This was a plan that was offered to Google “Enterprise” Workspace customers for a while. However, in the last year or so, they <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-other-shoe-finally-dropped-on-my-google-enterprise-cloud-storage-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply phased out that plan</a>, which really sucked for those who had a ton of data.</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/ad6ace2a-9c29-4f92-b4ba-dbca5a0a9829-RackMultipart20231211-113-sg4iew.png?ssl=1" alt="Image" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>As you can see from the above email, they told those who had formerly used a ton of storage on their unlimited plan, that their account would go into “read-only” mode and they wouldn’t be allowed to upload any more data. Tim Burke and his 237.22 TB of video files were among those put into read only mode, which he assumed meant that, at least, that content would be kept safe (hopefully until he could get the feds to return all of his computer equipment).</p>
<p>Instead, over the weekend, Google reached out to say that since he’s using too much storage, they’re going to delete his entire account in seven days (later this week).</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/aabc90fa-3946-4254-a261-de11d5c66bf3-RackMultipart20231211-142-y6igva.png?ssl=1" alt="Image" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>That email sure isn’t subtle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Your Google Workspace Enterprise Standard for your account burke-communications.com has been scheduled for suspension and will soon be canceled, and your data will be lost.</em></p>

<p>As Tim notes, this is his life’s work. And even if he had access to ~250 TBs of free storage, it’s not even clear he’d be able to transfer that much data in just seven days.</p>
<p>But, of course, Google has it’s big monolith problem. There’s no one to speak to. You’re just dealing with the machine.</p>
<p>That seems… bad?</p>
<p>And, yes, some people have asked why Tim doesn’t have other backups around, but (again) the FBI took all of his shit. And finding (and paying for) <em>multiple </em>backup services that can handle 250 TBs of data is likely pretty cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>One hopes that some human at Google might finally realize how bad this is and give Tim the time he needs to find another home for the data (or just give him back the plan he originally paid for, or at least let him store the existing data there as suggested in the earlier email).</p>

The job <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1627555/Principal-Program-Manager-Nuclear-Technology">posting</a> says it’s hiring someone to “lead project initiatives for all aspects&nbsp;of&nbsp;nuclear energy&nbsp;infrastructure for&nbsp;global growth.” </p><p>Microsoft is specifically looking for someone who can roll out a plan for small modular reactors&nbsp;(SMR). All the hype around nuclear these days is around these next-generation reactors. Unlike their older, much larger predecessors, these modular reactors are supposed to be easier and cheaper to build. For comparison, the last large nuclear reactor to be built in the US <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-power-nuclear-reactor-vogtle-9555e3f9169f2d58161056feaa81a425">finally came on line</a> this summer roughly $17 billion over budget after seven years of delays.</p><p>The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567711/nuclear-energy-advanced-small-modular-reactor-design-certified">certified</a> an SMR design for the first time in January, which allows utilities to choose the design when applying for a license for a new power plant. And it could usher in a whole new chapter for nuclear energy. </p><p>Even so, there are still kinks to work out if Microsoft wants to rely on SMRs to power the data centers where its cloud and AI live. An SMR requires more highly enriched uranium fuel, called HALEU, than today’s traditional reactors. So far, Russia has been the world’s major supplier of HALEU. There’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23003494/war-ukraine-nuclear-energy-uranium-russia-supply-chain">push</a> in the US to build up a domestic supply chain of uranium, which communities near uranium mines and mills are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/8/23824490/joe-biden-new-national-monument-grand-canyon-uranium-mine">fighting</a>. Then there’s the question of what to do with nuclear waste, which <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/05/30/small-modular-reactors-produce-high-levels-nuclear-waste/">even a fleet of SMRs can generate significant amounts of</a> and the US is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17765538/san-onofre-nuclear-generating-station-radioactive-spent-fuel-waste-yucca-mountain">still figuring out how to store long term</a>. </p><p>Microsoft didn’t answer questions from <em>The Verge</em> about its plans for next-generation nuclear or how it might tackle those challenges that could come along with it. Gates happens to also be the founder and chair of TerraPower, an incubator developing SMR designs. The company “does not currently have any agreements to sell reactors to Microsoft,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/microsoft-is-hiring-a-nuclear-energy-expert-to-help-power-data-centers.html">it told CNBC</a>. Microsoft already has a deal to buy clean energy credits from Canadian utility Ontario Power Generation, which is on track to be the first utility to deploy an SMR in North America, <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/climate-deals/2023/09/25/microsoft-small-modular-reactors-microreactors"><em>Axios</em> reports</a>. DCD, a website publishing content about data centers, first <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-cloud-hiring-to-implement-global-small-modular-reactor-and-microreactor-strategy-to-power-data-centers/">reported</a> on the job listing last week.</p><p>Microsoft has also made an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23717332/microsoft-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-helion-purchase-agreement">audacious</a> deal to purchase electricity from a company called Helion that’s developing an even more futuristic fusion power plant. Both old-school nuclear reactors and SMR designs generate electricity through nuclear <em>fission,</em> which is the splitting apart of atoms. Nuclear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23508872/nuclear-fusion-power-clean-energy-breakthrough-explained"><em>fusion</em></a>, involves forcing atoms together the way stars do to create their own energy. A fusion reactor is a holy grail of sorts — it would be a source of abundant clean energy that doesn’t create the same radioactive waste as nuclear fission. But despite decades of research and recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23506086/nuclear-fusion-power-research-milestone-net-energy-gain">breakthroughs</a>, most experts say a fusion power plant is at least decades away — and the world can’t wait that long to tackle climate change.</p><p>Helion’s backers also include <a href="https://www.helionenergy.com/articles/announcing-500-million-fundraise/">OpenAI CEO and ChatGPT developer Sam Altman</a>. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567448/microsoft-openai-partnership-extension-ai">extended</a> its “multiyear, multibillion dollar investment” with OpenAI this year. Last week, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23873690/microsoft-new-ai-features-bing-search-shopping-dall-e-3">announced its plan</a> to add OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 image generator&nbsp;to Bing Chat. “We are committed to helping our customers use our platforms and tools to do more with less today and innovate for the future in the new era of AI,” Microsoft chair and CEO Satya Nadella says in the job listing for a nuclear technology principal program manager.</p><p><em><strong>Update September 26th, 2:00PM ET: </strong>This story has been updated with the information about the website that first published news about the job listing.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>TAMPA, Fla. — The Federal Communications Commission is standing by last year’s decision to deny Starlink nearly $900 million in rural broadband subsidies.</p>



<p>The regulator issued its final denial Dec. 12, reaffirming that SpaceX’s satellite broadband service <a href="https://spacenews.com/spacex-loses-900-million-rural-broadband-subsidy/">failed to meet requirements</a> for participating in the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF).</p>



<p>“The FCC followed a careful legal, technical and policy review to determine that this applicant had failed to meet its burden to be entitled to” the funds,” FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reaffirms-rejection-nearly-900-million-subsidy-starlink">a news release</a>.</p>



<p>SpaceX was provisionally awarded the subsidies in December 2020 after competing in an auction under the first phase of the RDOF process.</p>



<p>The company was in line for $886 million over 10 years to deliver high-speed broadband to nearly 643,000 homes and businesses in 35 states, after winning one of the largest shares of the multi-billion-dollar fund.</p>



<p>However, the 180 auction winners had to show how they would deploy services that meet RDOF conditions, and this is where the FCC says SpaceX fell short. Terrestrial telco LTD Broadband was also denied $1.3 billion in provisionally awarded subsidies.</p>



<p>RDOF requirements include providing 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download speeds and 20 Mbps upload speeds.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ookla.com/articles/us-satellite-performance-q3-2023">the latest Ookla speed tests</a>, Starlink median download performance in the United States was 64.54 Mbps in the third quarter of 2023, which the research firm said was a slight decline quarter-on-quarter but up 22% on the 53 Mbps recorded for the period in 2022.</p>



<p>Median upload performance has been rising, Ookla added, hitting 9.72 Mbps over the three months to the end of September.</p>



<p>SpaceX said it is “deeply disappointed and perplexed” by the FCC’s RDOF denial.</p>



<p>The decision singles out SpaceX for not meeting RDOF speed requirements years before it had any obligation to do so, the company said in a Dec. 12 letter to the FCC.</p>



<p>SpaceX also took aim at the FCC’s use of Ookla speed tests, which the company said came without warning and involve nationwide averages covering areas that would not be served with RDOF support.</p>



<p>“This decision directly undermines the very goal of RDOF: to connect unserved and underserved Americans. Starlink is demonstrably one of the best options—likely<em> the</em> best option—to accomplish the goals of RDOF,” wrote SpaceX vice president Christopher Cardaci (emphasis in original).</p>



<p>“Indeed, Starlink is arguably the only viable option to <em>immediately </em>connect many of the Americans who live and work in the rural and remote areas of the country where high-speed, low-latency internet has been unreliable, unaffordable, or completely unavailable, the very people RDOF was supposed to connect.”</p>



<p>SpaceX has plans to upgrade Starlink services with increasingly powerful satellites, which would also greatly benefit from the Starship/Super Heavy launch vehicle <a href="https://spacenews.com/starship-super-heavy-lifts-off-on-second-flight/">the company is developing</a> in Boca Chica, Texas.</p>



<p>Brendan Carr and Nathan Simington, the FCC’s two Republican FCC Commissioners, have dissented from the regulator’s Starlink subsidiary denial decision.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">craw, <code>crawshaw.io/sqlite</code>, a CGO-based solution. This is not a <code>database/sql</code> driver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">mattn, <code>github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3</code>, a CGO-based solution. This library is
(still) the de-facto standard and widely used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">modernc, <code>modernc.org/sqlite</code>, a pure Go solution. This is a newer library,
based on the SQLite C code re-written in Go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">ncruces, <code>github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3</code>, a pure Go solution based on WASM (?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">sqinn, <code>github.com/cvilsmeier/sqinn-go</code>, a solution without CGO. It uses
<code>github.com/cvilsmeier/sqinn</code> to access SQLite database files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">zombie, <code>github.com/zombiezen/go-sqlite</code>, a rewrite of the crawshaw driver, using the
modernc libraries. This is not a <code>database/sql</code> driver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The test setup is as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>OS: Debian/GNU Linux amd64 version 12.3</li>
<li>CPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz, 4 physical cores, 8 logical cores</li>
<li>RAM: 16GB</li>
<li>Disk: 1TB NVME SSD</li>
<li>go version go1.21.5 linux/amd64</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The benchmark was run on 2023-12-09, with then-current library versions.
See go.mod for library versions. Each test was run once for warmup.
The second run was then recorded.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="articleContent" id="article-content"><p>The recent generative AI boom has companies across industries investing massive amounts of time and money into AI. Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/cloudfare/" target="_blank" rel="">Cloudflare</a>, thinks most of them are just “lighting money on fire.”</p><div>



<p>The CEO, who runs one of the world’s largest networks underlying the global internet, made the statement onstage at the <em>Fortune</em> <a href="https://fortune.com/conferences/fortune-brainstorm-a-i-2023/agenda" target="_self" rel="">Brainstorm AI conference </a>in San Francisco Monday in response to a question about businesses experimenting with AI.</p>



<p>“I think most of the people in this room are affected,” he said, directing his statement at the audience.</p>



<p>Prince also took shots at the major cloud providers, especially <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Amazon</a>, during the talk about the infrastructure side of AI. He pointed to the shortage of GPUs as one of his top concerns about both the current infrastructure and lack of competition in AI, but argued this problem is “somewhat artificial.”</p>



<p>“If you look at big cloud providers, one of the decisions they made early on was to make it more expensive for you to move your data from one region to another or from one cloud provider to another. AWS, for example, marks up their transport costs 4,000 times what their underlying costs are. And what that is doing in the AI space is actually further artificially constraining access to GPUs,” he said, later adding that if the price of taking data out were the same as putting it in, “we’d have a lot more competition in the space.”</p>



<p>Jennifer Tejada, chairperson and CEO of cloud computing company PagerDuty, took a more optimistic stance and spoke about more high-level concerns among companies such as keeping AI strategies simple, creating a path between research and actually delivering products, and training the workforce for AI transformation, including preparing the C-suite and board members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among her clients, she spoke about seeing the fear of risk keeping some companies from jumping into AI. For a straightforward approach, she suggested starting from the ground up with employees and having them create what she calls a “toil bucket,” essentially a list of everything they hate doing that they hope AI could take off their plate.</p>



<p>“We found that employees that are closest to the business problems, that understand the most about the business problems, often come up with the most practical use cases,” she said.</p>

<p>Tesla is trying to use a free speech argument to defeat a complaint that it falsely advertised "Autopilot" as an autonomous vehicle system. In response to the California Department of Motor Vehicles allegation about Autopilot, Tesla claims the state laws cited by the DMV violate the US Constitution's First Amendment.</p>
<p>The DMV's July 2022 <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22128017/california-dmv-complaint-against-tesla-2.pdf">complaint</a> alleges that Tesla falsely advertises its Autopilot-enabled cars as operating autonomously and seeks a suspension or revocation of Tesla's manufacturer license.</p>
<p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/12/11/ca-dmv-tesla-autopilot-advertising-response.pdf">Tesla's response</a>, which was filed last week and published yesterday in a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/11/tesla_california_autopilot_lawsuit/">story by The Register</a>, says that several California statutes and regulations cited by the DMV "are unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 2, of the California Constitution, as they impermissibly restrict Tesla's truthful and nonmisleading speech about its vehicles and their features."</p>
<p>One of the state laws that Tesla complains about is <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/california-codes/california-vehicle-code/division-12-equipment-of-vehicles/chapter-1-general-provisions/section-240115-notice-regarding-partial-driving-automation-feature">Cal. Veh. Code § 24011.5</a>, which says that companies "shall not name any partial driving automation feature, or describe any partial driving automation feature in marketing materials, using language that implies or would otherwise lead a reasonable person to believe, that the feature allows the vehicle to function as an autonomous vehicle."</p>
<h2>Tesla: Law “invalid under the First Amendment”</h2>
<p>That California law, according to Tesla, "is facially invalid under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution" and the state Constitution because "a substantial number of the statute's applications impermissibly restrict constitutionally protected speech that is truthful and nonmisleading."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Despite Tesla's free speech claim, the US and state governments can enforce laws banning deceptive practices that harm consumers. "Beyond the category of common-law fraud, the Supreme Court has also said that false or misleading commercial speech may be prohibited," a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12180">Congressional Research Service report</a> last year stated. "For constitutional purposes, commercial speech is speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction or that relates solely to the speaker's and audience's economic interests. Accordingly, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) can regulate deceptive commercial speech without violating the First Amendment."</p>
<p>The California DMV's 2022 complaint, alleging deceptive practices that violate state law, said that Tesla "made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts, in advertising vehicles as equipped, or potentially equipped, with advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features... Instead of simply identifying product or brand names, these 'Autopilot' and 'Full Self-Driving Capability' labels and descriptions represent that vehicles equipped with the ADAS features will operate as an autonomous vehicle, but vehicles equipped with those ADAS features could not at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles."</p>
<p>The agency argued that a Tesla disclaimer, which says the "features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous," is not enough to make the advertising truthful. The "disclaimer contradicts the original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading, and does not cure the violation," the DMV said.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://plane.so/blog/how-we-got-to-20k-github-stars">https://plane.so/blog/how-we-got-to-20k-github-stars</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38624873">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>How Plane, an open-source alternative to Jira, got to the #1 in project management on GitHub in less than a year</p><div><p>On September 18 this year, we crossed 14K stars and stood at #1 on the list of open source project management tools on GitHub. Curiously, every chat over the last two months, be it with users who are switching over to Plane from Jira, Aha!, and Linear, other OSS companies that want to partner, or about offers to speak at <a href="https://opencoresummit.com/" target="_blank">OSS events</a>, opens with surprise at our star-growth and echos what others have asked me online and offline.</p>

<p>This post is a summary answer to that question, strictly from the privileged ring-side view I have had of our short journey of the last year. It covers what worked for us, where we failed, and what we have learnt about popularity in open source. Hopefully, it encourages other open source start-ups to avoid our mistakes if nothing else.</p>
<h2>“But what are GitHub stars?”</h2>
<p>GitHub stars are like Facebook Likes or Twitter Hearts for GitHub users, largely developers, with the added benefit of GitHub-native notifications from starred projects. For open source projects, especially new ones like ours, they are a good popularity indicator and thus, initial success with a core audience group.</p>
<p>Naturally, <a href="https://x.com/planepowers/status/1703627427946311832?s=20" target="_blank">our claims</a> of topping our category were met with hoots and shout-outs from our users and supporters, disbelief from industry watchers, and in one case, <a href="https://x.com/cpojer/status/1703690435192045609?s=20" target="_blank">a jibe</a>. We have continued at a faster clip since and just crossed 18K stars in October.</p>
<div><p>The more you know</p><p>We're not the fastest or the first to get to the coveted #1 position on
GitHub. We have often tipped our hat to Cal.com, Supabase, Appsmith, and
Hopscotch for setting several precedences at GitHub success. Some GPT projects
are skyrocketing to 100K stars as I write this!</p></div>
<div><blockquote>If you are open-source on GitHub, ignoring star growth could be an expensive mistake.</blockquote></div>
<p>Many in open source have voiced their disillusionment with GitHub stars, what with the trend of now buying them just as you can Likes and Hearts. I agree with the spirit of it, not the devaluation of stars.</p>
<p>To offer an analogy, you wouldn’t complain if your handle got 18K followers on X or Instagram or LinkedIn early on, but you wouldn’t make that your North Star metric. Similarly, the more stars, the better GitHub’s network effects, the more eyeballs on a project—gold in the early stages of open-source—but soon enough, you would want to switch tune to use cases, growth, and customers. More on that coming soon</p>
<h2>Rolling out of the hangar</h2>
<p>Plane tiptoed on to GitHub on November 19, 2022 to cheers and raised glasses from exactly five wide-eyed watchers, all of whom are still at Plane and cheer every release as they did the first one. It was a private repo, so you had to be invited to see the project. It was expectedly vanilla, offering issue management via cycles <em>AKA sprints</em> and modules <em>AKA epics</em>, in List and Kanban-style layouts. It was admittedly a tad bumpier than a country road for anyone who wanted to host Plane themselves, including us.</p>
<div><blockquote>We weren’t ready to announce Plane anytime soon, but that meant, we had time to experiment with how we communicated value, talked about features, and wrote our private release notes in one-on-one e-mails, which later became winning tactic #2. But first, we needed committed users.</blockquote></div>
<div><div><p><img src="https://plane.so/favicon/android-chrome-192x192.png" alt="icon"></p></div><div><p>With Plane, you can manage tasks, track them by cycles, and even group them by modules. Share your work with clients or users, customize your workflows, and move work to the right.
<a href="https://app.plane.so/" target="_blank"></a></p></div></div>
<h3>Tactic #1: Community</h3>
<p>Open source is a tribe and that tribe is demanding. It wants to know that your project is cool, serious about its existence, and is built for participation. To communicate all that consistently demands diligence that is tough for a very-early-stage start-up. While we could have gone all out with promoting Plane, we knew we weren’t ready to handle engagement at scale.</p>
<p>Much before we went on to GitHub, we promoted the project privately to our network of friends, friends of friends, and acquaintances who would find value with the tool. We sat down with all of them, got their feedback, heard their use cases, and continued cranking out updates for the top requests.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/early-request-for-feedback-plane.webp" alt="early-request-for-feedback-plane"></p><p>A very early blurb we sent out to a bunch that got trashed by just about everyone.</p></div>
<div><div><p>What worked #1</p><div><ul>
<li>We crowdsourced ideas for comms, not just the product.</li>
<li>We asked them to outline their business goals, describe their troubles with other software, name our features, even opine on the logo.</li>
<li>We consistently kept them updated about our progress.</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #1</p><div><ul>
<li>Automating updates and boilerplate responses</li>
<li>Delays with Support requests, especially from new users</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<p>At some point before the end of October, we felt the need to turn this cabal of tens of users into a community. We also wanted to time it to our go-live on GitHub. We set up Discord on November 19, 2022 and sent out twenty invites in total to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/A92xrEGCge" target="_blank">our server</a>. That server has already crossed the 2,500-member mark and counts 1,890 active members at the time of publishing.</p>

<p>Discord is geeky, fun, and packs features for at-scale community engagement, but we didn't bother with any of that. Our goal was to engage our earliest users with product muscle, turn them into fans, and have them spread the word. So we stuck to the basics, creating just one other channel—<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1031547764020084846/1053269018196320267" target="_blank">#feedback</a>—apart from #general which is auto-created for each server. We pushed people early on to #feedback for complaints, requests, and <em>demands</em>—ahem—while keeping #general reserved for project management banter.</p>
<p>Soon enough, more users trickled in and started showing an interest in contributing to Plane. To an open-source start-up, this is a huge mile-marker and tells you you got the <em>cool factor</em> down pat*.*</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/offer-to-contribute-to-the-plane%20repo-discord.webp" alt="offer-to-contribute-to-the-plane repo-discord"></p><p>We weren’t ready to take contributions in January, but we opened that up, too soon after.</p></div>
<p>Also trickling in with these users were their requests for more—more features, more experience, more everything. Which was great, because it gave us ready opportunities to talk about their problems and send them personalized updates when we shipped new features and improvements.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/engaging-with-feedback-for-plane-discord.webp" alt="engaging-with-feedback-for-plane-discord"></p><p>We responded to every new request for a workaround, every bug report, and every new feature ask within minutes.</p></div>
<p>In return for this white-glove, hyper-personal engagement, we started actively asking for referrals. And they did. It wasn’t anything crazy, but we saw more than five users join our Discord every week.</p>
<div><div><p>What worked #2</p><div><ul>
<li>Active comms, probing for the <em>whys</em> behind every request, and workarounds</li>
<li>Personal messages when a feature got shipped</li>
<li>Asking for referrals</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #2</p><div><ul>
<li>Lengthy messages with unnecessary context</li>
<li>Shying away from sharing work in progress</li>
<li>Not creating a dedicated forum for Support early on</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<p>In hindsight, this was the game prep we needed before we went wide with our repo and promotions. It let us see challenges ahead of time, plan for them, and execute with intent.</p>
<h2>First flight(s)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/makeplane/plane/releases/tag/v0.1-dev" target="_blank">v0.1-dev</a> in January was our first release and garnered encouraging inbound interest. Some of those were referrals, sure, but most of those were due to one of our early private experiments—well-crafted release notes.</p>
<p>Before there were release notes, though, there was <a href="https://github.com/makeplane/plane/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">our GitHub README</a>, the About page of any project on GitHub. We had heard it worked for new users and some even called it nice.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/planes-readme-github.webp" alt="planes-readme-github"></p><p>Self-hosted options quickly followed the hero and the intro. For those who needed a little more, there were screenshots.</p></div>
<p>Apart from feature highlights and show-and-tell, it also had links to Docs and a way to reach out about security worries. We haven’t changed it. In fact, we drew heavily from our experience doing it up.</p>
<div><div><p>What worked #3</p><div><ul>
<li>It didn’t push Plane into anyone’s face.</li>
<li>Short-and-sweet instructions for self-hosting came first.</li>
<li>There were links to destinations new users expect to see.</li>
<li>Using simple language, keeping in mind of the global audience</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #3</p><div><ul>
<li>The full readme is a little too long.</li>
<li>We heard some folks saying it was too promotional—something we are still considering changing.</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<h3>Tactic #2: Release notes</h3>
<p>“Why craft release notes? Who does?” Allow me to answer with this craziness from Tumblr.</p>

<div><blockquote><h3>While none of our release notes are this mad—and probably never will—, they were great for three early goals.</h3><ul>
<li>Educate your existing users about a feature.</li>
<li>Engage them with whatever’s new and exciting.</li>
<li>Convert lurkers into users.</li>
</ul></blockquote></div>
<p>For an early-stage, resource-crunched start-up, few other marketing avenues come close to the ROI of well-done release notes. So, that’s what we did.</p>
<p>The one-on-one blurbs we had sent out in e-mail and LinkedIn + WhatsApp DMs helped us figure out a structure to our notes—excitement, education, and information in that order. For those looking to go deeper into a feature and public GitHub conversations leading up to the release, we linked each bullet to its own PR, GitHub lingo for open and closed roadmap items.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/our-first-release-github.webp" alt="our-first-release-github"></p><div><p>Forgive us the bluster and cut straight to <strong>Highlights</strong>. 🙂</p></div></div>
<p>Then we went about distributing them on Reddit and Twitter—<a href="https://www.notion.so/From-the-first-line-of-code-to-1-in-our-category-bb50bf569f6c4ef3bb4a8c27fe5f8427?pvs=21" target="_blank">winning tactic #4</a>.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/14-upvotes-reddit.webp" alt="14-upvotes-reddit"></p><p>16 upvotes is no dance party, but it signaled to us there was interest.</p></div>
<p>New users trickled in with each release, courtesy GitHub notifications + popularity, and started talking to us. That led to more candid conversations about more use cases and more <em>whys</em> behind trying Plane. Combined with a quick walkthrough of our then-private roadmap, these conversations allowed us to build first-name relationships with early adopters.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/early-roadmap-plane.webp" alt="early-roadmap-plane"></p><p>Plane’s come far from this version.</p></div>
<p>The more we wrote ‘em notes, the better we got at structuring them for readability and show-and-tell. Soon enough, we were writing them like we would write a round-up on our blog.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/highlights-in-planes-release-notes-github.webp" alt="highlights-in-planes-release-notes-github"></p></div>
<p>Our next and current evolution included,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Features</strong>
<p>We turned <strong>Highlights</strong> into useful sections about new and exciting features that users were waiting for. Anyone not troubled by a bug could just focus on this and move on.</p></li>
<li><strong>Visual aids</strong>
<p>Next, we made it easier to see value in the features we were building with screenshots and GIFs. For a UI-heavy product like ours, this was not just cool. It worked beautifully for user education, as evidenced in our how-to requests going down by about 50% for new releases.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Improvements</strong>
<p>Meant for existing and engaged users of the product, this section talked about a much-awaited workaround or micro-feature that improved user experience.</p></li>
<li><strong>Bugs</strong>
<p>For the more technical audience and those that were blocked by a bug, this section focused on unexpected behaviour that we had killed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Breaking up our release notes this way allowed us to spotlight areas for what users at different stages of product adoption cared about, which, if you think about it, is Product Marketing 101 in principle. Plus, it also let us push these notes straight from GitHub into a blog-page-like layout on our earliest version of our website. Anyone on that blah avatar of our site instead of on GitHub could now discover features, see our release cadence, and sign up.</p>
<h3>Tactic #3: Repurposing content</h3>
<p>“Yeah, sure! Content. Isn’t everyone and their grandma doing content? Like literally.”</p>
<p>Bear with me while we do some back-of-the-hand math.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have had 12 releases so far.</li>
<li>In total, we have talked about,<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>2 major features</li>
<li>4 noteworthy improvements</li>
<li>15 bugs squashed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simplistically, that’s 21 unique things to talk about.</li>
<li>For just five experimental destinations where our audience hung out, that was 105 opportunities to show Plane off.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we didn’t have 105 things to talk about in January and you can’t talk about everything with everyone anyway, but you can see how it compounds over months. With a simple calendar on Notion—this was before Plane got its own calendar view of tasks—, we could talk about almost all of our product as it got built in different ways to different audiences on different social networks—all of this over and above one-and-done release notes.</p>
<div><div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/talking-about-deploy-on-reddit-and-discord-plane.webp"></p></div><div><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p>🛰️ Introducing Plane Deploy</p><p>Now publish your project boards live with Plane Deploy.

<div><div><p>What worked #4</p><div><ul>
<li>Cycling posts through five destinations</li>
<li>Bringing older updates back up to the top of our users’ feeds</li>
<li>Figuring out destinations and networks that were working well</li>
<li>Doubling down on them and discarding others in the short-term</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #4</p><div><ul>
<li>No variation in language or tone for different channels</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<h3>Tactic #4: Deliberate distribution</h3>
<p>The two networks we saw traction with for our early social posts were Reddit and Twitter.</p>
<p>While most marketers will tell you to step gingerly on Reddit, we left that advice to marketers. We are Redditors ourselves and we sort of get what works for other Redditors—transparency, humility, and value. Reddit also loves open source, so we knew Reddit could be one of our biggest sources of traffic and sign-ups, so planned for Reddit first.</p>
<p>Despite the humbling ten or fourteen upvotes we had seen thus far, we continued distributing our content consistently, experimenting with tone, style, formats, and even sub-reddits, Reddit destinations dedicated to topics. We had already seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/" target="_blank">r/selfhosted</a>, an active and popular community of open-source buffs, show interest in Plane, so we continued engaging with users there, but we also moved into several other sub-reddits for,</p>
<ul>
<li>Project management and agile because we are all about that life</li>
<li>Next.js because we have a bunch of it in our tech stack</li>
</ul>
<p>In each one of these sub-reddits, Plane became a showcase for our philosophies, implementation, and vision, but most of all, audiences saw our consistency in not just putting up Plane updates but also in responding to questions, how-tos, feedback, and sometimes, criticism. Interest and sign-ups kept ticking up and to the right.</p>
<div><blockquote>Looking back, that kind of consistency and careful engagement is everything in early-stage communication irrespective of the social network or channel you are on. It snowballs into a word-of-mouth engine that begins to run all on its own soon enough.</blockquote></div>
<p>Back then, though, we were antsy for anything that caused a spike. Consistency and gradual upticks were okay, but we were looking to shoot past our local maxima.</p>
<h2>Climbing up</h2>
<p>The first hit came with primetime Reddit engagement—a hundred upvotes on one post—for <a href="https://github.com/makeplane/plane/pull/315" target="_blank">our Github Sync feature</a>.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/85-upvotes-reddit.webp"></p></div>
<p>While feedback flowed in in varying shades of constructive, uplifting, and occasionally, slices of humble pie, what also twinkled in were GitHub stars—all 300 of them from that post alone.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/star-growth-plane.webp"></p></div>
<p>Those users also got into our Discord and engaged with us about new features, which turned into a conversational flywheel between them and existing users. Love, impatience, sometimes disappointment flowed through our Discord.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/traffic-on-discord-from-reddit.webp"></p></div>
<p>We doubled down on Reddit and continued to make those more upfront, readable, and engaging. The numbers showed us it was working.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/upvoted-posts-from-plane-reddit.webp"></p><div><p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ilyamkin" target="_blank">Ilya Lyamkin</a> for the research, the screenshot, and the participation in a testy conversation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What worked #5</p><div><ul>
<li>Focusing on one channel before adding any other</li>
<li>Experimentation with formats, tones, and styles until we found our Reddit sweet spot</li>
<li>Direct access to a release on GitHub from its Reddit post</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #5</p><div><ul>
<li>Talking about every bug or minor improvement</li>
<li>Excessive promotion or cross-posting</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<p>Coming off of our wins on Reddit, we added Twitter to the mix. Instead of just cross-posting from Reddit, we made our posts Twitter-native using threads copiously and adding to the regular product updates with community flexes like ↓.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>Exciting news! Plane is now being used in over 40 countries!</p><p>We’re thrilled to see how it’s growing. Thank you to all of our users for
your support and for helping us spread the word about our product around
the world.</p><p>Let’s keep making a positive impact together!
<a href="https://t.co/0zZTe7YyqB">pic.twitter.com/0zZTe7YyqB</a></p><p>— Plane (@planepowers) <a href="https://twitter.com/planepowers/status/1636362628862996480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote></div>
<p>Again, forgive the big words and cut straight to the heart of the share—40 countries. Which was nice.</p>
<p>Engagement per post was <em>meh</em> as you can see for yourself, but we knew from our Reddit experience Twitter gold was just around the corner. Even so, we started getting  <strong>@mention</strong> alerts on Twitter and soon after that, on LinkedIn and Instagram. It wasn't fireworks, but it was a start. We could now measure our inbound interest in chunky percentages and a good 5% to 10% of our first wave of visitors strolled in from these mentions.</p>
<div><div><p>What worked #6</p><div><ul>
<li>Always tagging contributors and other open-source projects</li>
<li>Linking metrics for releases when announcing them</li>
<li>Showing early previews of features in action, usually via a GIF</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #6</p><div><ul>
<li>Automating tweets without careful, careful planning</li>
<li>Linking to our sites and resources a little too much without enough show-and-tell sometimes</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<h2>Shooting for the stars</h2>
<p>We still weren’t cooking with gas, though, so we started toying with the idea of making our first announcement—five months and seven releases from day 0.</p>
<p>Goal? Grow our total and daily active users by 50%. Tall order, we knew, but if you shoot for the stars, you maybe get to the stratosphere.</p>
<p>We brainstormed destinations and methods for our first ever announcement.</p>
<ul>
<li>We could have reached out name publishers and journos who cover project management.
The effort-to-probability-of-success ratio didn’t work in our favor back then.</li>
<li>We could have done it just on our site and distributed that on Reddit and Twitter.
Sounded dumb.</li>
<li>At one point, sky-writing in San Francisco was proposed and weighed in on. Yep, seriously weighed in on.
We dropped the idea like a hot potato when we saw what it would cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tactic #5: Captive audiences</h3>
<p>Until that point, I don’t think any of us had fully realized what had worked for us thus far, but in asking that question, we found the answer to be right in front of our eyes—working with communities. You, dear reader, probably got here much faster than us.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/viharkurama" target="_blank">Vihar</a>, my brother and co-founder, had experience working with techno-business publications on Medium. He started reaching out to those with the organic community and readership numbers to back their popularity. Our pitch was crafted to our strengths and aimed to make it attractive for Medium readers.</p>
<ul>
<li>We had over 2K stars on GitHub at this time.</li>
<li>We had users calling us better than Jira, Monday, and Linear.</li>
<li>We were climbing engagements charts on Reddit and Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of all those who replied with interest, we chose Better Programming for three reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>They had north of 200K subscribers.</li>
<li>Developers and technical audiences flock to them everyday.</li>
<li>Open source was a big theme for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>They were also great collaborators for how to get the most eyeballs on our post and agreed to feature us on their home page.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/asking-for-distribution-from-better-programming-medium.webp"></p><p>Better Programming’s home page + Medium’s own distribution worked out pretty.</p></div>
<p>May the fourth was with us when we introduced Plane formally to the world <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/introducing-plane-simple-extensible-open-source-project-management-tool-d56dfac886ed" target="_blank">in a post</a> that is now our #1 source of traffic and is as strong a backlink as we could have hoped for then.</p>
<div><video autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/18k-19.webm" type="video/webm"><p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p></video></div>
<p>If there’s one metric I am proud of, it’s the <strong>Read ratio</strong>, telling us our features and the whys behind them won over most readers.</p>
<div><div><p>What worked #7</p><div><ul>
<li>Strategic publisher and audience research</li>
<li>Enough breadcrumbs to the product, Docs, or the <a href="http://plane.so/" target="_blank">plane.so</a> site</li>
<li>Lots of show-don’t-tell</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #7</p><div><ul>
<li>Not planning for reviews and approvals</li>
<li>Going wide, not deep, with distribution</li>
<li>Almost-zero calls to action</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<h3>Tactic #6: Hacking Hacker News</h3>
<p>Hacker News, like Reddit, is frequented by discerning and vocal people who do not shy away from calling BS on, well, whatever’s BS. We had been lurkers on Hacker News, not contributors, but we knew we weren’t going to do more than just introduce ourselves. We were also not going to game upvotes so we could trend.</p>
<p>The first few times were a dud. In one particularly frustrating instance, maybe fourteen people saw the post, three upvoted, and one of them politely commented.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/the-plane-tech-stack-hacker-news.webp"></p></div>
<p>Our fifth try—yep, fifth—looked like ↓ and at the time it read, “Plane: Open source alternative to Atlassian’s Jira.”</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/plane-at-the-top-hacker-news.webp"></p></div>
<p>We took off, largely riding on users complaining about how “crammy”, “janky’” and “sucky” Jira had become over the years and just how much room there was for a simpler, more intuitive, quickstart project management tool. For our part, we answered questions in near-real-time, talked about our roadmap, and discussed our vision for project management that desiloed goals, impact, and projects. The comments, the feedback, the banter were an eyeopener to the opportunity before us, but for now, we watched Plane soar on Hacker News.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/the-problem-with-jira-hacker-news.webp"></p><p>We wonder if Atlassian saw this and cared at all. I would like to think they didn’t. 😛</p></div>
<p>What did it all end up in?</p>
<ul>
<li>We trended on GitHub globally across categories. This is almost like trending globally on Twitter. There. I said it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We got 7,000 GitHub stars from this one post. To put that in context, Hacker News was almost 3X more yieldy than all our previous efforts on Reddit and Twitter.</li>
<li>Big names on Twitter started talking about us.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Publishers started asking for quotes for featured posts.
Remember how we didn’t think media outreach wasn’t going to work for us? Yep.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/open-source-jira-alternative-plane-lands/" target="_blank">The New Stack called our landing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://computingforgeeks.com/plane-project-management-tool" target="_blank">Computing For Geeks got a quickstart guide for developers</a>, our core audience group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our servers crashed if only for 119 seconds.
I will talk about our scaling challenges and how we are solving for them in later posts if there’s interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our GitHub page took a life of its own, getting hundreds of new users everyday over to <a href="https://www.notion.so/9de0f9c4c27a45ec9068330b82e60625?pvs=21" target="_blank">app.plane.so</a>. The star growth was automatic and network effects, amongst other things like word-of-mouth, have kept us going past the 18K-mark.</p>
<div><div><p>What worked #8</p><div><ul>
<li>Preparedness and timing</li>
<li>Experimenting with titles</li>
<li>Responding to questions with GitHub and Discord links</li>
<li>Consistent engagement — contributions to keep up the rank on hackernews page</li>
<li>Talking about the foundations— the tech stack, scale, performance and security.</li>
<li>Not taking potshots at competition</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #8</p><div><ul>
<li>Engaging on off-topic competition and conversations</li>
<li>Defending the unavailability of features</li>
<li>Prioritising customer want vs customers want</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<h3>Tactic #7: Crisis comms</h3>
<p>Not so much <em>crisis comms</em> as much as defending our claims and our joy at topping a category.</p>
<p>I linked to a jibe at the beginning of this post, right around the 14K star mark, that's worth investigating. For those who missed it, it happened when we claimed the #1 popularity spot on GitHub.</p>

<h3>🥴 TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>An X user called our GitHub stars fake and likely paid for.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We responded with transparency about where they came from—you, our amazing, amazing community. 🙏🏾</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Tweeps (Xeeps?) jumped in with research and data validating our claims. 🎉<!-- -->
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/Ilya-and-arek-on-planes-stars-twitter.webp"></p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A few things we took away from that episode.</p>
<ul>
<li>We had broken an apparently significant ceiling.</li>
<li>Our authenticity garnered us support from the larger, non-Plane community.</li>
<li>We should have celebrated our differentiators and use cases Plane is good for, something we are still working on.<!-- -->
<div><p><img src="https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/gergely-and-vamsi-about-stars-twitter.webp"></p><div><p> I couldn’t be more thankful to <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz" target="_blank"> Gergely Orosz </a> who challenged us about our flexes and was kind enough to remove a tweet (xeet?) that we both agreed was suggestive.</p></div></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div><div><p>What worked #9</p><div><ul>
<li>Defending ourselves because we had a right to</li>
<li>Not soliciting defense from our users</li>
<li>Not treating it like, “Any publicity is good publicity”</li>
</ul></div></div><div><p>What didn’t #9</p><div><ul>
<li>Not showing proof in numbers</li>
<li>Being a little too brash about our defense</li>
<li>Being tone-deaf about differentiators and use cases</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<h2>The path forward from here</h2>
<p>Just the other day, I found <a href="https://twitter.com/PrettierCode/status/1729183057356497166" target="_blank">this tweet from Prettier</a> about a bounty they ran just so they can up their game. Note that the Prettier site runs off of Netlify. Guillermo Rauch doubled their original bounty. Guillermo is the chief at Vercel, a Netlify competitor.</p>
<p>Open source is wild country and the one sureshot way to stay top-of-mind here is an unrelenting commitment to open source, even from COSS start-ups like ours, scale-ups like Posthog, or whales like Cal.com.</p>
<p>Again, we are not the first and certainly not the fastest to get here. GitLab, MongoDB, and Snowflake have been-there-done-that for years. Alternatives to proprietary software like Supabase, a Firebase alternative, Medusa, a Shopify alternative, and NocoDB, an Airtable alternative are all upping the game for everyone, including other open source players.</p>
<p>We have been lucky a lot to have found early adopters, checked a few important boxes along the way, and stayed ears-to-the-ground with our community. Getting to 20K stars as of the writing of this post has been very motivating and it's even led to a ROSS Index listing, but again, stars are just one metric.</p>
<p>Finding a path forward from GitHub stars to hard product metrics—adoption, retention, and referrals—that will spell a stronger PMF, especially when we launch pricing, will mean doubling down on everything we have done so far, experimenting with more—the idea of a bounty comes to mind 🙂—, and making your-feedback-is-our-roadmap our mantra.</p>
<p>So, we will go do just that. And we will talk about that, too. Stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]></description>

However, it was a frustrating experience as the staff didn't always update the website regularly, and we'd find that any suitable cats would be snapped up before we'd even seen them.<p>I spotted that the website served its data to the frontend via an unsecured internal JSON API, so I built an Elixir app that would poll the API endpoint and upsert the cat data into the database. Any new records would get posted to a twitter account (a free way to get notifications on my phone).</p><p>It worked beautifully, and when a black cat called "Fluff" popped up, we both knew he was the right one, and we were able to phone them and arrange a meeting before anyone else. Fast forward five years, and he's sitting next to me on the sofa right now, purring away.

Switching keyboard layouts is possible but exhausting (it's much more pleasant sticking to one); using modifier keys is similarly tedious, and custom setups break and aren't portable.</p><p>So this tool can do:</p><pre><code>    $ echo 'Gruess Gott, Poeten und Abenteuergruetze!' | srgn --german
    Grüß Gott, Poeten und Abenteuergrütze!
</code></pre>
meaning it not only replaces Umlauts and Eszett, it also knows when not to (<i>Poeten</i>), and handles arbitrary compound words. Write your text, slap it all into the tool, it spits out results instantly. The original text can use alternative spellings (ou, ae, ue, ss), which is ergonomic. Combined with tools like AutohotKey, GUI integration through a single keyboard shortcut is possible. See [0] for a similar example.<p>A niche need I haven't yet come across someone else having as well! (just the amount of text explaining what it's all about is saying a lot in terms of specificity...)</p><p>The tool now grew into a tree-sitter based (== language grammar-aware) text manipulation thing, mostly for fun. The bizarre German core is still there however.</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://github.com/alexpovel/betterletter/blob/c19245bf90589aff7fad744981202ae370d66a51/betterletter.ahk">https://github.com/alexpovel/betterletter/blob/c19245bf90589...</a>

Still only a handful of users, but usefull I guess for anyone that wished that e.g. Google maps made it possible to upload a picture to be laid upon the background map.</p><p>Earlier apps:
1 - the UNofficial Prezi Player app. Used in 56 countries, it relied upon a hack to be able to play a prezi on an Android phone or tablet. Was quite succesfull, untill of course Prezi made an official Android app of their own. (Actually: demonstrated it to Prezi and they asked nicely to make sure no one would think it was official)</p><p>2 - a ‘fixer’ of Prezi’s. This was in the time that Prezi’s could become ‘corrupt’ as one of the elements was to small such that the code would give a ‘divided by zero’ problem. I fixed a lot of these errors by hand, before I made a (paid) service, and before that a java program that fixed this by going into an XML file, finding the smallest item, and enlarging it.
(Am very happy with Prezi by the way, was invited (but declined in the end) to join them for a hackathon in Budapest, was made their first ‘prezi champion of the month’, and they gifted me a life long licence for their software).</p><p>3 - I do have another app - LetsDoThis - but this one is different: it did not scratch one of my own itches, but that of my eldest daughter: she wanted to ‘swipe’ away choices like one can on Tinder. This app never really went of (my daughter did not come through on her promise to market it among her fellow students;-0</p><p>(Edit: added ‘1’ ‘2’ etc)

Around 5 years ago, I was looking to install a camera in our living room. I couldn't find anything I trusted that worked completely offline without some companion app pinging their servers. So I bought a basic IP camera on Amazon that supports rtsp and a raspberry pi. Created a fenced wifi network and added the camera to it.</p><p>Had an FFmpeg process read camera stream on demand and write to local buffers. Wrote a simple python server to listen for incoming connections on a different interface and stream the video on API requests. Then built an android app that talks to the python server to stream video on demand.</p><p>Also installed motion (<a href="https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion">https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion</a>) on raspberry pi to detect motion in the video and store those snippets to local storage. With motion running, the adapter I was using wasn't delivering enough power resulting in storage occasionally unmounting and raspberry pi restarting taking the camera system offline. With motion detection disabled, the entire setup ran reliably for many years.

Some of them were things I imagined would be startups, and built at scale over 6-12 months, but realized I was the only person who had a use for.<p>So like, during covid lockdown I wanted to assess cumulative risk from me going to the supermarket, or seeing my girlfriend, or each of us hanging out with meeting 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 people per day. This led to me writing a pretty insane Markov Chain engine/GUI for defining time- or repetition-based curves for expected outcomes of bespoke events (basically like: I go to a bar N times, each one gives me a probability of encountering covid around 5%, if any of those happens it triggers another event in which having a covid-positive test result goes in a parabolic curve from 0% to 100% and back over the 12 days from contact, anchored around day 5), and chaining them together with other events that would only happen if the initial conditions had been met. I credit that beast with preventing me from getting covid... but it's also basically so visually insane and complicated that just explaining to someone why they'd need it would be pointless. Yet it has an entire login system, a custom engine in PixiJS for drawing time curves, and a whole multi-threaded worker system on the back and front for comparing monte carlo versions of the chains. Me and one friend are the only users.</p><p>[edit] Also: An engine for identifying stock market patterns. It's my form of "low frequency trading" - one of the goals being to avoid wash sales. So far, averaged over last 2 years it's turned out trades about 14% over base increase/decrease on the stocks it's trading... and I set aside a fund with which I follow it religiously. It only suggests trades every month or two. I have no interest in making picks for other people, or in trying to market the software. Occasionally I give my brothers tips from it.

So, I built a list of galleries from 3 different directories and came up with a master list of 353 art gallery websites. I created a Puppeteer script that snapshots every site on Sunday morning and then an enrichment script gathers current metadata from the Google Maps API. There were some growing pains and problems with encodings that nuked Puppeteer. Also, some CDNs were aggressive and blocked the requests. Over a few months I worked through all the issues as a small side project after work. Now it works perfectly.

It's absolutely re-inventing the wheel, but since I could just not find <i>anything</i> existing that really worked for me (heh!), I'm now dragging that particular millstone along as well.<p>It mostly connects to hosts over SSH, and uses CLI commands to gather data and make configuration changes as needed. Think things like NMVe storage health, disk space usage, Windows AD/Exchange/SQL/VSS health, Docker containers, reverse proxy mappings, Netflows hinting at BitTorrent or other data exfiltration, finding a MAC on a port, configuring VLAN access for a port/trunk, Wireguard tunnels, etc.</p><p>It's absolutely horrible, code-wise, since I tend to use this project to experiment with just about anything I think of. Current rewrite is about 2 years old, C#/.NET 5-&gt;8, UI using Tailwind and htmx, plus chartjs for the pretty pictures, although I have some custom rendering things for switch ports and traffic. Data store is SQLite, with some hacked-on time series features, and this is probably the most terrifying part of the whole mess, since I explored some <i>really</i> bad ideas there. But that also lead to some very good stuff for other projects, so possibly still a net win.

These days I build everything for myself, then publish and see if someone else is interested (mostly not :-)<p>First thing I built, when I started doing full-stack stuff: <a href="https://pushdata.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pushdata.io</a>
It's a super simple time series data storage. You don't even have to register an account, just do "curl -X POST <a href="https://pushdata.io/youremail@yourdomain.com/temperature/47" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pushdata.io/youremail@yourdomain.com/temperature/47</a>" and you've stored your first value. I use it a lot to log various stats about all the things I've built, like user signups or whatnot.</p><p>Then I wanted to create simple crosswords with image clues to help my kids learn to read. That resulted in a crossword generator backend and a simple game: <a href="https://puzzlepirate.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://puzzlepirate.net</a></p><p>Puzzle pirate is great, but I wanted to print the crosswords on paper also, so I slapped together <a href="https://crosswordcomputer.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://crosswordcomputer.com</a>. The UI is rather ugly (like Pushdata) but you can create pretty cool crosswords for kids with it.</p><p>Then I wanted to create more flexible shields.io so I created <a href="https://supershields.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://supershields.io</a> - basically a shields.io but with programmable (in Lua) logic for the shields you create. I'm not using it myself anymore though so not maintaining it very well and it seems there is something funny with the Lua execution right now. It is using AWS Lambda servers to run Lua scripts, perhaps they're not firing as they should or something. If someone wants to use it, get in touch and I'll see if I can get the Lua execution operational again :)</p><p>I also wanted to backup private photos and videos from household phones to a USB memory on a local storage server (Raspberry Pi) and then have that server automatically back everything to the public cloud but encrypted (as I don't trust public cloud providers to keep my data safe forever). I couldn't find a good solution for this, so I wrote some shell scripts that do the trick: <a href="https://github.com/ragnarlonn/savethepictures">https://github.com/ragnarlonn/savethepictures</a></p><p>My daughter was playing Minecraft too much, on our own server, and I created a small Python program to enforce "screen time" in Minecraft: <a href="https://github.com/ragnarlonn/mctimer">https://github.com/ragnarlonn/mctimer</a></p><p>I once needed to simulate broken DHCP clients and couldn't find a good tool to do so, so I wrote "dhcptool": <a href="https://github.com/ragnarlonn/dhcptool">https://github.com/ragnarlonn/dhcptool</a></p><p>All of these taught me a lot, especially the later forays into full-stack development after having been pretty much clueless about frontend stuff for a long time (still clueless but at least I can create ugly UIs now).
