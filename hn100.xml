<p dir="auto">Features marked with a <strong>*</strong> have been back-ported to youtube-dl</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Differences in default behavior</h3>
<p dir="auto">Some of yt-dlp's default options are different from that of youtube-dl and youtube-dlc:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>yt-dlp supports only <a href="##" title="Windows 7">Python 3.7+</a>, and <em>may</em> remove support for more versions as they <a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/#python-release-cycle" rel="nofollow">become EOL</a>; while <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30568#issue-1118238743" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30568/hovercard">youtube-dl still supports Python 2.6+ and 3.2+</a></li>
<li>The options <code>--auto-number</code> (<code>-A</code>), <code>--title</code> (<code>-t</code>) and <code>--literal</code> (<code>-l</code>), no longer work. See <a href="#Removed">removed options</a> for details</li>
<li><code>avconv</code> is not supported as an alternative to <code>ffmpeg</code></li>
<li>yt-dlp stores config files in slightly different locations to youtube-dl. See <a href="#configuration">CONFIGURATION</a> for a list of correct locations</li>
<li>The default <a href="#output-template">output template</a> is <code>%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s</code>. There is no real reason for this change. This was changed before yt-dlp was ever made public and now there are no plans to change it back to <code>%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s</code>. Instead, you may use <code>--compat-options filename</code></li>
<li>The default <a href="#sorting-formats">format sorting</a> is different from youtube-dl and prefers higher resolution and better codecs rather than higher bitrates. You can use the <code>--format-sort</code> option to change this to any order you prefer, or use <code>--compat-options format-sort</code> to use youtube-dl's sorting order</li>
<li>The default format selector is <code>bv*+ba/b</code>. This means that if a combined video + audio format that is better than the best video-only format is found, the former will be preferred. Use <code>-f bv+ba/b</code> or <code>--compat-options format-spec</code> to revert this</li>
<li>Unlike youtube-dlc, yt-dlp does not allow merging multiple audio/video streams into one file by default (since this conflicts with the use of <code>-f bv*+ba</code>). If needed, this feature must be enabled using <code>--audio-multistreams</code> and <code>--video-multistreams</code>. You can also use <code>--compat-options multistreams</code> to enable both</li>
<li><code>--no-abort-on-error</code> is enabled by default. Use <code>--abort-on-error</code> or <code>--compat-options abort-on-error</code> to abort on errors instead</li>
<li>When writing metadata files such as thumbnails, description or infojson, the same information (if available) is also written for playlists. Use <code>--no-write-playlist-metafiles</code> or <code>--compat-options no-playlist-metafiles</code> to not write these files</li>
<li><code>--add-metadata</code> attaches the <code>infojson</code> to <code>mkv</code> files in addition to writing the metadata when used with <code>--write-info-json</code>. Use <code>--no-embed-info-json</code> or <code>--compat-options no-attach-info-json</code> to revert this</li>
<li>Some metadata are embedded into different fields when using <code>--add-metadata</code> as compared to youtube-dl. Most notably, <code>comment</code> field contains the <code>webpage_url</code> and <code>synopsis</code> contains the <code>description</code>. You can <a href="#modifying-metadata">use <code>--parse-metadata</code></a> to modify this to your liking or use <code>--compat-options embed-metadata</code> to revert this</li>
<li><code>playlist_index</code> behaves differently when used with options like <code>--playlist-reverse</code> and <code>--playlist-items</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/302" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/302/hovercard">#302</a> for details. You can use <code>--compat-options playlist-index</code> if you want to keep the earlier behavior</li>
<li>The output of <code>-F</code> is listed in a new format. Use <code>--compat-options list-formats</code> to revert this</li>
<li>Live chats (if available) are considered as subtitles. Use <code>--sub-langs all,-live_chat</code> to download all subtitles except live chat. You can also use <code>--compat-options no-live-chat</code> to prevent any live chat/danmaku from downloading</li>
<li>YouTube channel URLs download all uploads of the channel. To download only the videos in a specific tab, pass the tab's URL. If the channel does not show the requested tab, an error will be raised. Also, <code>/live</code> URLs raise an error if there are no live videos instead of silently downloading the entire channel. You may use <code>--compat-options no-youtube-channel-redirect</code> to revert all these redirections</li>
<li>Unavailable videos are also listed for YouTube playlists. Use <code>--compat-options no-youtube-unavailable-videos</code> to remove this</li>
<li>The upload dates extracted from YouTube are in UTC <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/89e4d86171c7b7c997c77d4714542e0383bf0db0/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#L3898-L3900">when available</a>. Use <code>--compat-options no-youtube-prefer-utc-upload-date</code> to prefer the non-UTC upload date.</li>
<li>If <code>ffmpeg</code> is used as the downloader, the downloading and merging of formats happen in a single step when possible. Use <code>--compat-options no-direct-merge</code> to revert this</li>
<li>Thumbnail embedding in <code>mp4</code> is done with mutagen if possible. Use <code>--compat-options embed-thumbnail-atomicparsley</code> to force the use of AtomicParsley instead</li>
<li>Some internal metadata such as filenames are removed by default from the infojson. Use <code>--no-clean-infojson</code> or <code>--compat-options no-clean-infojson</code> to revert this</li>
<li>When <code>--embed-subs</code> and <code>--write-subs</code> are used together, the subtitles are written to disk and also embedded in the media file. You can use just <code>--embed-subs</code> to embed the subs and automatically delete the separate file. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/630#issuecomment-893659460" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/630/hovercard">#630 (comment)</a> for more info. <code>--compat-options no-keep-subs</code> can be used to revert this</li>
<li><code>certifi</code> will be used for SSL root certificates, if installed. If you want to use system certificates (e.g. self-signed), use <code>--compat-options no-certifi</code></li>
<li>yt-dlp's sanitization of invalid characters in filenames is different/smarter than in youtube-dl. You can use <code>--compat-options filename-sanitization</code> to revert to youtube-dl's behavior</li>
<li>yt-dlp tries to parse the external downloader outputs into the standard progress output if possible (Currently implemented: <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/5931" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/5931/hovercard"><del>aria2c</del></a>). You can use <code>--compat-options no-external-downloader-progress</code> to get the downloader output as-is</li>
<li>yt-dlp versions between 2021.09.01 and 2023.01.02 applies <code>--match-filter</code> to nested playlists. This was an unintentional side-effect of <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/8f18aca8717bb0dd49054555af8d386e5eda3a88">8f18ac</a> and is fixed in <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/d7b460d0e5fc710950582baed2e3fc616ed98a80">d7b460</a>. Use <code>--compat-options playlist-match-filter</code> to revert this</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For ease of use, a few more compat options are available:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--compat-options all</code>: Use all compat options (Do NOT use)</li>
<li><code>--compat-options youtube-dl</code>: Same as <code>--compat-options all,-multistreams,-playlist-match-filter</code></li>
<li><code>--compat-options youtube-dlc</code>: Same as <code>--compat-options all,-no-live-chat,-no-youtube-channel-redirect,-playlist-match-filter</code></li>
<li><code>--compat-options 2021</code>: Same as <code>--compat-options 2022,no-certifi,filename-sanitization,no-youtube-prefer-utc-upload-date</code></li>
<li><code>--compat-options 2022</code>: Same as <code>--compat-options playlist-match-filter,no-external-downloader-progress</code>. Use this to enable all future compat options</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">You can install yt-dlp using <a href="#release-files">the binaries</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp" rel="nofollow">pip</a> or one using a third-party package manager. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation">the wiki</a> for detailed instructions</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UPDATE</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>yt-dlp -U</code> to update if you are using the <a href="#release-files">release binaries</a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip">installed with pip</a>, simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program</p>
<p dir="auto">For other third-party package managers, see <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#third-party-package-managers">the wiki</a> or refer their documentation</p>
<a id="user-content-update-channels">
</a><p dir="auto">There are currently two release channels for binaries, <code>stable</code> and <code>nightly</code>.
<code>stable</code> is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the nightly channel.
The <code>nightly</code> channel has releases built after each push to the master branch, and will have the most recent fixes and additions, but also have more risk of regressions. They are available in <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases">their own repo</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using <code>--update</code>/<code>-U</code>, a release binary will only update to its current channel.
<code>--update-to CHANNEL</code> can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. <code>--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG</code> can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may also use <code>--update-to &lt;repository&gt;</code> (<code>&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;</code>) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example usage:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>yt-dlp --update-to nightly</code> change to <code>nightly</code> channel and update to its latest release</li>
<li><code>yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.02.17</code> upgrade/downgrade to release to <code>stable</code> channel tag <code>2023.02.17</code></li>
<li><code>yt-dlp --update-to 2023.01.06</code> upgrade/downgrade to tag <code>2023.01.06</code> if it exists on the current channel</li>
<li><code>yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.03.01</code> upgrade/downgrade to the release from the <code>example/yt-dlp</code> repository, tag <code>2023.03.01</code></li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">COMPILE</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Standalone PyInstaller Builds</h3>
<p dir="auto">To build the standalone executable, you must have Python and <code>pyinstaller</code> (plus any of yt-dlp's <a href="#dependencies">optional dependencies</a> if needed). Once you have all the necessary dependencies installed, simply run <code>pyinst.py</code>. The executable will be built for the same architecture (x86/ARM, 32/64 bit) as the Python used.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python3 -m pip install -U pyinstaller -r requirements.txt

</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">On some systems, you may need to use <code>py</code> or <code>python</code> instead of <code>python3</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pyinst.py</code> accepts any arguments that can be passed to <code>pyinstaller</code>, such as <code>--onefile/-F</code> or <code>--onedir/-D</code>, which is further <a href="https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate" rel="nofollow">documented here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms">do not support</a> Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Important</strong>: Running <code>pyinstaller</code> directly <strong>without</strong> using <code>pyinst.py</code> is <strong>not</strong> officially supported. This may or may not work correctly.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Platform-independent Binary (UNIX)</h3>
<p dir="auto">You will need the build tools <code>python</code> (3.7+), <code>zip</code>, <code>make</code> (GNU), <code>pandoc</code>* and <code>pytest</code>*.</p>
<p dir="auto">After installing these, simply run <code>make</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also run <code>make yt-dlp</code> instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with <strong>*</strong> are not needed for this)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Standalone Py2Exe Builds (Windows)</h3>
<p dir="auto">While we provide the option to build with <a href="https://www.py2exe.org/" rel="nofollow">py2exe</a>, it is recommended to build <a href="#standalone-pyinstaller-builds">using PyInstaller</a> instead since the py2exe builds <strong>cannot contain <code>pycryptodomex</code>/<code>certifi</code> and needs VC++14</strong> on the target computer to run.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to build it anyway, install Python and py2exe, and then simply run <code>setup.py py2exe</code></p>

                                the resulting video may have fewer artifacts
                                around the cuts

                                template can be used to pass any field as
                                arguments to the command. If no fields are
                                passed, %(filepath,_filename|)q is appended
                                to the end of the command. This option can
                                be used multiple times
--no-exec                       Remove any previously defined --exec

--split-chapters                Split video into multiple files based on
                                internal chapters. The "chapter:" prefix can
                                be used with "--paths" and "--output" to set
                                the output filename for the split files. See
                                "OUTPUT TEMPLATE" for details
--no-split-chapters             Do not split video based on chapters (default)
--remove-chapters REGEX         Remove chapters whose title matches the
                                given regular expression. The syntax is the
                                same as --download-sections. This option can
                                be used multiple times
--no-remove-chapters            Do not remove any chapters from the file

--force-keyframes-at-cuts       Force keyframes at cuts when
                                downloading/splitting/removing sections.
                                This is slow due to needing a re-encode, but
                                the resulting video may have fewer artifacts
                                around the cuts
--no-force-keyframes-at-cuts    Do not force keyframes around the chapters
                                when cutting/splitting (default)
--use-postprocessor NAME[:ARGS]
                                The (case sensitive) name of plugin
                                postprocessors to be enabled, and
                                (optionally) arguments to be passed to it,
                                separated by a colon ":". ARGS are a
                                semicolon ";" delimited list of NAME=VALUE.
                                The "when" argument determines when the
                                postprocessor is invoked. It can be one of
                                "pre_process" (after video extraction),
                                "after_filter" (after video passes filter),
                                "video" (after --format; before
                                --print/--output), "before_dl" (before each
                                video download), "post_process" (after each
                                video download; default), "after_move"
                                (after moving video file to it's final
                                locations), "after_video" (after downloading
                                and processing all formats of a video), or
                                "playlist" (at end of playlist). This option
                                can be used multiple times to add different
                                postprocessors

<p dir="auto">E.g. with the following configuration file yt-dlp will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under <code>YouTube</code> directory in your home directory:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Lines starting with # are comments

# Always extract audio
-x

# Do not copy the mtime
--no-mtime

# Use this proxy
--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128

# Save all videos under YouTube directory in your home directory
-o ~/YouTube/%(title)s.%(ext)s"><pre><code># Lines starting with # are comments

# Always extract audio
-x

# Do not copy the mtime
--no-mtime

# Use this proxy
--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128

# Save all videos under YouTube directory in your home directory
-o ~/YouTube/%(title)s.%(ext)s
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls; thus there <strong>must be no whitespace</strong> after <code>-</code> or <code>--</code>, e.g. <code>-o</code> or <code>--proxy</code> but not <code>- o</code> or <code>-- proxy</code>. They must also be quoted when necessary as-if it were a UNIX shell.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>--ignore-config</code> if you want to disable all configuration files for a particular yt-dlp run. If <code>--ignore-config</code> is found inside any configuration file, no further configuration will be loaded. For example, having the option in the portable configuration file prevents loading of home, user, and system configurations. Additionally, (for backward compatibility) if <code>--ignore-config</code> is found inside the system configuration file, the user configuration is not loaded.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration file encoding</h3>
<p dir="auto">The configuration files are decoded according to the UTF BOM if present, and in the encoding from system locale otherwise.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want your file to be decoded differently, add <code># coding: ENCODING</code> to the beginning of the file (e.g. <code># coding: shift-jis</code>). There must be no characters before that, even spaces or BOM.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Authentication with netrc</h3>
<p dir="auto">You may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with <code>--username</code> and <code>--password</code>) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every yt-dlp execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can achieve this using a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info" rel="nofollow"><code>.netrc</code> file</a> on a per-extractor basis. For that you will need to create a <code>.netrc</code> file in <code>--netrc-location</code> and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="touch ${HOME}/.netrc
chmod a-rwx,u+rw ${HOME}/.netrc"><pre><code>touch ${HOME}/.netrc
chmod a-rwx,u+rw ${HOME}/.netrc
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">After that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where <em>extractor</em> is the name of the extractor in lowercase:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="machine <extractor> login <username> password <password>"><pre><code>machine &lt;extractor&gt; login &lt;username&gt; password &lt;password&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">E.g.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password"><pre><code>machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To activate authentication with the <code>.netrc</code> file you should pass <code>--netrc</code> to yt-dlp or place it in the <a href="#configuration">configuration file</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The default location of the .netrc file is <code>~</code> (see below).</p>
<p dir="auto">As an alternative to using the <code>.netrc</code> file, which has the disadvantage of keeping your passwords in a plain text file, you can configure a custom shell command to provide the credentials for an extractor. This is done by providing the <code>--netrc-cmd</code> parameter, it shall output the credentials in the netrc format and return <code>0</code> on success, other values will be treated as an error. <code>{}</code> in the command will be replaced by the name of the extractor to make it possible to select the credentials for the right extractor.</p>
<p dir="auto">E.g. To use an encrypted <code>.netrc</code> file stored as <code>.authinfo.gpg</code></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="yt-dlp --netrc-cmd 'gpg --decrypt ~/.authinfo.gpg' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc"><pre><code>yt-dlp --netrc-cmd 'gpg --decrypt ~/.authinfo.gpg' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes about environment variables</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Environment variables are normally specified as <code>${VARIABLE}</code>/<code>$VARIABLE</code> on UNIX and <code>%VARIABLE%</code> on Windows; but is always shown as <code>${VARIABLE}</code> in this documentation</li>
<li>yt-dlp also allow using UNIX-style variables on Windows for path-like options; e.g. <code>--output</code>, <code>--config-location</code></li>
<li>If unset, <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}</code> defaults to <code>~/.config</code> and <code>${XDG_CACHE_HOME}</code> to <code>~/.cache</code></li>
<li>On Windows, <code>~</code> points to <code>${HOME}</code> if present; or, <code>${USERPROFILE}</code> or <code>${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}</code> otherwise</li>
<li>On Windows, <code>${USERPROFILE}</code> generally points to <code>C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;</code> and <code>${APPDATA}</code> to <code>${USERPROFILE}\AppData\Roaming</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OUTPUT TEMPLATE</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-o</code> option is used to indicate a template for the output file names while <code>-P</code> option is used to specify the path each type of file should be saved to.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <a href="#output-template-examples">navigate me to examples</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The simplest usage of <code>-o</code> is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file, like in <code>yt-dlp -o funny_video.flv "https://some/video"</code> (hard-coding file extension like this is <em>not</em> recommended and could break some post-processing).</p>
<p dir="auto">It may however also contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each video. The special sequences may be formatted according to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting" rel="nofollow">Python string formatting operations</a>, e.g. <code>%(NAME)s</code> or <code>%(NAME)05d</code>. To clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses, followed by formatting operations.</p>
<p dir="auto">The field names themselves (the part inside the parenthesis) can also have some special formatting:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Object traversal</strong>: The dictionaries and lists available in metadata can be traversed by using a dot <code>.</code> separator; e.g. <code>%(tags.0)s</code>, <code>%(subtitles.en.-1.ext)s</code>. You can do Python slicing with colon <code>:</code>; E.g. <code>%(id.3:7:-1)s</code>, <code>%(formats.:.format_id)s</code>. Curly braces <code>{}</code> can be used to build dictionaries with only specific keys; e.g. <code>%(formats.:.{format_id,height})#j</code>. An empty field name <code>%()s</code> refers to the entire infodict; e.g. <code>%(.{id,title})s</code>. Note that all the fields that become available using this method are not listed below. Use <code>-j</code> to see such fields</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Addition</strong>: Addition and subtraction of numeric fields can be done using <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> respectively. E.g. <code>%(playlist_index+10)03d</code>, <code>%(n_entries+1-playlist_index)d</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Date/time Formatting</strong>: Date/time fields can be formatted according to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes" rel="nofollow">strftime formatting</a> by specifying it separated from the field name using a <code>&gt;</code>. E.g. <code>%(duration&gt;%H-%M-%S)s</code>, <code>%(upload_date&gt;%Y-%m-%d)s</code>, <code>%(epoch-3600&gt;%H-%M-%S)s</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Alternate fields can be specified separated with a <code>,</code>. E.g. <code>%(release_date&gt;%Y,upload_date&gt;%Y|Unknown)s</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Replacement</strong>: A replacement value can be specified using a <code>&amp;</code> separator according to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format</code> mini-language</a>. If the field is <em>not</em> empty, this replacement value will be used instead of the actual field content. This is done after alternate fields are considered; thus the replacement is used if <em>any</em> of the alternative fields is <em>not</em> empty. E.g. <code>%(chapters&amp;has chapters|no chapters)s</code>, <code>%(title&amp;TITLE={:&gt;20}|NO TITLE)s</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Default</strong>: A literal default value can be specified for when the field is empty using a <code>|</code> separator. This overrides <code>--output-na-placeholder</code>. E.g. <code>%(uploader|Unknown)s</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>More Conversions</strong>: In addition to the normal format types <code>diouxXeEfFgGcrs</code>, yt-dlp additionally supports converting to <code>B</code> = <strong>B</strong>ytes, <code>j</code> = <strong>j</strong>son (flag <code>#</code> for pretty-printing, <code>+</code> for Unicode), <code>h</code> = HTML escaping, <code>l</code> = a comma separated <strong>l</strong>ist (flag <code>#</code> for <code>\n</code> newline-separated), <code>q</code> = a string <strong>q</strong>uoted for the terminal (flag <code>#</code> to split a list into different arguments), <code>D</code> = add <strong>D</strong>ecimal suffixes (e.g. 10M) (flag <code>#</code> to use 1024 as factor), and <code>S</code> = <strong>S</strong>anitize as filename (flag <code>#</code> for restricted)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Unicode normalization</strong>: The format type <code>U</code> can be used for NFC <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize" rel="nofollow">Unicode normalization</a>. The alternate form flag (<code>#</code>) changes the normalization to NFD and the conversion flag <code>+</code> can be used for NFKC/NFKD compatibility equivalence normalization. E.g. <code>%(title)+.100U</code> is NFKC</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">To summarize, the general syntax for a field is:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="%(name[.keys][addition][>strf][,alternate][&amp;replacement][|default])[flags][width][.precision][length]type"><pre><code>%(name[.keys][addition][&gt;strf][,alternate][&amp;replacement][|default])[flags][width][.precision][length]type
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, you can set different output templates for the various metadata files separately from the general output template by specifying the type of file followed by the template separated by a colon <code>:</code>. The different file types supported are <code>subtitle</code>, <code>thumbnail</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>annotation</code> (deprecated), <code>infojson</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>pl_thumbnail</code>, <code>pl_description</code>, <code>pl_infojson</code>, <code>chapter</code>, <code>pl_video</code>. E.g. <code>-o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" -o "thumbnail:%(title)s\%(title)s.%(ext)s"</code>  will put the thumbnails in a folder with the same name as the video. If any of the templates is empty, that type of file will not be written. E.g. <code>--write-thumbnail -o "thumbnail:"</code> will write thumbnails only for playlists and not for video.</p>
<a id="user-content-outtmpl-postprocess-note">
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Due to post-processing (i.e. merging etc.), the actual output filename might differ. Use <code>--print after_move:filepath</code> to get the name after all post-processing is complete.</p>

<p dir="auto">Each aforementioned sequence when referenced in an output template will be replaced by the actual value corresponding to the sequence name. E.g. for <code>-o %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s</code> and an mp4 video with title <code>yt-dlp test video</code> and id <code>BaW_jenozKc</code>, this will result in a <code>yt-dlp test video-BaW_jenozKc.mp4</code> file created in the current directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Some of the sequences are not guaranteed to be present since they depend on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor. Such sequences will be replaced with placeholder value provided with <code>--output-na-placeholder</code> (<code>NA</code> by default).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip</strong>: Look at the <code>-j</code> output to identify which fields are available for the particular URL</p>
<p dir="auto">For numeric sequences you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting" rel="nofollow">numeric related formatting</a>; e.g. <code>%(view_count)05d</code> will result in a string with view count padded with zeros up to 5 characters, like in <code>00042</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Output templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g. <code>-o "%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s"</code> which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding to this path template. Any missing directory will be automatically created for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use percent literals in an output template use <code>%%</code>. To output to stdout use <code>-o -</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current default template is <code>%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In some cases, you don't want special characters such as 中, spaces, or &amp;, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a Windows system or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel. In these cases, add the <code>--restrict-filenames</code> flag to get a shorter title.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FORMAT SELECTION</h2>
<p dir="auto">By default, yt-dlp tries to download the best available quality if you <strong>don't</strong> pass any options.
This is generally equivalent to using <code>-f bestvideo*+bestaudio/best</code>. However, if multiple audiostreams is enabled (<code>--audio-multistreams</code>), the default format changes to <code>-f bestvideo+bestaudio/best</code>. Similarly, if ffmpeg is unavailable, or if you use yt-dlp to stream to <code>stdout</code> (<code>-o -</code>), the default becomes <code>-f best/bestvideo+bestaudio</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deprecation warning</strong>: Latest versions of yt-dlp can stream multiple formats to the stdout simultaneously using ffmpeg. So, in future versions, the default for this will be set to <code>-f bv*+ba/b</code> similar to normal downloads. If you want to preserve the <code>-f b/bv+ba</code> setting, it is recommended to explicitly specify it in the configuration options.</p>
<p dir="auto">The general syntax for format selection is <code>-f FORMAT</code> (or <code>--format FORMAT</code>) where <code>FORMAT</code> is a <em>selector expression</em>, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <a href="#format-selection-examples">navigate me to examples</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The simplest case is requesting a specific format; e.g. with <code>-f 22</code> you can download the format with format code equal to 22. You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using <code>--list-formats</code> or <code>-F</code>. Note that these format codes are extractor specific.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use a file extension (currently <code>3gp</code>, <code>aac</code>, <code>flv</code>, <code>m4a</code>, <code>mp3</code>, <code>mp4</code>, <code>ogg</code>, <code>wav</code>, <code>webm</code> are supported) to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g. <code>-f webm</code> will download the best quality format with the <code>webm</code> extension served as a single file.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>-f -</code> to interactively provide the format selector <em>for each video</em></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>all</code>: Select <strong>all formats</strong> separately</li>
<li><code>mergeall</code>: Select and <strong>merge all formats</strong> (Must be used with <code>--audio-multistreams</code>, <code>--video-multistreams</code> or both)</li>
<li><code>b*</code>, <code>best*</code>: Select the best quality format that <strong>contains either</strong> a video or an audio or both (ie; <code>vcodec!=none or acodec!=none</code>)</li>
<li><code>b</code>, <code>best</code>: Select the best quality format that <strong>contains both</strong> video and audio. Equivalent to <code>best*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]</code></li>
<li><code>bv</code>, <code>bestvideo</code>: Select the best quality <strong>video-only</strong> format. Equivalent to <code>best*[acodec=none]</code></li>
<li><code>bv*</code>, <code>bestvideo*</code>: Select the best quality format that <strong>contains video</strong>. It may also contain audio. Equivalent to <code>best*[vcodec!=none]</code></li>
<li><code>ba</code>, <code>bestaudio</code>: Select the best quality <strong>audio-only</strong> format. Equivalent to <code>best*[vcodec=none]</code></li>
<li><code>ba*</code>, <code>bestaudio*</code>: Select the best quality format that <strong>contains audio</strong>. It may also contain video. Equivalent to <code>best*[acodec!=none]</code> (<a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/979#issuecomment-919629354" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/979/hovercard">Do not use!</a>)</li>
<li><code>w*</code>, <code>worst*</code>: Select the worst quality format that contains either a video or an audio</li>
<li><code>w</code>, <code>worst</code>: Select the worst quality format that contains both video and audio. Equivalent to <code>worst*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]</code></li>
<li><code>wv</code>, <code>worstvideo</code>: Select the worst quality video-only format. Equivalent to <code>worst*[acodec=none]</code></li>
<li><code>wv*</code>, <code>worstvideo*</code>: Select the worst quality format that contains video. It may also contain audio. Equivalent to <code>worst*[vcodec!=none]</code></li>
<li><code>wa</code>, <code>worstaudio</code>: Select the worst quality audio-only format. Equivalent to <code>worst*[vcodec=none]</code></li>
<li><code>wa*</code>, <code>worstaudio*</code>: Select the worst quality format that contains audio. It may also contain video. Equivalent to <code>worst*[acodec!=none]</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use <code>-f worstvideo</code>. It is however recommended not to use <code>worst</code> and related options. When your format selector is <code>worst</code>, the format which is worst in all respects is selected. Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. So it is generally better to use <code>-S +size</code> or more rigorously, <code>-S +size,+br,+res,+fps</code> instead of <code>-f worst</code>. See <a href="#sorting-formats">Sorting Formats</a> for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can select the n'th best format of a type by using <code>best&lt;type&gt;.&lt;n&gt;</code>. For example, <code>best.2</code> will select the 2nd best combined format. Similarly, <code>bv*.3</code> will select the 3rd best format that contains a video stream.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to download multiple videos, and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. Note that formats on the left hand side are preferred; e.g. <code>-f 22/17/18</code> will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator, e.g. <code>-f 22,17,18</code> will download all these three formats, of course if they are available. Or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature: <code>-f 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can merge the video and audio of multiple formats into a single file using <code>-f &lt;format1&gt;+&lt;format2&gt;+...</code> (requires ffmpeg installed); e.g. <code>-f bestvideo+bestaudio</code> will download the best video-only format, the best audio-only format and mux them together with ffmpeg.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deprecation warning</strong>: Since the <em>below</em> described behavior is complex and counter-intuitive, this will be removed and multistreams will be enabled by default in the future. A new operator will be instead added to limit formats to single audio/video</p>
<p dir="auto">Unless <code>--video-multistreams</code> is used, all formats with a video stream except the first one are ignored. Similarly, unless <code>--audio-multistreams</code> is used, all formats with an audio stream except the first one are ignored. E.g. <code>-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --video-multistreams --audio-multistreams</code> will download and merge all 3 given formats. The resulting file will have 2 video streams and 2 audio streams. But <code>-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --no-video-multistreams</code> will download and merge only <code>bestvideo</code> and <code>bestaudio</code>. <code>best</code> is ignored since another format containing a video stream (<code>bestvideo</code>) has already been selected. The order of the formats is therefore important. <code>-f best+bestaudio --no-audio-multistreams</code> will download only <code>best</code> while <code>-f bestaudio+best --no-audio-multistreams</code> will ignore <code>best</code> and download only <code>bestaudio</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Filtering Formats</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in <code>-f "best[height=720]"</code> (or <code>-f "[filesize&gt;10M]"</code> since filters without a selector are interpreted as <code>best</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">The following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>=</code> (equals), <code>!=</code> (not equals):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>filesize</code>: The number of bytes, if known in advance</li>
<li><code>filesize_approx</code>: An estimate for the number of bytes</li>
<li><code>width</code>: Width of the video, if known</li>
<li><code>height</code>: Height of the video, if known</li>
<li><code>aspect_ratio</code>: Aspect ratio of the video, if known</li>
<li><code>tbr</code>: Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>abr</code>: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>vbr</code>: Average video bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>asr</code>: Audio sampling rate in Hertz</li>
<li><code>fps</code>: Frame rate</li>
<li><code>audio_channels</code>: The number of audio channels</li>
<li><code>stretched_ratio</code>: <code>width:height</code> of the video's pixels, if not square</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Also filtering work for comparisons <code>=</code> (equals), <code>^=</code> (starts with), <code>$=</code> (ends with), <code>*=</code> (contains), <code>~=</code> (matches regex) and following string meta fields:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>url</code>: Video URL</li>
<li><code>ext</code>: File extension</li>
<li><code>acodec</code>: Name of the audio codec in use</li>
<li><code>vcodec</code>: Name of the video codec in use</li>
<li><code>container</code>: Name of the container format</li>
<li><code>protocol</code>: The protocol that will be used for the actual download, lower-case (<code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, <code>rtsp</code>, <code>rtmp</code>, <code>rtmpe</code>, <code>mms</code>, <code>f4m</code>, <code>ism</code>, <code>http_dash_segments</code>, <code>m3u8</code>, or <code>m3u8_native</code>)</li>
<li><code>language</code>: Language code</li>
<li><code>dynamic_range</code>: The dynamic range of the video</li>
<li><code>format_id</code>: A short description of the format</li>
<li><code>format</code>: A human-readable description of the format</li>
<li><code>format_note</code>: Additional info about the format</li>
<li><code>resolution</code>: Textual description of width and height</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Any string comparison may be prefixed with negation <code>!</code> in order to produce an opposite comparison, e.g. <code>!*=</code> (does not contain). The comparand of a string comparison needs to be quoted with either double or single quotes if it contains spaces or special characters other than <code>._-</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: None of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by particular extractor, i.e. the metadata offered by the website. Any other field made available by the extractor can also be used for filtering.</p>
<p dir="auto">Formats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (<code>?</code>) after the operator. You can combine format filters, so <code>-f "bv[height&lt;=?720][tbr&gt;500]"</code> selects up to 720p videos (or videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 KBit/s. You can also use the filters with <code>all</code> to download all formats that satisfy the filter, e.g. <code>-f "all[vcodec=none]"</code> selects all audio-only formats.</p>
<p dir="auto">Format selectors can also be grouped using parentheses; e.g. <code>-f "(mp4,webm)[height&lt;480]"</code> will download the best pre-merged mp4 and webm formats with a height lower than 480.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Sorting Formats</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can change the criteria for being considered the <code>best</code> by using <code>-S</code> (<code>--format-sort</code>). The general format for this is <code>--format-sort field1,field2...</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The available fields are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>hasvid</code>: Gives priority to formats that have a video stream</li>
<li><code>hasaud</code>: Gives priority to formats that have an audio stream</li>
<li><code>ie_pref</code>: The format preference</li>
<li><code>lang</code>: The language preference</li>
<li><code>quality</code>: The quality of the format</li>
<li><code>source</code>: The preference of the source</li>
<li><code>proto</code>: Protocol used for download (<code>https</code>/<code>ftps</code> &gt; <code>http</code>/<code>ftp</code> &gt; <code>m3u8_native</code>/<code>m3u8</code> &gt; <code>http_dash_segments</code>&gt; <code>websocket_frag</code> &gt; <code>mms</code>/<code>rtsp</code> &gt; <code>f4f</code>/<code>f4m</code>)</li>
<li><code>vcodec</code>: Video Codec (<code>av01</code> &gt; <code>vp9.2</code> &gt; <code>vp9</code> &gt; <code>h265</code> &gt; <code>h264</code> &gt; <code>vp8</code> &gt; <code>h263</code> &gt; <code>theora</code> &gt; other)</li>
<li><code>acodec</code>: Audio Codec (<code>flac</code>/<code>alac</code> &gt; <code>wav</code>/<code>aiff</code> &gt; <code>opus</code> &gt; <code>vorbis</code> &gt; <code>aac</code> &gt; <code>mp4a</code> &gt; <code>mp3</code> &gt; <code>ac4</code> &gt; <code>eac3</code> &gt; <code>ac3</code> &gt; <code>dts</code> &gt; other)</li>
<li><code>codec</code>: Equivalent to <code>vcodec,acodec</code></li>
<li><code>vext</code>: Video Extension (<code>mp4</code> &gt; <code>mov</code> &gt; <code>webm</code> &gt; <code>flv</code> &gt; other). If <code>--prefer-free-formats</code> is used, <code>webm</code> is preferred.</li>
<li><code>aext</code>: Audio Extension (<code>m4a</code> &gt; <code>aac</code> &gt; <code>mp3</code> &gt; <code>ogg</code> &gt; <code>opus</code> &gt; <code>webm</code> &gt; other). If <code>--prefer-free-formats</code> is used, the order changes to <code>ogg</code> &gt; <code>opus</code> &gt; <code>webm</code> &gt; <code>mp3</code> &gt; <code>m4a</code> &gt; <code>aac</code></li>
<li><code>ext</code>: Equivalent to <code>vext,aext</code></li>
<li><code>filesize</code>: Exact filesize, if known in advance</li>
<li><code>fs_approx</code>: Approximate filesize</li>
<li><code>size</code>: Exact filesize if available, otherwise approximate filesize</li>
<li><code>height</code>: Height of video</li>
<li><code>width</code>: Width of video</li>
<li><code>res</code>: Video resolution, calculated as the smallest dimension.</li>
<li><code>fps</code>: Framerate of video</li>
<li><code>hdr</code>: The dynamic range of the video (<code>DV</code> &gt; <code>HDR12</code> &gt; <code>HDR10+</code> &gt; <code>HDR10</code> &gt; <code>HLG</code> &gt; <code>SDR</code>)</li>
<li><code>channels</code>: The number of audio channels</li>
<li><code>tbr</code>: Total average bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>vbr</code>: Average video bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>abr</code>: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>br</code>: Average bitrate in KBit/s, <code>tbr</code>/<code>vbr</code>/<code>abr</code></li>
<li><code>asr</code>: Audio sample rate in Hz</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deprecation warning</strong>: Many of these fields have (currently undocumented) aliases, that may be removed in a future version. It is recommended to use only the documented field names.</p>
<p dir="auto">All fields, unless specified otherwise, are sorted in descending order. To reverse this, prefix the field with a <code>+</code>. E.g. <code>+res</code> prefers format with the smallest resolution. Additionally, you can suffix a preferred value for the fields, separated by a <code>:</code>. E.g. <code>res:720</code> prefers larger videos, but no larger than 720p and the smallest video if there are no videos less than 720p. For <code>codec</code> and <code>ext</code>, you can provide two preferred values, the first for video and the second for audio. E.g. <code>+codec:avc:m4a</code> (equivalent to <code>+vcodec:avc,+acodec:m4a</code>) sets the video codec preference to <code>h264</code> &gt; <code>h265</code> &gt; <code>vp9</code> &gt; <code>vp9.2</code> &gt; <code>av01</code> &gt; <code>vp8</code> &gt; <code>h263</code> &gt; <code>theora</code> and audio codec preference to <code>mp4a</code> &gt; <code>aac</code> &gt; <code>vorbis</code> &gt; <code>opus</code> &gt; <code>mp3</code> &gt; <code>ac3</code> &gt; <code>dts</code>. You can also make the sorting prefer the nearest values to the provided by using <code>~</code> as the delimiter. E.g. <code>filesize~1G</code> prefers the format with filesize closest to 1 GiB.</p>
<p dir="auto">The fields <code>hasvid</code> and <code>ie_pref</code> are always given highest priority in sorting, irrespective of the user-defined order. This behaviour can be changed by using <code>--format-sort-force</code>. Apart from these, the default order used is: <code>lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,vcodec:vp9.2,channels,acodec,size,br,asr,proto,ext,hasaud,source,id</code>. The extractors may override this default order, but they cannot override the user-provided order.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the default has <code>vcodec:vp9.2</code>; i.e. <code>av1</code> is not preferred. Similarly, the default for hdr is <code>hdr:12</code>; i.e. dolby vision is not preferred. These choices are made since DV and AV1 formats are not yet fully compatible with most devices. This may be changed in the future as more devices become capable of smoothly playing back these formats.</p>
<p dir="auto">If your format selector is <code>worst</code>, the last item is selected after sorting. This means it will select the format that is worst in all respects. Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. So it is generally better to use <code>-f best -S +size,+br,+res,+fps</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip</strong>: You can use the <code>-v -F</code> to see how the formats have been sorted (worst to best).</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">MODIFYING METADATA</h2>
<p dir="auto">The metadata obtained by the extractors can be modified by using <code>--parse-metadata</code> and <code>--replace-in-metadata</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>--replace-in-metadata FIELDS REGEX REPLACE</code> is used to replace text in any metadata field using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">python regular expression</a>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=backreferences#re.sub" rel="nofollow">Backreferences</a> can be used in the replace string for advanced use.</p>
<p dir="auto">The general syntax of <code>--parse-metadata FROM:TO</code> is to give the name of a field or an <a href="#output-template">output template</a> to extract data from, and the format to interpret it as, separated by a colon <code>:</code>. Either a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">python regular expression</a> with named capture groups, a single field name, or a similar syntax to the <a href="#output-template">output template</a> (only <code>%(field)s</code> formatting is supported) can be used for <code>TO</code>. The option can be used multiple times to parse and modify various fields.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that these options preserve their relative order, allowing replacements to be made in parsed fields and viceversa. Also, any field thus created can be used in the <a href="#output-template">output template</a> and will also affect the media file's metadata added when using <code>--embed-metadata</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This option also has a few special uses:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can download an additional URL based on the metadata of the currently downloaded video. To do this, set the field <code>additional_urls</code> to the URL that you want to download. E.g. <code>--parse-metadata "description:(?P&lt;additional_urls&gt;https?://www\.vimeo\.com/\d+)"</code> will download the first vimeo video found in the description</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can use this to change the metadata that is embedded in the media file. To do this, set the value of the corresponding field with a <code>meta_</code> prefix. For example, any value you set to <code>meta_description</code> field will be added to the <code>description</code> field in the file - you can use this to set a different "description" and "synopsis". To modify the metadata of individual streams, use the <code>meta&lt;n&gt;_</code> prefix (e.g. <code>meta1_language</code>). Any value set to the <code>meta_</code> field will overwrite all default values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Metadata modification happens before format selection, post-extraction and other post-processing operations. Some fields may be added or changed during these steps, overriding your changes.</p>
<p dir="auto">For reference, these are the fields yt-dlp adds by default to the file metadata:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EXTRACTOR ARGUMENTS</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some extractors accept additional arguments which can be passed using <code>--extractor-args KEY:ARGS</code>. <code>ARGS</code> is a <code>;</code> (semicolon) separated string of <code>ARG=VAL1,VAL2</code>. E.g. <code>--extractor-args "youtube:player-client=android_embedded,web;include_live_dash" --extractor-args "funimation:version=uncut"</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Note: In CLI, <code>ARG</code> can use <code>-</code> instead of <code>_</code>; e.g. <code>youtube:player-client"</code> becomes <code>youtube:player_client"</code></p>
<p dir="auto">The following extractors use this feature:</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">youtube</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>lang</code>: Prefer translated metadata (<code>title</code>, <code>description</code> etc) of this language code (case-sensitive). By default, the video primary language metadata is preferred, with a fallback to <code>en</code> translated. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c26f9b991a0681fd3ea548d535919cec1fbbd430/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#L381-L390">youtube.py</a> for list of supported content language codes</li>
<li><code>skip</code>: One or more of <code>hls</code>, <code>dash</code> or <code>translated_subs</code> to skip extraction of the m3u8 manifests, dash manifests and <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/4090#issuecomment-1158102032" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/4090/hovercard">auto-translated subtitles</a> respectively</li>
<li><code>player_client</code>: Clients to extract video data from. The main clients are <code>web</code>, <code>android</code> and <code>ios</code> with variants <code>_music</code>, <code>_embedded</code>, <code>_embedscreen</code>, <code>_creator</code> (e.g. <code>web_embedded</code>); and <code>mweb</code> and <code>tv_embedded</code> (agegate bypass) with no variants. By default, <code>ios,android,web</code> is used, but <code>tv_embedded</code> and <code>creator</code> variants are added as required for age-gated videos. Similarly, the music variants are added for <code>music.youtube.com</code> urls. You can use <code>all</code> to use all the clients, and <code>default</code> for the default clients.</li>
<li><code>player_skip</code>: Skip some network requests that are generally needed for robust extraction. One or more of <code>configs</code> (skip client configs), <code>webpage</code> (skip initial webpage), <code>js</code> (skip js player). While these options can help reduce the number of requests needed or avoid some rate-limiting, they could cause some issues.

<li>Extractor plugins do not need to be enabled from the CLI and are automatically invoked when the input URL is suitable for it.</li>
<li>Extractor plugins take priority over builtin extractors.</li>
<li>Postprocessor plugins can be invoked using <code>--use-postprocessor NAME</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Plugins are loaded from the namespace packages <code>yt_dlp_plugins.extractor</code> and <code>yt_dlp_plugins.postprocessor</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In other words, the file structure on the disk looks something like:</p>

<p dir="auto">yt-dlp looks for these <code>yt_dlp_plugins</code> namespace folders in many locations (see below) and loads in plugins from <strong>all</strong> of them.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Plugins">wiki for some known plugins</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installing Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">Plugins can be installed using various methods and locations.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Configuration directories</strong>:
Plugin packages (containing a <code>yt_dlp_plugins</code> namespace folder) can be dropped into the following standard <a href="#configuration">configuration locations</a>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>User Plugins</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp/plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code> (recommended on Linux/macOS)</li>
<li><code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li><code>${APPDATA}/yt-dlp/plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code> (recommended on Windows)</li>
<li><code>${APPDATA}/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li><code>~/.yt-dlp/plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li><code>~/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>System Plugins</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/etc/yt-dlp/plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li><code>/etc/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Executable location</strong>: Plugin packages can similarly be installed in a <code>yt-dlp-plugins</code> directory under the executable location (recommended for portable installations):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Binary: where <code>&lt;root-dir&gt;/yt-dlp.exe</code>, <code>&lt;root-dir&gt;/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li>Source: where <code>&lt;root-dir&gt;/yt_dlp/__main__.py</code>, <code>&lt;root-dir&gt;/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>pip and other locations in <code>PYTHONPATH</code></strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Plugin packages can be installed and managed using <code>pip</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-sample-plugins">yt-dlp-sample-plugins</a> for an example.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Note: plugin files between plugin packages installed with pip must have unique filenames.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any path in <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is searched in for the <code>yt_dlp_plugins</code> namespace folder.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Note: This does not apply for Pyinstaller/py2exe builds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><code>.zip</code>, <code>.egg</code> and <code>.whl</code> archives containing a <code>yt_dlp_plugins</code> namespace folder in their root are also supported as plugin packages.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>e.g. <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp/plugins/mypluginpkg.zip</code> where <code>mypluginpkg.zip</code> contains <code>yt_dlp_plugins/&lt;type&gt;/myplugin.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Run yt-dlp with <code>--verbose</code> to check if the plugin has been loaded.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Developing Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-sample-plugins">yt-dlp-sample-plugins</a> repo for a template plugin package and the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Plugin-Development">Plugin Development</a> section of the wiki for a plugin development guide.</p>
<p dir="auto">All public classes with a name ending in <code>IE</code>/<code>PP</code> are imported from each file for extractors and postprocessors repectively. This respects underscore prefix (e.g. <code>_MyBasePluginIE</code> is private) and <code>__all__</code>. Modules can similarly be excluded by prefixing the module name with an underscore (e.g. <code>_myplugin.py</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">To replace an existing extractor with a subclass of one, set the <code>plugin_name</code> class keyword argument (e.g. <code>class MyPluginIE(ABuiltInIE, plugin_name='myplugin')</code> will replace <code>ABuiltInIE</code> with <code>MyPluginIE</code>). Since the extractor replaces the parent, you should exclude the subclass extractor from being imported separately by making it private using one of the methods described above.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are a plugin author, add <a href="https://github.com/topics/yt-dlp-plugins">yt-dlp-plugins</a> as a topic to your repository for discoverability.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-instructions">Developer Instructions</a> on how to write and test an extractor.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EMBEDDING YT-DLP</h2>
<p dir="auto">yt-dlp makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your program should avoid parsing the normal stdout since they may change in future versions. Instead they should use options such as <code>-J</code>, <code>--print</code>, <code>--progress-template</code>, <code>--exec</code> etc to create console output that you can reliably reproduce and parse.</p>
<p dir="auto">From a Python program, you can embed yt-dlp in a more powerful fashion, like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from yt_dlp import YoutubeDL

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']
with YoutubeDL() as ydl:
    ydl.download(URLS)"><pre><span>from</span> <span>yt_dlp</span> <span>import</span> <span>YoutubeDL</span>

<span>URLS</span> <span>=</span> [<span>'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'</span>]
<span>with</span> <span>YoutubeDL</span>() <span>as</span> <span>ydl</span>:
    <span>ydl</span>.<span>download</span>(<span>URLS</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Most likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py#L183"><code>yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py</code></a> or <code>help(yt_dlp.YoutubeDL)</code> in a Python shell. If you are already familiar with the CLI, you can use <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/devscripts/cli_to_api.py"><code>devscripts/cli_to_api.py</code></a> to translate any CLI switches to <code>YoutubeDL</code> params.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip</strong>: If you are porting your code from youtube-dl to yt-dlp, one important point to look out for is that we do not guarantee the return value of <code>YoutubeDL.extract_info</code> to be json serializable, or even be a dictionary. It will be dictionary-like, but if you want to ensure it is a serializable dictionary, pass it through <code>YoutubeDL.sanitize_info</code> as shown in the <a href="#extracting-information">example below</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/11/go_native_or_go_home/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/11/go_native_or_go_home/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37473628">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft has made it clear: it will ax third-party printer drivers in Windows.</p>
<p>The death rattle will be lengthy, as the timeline for the end of servicing stretches into 2027 – although Microsoft noted that the dates will be subject to change. There is, after all, always that important customer with a strange old printer lacking Mopria support.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mopria.org/mopria-alliance">Mopria</a> is part of the Windows' teams justification for removing support. Founded in 2013 by Canon, HP, Samsung and Xerox, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mopria.org/">Mopria Alliance</a>'s mission is to provide universal standards for printing and scanning. Epson, Lexmark, Adobe and Microsoft have also joined the gang since then.</p>

    

<p>Since Windows 10 21H2, Microsoft has baked Mopria support into the flagship operating system, with support for devices connected via the network or USB, thanks to the Microsoft IPP Class driver. Microsoft said: "This removes the need for print device manufacturers to provide their own installers, drivers, utilities, and so on."</p>

        


        

<p>The software giant also said that customization can be performed via Print Support Apps from the Windows Store. It added: "This framework improves reliability and performance by moving customization from the Win32 framework to the UWP software development framework."</p>
<p>While some wags have dubbed the framework the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/26/microsofts_uwp_unwanted_windows_platform/">"Unwanted Windows Platform"</a>, it's always good to see legacy tech being retired in favor of something with a bright future ahead of it.</p>

        

<p>Microsoft's timeline for the end of servicing will be staged. The next milestone will occur in 2025 when no new printer drivers will be published to Windows Update – although existing drivers can still be updated. In 2026, driver ranking will be tweaked to bring the IPP inbox class driver to the top, and by 2027 – except for security-related fixes – no printer driver updates will be allowed.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/18/windows_printing/">Microsoft admits to yet more printing problems in Windows as back-at-the-office folks asked for admin credentials</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, the end of servicing applies to drivers provided via Windows Update. Manufacturers will, according to Microsoft, "need to provide customers with an alternative means to download and install those printer drivers." Legacy v3 and v4 Windows printer drivers are facing the end of servicing ax.</p>
<p>Microsoft added that multi-function devices – print, scan and fax – will work via the inbox drivers.</p>
<p>Printing and Windows have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/26/windows_10_printer_bork/">long been uneasy bedfellows</a>. While Microsoft hopes the end-of-servicing will take away some legacy driver headaches, there are plenty of other components within the Windows printing subsystem that can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/18/windows_printing/">occasionally topple</a> when poked the wrong way by a patch. ®</p>

          <p>Research Highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An analysis of data from a long-running study of more than 11,000 adults from four diverse communities in the United States has found that adults who had high blood pressure while both seated upright and lying supine (flat on their backs) had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, heart failure or premature death compared to adults without high blood pressure while upright and supine.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Adults who had high blood pressure while lying supine but not while seated upright had similar elevated risks of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or premature death as adults who had high blood pressure in both supine and upright positions.</li>
	<li>The increased risk of heart disease, stroke, heart failure or premature death did not differ by the type of blood pressure medication used among participants.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Embargoed until 6:30a.m. CT/7:30 a.m. ET Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023</strong></p>

<p>BOSTON, Sept. 7, 2023 — People who had high blood pressure while lying flat on their backs had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or premature death, according to new research to be presented at the American Heart Association’s <a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/meetings/hypertension" rel="" target="_blank" title="">Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2023</a>, to be held Sept. 7-10, 2023, in Boston. The meeting is the premier scientific exchange focused on recent advances in basic and clinical research on high blood pressure and its relationship to cardiac and kidney disease, stroke, obesity and genetics.</p>

<p>The autonomic nervous system regulates blood pressure in different body positions; however, gravity may cause blood to pool when seated or upright, and the body is sometimes unable to properly regulate blood pressure during lying, seated and standing positions, the authors noted.</p>

<p>“If blood pressure is only measured while people are seated upright, cardiovascular disease risk may be missed if not measured also while they are lying supine on their backs,” said lead study author Duc M. Giao, a researcher and a 4<sup>th</sup>-year M.D. student at Harvard Medical School in Boston.</p>

<p>To examine body position, blood pressure and heart health risk, the researchers examined health data for 11,369 adults from the longitudinal Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. The data on supine and seated blood pressure was gathered during the enrollment period, ARIC visit 1, which took place between 1987–1989. Participants had their blood pressure taken while briefly lying down at a clinic. The average age of participants at that time was 54 years old; 56% of the group self-identified as female; and 25% of participants self-identified as Black race. Participants in this analysis were followed for an average of 25 to 28 years, up through ARIC visit 5, which includes health data collected from 2011-2013.</p>

<p>The researcher’s findings included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>16% percent of participants who did not have high blood pressure — defined in this study as having top and bottom blood pressure measures greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg — while seated had high blood pressure while lying supine (flat on their backs), compared to 74% of those with seated high blood pressure who also had supine high blood pressure.</li>
	<li>In comparison to participants who did not have high blood pressure while seated and supine, participants who had high blood pressure while seated and supine had a 1.6 times higher risk of developing coronary heart disease; a 1.83 times higher risk of developing heart failure; a 1.86 times higher risk of stroke; a 1.43 times higher risk of overall premature death; and a 2.18 times higher risk of dying from coronary heart disease</li>
	<li>Participants who had high blood pressure while supine but not while seated had similar elevated risks as participants who had high blood pressure while both seated and supine.</li>
	<li>Differences in blood pressure medication use did not affect these elevated risks in either group.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Our findings suggest people with known risk factors for heart disease and stroke may benefit from having their blood pressure checked while lying flat on their backs,” Giao said.</p>

<p>“Efforts to manage blood pressure during daily life may help lower blood pressure while sleeping. Future research should compare supine blood pressure measurements in the clinic with overnight measurements.”</p>

<p>The study’s limitations included that it focused on adults who were middle-aged at the time of enrollment, meaning the results might not be as generalizable to older populations, Giao said.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Giao presents <em>Seated And Supine Blood Pressure And Risk Of Cardiovascular Disease And Mortality From The Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities Study </em>at 2:15 p.m. ET on Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023, Presentation #071; Abstract #452</strong></p>

<p>Background:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing, community-based cohort of 15,792 adults in the United States enrolled from 1987-1989 to investigate the causes for atherosclerotic disease (plaque or fatty buildup in the arteries). ARIC study participants were ages 45–65 years at the start of the study and from rural areas in the U.S. (Forsyth County, North Carolina, and Washington County, Maryland) and urban areas: Minneapolis and Jackson, Mississippi. The research and data from the ARIC clinical visits — including hospital record abstraction, ECG tracings, and physician and coroner questionnaires, as well as death certificate data — have led to discoveries and guidelines surrounding atherosclerosis, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, stroke and cognitive decline.</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065" target="_blank">2017 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults</a> classifies hypertension as having top and bottom numbers greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg, which was the definition of hypertension used in this study.</li>

This was an incompatible language confusingly <i>also</i> called Visual Basic. I don't think Microsoft realized how angry this made developers and businesses, who were being asked to spend hundreds of billions of dollars (USD) to rewrite code just to keep the same functionality. Before that time, many thought that Visual Basic's wide use gave it a kind of "herd immunity". I don't have numbers with me, but I remember that years later that a study found that some were sticking to the original Visual Basic (even though it was no longer supported), a few had moved to Visual .NET, and many other had abandoned Visual Basic entirely (some to C#, others beyond). In short, the Visual Basic community was split into multiple communities, and anyone using Visual Basic would have to worry about either lack of support or yet another harmful change.</p><p>* The rise of the web and of platforms other than Windows (including Android, iOS, MacOS, Linux). Visual Basic is fine when you send files via sneakernet to another Windows user. Now people want to access through their web browser, smartphone, etc. If you have a website, anything can access it (as long as they have the permissions), and you don't have to worry about synchronizing data changes the way you do if people make changes on their local device. Most of the simple "fill in a form" kinds of applications that Visual Basic was used for are more sensibly web applications (server side or client side).</p><p>Visual Basic is still used. And yes, I think there could be better tools for developing software. But as best as I recall, that's how we ended up here.

I'm a big fan of modern .NET, but my biggest complaint is that Microsoft views, and always has, the CLR as the C# Language Runtime and not the Common Language Runtime.<p>For example, see the relationship between F# and C#. The CLR is constantly getting features that are only to support features in C#, leaving F# in a position where they either don't get the feature, can't add the feature, or begrudgingly add the feature to keep up compatibility with C#, which is something it does take seriously. But this has the effect of "dirtying up" the F# language by either adding features that don't really belong in the language or keeping features out.</p><p>The other thing is that C# consistently adds features to itself that are inspired by F#, since F# already implements these features on the CLR, thus showing their viability. So what happens is that C# continually approaches a more bloated language with a subset of it being a poor copy of F#. But then F# gets dragged along towards having a small subset of C# in it for compatibility purposes. So it's simultaneously making both languages worse.</p><p>Even the iron languages project that lead to IronPython, IronRuby, etc. was a bit of a Trojan horse to test out and exercise the CLR and .NET with no intention of ever providing long-term support for those projects. The DLR, which was implemented to support those, appears to be just maintained by a skeleton crew of people invested in it, probably by those interested in keeping IronPython up and running.</p><p>I do not understand why Microsoft takes this approach. It is myopic, shows a misunderstanding of their own technology in the CLR, and ultimately turns C# into another C++, leave dead languages and projects in the wake.

There are some really good SAAS offerings that target this space, but none of them seem as dominant as I would expect.  There was a time that if you wanted a simple application that could be covered with 3-4 tables and 5-6 views, any of the things I mentioned above could handle it.  You could explain the business problem and hand a developer a book on any of the above technologies and expect to have a working product a month later.  Today, this isn't really true.

The closest equivalent today for desktop apps <i>that still has Microsoft's focus on future innovation</i> is C# with Windows Forms.

It actually went on to become industry leading software in its space.</p><p>20+ years later, that doesn't seem to have been a bad choice.  Windows Forms is very simple, with a powerful drag-and-drop designer, double-click to hook up events, it's all very similar.  Yes, you have to understand object oriented programming much more than you would have under VB, but that's as close as you are going to get from Microsoft on the desktop.  They try to hide it as best they can.</p><p>I <i>still</i> use Windows Forms if I need to put together something that "just works" on Windows as a desktop app quickly.  It's unmatched for that.</p><p>There are newer technologies, such as WPF, WinUI3, Avalonia and others for .Net but they come with a complexity that would be above your typical use-case for VB6 back in the day.  The VB6 user who just wanted to get stuff done probably doesn't want to have to understand how to implement the MVVM pattern just to get a UI.

The big problem though is that MS keeps failing to make a GUI framework that is quick-and-easy as VB forms were.  Winforms still exists, and it's only a <i>bit</i> clumsier than VB forms, but it's very old and not modern.  The more modern .NET gui-frameworks are much less user-friendly.<p>Linguistically, I think the successor to VB is Powershell.  It's the same mashup of inconsistent flags that let you swap between "this is a serious language" and "I'm smashing crap together" with tons of unexpected weird behavior, but instead of being a quick-and-dirty GUI app maker, it's a Shell.  Hardcore focus on being easy and productive but unforgivably warty.</p><p>As for VB itself, VB.Net just didn't offer much value distinct from C#, so most people who were coding in VB switched to C#.</p><p>So if you're an old longbearded MS LOB programmer who started before .NET, and you're still working in Microsoft LOB shops, you're probably doing similar stuff but with C#.  But realistically, you've probably also switched to Web.</p><p>And the lack of the VB-level ease-of-use in <i>web</i> technologies is a whole other story.  All the hoary mess of using a document-engine for a cross-platform application server makes it pretty untameable.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://news.ucsb.edu/2023/021198/wifi-can-read-through-walls">https://news.ucsb.edu/2023/021198/wifi-can-read-through-walls</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469920">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-history-node-id="21198">
      

    
                    <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>Researchers in UC Santa Barbara professor Yasamin Mostofi’s lab have proposed a new foundation that can enable high-quality imaging of still objects with only WiFi signals. Their method uses the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction and the corresponding Keller cones to trace edges of the objects. The technique has also enabled, for the first time, imaging, or reading, the English alphabet through walls with WiFi, a task deemed too difficult for WiFi due to the complex details of the letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>For more details on this technology, check their video at <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvqL3gqGDeM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvqL3gqGDeM</a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>“Imaging still scenery with WiFi is considerably challenging due to the lack of motion,” said Mostofi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering. “We have then taken a completely different approach to tackle this challenging problem by focusing on tracing the edges of the objects instead.”&nbsp; The proposed methodology and experimental results appeared in the Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE </span></span></span></span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>National Conference on Radar</span></span></span></span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span> (RadarConf) on June 21, 2023.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
</div>

                  

                  <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>This innovation builds on previous work in the Mostofi Lab, which since 2009 has pioneered sensing with everyday radio frequency signals such as WiFi for several different applications, including crowd analytics, person identification, smart health and smart spaces. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>“When a given wave is incident on an edge point, a cone of outgoing rays emerges according to the Keller’s Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), referred to as a Keller cone,” Mostofi explained. The researchers note that this interaction is not limited to visibly sharp edges but applies to a broader set of surfaces with a small enough curvature.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>“Depending on the edge orientation, the cone then leaves different footprints (i.e., conic sections) on a given receiver grid. We then develop a mathematical framework that uses these conic footprints as signatures to infer the orientation of the edges, thus creating an edge map of the scene,”&nbsp; Mostofi continued. </span></span></span></p>
</div>

                  <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>More specifically, the team proposed a Keller cone-based imaging projection kernel. This kernel is implicitly a function of the edge orientations, a relationship that is then exploited to infer the existence/orientation of the edges via hypothesis testing over a small set of possible edge orientations. In other words, if existence of an edge is determined, the edge orientation that best matches the resulting Keller cone-based signature is chosen for a given point that they are interested in imaging. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>“Edges of real-life objects have local dependencies,” said Anurag Pallaprolu, the lead Ph.D. student on the project. “Thus, once we find the high-confidence edge points via the proposed imaging kernel, we then propagate their information to the rest of the points using Bayesian information propagation. This step can further help improve the image, since some of the edges may be in a blind region, or <span>can be </span>overpowered by other edges that are closer to the transmitters.” Finally, once an image is formed, the researchers can further improve the image by using image completion tools from the area of vision.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>“It is worth noting that traditional imaging techniques result in poor imaging quality when deployed with commodity WiFi transceivers,” added Pallaprolu, “as the surfaces can appear near-specular at lower frequencies, thus not leaving enough signature on the receiver grid.” &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>The researchers have also extensively studied the impact of several different parameters, such as curvature of a surface, edge orientation, distance to the receiver grid, and transmitter location on the Keller cones and their proposed edge-based imaging system, thereby developing a foundation for a methodical imaging system design. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
</div>

                  <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>In the team’s experiments, three off-the-shelf WiFi transmitters send wireless waves in the area. WiFi receivers are then mounted on an unmanned vehicle that emulates a WiFi receiver grid as it moves.&nbsp; The receiver measures the received signal power which it then uses for imaging, based on the proposed methodology. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>The researchers have extensively tested this technology with several experiments in three different areas, including through-wall scenarios. In one example application, they developed a WiFi Reader to showcase the capabilities of the proposed pipeline. </span></span></span></span></p>
</div>

                  <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>This application is particularly informative as the English alphabet presents complex details which can be used to test the performance of the imaging system. Along this line, the group has shown how they can successfully image several alphabet-shaped objects. In addition to imaging, they can further classify the letters. Finally, they have shown how their approach enables WiFi to image and read through walls by imaging the details and further reading the letters of the word “BELIEVE” through walls. They have furthermore imaged a number of other objects as well, showing that they can capture details previously not possible with WiFi. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>Overall, the proposed approach can open up new directions for RF imaging.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

When the photo was <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/history-of-ai" target="_self">reprinted</a> in Eliza Strickland’s October 2021 article “The Turbulent Past and Uncertain Future of Artificial Intelligence” in <em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em>, the caption identified six people, plus one “unknown.” So who was this unknown person?</p><h2>Who is in the photo?</h2><p>Six of the people in the photo are easy to identify.

Over the years, some people <a href="https://pemey.medium.com/whos-that-kid-laughing-with-high-socks-in-the-middle-of-summer-7801a34feeef" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that this was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenchard_More" target="_blank">Trenchard More</a>, another AI expert who attended the workshop.</p><p>I first ran across the Dartmouth group photo in 2018, when I was gathering material for <a href="https://raysolomonoff.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ray’s memorial website</a>. Ray and I had met in 1969, and we got married in 1989; he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/science/10solomonoff.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed away</a> in late 2009. Over the years, I had attended a number of his talks, and I had met many of Ray’s peers and colleagues in AI, so I was curious about the photo.</p><p>I thought, “Gee, that guy in the middle doesn’t look like my memory of Trenchard.” So I called up Trenchard’s son Paul More. He assured me that the unknown person was not his father.</p><p>More recently, I discovered a letter among Ray’s papers. On 8 November 1956, Nat Rochester sent a short note and a copy of the photo to some colleagues: “Enclosed is a print of the photograph I took of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a> group.” He sent his note to McCarthy, Minsky, Selfridge, Shannon, Solomonoff—and Peter Milner.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="A typed letter with the photograph of the six men,  is addressed to six names from Nathaniel Rochester." data-rm-shortcode-id="29a714f8f61d2228ac93efd838df9fb6" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-typed-letter-with-the-photograph-of-the-six-men-is-addressed-to-six-names-from-nathaniel-rochester.jpg?id=33603732&amp;width=980" height="1375" id="1b532" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-typed-letter-with-the-photograph-of-the-six-men-is-addressed-to-six-names-from-nathaniel-rochester.jpg?id=33603732&amp;width=980" width="1338"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Several months after the workshop, Nathaniel Rochester sent a copy of the photo, along with this note, to six people.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Grace Solomonoff</small></p><p>So the unknown person must be Milner! This makes perfect sense. <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/article/remembering-peter-m-milner-1919-2018" target="_blank">Milner</a> was working on neuropsychology at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill University</a>, in Montreal, although he had trained as an electrical engineer. He’s not generally lumped in with the other AI pioneers because his research interests diverged from theirs. Even at Dartmouth, he felt he was in over his head, as he wrote in his 1999 autobiography: “I was invited to a meeting of computer scientists and information theorists at Dartmouth College…. Most of the time I had no idea what they were talking about.”</p><p>In his fascinating autobiography, Milner writes about his work in radar development during World War II, and his switch after the war from nuclear-reactor design to psychology. His doctoral thesis in 1954, “<a href="https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sv01t" target="_blank">Effects of Intracranial Stimulation on Rat Behaviour</a>,” examined the effects of electrical stimulation on certain rat neurons, which became widely and enthusiastically known as “pleasure centers.”</p><p>This work led to one of Milner’s most famous papers, “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-00249-001" target="_blank">The Cell Assembly: Mark II</a>,” in 1957. The paper describes how, when a neuron in the brain fires, it excites similar connected neurons (especially those already aroused by sensory input) and randomly excites other cortical neurons. Cells may form assemblies and connect with other assemblies. But the neurons don’t seem to exhibit the same snowballing behavior of atoms that leads to an exponential explosion. How neurons might inhibit this effect were among his ideas that led to new insights at the workshop.</p><p>Milner’s work contributed to the early development of artificial neural networks, and it’s why he was included in the Dartmouth meeting. There was considerable interest among AI researchers in studying the brain and neurons in order to reproduce its functions and intelligence.</p><p>But as Strickland notes in her October 2021 <em>Spectrum</em> article, a division was already forming in AI research. One side focused on replicating the brain, while the other was more interested in what the mind might do to directly solve problems. Scientists interested in this latter approach were also represented at Dartmouth and later championed the rise of symbolic logic, using heuristic and algorithmic processes, which I’ll discuss in a bit.</p><h2>Where Was the Photo Taken?</h2><p>Rochester’s photo from 1956 shows the left-hand side of Dartmouth Hall in the background. In 2006 Dartmouth convened a conference, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI@50" target="_blank">AI@50</a>, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the AI gathering and to discuss AI’s present and future. Trenchard More, the person most often misidentified as the “unknown person” in Nat’s photo, met with the organizers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Moor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">James Moor</a> and Carey Heckman, as well as Wendy Conquest, who was working on a movie about AI for the conference. None of the AI@50 organizers knew exactly where the 1956 meeting had taken place.</p><p>More led them across the lawn and to the left-hand side door of Dartmouth Hall. He showed them the rooms that were used, which in turn triggered an old memory. During the 1956 meeting, as More recalled in a <a href="http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/misc/Trenchardinterview2011.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2011 interview</a>, “Selfridge, and Minsky, and McCarthy, and Ray Solomonoff, and I gathered around a dictionary on a stand to look up the word <em>heuristic</em>, because we thought that might be a useful word.” On that 2006 tour of Dartmouth Hall, he was delighted to find that the dictionary was still there.</p><p>The word <em>heuristic</em> was invoked all through the summer of 1956. Instead of trying to analyze the brain to develop machine intelligence, some participants focused on the operational steps needed to solve a given problem, making particular use of heuristic methods to quickly identify the steps.</p><p>Early in the summer, for instance, Herb Simon and Allen Newell gave a talk on a program they had written, the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1056797" target="_blank">logic theory machine</a>. The program relied on early ideas of symbolic logic, with algorithmic steps and heuristic guidance in list form. They later won the 1975 Turing Award for these ideas. Think of heuristics as intuitive guides. The logic theory machine used such guides to initiate the algorithmic steps—that is, the set of instructions to actually carry out the problem solving.<br></p><h2>Who Wasn’t in the Photo</h2><p>There was one person who was at the Dartmouth Workshop from time to time but was never included in any of the lists of attendees: Gloria Minsky, Marvin’s wife.</p><p>But Gloria was definitely a presence that summer. Marvin, Ray, and John McCarthy were the only three participants to stay for the entire eight-week workshop. Everyone else came and went as their schedules allowed. At the time, Gloria was a pediatrics fellow at Children’s Hospital in Boston, but whenever she could, she would drive up to Dartmouth, stay in Marvin’s apartment, and visit with whoever was at the workshop.</p><p>Several years earlier, in the spring of 1952, Gloria had been doing her residency in pathology at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, when she began dating Marvin. Marvin was a Ph.D. student at Princeton, as was McCarthy, and the two were invited to Bell Labs for the summer to work under Claude Shannon. In July, just four months after their first meeting, Gloria and Marvin got married. Although Marvin was working nonstop for Shannon, Shannon insisted he and Gloria take a honeymoon in New Mexico.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="A letter from John McCarthy to Ray Solomonoff on Dartmouth College stationery." data-rm-shortcode-id="85ad1d73a223bb5735e7b0fe2c2fc67d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-letter-from-john-mccarthy-to-ray-solomonoff-on-dartmouth-college-stationery.jpg?id=33603735&amp;width=980" height="1001" id="4a2b5" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-letter-from-john-mccarthy-to-ray-solomonoff-on-dartmouth-college-stationery.jpg?id=33603735&amp;width=980" width="620"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">In March 1956, John McCarthy, one of the Dartmouth AI workshop’s organizers, invited Ray Solomonoff to the summer workshop in Hanover, N.H.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Grace Solomonoff</small></p><p>Four years later, McCarthy, Shannon, and Minsky, along with Nat Rochester, organized the <a href="http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/dartmouth/dartmouth.pdf" target="_blank">Dartmouth workshop</a>. Gloria remembered a conversation between her husband and Ray, in which Marvin expressed a thought that later became one of his hallmarks: “You need to see something in more than one way to understand it.” In Minsky’s 2007 book <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Emotion-Machine/Marvin-Minsky/9780743276641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Emotion Machine</em></a>, he looked at how emotions, intuitions, and feelings create different descriptions and provide different ways of looking at things. He tended to favor symbolic logic and deductive methods in AI, which he called “good old-fashioned AI.”</p><p>Ray, meanwhile, was focused on probabilities—the likelihood of something happening and predictions of how it might evolve. He later developed algorithmic probability, an early version of algorithmic information theory, in which each different description of something leads with a probabilistic likelihood (some more likely, some less likely) of a given outcome in the future. Probabilistic methods eventually became the underpinnings of machine learning.</p><p>These days, as chatbots enter the limelight, and compression methods are used more in AI, the value of understanding things in many ways and using probabilistic predictions will only grow in importance. That is, logic and probability methods are uniting. These in turn are being aided by new work on neural nets as well as symbolic logic. And so the photo that Nat Rochester took not only captured a moment in time for AI. It also offered a glimpse into how AI would develop.</p><p><em>The author thanks Gloria Minsky, Margaret Minsky,</em><em>Nicholas Rochester, Julie Sussman, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Paul More for their help and patience.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

                  <p><span>Cool idea!  I don't really picture myself using this, but I think this add-on is a great example of how great a browser Firefox is.  I'd be the first to critique Mozilla, and there are definitely things about Firefox I don't like (ex. Pocket, telemetry on by default), but overall I think it's an amazing product in that it allows for multiple levels of isolation (profiles, containers, private mode) and a level of control over them that Chromium either doesn't do as cleanly or doesn't do at all.  As an aside, the only thing I think Chromium does better is the debugging experience; I don't truly understand why Firefox thinks it shouldn't support debugging Node.js like Chromium does.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Chrome has a visually similar functionality to Firefox Containers hidden away behind a feature flag [1] at the moment. BUT under the hood it's simply just tab grouping with no isolation. I presume isolation is against Google's interests so we will never see this kind of feature.</p><p>As for Firefox's API, the Contextual Identities API [2] that allows you to create/delete containers is amazing and easy to work with as a dev. And it works out-of-the-box, it doesn't need the companion addon Multi-Account Containers (MAC) [3] which really should've been part of Firefox in my opinion.</p><p>1. chrome://flags/#tab-groups-save</p><p>2. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contextualIdentities" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Web...</a></p><p>3. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account...</a>

And as far as "isolation", privacy or security are concerned, Chrome's profiles are actually superior due to ability to have different extensions and history per profile. Chrome's extensions in general still have superior security (e.g., activate on click or only for certain websites), so sometimes different profiles aren't even needed.<p>Chrome's Profiles are also remembered when you "install an app" (SSB/PWA), so you could have "apps" started in their own profiles.</p><p>Firefox's containers are only useful if you want multiple logins to the same service in the same browser window. But I never found that usecase to be very compelling.</p><p>Firefox's containers are an often lauded feature, and I don't understand why, given the integration issues or general awkwardness. It's probably a reminiscence of the "Facebook container" extension, which was a bandaid until better site isolation was implemented.

                  <p><span>A counter anecdote is that I have the exact opposite use case. I don't share my computer with other users, so I've never needed something like profiles. Firefox containers are great for keeping different sites, especially those notorious for tracking (e.g. Amazon, Google, LinkedIn) completely isolated from each other or from general browsing. Plus, the extension that allows for creating temporary containers is great for one-off visits to e-commerce sites without needing to switch to a new private/incognito window. I'm not sure I've ever wanted my extensions isolated by container/profile, that seems like it would hinder productivity. Same for history. It's great having all my history commingled, especially if I want to find something from 30 tabs ago.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Exploit idea (not trying for the bounty, just thinking aloud). I wonder if a website could play background music (or a video) with stenographically encoded data, then another tab could listen to it with microphone permissions on and decode it that way. I'm thinking like a fake video conferencing site, or malicious telephony how-to doc that deals with API calls and such and links to a fake password hasher that then plays the audio for the first tab to hear. Convoluted, I know, just an idea.

      <p>Comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/16fhmuq/a_deep_dive_into_the_bug_that_caused_the_uk_air/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">reddit</a></p>
<p>On 28 August 2023 <em>NATS</em>, the UK's air traffic control operator, suffered a
<strong>major</strong> technical incident. The BBC reports that more than <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66685349">2000 flights were
cancelled</a> and the cost has been estimated
at over <em>£100 million</em> GBP. The incident probably affected hundreds of thousands
of people.</p>
<p>The press initially reported the cause was a faulty flight plan: <em>UK air traffic
control: inquiry into whether French error caused failure</em> (The Times) and in
typical Mail Online reporting style: <em>"Did blunder by French airline spark air
traffic control issues? Officials probe if a single badly filed travel plan
caused UK's entire flight-control system to collapse in worst outage for a
decade - with 1,000 flights cancelled and chaos set to last DAYS"</em>.</p>
<p>So what happened? These are notes on my reading of the incident report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NATS Major Incident Preliminary Report<br>
Flight Plan Reception Suite Automated (FPRSA-R) Sub-system Incident 28th August 2023 <br>
<a href="https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/NERL%20Major%20Incident%20Investigation%20Preliminary%20Report.pdf">pdf</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>NATS</em> is a "public-private" company in the UK that is responsible for all of
the UK's air traffic control:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Air Traffic Control (ATC) is the provision and operation of a safe system for
controlling and monitoring aircraft.
[..] <br>
aircraft [..] are required to file a flight plan.
[..] <br>
ATC ensures that aircraft are safely separated laterally and vertically.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The start of the sequence of events leading to the incident can be tracked
back to the point at which a flight plan was entered into the flight planning
system.</p>
<p>[Airlines] submit the plan into Eurocontrol’s Integrated Initial Flight Plan
Processing System (IFPS).
[..]</p>
<p>If the submitted flight plan is accepted by IFPS, i.e. it is compliant with
IFPS defined parameters [...] this is sufficient for a flight to depart with
local ATC approval. The flight plan will be sent from IFPS to all relevant
ANSPs who need to manage the flight.
[..]</p>
<p>Within the NATS En-route operations at Swanwick Centre, the data is passed to
FPRSA-R. The FPRSA-R sub-system exists to convert the data received from IFPS
(in a format known as ATS Data Exchange Presentation, ADEXP) into a format
that is compatible with the UK National Airspace System (NAS). NAS is the
flight data processing system which contains all of the relevant airspace and
routings.
[..]</p>
<p>FPRSA-R has a primary and backup system monitored both by dedicated Control
and Monitoring (C&amp;M) systems and also an aggregated central C&amp;M system.
Further resilience is provided by NAS storing 4 hours of previously filed
flight data to allow the operation to continue in the event of the loss of
automatic processing of flight data.
[..]</p>
<p>In addition to the technical resilience provided by backup systems, and the 4
hours of stored flight data, there is operational contingency available to
allow safe service to continue. This is provided through the ability to input
flight data manually, directly into NAS using a manual input system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flight plans are first submitted to a European-wide authority <em>IFPS</em>.</li>
<li>If a plan is accepted, the flight is cleared for takeoff.</li>
<li><em>NATS</em> requires the flight plan be transferred to them at least 4 hours before
the aircraft is due to enter UK airspace. This is supposed to give NATS a
4-hour window to be able to fix any problems in processing flight plans.</li>
<li>It seems that there is also probably some process which <em>delays</em> flight plans
until <em>close</em> to the deadline (see below). This might be to avoid congesting
the system with flight plans too early, or lots of plans that may later
change. Still, this results in flight plans being received by NATS sometimes
<em>hours</em> after the flight has taken off.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The NATS ATC System was operating normally.
[..]</p>
<p>[On] 28 August the airline submitted an ICAO4444 compliant flight plan into
Eurocontrol’s flight planning distribution system, IFPS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ICAO stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization" title="wikipedia">International Civil Aviation
Organization</a>, a United Nations agency.
An ICAO4444 flight plan looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>(FPL-TTT123-IS

<p>Such messages are in a format that is meant to be read by machines, but also by
humans if necessary. The format is spec'd over many many pages of PDF, but is
roughly:</p>

<p>The route part (in this example: <code>N0440F310 SSOXS5 SSOXS DCT BUZRD DCT SEY DCT HTO J174 ORF J121 CHS EESNT LUNNI1</code>) encodes an overall speed (here <code>N0440</code>
meaning <code>440 knots</code>), an overall altitude (here <code>F310</code> which means "Flight
Level 310" which means <code>310 × 100 ft</code> (can also be in <code>km</code>)), and a sequence of
waypoints (referenced by name) separated by a description of how to get from the
previous waypoint to the next one, usually by referencing a "known route" by
name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The flight plan was accepted by IFPS
[..] <br>
the aircraft was cleared to depart at 04:00.
[..]</p>
<p>At 08:32 the flight plan was received by NATS’ FPRSA-R sub-system from
Eurocontrol’s IFPS system. This is consistent with the 4 hour rule mentioned
above. The purpose of the FPRSA-R software is to extract the UK portion of the
flight plan [..]</p>
<p>The flight plans delivered to FPRSA-R by IFPS are converted from [..] ICAO4444
to [..] ADEXP. ADEXP is a European-wide flight plan specification that
includes, amongst other data, additional geographical waypoints within the
European region specific to the route of a flight. For flights transiting
through UK airspace, rather than landing in the UK, this will include
additional waypoints outside of UK airspace required for its onward journey.
Following this conversion the ADEXP version of a flight plan includes, amongst
other aspects, the original ICAO4444 flight plan plus an additional list of
waypoints and other data.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that the ICAO waypoints do not contain the start and end, since in the
original ICAO format these are specified in other fields (so it would waste
space to list them again in this list).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ADEXP waypoints plan included two waypoints along its route that were
geographically distinct but which have the same designator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means there were two lines like:</p>
<pre><code><span>-PT -PTID RESIA -FL F330 -ETO 170729080731
</span></code></pre>
<p>that had the same <code>PTID</code> string like <code>"RESIA"</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although there has been work by ICAO and other bodies to eradicate non-unique
waypoint names there are duplicates around the world. In order to avoid
confusion latest standards state that such identical designators should be
geographically widely spaced. In this specific event, both of the waypoints
were located outside of the UK, one towards the beginning of the route and one
towards the end; approximately 4000 nautical miles apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4000 nautical miles is 7408km. Here is an arc of that length on the globe:
<img src="https://jameshaydon.github.io/nats-fail/4000-nautical-miles.png" alt="4000 nautical miles on a globe"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the ADEXP file had been received, the FPRSA-R software commenced
searching for the UK airspace entry point in the waypoint information per the
ADEXP flight plan, commencing at the first line of that waypoint data. FPRSA-R
was able to specifically identify the character string as it appeared in the
ADEXP flight plan text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The programming style is very imperative. Furthermore, the description sounds
like the procedure is working directly on the textual representation of the
flight plan, rather than a data structure parsed from the text file. This would
be quite worrying, but it might also just be how it is explained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having correctly identified the entry point, the software moved on to search
for the exit point from UK airspace in the waypoint data.</p>
<p>Having completed those steps,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This part of the code identified <code>entry</code> and <code>exit</code> waypoints to UK airspace in
the list of <code>ADEXP</code> waypoints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FPRSA-R then searches the ICAO4444 section of
the ADEXP file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems at this point, having identified the entry and exit points from the
list of ADEXP waypoints, it will try to extract the UK portion of the flight plan from the ICAO route.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It initially searches from the beginning of that data, to find
the identified UK airspace entry point. This was successfully found. Next, it
searches backwards, from the end of that section, to find the UK airspace exit
point. This did not appear in that section of the flight plan so the search
was unsuccessful. As there is no requirement for a flight plan to contain an
exit waypoint from a Flight Information Region (FIR) or a country’s airspace,
the software is designed to cope with this scenario.</p>
<p>Therefore, where there is no UK exit point explicitly included, the software
logic utilises the waypoints as detailed in the ADEXP file to search for the
next nearest point beyond the UK exit point. This was also not present.</p>
<p>The software therefore moved on to the next waypoint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so I think this is what is going on, the situation looked something like
this:</p>
<pre><code><span>           4       2        8         5              1           9
</span><span>ICAO:  F------Q--------T--------O-----------P---------------Y--------U
</span><span>
</span><span>ADEXP: F   S  Q    C   T   A    O  E  X     P   W   B   Q   Y        U
</span><span>                       UK  UK   UK UK UK    UK  UK
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here the ICAO route has waypoints (represented by capital letters) separated by
known routes (numbers). On the bottom we have the ADEXP waypoints. The ADEXP
waypoints that are located in the UK airspace are marked with <code>UK</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The software has identified:
<ul>
<li><code>entry</code>: waypoint <code>T</code></li>
<li><code>exit</code>: waypoint <code>W</code>
in the ADEXP waypoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The software finds waypoint <code>T</code> in the ICAO flight plan.</li>
<li>The software <em>does not</em> find waypoint <code>W</code> in the ICAO flight plan.</li>
<li>The software therefore takes the next waypoint in the ADEXP list, so <code>B</code>, and
tries to find it too, and also does not find it.</li>
<li>So it does this again, taking waypoint <code>Q</code>, and it <em>does</em> find it, but at the
<em>start</em> of the ICAO flight plan, before the plane even enters the UK.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This search was successful as a duplicate identifier appeared in the flight
plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What should the software have done? Well, <code>Q</code> is clearly <em>not</em> the waypoint we
are searching for, we are searching for waypoint <code>Y</code>, since <code>[T, O, P, Y]</code> is
the smallest segment of the ICAO plan that contains all the UK waypoints.</p>
<p>It's important to note here that the original algorithm is buggy; it is perfectly
possible to unambiguously extract the UK portion of this example flight plan;
see <a href="https://jameshaydon.github.io/nats-fail/#how-to-code-this-properly">below</a>. And this is likely the case for the
flight plan that caused the meltdown too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having found an entry and exit point, with the latter being the duplicate and
therefore geographically incorrect, the software could not extract a valid UK
portion of flight plan between these two points. This is the root cause of the
incident. We can therefore rule out any cyber related contribution to this
incident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds like the exception was raised in a later portion of the code, which
converts the plan to an internal format for <em>NAS</em>. This part failed because the
identified entry/exit waypoints didn't even specify a valid segment of the ICAO
route.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Safety critical software systems are designed to always fail safely. This
means that in the event they cannot proceed in a demonstrably safe manner,
they will move into a state that requires manual intervention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are left wondering if, had the misidentified waypoint been in a more
plausible geographic location, the code might not have thrown an exception and
passed along wrong data to ATCOs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case the software within the FPRSA-R subsystem was unable to establish
a reasonable course of action that would preserve safety and so raised a
critical exception. A critical exception is, broadly speaking, an exception of
last resort after exploring all other handling options. Critical exceptions
can be raised as a result of software logic or hardware faults, but
essentially mark the point at which the affected system cannot continue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds like the software was written thinking this exception would never
occur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly a better way to handle this specific logic error would be for FPRSA-R
to identify and remove the message and avoid a critical exception. However,
since flight data is safety critical information that is passed to ATCOs the
system must be sure it is correct and could not do so in this case. It
therefore stopped operating, avoiding any opportunity for incorrect data being
passed to a controller. The change to the software will now remove the need
for a critical exception to be raised in these specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Having raised a critical exception the FPRSA-R primary system wrote a log file
into the system log. It then correctly placed itself into maintenance mode and
the C&amp;M system identified that the primary system was no longer available. In
the event of a failure of a primary system the backup system is designed to
take over processing seamlessly. In this instance the backup system took over
processing flight plan messages. As is common in complex real-time systems the
backup system software is located on separate hardware with separate power and
data feeds.</p>
<p>Therefore, on taking over the duties of the primary server, the backup system
applied the same logic to the flight plan with the same result. It
subsequently raised its own critical exception, writing a log file into the
system log and placed itself into maintenance mode.</p>
<p>At this point with both the primary and backup FPRSA-R sub-systems having
failed safely the FPRSA-R was no longer able to automatically process flight
plans. It required restoration to normal service through manual intervention.
The entire process described above, from the point of receipt of the ADEXP
message to both the primary and backup sub-systems moving into maintenance
mode, took less than 20 seconds. 08:32 therefore marks the point at which the
automatic processing of flight plans ceased and the 4 hour buffer to manual
flight plan input commenced. The steps taken to restore the FPRSA-R sub-system
are described in section 5 of this report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then support teams tried to fix things, but unfortunately it took longer than
the 4 hours they had:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1st Line support team were alerted to the incident through the C&amp;M systems
that directly monitor operational systems as well as through direct feedback
from the Operational teams using the FPRSA-R sub-system at the time. The
initial response for the team followed standard recovery processes using the
centralised C&amp;M systems to restart the sub-system. Following multiple attempts
to restore the service, which were unsuccessful, the 2nd Line engineering team
was mobilised and supported the on-site engineers remotely via video link.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://jameshaydon.github.io/nats-fail/off-and-on-again.jpg" alt="have you tried turning it off and on again?"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The on-call teams working remotely with the on-site engineering teams followed
a staged analysis, involving increasingly detailed procedures to attempt to
resolve the issue, none of which were successful. As per standard escalation
procedures, 2nd Line engineers were engaged to provide further access to
advanced diagnostics and logging capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't say how long it took, but the manufacturer of the <code>FPRSA-R</code> system was
eventually called:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional support was then requested from the Technical Design team and
sub-system manufacturer as 1st and 2nd Line support had been unable to restore
the service or identify the precise root cause, which was unusual. The
manufacturer was able to offer further expertise including analysis of
lower-level software logs which led to identification of the likely flight
plan that had caused the software exception. Through understanding which
flight plan had caused the incident the manufacturer was able to provide the
precise sequence of actions necessary to recover the system in a controlled
and safe manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system was eventually restored, but unfortunately the knock-on effects by
that point were already disastrous.</p>
<p>The manufacturer is an Austrian company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentis">Frequentis
AG</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An FPRSA sub-system has existed in NATS for many years and in 2018 the
previous FPRSA sub- system was replaced with new hardware and software
manufactured by Frequentis AG, one of the leading global ATC System providers.
The manufacturer’s ATC products are operating in approximately 150 countries
and they hold a world-leading position in aeronautical information management
(AIM) and message handling systems.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>Things that went wrong:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software that processes flight plans (<code>FPRSA-R</code>) was written in a buggy
way.</li>
<li>The software and system are not properly tested.</li>
<li>The <code>FPRSA-R</code> system has bad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis" title="wikipedia">failure modes</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-software-was-buggy">The software was buggy</h3>
<p>The software was incapable of extracting the UK portion of the ICAO flight plan,
even though the flight plan was apparently valid (at least according to IFPS).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The procedure was very fiddly and failed for a silly reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waypoint markers are not globally unique, but this is a known issue, so NATS
should make sure their systems are robust enough to handle it. <em>All other air
traffic control authorities have to deal with this</em>. NATS says the following
about this in the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although there has been work by ICAO and other bodies to eradicate
non-unique waypoint names there are duplicates around the world. In order to
avoid confusion latest standards state that such identical designators
should be geographically widely spaced. In this specific event, both of the
waypoints were located outside of the UK, one towards the beginning of the
route and one towards the end; approximately 4000 nautical miles apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When waypoints with the same name are widely spaced, this makes flight plans
unambiguous, because successive waypoints in a flight plan cannot be too far
apart. They also mention possible actions they will take:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The feasibility of working through the UK state with ICAO to remove the
small number of duplicate waypoint names in the ICAO administered global
dataset that relate to this incident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Waypoint names are clearly chosen to be short and snappy. Here's a sequence
from some flight plan I found: <code>KOMAL</code>, <code>ATRAK</code>, <code>SORES</code>, <code>SAKTA</code>, <code>ALMIK</code>,
<code>IGORO</code>, <code>ATMED</code>, etc. It's clear that the system has been designed so these
names can be communicated quickly, e.g. over radio, and that pilots and
air traffic controllers can become familiar with those on the routes they
usually fly. Changing the name of a waypoint can be a scary operation.
Uniqueness is obviously desirable, but it has to be balanced against other
considerations. Including this suggestion in the initial report feels like
NATS is trying to shift the blame onto ICAO.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I don't see why a flight plan can't include the same <em>geographic</em>
waypoint several times; for example for leisure flights or military exercises.
Taking off and landing at the same airport is definitely a thing (called a
"round-robin flight plan"). It doesn't sound like the <code>FPRSA-R</code> algorithm
would be very robust to that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NATS officials are trying to spin this as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An air traffic meltdown in Britain was caused by a "one in 15 million" event,
the boss of traffic control provider NATS said, as initial findings showed how
a single flight plan with two identically labelled markers caused the chaos.</p>
<p>"This was a one in 15 million chance. We've processed 15 million flight plans
with this system up until this point and never seen this before," NATS CEO
Martin Rolfe told the BBC, as airlines stepped up calls for compensation for
the breakdown. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-aviation-regulator-review-air-traffic-control-failure-2023-09-06/">Reuters</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system was put in place in 2018, so what Martin Rolfe is saying here is that
this sort of thing only had a chance of occurring "once every 5 years", which is
apparently an acceptable frequency for having a complete air traffic control
meltdown.</p>
<h3 id="the-system-was-poorly-tested">The system was poorly tested</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzzing</a>, for example, may have
prevented this. By bombarding such a system with randomly generated flight
plans, you can see if any of them cause bad failure modes: a crashed system
where one doesn't know immediately what went wrong. By inspecting which sorts of
flight plans cause problems, it would become apparent that those with duplicate
waypoint identifiers in the ADEXP portion cannot be processed properly.</p>
<h3 id="the-fprsa-r-system-has-bad-failure-modes">The <code>FPRSA-R</code> system has bad failure modes</h3>
<p>All systems can malfunction, so the important thing is that they malfunction <em>in
a good way</em> and that those responsible are <em>prepared</em> for malfunctions.</p>
<p>A single flight plan caused a problem, and the entire <code>FPRSA-R</code> system crashed,
which means no flight plans are being processed at all. If there is a problem
with a single flight plan, it should be moved to a separate slower queue, for
manual processing by humans. NATS acknowledges this in their "actions already
undertaken or in progress":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The addition of specific message filters into the data flow between IFPS and
FPRSA-R to filter out any flight plans that fit the conditions that caused the
incident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When <code>FPRSA-R</code> it did crash, it did so in an obscure way. This is a system
which <em>processes flight plans</em>, yet the relevant flight plan was only found in
"lower-level software logs". If there is an error processing a flight plan,
which brings down the whole system, a notification (including the flight plan)
should immediately be sent to some monitoring team.</p>
<p>NATS was also not prepared for an <code>FPRSA-R</code> system failure. The 1st
and 2nd Line support engineers were not able to locate, or did not think to
check, the low-level log files. This has been fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An operating instruction has been put in place to allow prompt recovery of the
FPRSA-R sub-system if the same circumstances recur. Each of the technical
operators have been trained to implement the new process. With enhanced
monitoring in place, additional engineering expertise will also be present to
oversee the activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="possible-lack-of-formal-verification">Possible lack of formal verification</h3>
<p>As reddit user <code>DontWannaMissAFling</code> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/16fhmuq/comment/k02o6n8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">points out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what's wild to me is that something as safety critical as air traffic
control apparently isn't using proven techniques like formal verification,
model checking to eliminate these classes of bugs entirely.</p>
<p>Like as an industry we use TLA+ to stop AWS from having downtime or Xboxes
segfaulting, but not to keep planes in the air?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that it certainly doesn't sound like any formal verification was used in
this case (for this system), and the report doesn't mention anything. Using
formal verification would certainly have helped here, I might explore this in
subsequent posts.</p>
<p>But it's possible formal verification was used, but faulty code still made its
way into production: end-2-end formal verification for large systems is still in
its infancy. We'll have to wait for the result of the enquiry to know more.</p>
<h2 id="humans-were-kept-safe-at-all-times">Humans were kept safe at all times</h2>
<p>I'd like to note (as does NATS in the report) that despite all the problems
highlighted above, planes in the air over the UK were still safe at all times.
They were being monitored by experienced ATCOs, which monitor planes by their
known flight plan, radio, radar and vision. The consequence of all this was not
that any human lives were put in danger, it's simply that far fewer flights
could take off in the first place, or had to be diverted away from UK airspace.
NATS did the right thing (reducing the number of flights), and kept everybody
safe.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-code-this-properly">How to code this properly</h2>
<p>So, how can we avoid this bug?</p>
<p>Let's recap the problem. There are two sequences of waypoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ADEXP</code>: the full list of waypoints.</li>
<li><code>ICAO</code>: a subsequence of the ADEXP waypoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the ICAO plan doesn't need to include the waypoints at which it
enters/exits an air traffic control region, extracting the segment of the ICAO
flight plan corresponding to the UK portion of the flight is not entirely
trivial. Of course, if we take the entire ICAO flight plan, it already contains
the UK portion, but what we really want is the <em>smallest</em> such segment. It's
interesting to note here that a flight could possibly enter UK airspace, and
then exit it again, and enter it again. We'll ignore this, that is, we will just
find a single contiguous segment that contains all UK portions of the flight,
since this is what the original code seemed to do.</p>
<p>I'm unsure why this task attempts to do this only using the ADEXP data, rather
than consulting a database about how waypoints and flight segments intersect UK
airspace. It seems strange, but let's move on.</p>
<p>Note that it is impossible to achieve this task with the ICAO flight plan alone
(and no knowledge of routes), even if you know for each waypoint if it is in the
UK or not. Indeed you could even be in a situation where <em>none</em> of the waypoints
in the ICAO route are in the UK, for example when the flight plan clips a small
portion of the UK between two of the ICAO waypoints.</p>
<p>So this is why the ADEXP waypoint list is used, and the assumption here, I
assume, is that the ADEXP list contains <em>all</em> the waypoints, and that
furthermore, waypoint granularity is such that if <em>adjacent</em> waypoints both
don't intersect UK airspace, then the segment between them doesn't either.</p>
<p>The mistake of the faulty algorithm described above is to try to work on both
the ICAO data and the ADEXP data as they are, maintaining pointers into each of
them, updating them with vague and wrong invariants in the background of the
programmer's mind. This is a recipe for bugs. Instead, the first thing to do is
to reconcile the data and then carefully extract the UK portion from that.</p>
<p>So we create a data structure for a plan:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell"><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- A flight plan, with segments between points 'p' via routes 'r'.
</span><span>data </span><span>Plan</span><span> p r
</span><span>  = </span><span>End</span><span> p
</span><span>  | </span><span>Leg</span><span> p r (</span><span>Plan</span><span> p r)
</span></code></pre>
<p>(This is <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> code, but the ideas apply to most languages.)</p>
<p>This says that a <code>Plan p r</code> has either arrived at its destination <code>End p</code>, or
consists of a segment starting from <code>p</code>, via <code>r</code>, and the <code>rest</code> of the plan:
<code>Leg p r rest</code>.</p>
<p>We can now define all the sorts of flight plan data we will deal with:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell"><code data-lang="haskell"><span>type </span><span>ICAO</span><span>     p r = </span><span>Plan</span><span> p r         </span><span>-- points and routes, no intermediate waypoints
</span><span>type </span><span>ADEXP</span><span>    p   = </span><span>Plan</span><span> p [p]       </span><span>-- points and intermediate waypoints, no route data
</span><span>type </span><span>Combined</span><span> p r = </span><span>Plan</span><span> p (</span><span>Via</span><span> p r) </span><span>-- all the data combined
</span><span>
</span><span>data </span><span>Via</span><span> p r = </span><span>Via
</span><span>  { route   :: r,
</span><span>    </span><span>through </span><span>::</span><span> [</span><span>p</span><span>]
</span><span>  }
</span><span>  </span><span>deriving</span><span> stock (</span><span>Show</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here <code>Combined</code> is our reconciled flight plan, it combined all the information
form ICAO and ADEXP. We can project a <code>Plan</code> back down to <code>ICAO</code> or <code>ADEXP</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell"><code data-lang="haskell"><span>projectICAO </span><span>:: Combined </span><span>p r </span><span>-&gt; ICAO </span><span>p r
</span><span>projectICAO = mapRoutes (.route)
</span><span>
</span><span>projectADEXP </span><span>:: Combined </span><span>p r </span><span>-&gt; ADEXP </span><span>p
</span><span>projectADEXP = mapRoutes (.through)
</span><span>
</span><span>mapRoutes </span><span>::</span><span> (</span><span>r </span><span>-&gt; </span><span>r</span><span>') </span><span>-&gt; Plan </span><span>p r </span><span>-&gt; Plan </span><span>p r</span><span>'
</span><span>mapRoutes _ (</span><span>End</span><span> p) = </span><span>End</span><span> p
</span><span>mapRoutes f (</span><span>Leg</span><span> p r rest) = </span><span>Leg</span><span> p (f r) (mapRoutes f rest)
</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll assume we have already parsed the data into the data structures above.
This is just a matter of reading the spec carefully and turning it into code,
and hopefully something the <code>FPRSA-R</code> did correctly, though as noted previously
it might be working on the text version directly.</p>
<p>Now we write our reconciliation function. For ICAO and ADEXP to reconcile, the
start and end points must match. When reconciling a leg of a flight plan, a
certain amount of waypoints can be skipped in the ICAO plan, and the rest of
them must reconcile with the rest of the flight plan:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell"><code data-lang="haskell"><span>reconcile </span><span>::</span><span> (</span><span>Eq </span><span>p</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; ICAO </span><span>p r </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> [</span><span>p</span><span>] </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> [</span><span>Combined </span><span>p r</span><span>]
</span><span>reconcile (</span><span>End</span><span> p) [p']             | p == p' = pure (</span><span>End</span><span> p)
</span><span>reconcile (</span><span>Leg</span><span> p r rest) (p' : ps) | p == p' = </span><span>do
</span><span>  (through, restAdexp) &lt;- splits ps
</span><span>  recoRest &lt;- reconcile rest restAdexp
</span><span>  pure (</span><span>Leg</span><span> p </span><span>Via</span><span> {route = r, through} recoRest)
</span><span>reconcile _ _ = </span><span>[]
</span><span>
</span><span>-- | All the ways to snap a list in two.
</span><span>splits </span><span>::</span><span> [</span><span>a</span><span>] </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> [([</span><span>a</span><span>], [</span><span>a</span><span>])]
</span><span>splits </span><span>[] </span><span>= [(</span><span>[]</span><span>, </span><span>[]</span><span>)]
</span><span>splits xs@(x : rest) = (</span><span>[]</span><span>, xs) : (first (x :) &lt;$&gt; splits rest)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that the function produces <em>all</em> the possible reconciliations. This is
because reconciliations are not necessarily unique because waypoints can appear
more than once. By calculating all the possible reconciliations, we'll know if
the data is ambiguous, and flag those flight plans for manual processing.</p>
<p>Next, we extract the UK portion of the flight plan. This is done in 3 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all legs at the start which don't cross into UK airspace.</li>
<li>Traverse the legs which are in UK airspace.</li>
<li>Once the rest of the flight plan is never again in the UK, cut it short.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each function calls the next step in sequence. Note that we return a
<code>NonUkPlan</code> error when the system reaches the end of the plan without having
found a UK part. By having a compiler which checks that pattern-matches are
covering, the possible failures arise naturally while coding.</p>

</span><span>                       ┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┫
</span><span>           4       2        8         5              1           9
</span><span>ICAO:  F------Q--------T--------O-----------P---------------Y--------U
</span><span>
</span><span>ADEXP: F   S  Q    C   T   A    O  E  X     P   W   B   Q   Y        U
</span><span>                       UK  UK   UK UK UK    UK  UK
</span></code></pre>
<p>The waypoint <code>Q</code> is a duplicate in the ADEXP list, but the system still returns
the correct portion of the ICAO flight path. Crisis averted! The fact that there
is a duplicate identifier in this case is immaterial, the ICAO and ADEXP data
still reconcile unambiguously, and the correct sub-route is well-defined.</p>
<p>How large can flight plans get? Well here is a flight plan from London to Sydney
that contains a total of 158 waypoints, and about a third of them appear in the
ICAO route:

<code>ukPortionOfICAO</code> returns practically instantly for such a flight plan.</p>

<span>Summary</span><a href="#summary"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In this post I’ll go into detail about how, during my contracting work for <a href="https://www.shimmerindustries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shimmer Industries</a> (a company founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/EskilSteenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eskil Steenberg</a> which is focused on developing a real-time lighting designing software), I worked on a piece of software which enabled us to use the MacOS and iOS APIs using a custom C API without having to use ObjC.</p>
<p>This technology (which we decided to call <strong>c-ocoa</strong>) was used to implement support for OSX &amp; iOS for Eskil’s platform abstraction library <a href="https://gamepipeline.org/betray.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">betray</a>. Betray is what’s driving the tools of Shimmer Industries. This allowed us to easily ship existing applications to mobile with only minimal code changes. <a href="https://felixk15.github.io/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/betray_abstraction.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/betray_abstraction.png" alt="Betray abstraction layers" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://felixk15.github.io/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/betray_abstraction.png"></a> <em>Abstraction layers of betray using c_ocoa for calling native APIs</em></p>
<p>Eskil was generous enough to allow me to write about how this problem was solved. Additionally, we decided to make the <a href="#sourcecode">final project completely open-source!</a>.</p>
<p>The result of the endevaour is effectively a C-API which you can use to interact with the Cocoa API. Since there are C bindings for virtually all programming languages out there, you could even use the generated API with</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/26.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lua</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a></li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, that’s right. Cocoa from the web, y’all!</p>
<p>In the end we have an application that shares 95% of it’s code between platforms and has an identical look and feel. <a href="https://felixk15.github.io/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/zenith_on_devices.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/zenith_on_devices.png" alt="Zenith on different devices" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://felixk15.github.io/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/zenith_on_devices.png"></a> <em>Application running on Android, Windows 11 and iOS</em></p>
<p>Since this is a code generator, another nice bonus is that you can immediately re-generate the C-API when a new ObjC API becomes available. There’s no waiting for the maintainer of a language bindings library to update the code, just re-run the generator and voila, you have the latest API.</p>
<p>Watched the latest WWDC where a new library got presented and want to try it out in your C-only program? Just re-generate and start tinkering!</p>

<span>“Why would you do this? Just use Objective-C!!!11”</span><a href="#why-would-you-do-this-just-use-objective-c11"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Let me start this post by saying that yes, we could’ve used ObjC to be able to use the MacOS and iOS APIs from within the C codebase that was already in place. We decided against it though, because we wanted to have a pure C codebase without any of the weird ObjC code in there. We didn’t want maintainers (who are all mostly familiar with C) to first learn how to parse ObjC and also thought that this would be a cool thing that might also interesting other developers. It was certainly an interesting experience for me since outside some courses in University, I’ve never touched an OSX or iOS development and was also unfamiliar with ObjC and XCode as an IDE.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-objective-c-runtime">
<span>Introducing the Objective-C runtime</span><a href="#introducing-the-objective-c-runtime"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Eskil actually gave me the first hint by pointing me towards the ObjC runtime.</p>
<p>Quoting the official documentation it states that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Objective-C runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Objective-C language”</a>. This sounds interesting, but slighty vague, so after taking a closer look at the documentation and the API itself, to see if there’s stuff in there that could be of use for solving this problem, I was delighted to see that there’s stuff like “give me a list of all classes and methods” and, most importantly “call the function with a given name on this object”. Bingo, this is exactly what I was looking for and seems to be a good foundation to build a C API on. Even better: The ObjC runtime itself is even a pure C API!</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">
<span>The plan</span><a href="#the-plan"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The overall plan is to have a C API which, under the hood, uses the ObjC runtime to call functions that are normally only accessible when programming in ObjC.</p>
<p>In praxis this would mean that ObjC code like this:</p>

<p>It was clear pretty early on that we’d need some kind of external code-generation tool that would use the ObjC runtime to parse the ObjC APIs and use the parsed information to generate the C API.</p>
<h2 id="the-code-generator">
<span>The code generator</span><a href="#the-code-generator"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Let’s get right into it and talk about the code generator. From a birds-eye-view the code generator is a command-line tool (written in C) which uses the ObjC runtime API to query various data from ObjC APIs and uses this queried data to generate multiple .c/.h files which can be used in a project to interface with these ObjC APIs using normal C functions.</p>
<p>For each ObjC class that you want to create a C API for, the tool basically does these things in order: <a href="https://felixk15.github.io/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/code_generator_workflow.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/code_generator_workflow.png" alt="Code Generator Workflow" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://felixk15.github.io/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/code_generator_workflow.png"></a> <em>Code Generator Workflow</em></p>
<h3 id="query-objc-class">
<span>Query ObjC Class</span><a href="#query-objc-class"><i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The first step is to query metadata about the class that we’re interested in turning into a C API. The code generator works by providing it with one or more ObjC class name(s) (optionally including wildcards). For each class the generator generates a pair of .c/.h files.</p>
<p>This is done by first querying for <em>all</em> (see notes about what <em>all</em> actually means) available classes using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418579-objc_getclasslist?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>objc_getClassList()</code></a>. The query results will be returned using an opaque type <code>Class</code> which can be used together with <code>class_</code> prefixed functions to query more metadata about a specific class. So the generator first caches all available classes (I’ll later talk about how classes are made visible for the ObjC runtime API) and then compares the name of each class (by using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418635-class_getname?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>class_getName()</code></a>) against the input of the user.</p>
<p>Once one ore more matching classes have been found, we move to the next step.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: <em>All</em> available classes depends on what ObjC frameworks are linked at the time the code generator is run. This also means that you can’t generate code for iOS only classes when running the code generator on OSX since you can’t link the iOS frameworks to the OSX app. For generating code for iOS classes, you have to run the code generator on an iOS simulator.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="flattening-objc-class-hierarchy">
<span>Flattening ObjC Class Hierarchy</span><a href="#flattening-objc-class-hierarchy"><i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>ObjC is an object oriented language, C is not. So we need some way to map ObjC’s “object orientness” to C functions.</p>
<p>For this problem I decided to flatten the class hierarchy of the class that you want to export to C. This is done by using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418498-class_getsuperclass?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>class_getSuperClass()</code></a> function from the ObjC Runtime API - this also returns an object of type <code>Class</code> - same as <code>objc_getClassList()</code> before.</p>
<p>For each class found during the “Query ObjC Class” step, the program needs to recursively move up the class hierarchy, This is an image illustrating the class hierarchy for the class <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutablestring?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>NSMutableString</code></a>: <a href="https://felixk15.github.io/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/class_hierarchy.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/class_hierarchy.png" alt="Class Hierarchy of NSMutableString" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://felixk15.github.io/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/class_hierarchy.png"></a> <em>Class Hierarchy of NSMutableString (The arrow point upwards the class hierarchy)</em></p>
<p>Unlike C++, ObjC does <em>not</em> support multiple inheritance (thank god!), so this process is rather straight-forward.</p>
<p>By using <code>class_getSuperClass()</code>, we can recursively go up the class hierarchy and query the methods of each individual class. Querying the methods of a class is done using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418490-class_copymethodlist?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>class_copyMethodList()</code></a> API - this returns an array of the opaque type <code>Method</code> which can be used to query metadata about a specific method.</p>
<p>The result of this step is an array of methods from the complete class hierarchy. Spoiler: Since we’ll later call the methods using just their name, we don’t have to worry about methods that have been overriden at this point.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: This works for only for <em>non-static</em> methods. To also get the <em>static</em> methods of a class you have to get what’s called the <code>meta-class</code>. This is done by using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418629-object_getclass?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>object_getClass()</code></a> function with a <code>Class</code> object as it’s argument. This returns another object of type <code>Class</code>. This object can be used together with <code>class_copyMethodList()</code> to get the list of static methods.</p></blockquote>
<p>The result of this step are 2 arrays:</p>
<ol>
<li>Array of all <em>static</em> methods</li>
<li>Array of all <em>non-static</em> methods</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="resolving-objc-runtime-types">
<span>Resolving ObjC Runtime Types</span><a href="#resolving-objc-runtime-types"><i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Before talking about how the metadata of methods is queried, I have to talk about how types are encoded in the ObjC runtime.</p>
<p>When querying argument and/or return types using the ObjC runtime you “only” get back a string. Naively I though that this is just the name of the return type (eg: <code>int</code>, <code>float</code> or <code>NSString</code>) but things are a bit more complicated than that. Basically we have to differentiate between base types (<code>int</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>float</code> etc), user defined POD(plain-old-data) types (your typical structs), references (pointers) and ids (more on that later). For each of these types, the type name from the ObjC runtime has to be parsed differently.</p>
<h4 id="base-types">
<span>Base Types</span><a href="#base-types"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Let’s start with the most simple - base types. Instead of fully qualified type names (like <code>int</code>), the ObjC runtime returns a string with 1 element. Fortunately, there’s a 1:1 mapping between these “ObjC base types” and “C base types”. The mapping listed below is from the <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-709/runtime/runtime.h.auto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>objc/runtime.h</code></a> file</p>
<div>

</div>
<h4 id="user-defined-structs">
<span>User defined structs</span><a href="#user-defined-structs"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The next type, user defined POD types (struct XY) are a bit more complex. The ObjC runtime returns the type name and the complete layout of the custom type. To drive home what I mean by this, think of a struct like this:</p>
<div>

<p><code><table><tbody><tr>
<td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td>
<td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>AwesomeType</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>a</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
  <span>float</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></tbody></table></code></p>
</div>
<p>This type would be encoded by the ObjC runtime like this: <code>{AwesomeType=cif}</code> With the info on how base types are encoded, the part after the equal sign can be parsed as a list of base types. So this is basically <code>AwesomeType = char int float</code>.</p>
<p>This extends to structs within structs as well. So this struct:</p>
<div>

<p><code><table><tbody><tr>
<td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
</pre></td>
<td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>;</span>
  <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
  <span>float</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Boo</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>double</span> <span>a</span><span>;</span>
  <span>Foo</span> <span>foo</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></tbody></table></code></p>
</div>
<p>Would result in this type name for <code>struct Boo</code>: <code>{Boo=d{Foo=iIf}}</code>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: The first version of the code generator actually re-created all structs that where used as return and argument types but as you might already have guessed, you loose the member name of each struct member. The current version assumes that you use the actual ObjC struct (which are the same as C structs).</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="references">
<span>References</span><a href="#references"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Following this, we have references which are marked with a <code>^</code> preceeding the encoded type name. This is thankfully quite easy to incorporate into the existing type parsing. Care should be taken with opaque types however since they’ll be returned like this: <code>{OpaqueType=}</code> (For reference: Opaque types are types where the caller doesn’t know the type layout).</p>
<h4 id="id">
<span>ID</span><a href="#id"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Finally, we have id - this is actually a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">type from the objc runtime API</a>. This is a reference to an ObjC object, unfortunately for this we don’t get any more type information. Looking at this from C, we basically only know that this is a <code>void*</code> and not what type.</p>
<h3 id="collect-objc-method-metadata">
<span>Collect ObjC Method Metadata</span><a href="#collect-objc-method-metadata"><i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Now that it is established how the types are encoded, we can continue with querying metadata about each individual method.</p>
<p>After the class hierarchy has been flattened, we have generated a list of all methods of the complete class hierarchy. In this step we use this list to query information about each individual method. Things that we’re interested in include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Method Name</li>
<li>Return Type</li>
<li>Number of Parameters</li>
<li>Type of Parameters</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we now operate on objects of type <code>Method</code>, we can use the ObjC runtime functions prefixed with <code>method_</code>. The first function that is being used is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418758-method_getname?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>method_getName()</code></a> - this is similar to <code>class_getName()</code> and returns a string.</p>
<p>The next function that we can use is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418591-method_getreturntype?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>method_getReturnType()</code></a> this returns an ObjC runtime encoded type string (that we know how to parse thanks to <a href="#resolving-objc-runtime-types">the previous chapter</a>). To get the parameter list, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418968-method_getnumberofarguments?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>method_getNumberOfArguments()</code></a> together with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418607-method_getargumenttype?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>method_getArgumentType()</code></a> can be used. The returned type is also encoded as an ObjC runtime type.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: Unfortunately the name of the arguments can not be queried - until this is solved, the arguments follow a <code>arg0</code>, <code>arg1</code>, <code>arg2</code>, etc naming-scheme.</p></blockquote>
<p>With these information available, we have a complete function signature and now only need to find out how we can do the actual function call.</p>
<h3 id="calling-objc-methods-using-the-objc-runtime">
<span>Calling ObjC Methods Using The ObjC Runtime</span><a href="#calling-objc-methods-using-the-objc-runtime"><i></i></a>

<p>For calling ObjC methods various variations of <code>objc_msgSend</code> can be used. I say “various variations” because there are multiple version depending on what kind of return value you expect (this only applies when targeting i386 hosts).</p>

</ol>
<p>Calculating the size of the return type can be added as part of the pass where the return type is parsed. During code generation, the size and type of the return value can then be used to select the correct <code>objc_msgSend</code> function.</p>
<p>If you look at the definition of any of these function, you’ll see that the first 2 arguments are always <code>ID self</code> and <code>SEL selector</code>. The first argument <code>ID self</code> is a pointer to the object which we want to call this method on (or, in case of static methods, the meta-class). The <code>SEL selector</code> argument is the name of the method at runtime. This can be retrieved by calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418557-sel_registername?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>sel_registerName()</code></a> with the method name as argument (as given by <code>method_getName()</code>).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: The return value of <code>sel_registerName()</code> is cached internally.</p></blockquote>

</h3>
<p>We’re now perfectly set-up to start generating the C source code, which will become the basis of our API.</p>
<p>If you remember from <a href="#flattening-objc-class-hierarchy">the previous chapter</a> we are left with 2 arrays which contain elements of type <code>Method</code> after the class hierarchy has been flattened. One array for static and one array for non-static methods. These arrays are now used to create matching C functions for each individual method.</p>
<p>We do this by using the method meta-data that we’ve collected <a href="#collect-objc-method-metadata">earlier</a>. The result of this step will be matching .h/.c files for each ObjC class that should be exported.</p>
<p>The first step when writing the C source files is always the file prefix. For .h files the prefix is a header guard and a single typedef for syntactic sugar (example for <code>NSString</code>):</p>
<div>

<p><code><table><tbody><tr>
<td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td>
<td><pre><span>#ifndef C_OCOA_NSSTRING_HEADER
#define C_OCOA_NSSTRING_HEADER
</span><span>typedef</span> <span>nsstring_t</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></tbody></table></code></p>
</div>
<p>(for .h files there’s also a postfix needed to add the <code>#endif</code> for the header guard).</p>
<p>For .c files this is a couple of defines that change what variation of <code>objc_msgSend</code> is being called based on the target ABI (since this could theoretically be x86 or ARM). To make the generated C code work on both architectures, these defines are added at the beginning of every .c file:</p>
<div>

<p><code><table><tbody><tr>
<td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

#define abi_objc_msgSend_stret objc_msgSend_stret
#endif
#ifdef __i386__
#define abi_objc_msgSend_fpret objc_msgSend_fpret
#else
#define abi_objc_msgSend_fpret objc_msgSend
#endif
</span></pre></td>
</tr></tbody></table></code></p>
</div>
<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: this means that instead of <code>objc_msgSend_stret</code> and <code>objc_msgSend_fpret</code> we need to use <code>abi_objc_msgSend_stret</code> &amp; <code>abi_objc_msgSend_fpret</code> respectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>For each C function we first call <code>sel_registerName()</code> to get the correct selector for the method that we want to call. After that we have to make the call to <code>objc_msgSend()</code> to perform the actual function call.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: Since all the <code>objc_msgSend</code> function are typless, they need to be cast to the correct function-ptr type to be called with the correct arguments. This will be done using a “synctactic-sugar” helper-macro for better readability and debugability.</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="example">

<p>To give a concrete example let’s focus on the source code generation of the <code>NSString</code> class with one method, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1415702-getcstring?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>getCString()</code></a></p>

<span>Conclusion</span><a href="#conclusion"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Generating a pure C API to interface with the OSX/iOS system APIs was a very interesting problem for me personally since it gave me an excuse to work with ObjC and get to know some internals of the language. This was definitely a big undertaking and, to be honest, I expected it to fail at any moment because of some problem(s) that we didn’t foresee. But fortunately everything worked out pretty nicely and it was definitely a scary feeling letting the generator work through the <em>entire</em> class hierarchy of big frameworks like <strong>AppKit</strong>, <strong>Foundation</strong> or <strong>GLKit</strong>. That being said we did hit a couple of problems that we’re actively working on, namely parameter naming and adding auto-generated documentation to the various functions. But all in all the result is pretty cool and we were able to ship an iOS application using the technology.</p>

<p>Today, Elon Musk's X Corp. <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/X-Corp-v-Bonta-9-8-2023-Complaint.pdf">sued</a> to block California's content moderation law, AB 587. In its complaint, filed in a US district court in California, X Corp. is seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction stopping California Attorney General Robert Bonta from enforcing the law.</p>
<p>AB 587 passed in September 2022, requiring social media platforms to submit a "terms of service report" semi-annually to California's attorney general, providing "a detailed description of content moderation practices used" and "information about whether, and if so how, the social media company defines and moderates" hate speech or racism, extremism or radicalization, disinformation or misinformation, harassment, and foreign political interference. Under the law, social media platforms must also provide information and statistics on any content moderation actions taken in those categories.</p>
<p>In X's complaint, the company accused California of trying to dictate X's terms of service and compel "controversial disclosures about how X Corp. moderates content on its platform."</p>
<p>The law stipulated that all platforms were required to start collecting data for their first terms of service report covering content moderation during the third quarter of 2023 and submit those reports to Bonta by January 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Platforms could be found violating the law for failing to post terms of service about content moderation, missing a deadline to submit a terms of service report, or materially omitting or misrepresenting information about content moderation. Any platform violating the law risks fines—which X described as "draconian financial penalties"—up to $15,000 per violation per day.</p>
<p>In its complaint, X Corp. argued that AB 587 violates the First Amendment by compelling "companies like X Corp. to engage in speech against their will" and "impermissibly" interfering "with the constitutionally protected editorial judgments of companies." X Corp. said that if the court did not block the law, California could pressure companies "to remove, demonetize, or deprioritize constitutionally protected speech that the state deems undesirable or harmful."</p>
<p>"The State of California touts AB 587 as a mere 'transparency measure' under which certain social media companies must make their content moderation policies and statistics publicly&nbsp;available," X's complaint said. But, X alleged, the state's "true intent" is "to pressure social media platforms to 'eliminate' certain constitutionally protected content viewed by the state as problematic."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>X Corp. alleged that AB 587 violates other laws, including the Dormant Commerce Clause—"failing to restrict its extensive reporting requirements to information about Californians"—and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act—which grants platforms immunity from liability for “any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.”</p>
<p>"Because AB 587 imposes liability on such actions if they are taken without the required disclosures, AB 587 is preempted by the broad immunity afforded by Section 230," X's complaint said.</p>
<p>Ars could not immediately reach X for comment. Bonta's office said: “While we have not yet been served with the complaint, we will review it and respond in court.”</p>
<p>The author of AB 587, California assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, released a statement saying that the law "is a pure transparency measure that simply requires companies to be upfront about if and how they are moderating content. It in no way requires any specific content moderation policies—which is why it passed with strong, bipartisan support. If Twitter has nothing to hide, then they should have no objection to this bill.”</p>
<p>But tech groups and policy experts echoed X's concerns over AB 587.</p>
<p>Adam Kovacevich, the CEO of the tech industry policy coalition Chamber of Progress, said that "requiring companies to give their content moderation playbook to scammers and conspiracists is a bad idea."</p>
<p>“Even if you don't like anything about Elon Musk’s leadership of X, it’s clear that requiring tech platforms to publish a detailed blueprint of how to work around content moderators will have negative consequences for users online," Kovacevich said. "Letting platforms set their own editorial standards also leaves consumers with more choices about what kind of platforms they spend time on.”</p>
<p>Netchoice, a group representing tech companies and trade associations, has called AB 587 "the Golden State’s new online censorship law." In a statement about X Corp.'s lawsuit, Netchoice said that the law would force companies to submit "intrusive" and "often impossible to comply with" disclosures "about constitutionally protected editorial decisions." Netchoice's director of litigation, Chris Marchese, said that the court should enjoin AB 587 to protect free speech online.</p>
<p>“The First Amendment prohibits the government from regulating lawful speech—directly or indirectly," Marchese said. "States cannot avoid this prohibition by rebranding censorship as ‘transparency’ requirements."</p>

<p>Nvidia is an amazing company that has executed a contrarian vision for decades, and has rightly become one of the most valuable corporations on the planet thanks to its central role in the AI revolution. I want to explain why I believe it’s top spot in machine learning is far from secure over the next few years. To do that, I’m going to talk about some of the drivers behind Nvidia’s current dominance, and then how they will change in the future.</p>



<h2><span>Currently</span></h2>



<p>Here’s why I think Nvidia is winning so hard right now.</p>



<p><strong>#1 – Almost Nobody is Running Large ML Apps</strong></p>



<p>Outside of a few large tech companies, very few corporations have advanced to actually running large scale AI models in production. They’re still figuring out how to get started with these new capabilities, so the main costs are around dataset collection, hardware for training, and salaries for model authors. This means that machine learning is focused on training, not inference.</p>



<p><strong>#2 – All Nvidia Alternatives Suck</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a developer creating or using ML models, using an Nvidia GPU is a lot easier and less time consuming than an AMD OpenCL card, Google TPU, a Cerebras system, or any other hardware. The software stack is much more mature, there are many more examples, documentation, and other resources, finding engineers experienced with Nvidia is much easier, and integration with all of the major frameworks is better. There is no realistic way for a competitor to beat the platform effect Nvidia has built. It makes sense for the current market to be winner-takes-all, and they’re the winner, full stop.</p>



<p><strong>#3 – Researchers have the Purchasing Power</strong></p>



<p>It’s incredibly hard to hire ML researchers, anyone with experience has their pick of job offers right now. That means they need to be kept happy, and one of the things they demand is use of the Nvidia platform. It’s what they know, they’re productive with it, picking up an alternative would take time and not result in skills the job market values, whereas working on models with the tools they’re comfortable with does. Because researchers are so expensive to hire and retain, their preferences are given a very high priority when purchasing hardware.</p>



<p><strong>#4 – Training Latency Rules</strong></p>



<p>As a rule of thumb models need to be trainable from scratch in about a week. I’ve seen this hold true since the early days of AlexNet, because if the iteration cycle gets any longer it’s very hard to do the empirical testing and prototyping that’s still essential to reach your accuracy goals. As hardware gets faster, people build bigger models up until the point that the training once again takes roughly the same amount of time, and reap the benefits through higher-quality models rather than reduced total training time. This makes buying the latest Nvidia GPUs very attractive, since your existing code will mostly just work, but faster. In theory there’s an opportunity here for competitors to win with lower latency, but the inevitably poor state of their software stack (CUDA has had decades of investment) means it’s mostly an illusion.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s going to change?</strong></h2>



<p>So, hopefully I’ve made a convincing case that there are strong structural reasons behind Nvidia’s success. Here’s how I see those conditions changing over the next few years.</p>



<p><strong>#1 – Inference will Dominate, not Training</strong></p>



<p>Somebody years ago told me “Training costs scale with the number of researchers, inference costs scale with the number of users”. What I took away from this is that there’s some point in the future where the amount of compute any company is using for running models on user requests will exceed the cycles they’re spending on training. Even if the cost of a single training run is massive and running inference is cheap, there are so many potential users in the world with so many different applications that the accumulated total of those inferences will exceed the training total. There are only ever going to be so many researchers.</p>



<p>What this means for hardware is that priorities will shift towards reducing inference costs. A lot of ML researchers see inference as a subset of training, but this is wrong in some fundamental ways. It’s often very hard to assemble a sizable batch of inputs during inference, because that process trades off latency against throughput, and latency is almost always key in user-facing applications. Small or single-input batches change the workload dramatically, and call for very different optimization approaches. There are also a lot of things (like the weights) that remain constant during inference, and so can benefit from pre-processing techniques like weight compression or constant folding.</p>



<p><strong>#2 – CPUs are Competitive for Inference </strong></p>



<p>I didn’t even list CPUs in the Nvidia alternatives above because they’re still laughably slow for training. The main desktop CPUs (x86, Arm, and maybe RISC-V soon) have the benefit of many decades of toolchain investment. They have an even more mature set of development tools and community than Nvidia. They can also be much cheaper per arithmetic op than any GPU.</p>



<p>Old-timers will remember the early days of the internet when most of the cost of setting up a dot-com was millions of dollars for a bunch of high-end web server hardware from someone like Sun. This was because they were the only realistic platform that could serve web pages reliably and with low-latency. They had the fastest hardware money could buy, and that was important when entire sites needed to fit on a single machine. Sun’s market share was rapidly eaten by the introduction of software that could distribute the work across a large number of individually much less capable machines, commodity x86 boxes that were far cheaper.</p>



<p>Training is currently very hard to distribute in a similar way. The workloads make it possible to split work across a few GPUs that are tightly interconnected, but the pattern of continuous updates makes reducing latency by sharding across low-end CPUs unrealistic. This is not true for inference though. The model weights are fixed and can easily be duplicated across a lot of machines at initialization time, so no communication is needed. This makes an army of commodity PCs very appealing for applications relying on ML inference.</p>



<p><strong>#3 – Deployment Engineers gain Power</strong></p>



<p>As inference costs begin to dominate training, there will be a lot of pressure to reduce those costs. Researchers will no longer be the highest priority, so their preferences will carry less weight. They will be asked to do things that are less personally exciting in order to streamline production. There are also going to be a lot more people capable of training models coming into the workforce over the next few years, as the skills involved become more widely understood. This all means researchers’ corporate power will shrink and the needs of the deployment team will be given higher priority.</p>



<p><strong>#4 – Application Costs Rule</strong></p>



<p>When inference dominates the overall AI budget, the hardware and workload requirements are very different. Researchers value the ability to quickly experiment, so they need flexibility to prototype new ideas. Applications usually change their models comparatively infrequently, and may use the same fundamental architecture for years, once the researchers have come up with something that meets their needs. We may almost be heading towards a world where model authors use a specialized tool, like Matlab is for mathematical algorithms, and then hand over the results to deployment engineers who will manually convert the results into something more efficient for an application. This will make sense because any cost savings will be multiplied over a long period of time if the model architecture remains constant (even if the weights change).</p>



<h2>What does this Mean for the Future?</h2>



<p>If you believe my four predictions above, then it’s hard to escape the conclusion that Nvidia’s share of the overall AI market is going to drop. That market is going to grow massively so I wouldn’t be surprised if they continue to grow in absolute unit numbers, but I can’t see how their current margins will be sustainable.</p>



<p>I expect the winners of this shift will be traditional CPU platforms like x86 and Arm. Inference will need to be tightly integrated into traditional business logic to run end user applications, so it’s difficult to see how even hardware specialized for inference can live across a bus, with the latency involved. Instead I expect CPUs to gain much more tightly integrated machine learning support, first as co-processors and eventually as specialized instructions, like the evolution of floating point support.</p>



<p>On a personal level, these beliefs drive my own research and startup focus. The impact of improving inference is going to be so high over the next few years, and it still feels neglected compared to training. There are signs that this is changing though. Communities like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/">r/LocalLlama</a> are mostly focused on improving inference, the success of <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml">GGML</a> shows how much of an appetite there is for inference-focused frameworks, and the spread of a few general-purpose models increases the payoff of inference optimizations. One reason I’m so obsessed with the edge is that it’s the closest environment to the army of commodity PCs that I think will run most cloud AI in the future. Even back in 2013 I originally wrote <a href="https://github.com/jetpacapp/DeepBeliefSDK">the Jetpac SDK</a> to accelerate computer vision on a cluster of 100 m1.small AWS servers, since that was cheaper and faster than a GPU instance for running inference across millions of images. It was only afterwards that I realized what a good fit it was for mobile devices.</p>



<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether inference is going to be as important as I’m predicting! Let me know in the comments if you think I’m onto something, or if I should be stocking up on Nvidia stock.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
       <p>Two communicating processes on a single machine have a few options. They can use regular TCP sockets, UDP sockets, unix domain sockets, or shared memory. A recent project I was working on used Node.js with two communicating processes on the same machine. I wanted to know how to reduce the CPU utilization of the machine, so I ran a few experiments to compare the efficiency between unix domain sockets and TCP sockets using the loopback interface. This post covers my experiments and test results.</p>
<p>First off, is a disclaimer. This test is not exhaustive. Both client and server are written in Node.js and can only be as efficient as the Node.js runtime.</p>
<p>All code in this post is available at:&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/nicmcd/uds_vs_tcp">github.com/nicmcd/uds_vs_tcp</a></p>
<h2>Server Application</h2>
<p>I created a simple Node.js server application that could be connected to via TCP socket or Unix domain socket. It simply echos all received messages. Here is the code:</p>
<pre title="">var assert = require('assert');
assert(process.argv.length == 4, 'node server.js &lt;tcp port&gt; &lt;domain socket path&gt;');

var net = require('net');

var tcpPort = parseInt(process.argv[2]);
assert(!isNaN(tcpPort), 'bad TCP port');
console.log('TCP port: ' + tcpPort);

var udsPath = process.argv[3];
console.log('UDS path: ' + udsPath);

function createServer(name, portPath) {
    var server = net.createServer(function(socket) {
        console.log(name + ' server connected');
        socket.on('end', function() {
            console.log(name + ' server disconnected');
        });
        socket.write('start sending now!');
        socket.pipe(socket);
    });
    server.listen(portPath, function() {
        console.log(name + ' server listening on ' + portPath);
    });
}

var tcpServer = createServer('TCP', tcpPort);
var udsServer = createServer('UDS', udsPath);
</pre>
<h2>Client Application</h2>
<p><span>The client application complements the server application. It connects to the server via TCP or Unix domain sockets. It sends a bunch of randomly generated packets and measures the time it takes to finish. When complete, it prints the time and exits. Here is the code:</span></p>
<pre title="">var assert = require('assert');
assert(process.argv.length == 5, 'node client.js &lt;port or path&gt; &lt;packet size&gt; &lt;packet count&gt;');

var net = require('net');
var crypto = require('crypto');

if (isNaN(parseInt(process.argv[2])) == false)
    var options = {port: parseInt(process.argv[2])};
else
    var options = {path: process.argv[2]};
console.log('options: ' + JSON.stringify(options));

var packetSize = parseInt(process.argv[3]);
assert(!isNaN(packetSize), 'bad packet size');
console.log('packet size: ' + packetSize);

var packetCount = parseInt(process.argv[4]);
assert(!isNaN(packetCount), 'bad packet count');
console.log('packet count: ' + packetCount);

var client = net.connect(options, function() {
    console.log('client connected');
});

var printedFirst = false;
var packet = crypto.randomBytes(packetSize).toString('base64').substring(0,packetSize);
var currPacketCount = 0;
var startTime;
var endTime;
var delta;
client.on('data', function(data) {
    if (printedFirst == false) {
        console.log('client received: ' + data);
        printedFirst = true;
    }
    else {
        currPacketCount += 1;
        if (data.length != packetSize)
            console.log('weird packet size: ' + data.length);
        //console.log('client received a packet: ' + currPacketCount);
    }

    if (currPacketCount &lt; packetCount) {
        if (currPacketCount == 0) {
            startTime = process.hrtime();
        }
        client.write(packet);
    } else {
        client.end();
        endTime = process.hrtime(startTime);
        delta = (endTime[0] * 1e9 + endTime[1]) / 1e6;
        console.log('millis: ' + delta);
    }
});
</pre>
<h2>Running a Single Test</h2>
<p>First start the server application with:</p>
<pre title="">node server.js 5555 /tmp/uds
</pre>
<p>This starts the server using TCP port 5555 and Unix domain socket /tmp/uds.</p>
<p>Now we can run the client application to get some statistics. Let’s first try the TCP socket. Run the client with:</p>
<pre title="">
node client.js 5555 1000 100000

</pre>
<p>This runs the client application using TCP port 5555 and sends 100,000 packets all sized 1000 bytes. This tooks 8006 milliseconds on my machine. We can now try running with the Unix domain socket with:</p>
<pre title="">
node client.js /tmp/uds 1000 100000

</pre>
<p>This runs the client the same as before except it uses the /tmp/uds Unix domain socket instead of the TCP socket. On my machine this took 3570 milliseconds to run. These two runs show that for 1k byte packets, Unix domain sockets are about 2-3x more efficient than TCP sockets.<br>
At this point you might be completely convinced that Unix domain sockets are better and you’ll use them whenever you can. That’s too easy. Let’s run the client application a whole bunch of times and graph the results.<br>
I recently posted about a <a title="taskrun – An easy-to-use python package for running tasks with dependencies and process&nbsp;management" href="https://nicisdigital.wordpress.com/2013/12/13/taskrun/">python package</a> I created for running many tasks and aggregating the data. I thought this socket comparison would make a good example.</p>
<h2>Running the Full Test</h2>
<p>As mentioned, running the full test uses the Taskrun Python package (available at <a title="Taskrun Python Package" href="http://github.com/nicmcd/taskrun">github.com/nicmcd/taskrun</a>). The script I quickly hacked together to run the client application and parse the results is as follows:</p>
<pre title="">
import taskrun
import os

POWER = 15
RUNS = 10
PACKETS_PER_RUN = 100000

manager = taskrun.Task.Manager(
    numProcs = 1,
    showCommands = True,
    runTasks = True,
    showProgress = True)

DIR = "sims"
mkdir = manager.task_new('dir', 'rm -rI ' + DIR + '; mkdir ' + DIR)

def makeName(stype, size, run):
    return stype + '_size' + str(size) + '_run' + str(run)

def makeCommand(port_or_path, size, name):
    return 'node client.js ' + port_or_path + ' ' + str(size) + ' ' + str(PACKETS_PER_RUN) + \
        ' | grep millis | awk \'{printf "%s, ", $2}\' &gt; ' + os.path.join(DIR, name)

barrier1 = manager.task_new('barrier1', 'sleep 0')
for exp in range(0, POWER):
    size = pow(2, exp)
    for run in range(0, RUNS):
        # Unix domain socket test
        name = makeName('uds', size, run)
        task = manager.task_new(name, makeCommand('/tmp/uds', size, name))
        task.dependency_is(mkdir)
        barrier1.dependency_is(task)

        # TCP socket test
        name = makeName('tcp', size, run)
        task = manager.task_new(name, makeCommand('5555', size, name))
        task.dependency_is(mkdir)
        barrier1.dependency_is(task)

# create CSV header
filename = os.path.join(DIR, 'uds_vs_tcp.csv')
header = 'NAME, '
for run in range(0, RUNS):
    header += 'RUN ' + str(run) + ', '
hdr_task = manager.task_new('CSV header', 'echo \'' + header + '\' &gt; ' + filename)
hdr_task.dependency_is(barrier1)

# UDS to CSV
cmd = ''
for exp in range(0,POWER):
    size = pow(2, exp)
    cmd += 'echo -n \'UDS Size ' + str(size) + ', \' &gt;&gt; ' + filename + '; '
    for run in range(0, RUNS):
        name = makeName('uds', size, run)
        cmd += 'cat ' + os.path.join(DIR, name) + ' &gt;&gt; ' + filename + '; '
    cmd += 'echo \'\' &gt;&gt; ' + filename + '; '
uds_task = manager.task_new('UDS to CSV', cmd)
uds_task.dependency_is(hdr_task)

# TCP to CSV
cmd = ''
for exp in range(0,POWER):
    size = pow(2, exp)
    cmd += 'echo -n \'TCP Size ' + str(size) + ', \' &gt;&gt; ' + filename + '; '
    for run in range(0, RUNS):
        name = makeName('tcp', size, run)
        cmd += 'cat ' + os.path.join(DIR, name) + ' &gt;&gt; ' + filename + '; '
    cmd += 'echo \'\' &gt;&gt; ' + filename + '; '
tcp_task = manager.task_new('TCP to CSV', cmd)
tcp_task.dependency_is(uds_task)

manager.run_request_is()

</pre>
<p>Admittedly, this isn’t the prettiest code to look at, but it gets the job done. For both Unix domain socket and TCP socket, it runs the client application for all packet sizes that are a power of 2 from 1 to 16384. Each setup is run 10 times. Each test result is written to its own file. After all the tests have been run, the taskrun script creates a CSV file using all the test results. The CSV file can then be imported into a spreadsheet application for analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I ran this on an&nbsp;<a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/75789/">Intel E5-2620 v2</a>&nbsp;processor with 16GB of RAM. I imported the CSV into Excel, averaged the 10 results of each setup, then graphed the results. This first graph shows the execution time compared to packet size on a logarithmic graph.</p>

<p>The results shown here are fairly predicable. The Unix domain sockets are always more efficient and the efficiency benefit is in the 2-3x range. After noticing some weird ups and down in the graph, I decided to generate a graph with the execution times normalized to the TCP execution time.</p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure why the efficiency of Unix domain sockets varies as it does compared to TCP sockets, but it is always better. This is simply because Unix domain sockets don’t traverse the operating system’s network stack. The kernel simply copies the data from the client’s application into the file buffer in the server’s application.</p>

    <p>If you ever tried to learn how the Harris corner detection algorithm works, you might have
noticed that the process is not intuitive at all. First, you start with an energy function, approximate it
using Taylor approximation, get a matrix from that, then find the eigenvalues of that matrix, etc.
But when you come to the final implementation, it is rather simple and seems easier.
If you are like me, this is not intuitive at all. But today I will present you a much easier way to understand
how the Harris corner detection algorithm works.</p>

<p>Let’s start with understanding what is a corner. We can simply think of it as a connection of edges. For two edges
to be able to connect, they sure need to be not parallel, so looking at a corner, we should see that
edges moving in different directions (they would be parallel if they moved in the same directions):</p>

<p><em>Figure source: <a href="https://www.cse.psu.edu/~rtc12/CSE486/lecture06.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cse.psu.edu/~rtc12/CSE486/lecture06.pdf</a></em></p>

<p>So it is obvious that the gradients of the image I<sub>x</sub> and I<sub>y</sub> will both be active in the corner
region. We know that adding I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> and I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup> shows the regions with change
in x <strong><em>or</em></strong> y directions (which is the basis of the all edge detection algorithms). So one thing that comes to mind is multiplying the I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>
and I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup> so that we will only see regions on the image that have a change in both x <strong><em>and</em></strong> y
directions at the same time, just like corners!</p>

<p>Let’s start implementing this. First, let’s find a pretty basic image that will have lots of corners inside it.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>cv2</span>
<span>import</span> <span>matplotlib.pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>

<span># wget https://logowik.com/content/uploads/images/bbc-america9038.jpg -O assets/bbc.jpg
</span>
<span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>imread</span><span>(</span><span>"assets/bbc.jpg"</span><span>,</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>IMREAD_GRAYSCALE</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>cmap</span><span>=</span><span>"gray"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://comsci.blog/assets/intuitive-harris_1_1.png" alt="png"></p>

<p>Now we can start finding the gradient of this image using the Sobel operator:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Ix</span> <span>=</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>Sobel</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>ddepth</span><span>=</span><span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>CV_32F</span><span>,</span> <span>dx</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>dy</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>Iy</span> <span>=</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>Sobel</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>ddepth</span><span>=</span><span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>CV_32F</span><span>,</span> <span>dx</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>dy</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Okay, we are there now. Let’s plot the I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>, we are expecting it to give us regions with both x and y directions:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>Ix</span><span>**</span><span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>Iy</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>cmap</span><span>=</span><span>'gray'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://comsci.blog/assets/intuitive-harris_5_1.png" alt="png"></p>

<p>As you can see, we are kind of not successful, because this shows us the both corners and edges that move along in
both x and y directions. But we need to get rid of the edges.</p>

<p>If you carefully look at this resulting image, you will notice that corners are either isolated like the top left
corner of the B logo, or they are at the end of these edges. Maybe we can’t get rid of the edges directly,
but if somehow we can remove the corners from I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>, we can subtract it from the original I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup> and
get only the corners. Actually, we can get rid of the corners. Since the corners are isolated in this image,
applying a Gaussian blur will decrease the intensities of the corners a lot!</p>

<p>Let’s see this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>corners_suppressed</span> <span>=</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>GaussianBlur</span><span>(</span><span>Ix</span><span>**</span><span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>Iy</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>ksize</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>sigmaX</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>corners_suppressed</span><span>,</span> <span>cmap</span><span>=</span><span>'gray'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://comsci.blog/assets/intuitive-harris_7_1.png" alt="png"></p>

<p>We can even do a better job of removing the corners by applying the blur before squaring. Because square will increase
the intensity of isolated corners, making it less affected by the blur. So we can instead do:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>corners_suppressed</span> <span>=</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>GaussianBlur</span><span>(</span><span>Ix</span><span>*</span> <span>Iy</span><span>,</span> <span>ksize</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>sigmaX</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>**</span> <span>2</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>corners_suppressed</span><span>,</span> <span>cmap</span><span>=</span><span>'gray'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://comsci.blog/assets/intuitive-harris_9_1.png" alt="png"></p>

<p>Now that we have the corners mostly suppressed image, we can try subtracting this from the I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup> and get only the corners. Let’s try it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>Ix</span><span>**</span><span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>Iy</span><span>**</span><span>2</span> <span>-</span> <span>corners_suppressed</span><span>,</span> <span>cmap</span><span>=</span><span>'gray'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://comsci.blog/assets/intuitive-harris_11_1.png" alt="png"></p>

<p>That doesn’t seem to work, but the reason is clear. Edges of the I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>
have different intensity than <code>corners_suppressed</code>, since <code>corners_suppressed</code> has been blurred.
We want them to have the same intensity in edges so that they cancel the edges when they are subtracted.</p>

<p>We can make the edges of I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup> similar intensity to edges of <code>corners_suppressed</code>
by applying Gaussian blur to I<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> and I<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup> seperately before multiplying them.
We will apply the blur to squared gradients to make sure the corners are less affected by the blur.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Ix_squared</span> <span>=</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>GaussianBlur</span><span>(</span><span>Ix</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>ksize</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>sigmaX</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>corners</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ix_squared</span> <span>*</span> <span>Iy_squared</span> <span>-</span> <span>corners_suppressed</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://comsci.blog/assets/intuitive-harris_13_1.png" alt="png"></p>

<p>Yes! We successfully get the corners of the image. Now if we look at the data inside the <code>corners</code> matrix, you will notice that
corners have extremely large values and other parts have smaller values. Let’s threshold it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>corners</span><span>[</span><span>corners</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>corners</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>()</span> <span>/</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>corners</span><span>[</span><span>corners</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>255</span>

<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>corners</span><span>,</span> <span>cmap</span><span>=</span><span>"gray"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://comsci.blog/assets/intuitive-harris_15_1.png" alt="png"></p>

<p>Okay, let’s plot these points as circles in our image:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>new_img</span> <span>=</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>cvtColor</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>COLOR_GRAY2RGB</span><span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>corners</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>][</span><span>j</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>255</span><span>:</span>
            <span>cv2</span><span>.</span><span>circle</span><span>(</span><span>new_img</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>),</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>color</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>255</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>thickness</span><span>=-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://comsci.blog/assets/intuitive-harris_17_0.png" alt="png"></p>

<p>And with this, we have implemented the Harris corner detection algorithm and we haven’t talked about things like
fitting ellipses, Taylor series approximation, or any of that stuff. This implementation is equivalent to the
other implementations of this algorithm.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/blog/Tencent-LLM/">https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/blog/Tencent-LLM/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37466182">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Six months ago, I wrote about <a href="https://doris.apache.org/blog/Tencent%20Music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why we replaced ClickHouse with Apache Doris as an OLAP engine</a> for our data management system. Back then, we were struggling with the auto-generation of SQL statements. As days pass, we have made progresses big enough to be references for you (I think), so here I am again. </p><p>We have adopted Large Language Models (LLM) to empower our Doris-based OLAP services.</p><h2 id="llm--olap">LLM + OLAP<a href="#llm--olap" aria-label="LLM + OLAP的直接链接" title="LLM + OLAP的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Our incentive was to save our internal staff from the steep learning curve of SQL writing. Thus, we used LLM as an intermediate. It transforms natural language questions into SQL statements and sends the SQLs to the OLAP engine for execution.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdnd.selectdb.com/zh-CN/assets/images/Tencent_LLM_1-6672112c0d09d75171d8ed9a749ff196.png" width="1280" height="253"></p><p>Like every AI-related experience, we came across some friction:</p><ol><li>LLM does not understand data jargons, like "fields", "rows", "columns" and "tables". Instead, they can perfectly translate business terms like "corporate income" and "DAU", which are basically what the fields/rows/columns are about. That means it can work well only if the analysts use the exact right word to refer to the metric they need when typing their questions.</li><li>The LLM we are using is slow in inference. It takes over 10 seconds to respond. As it charges fees by token, cost-effectiveness becomes a problem.</li><li>Although the LLM is trained on a large collection of public datasets, it is under-informed of niche knowledge. In our case, the LLM is super unfamiliar with indie songs, so even if the songs are included in our database, the LLM will not able to identify them properly. </li><li>Sometimes our input questions require adequate and latest legal, political, financial, and regulatory information, which is hard to be included in a training dataset or knowledge base. We need to connect the LLM to wider info bases in order to perform more diversified tasks.</li></ol><p>We knock these problems down one by one.</p><h3 id="1-a-semantic-layer">1. A semantic layer<a href="#1-a-semantic-layer" aria-label="1. A semantic layer的直接链接" title="1. A semantic layer的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>For problem No.1, we introduce a semantic layer between the LLM and the OLAP engine. This layer translates business terms into the corresponding data fields. It can identify data filtering conditions from the various natural language wordings, relate them to the metrics involved, and then generate SQL statements. </p><p>Besides that, the semantic layer can optimize the computation logic. When analysts input a question that involves a complicated query, let's say, a multi-table join, the semantic layer can split that into multiple single-table queries to reduce semantic distortion.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdnd.selectdb.com/zh-CN/assets/images/Tencent_LLM_2-bb2fdaed64ef15214c0542204dd45832.png" width="1280" height="289"></p><h3 id="2-llm-parsing-rules">2.

LLM parsing rules的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>To increase cost-effectiveness in using LLM, we evaluate the computation complexity of all scenarios, such as metric computation, detailed record retrieval, and user segmentation. Then, we create rules and dedicate the LLM-parsing step to only complicated tasks. That means for the simple computation tasks, it will skip the parsing. </p><p>For example, when an analyst inputs "tell me the earnings of the major musical platforms", the LLM identifies that this question only entails several metrics or dimensions, so it will not further parse it but send it straight for SQL generation and execution. This can largely shorten query response time and reduce API expenses. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdnd.selectdb.com/zh-CN/assets/images/Tencent_LLM_3-3ab023081e1acb069d34a4ce24aef010.png" width="1280" height="406"></p><h3 id="3-schema-mapper-and-external-knowledge-base">3.

The Schema Mapper maps the input question to an external knowledge base, and then the LLM will do parsing.</p><p>We are constantly testing and optimizing the Schema Mapper. We categorize and rate content in the external knowledge base, and do various levels of mapping (full-text mapping and fuzzy mapping) to enable better semantic parsing.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdnd.selectdb.com/zh-CN/assets/images/Tencent_LLM_4-261ee680cf77335b25f32e41d7a4924b.png" width="2001" height="647"></p><h3 id="4-plugins">4. Plugins<a href="#4-plugins" aria-label="4. Plugins的直接链接" title="4. Plugins的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>We used plugins to connect the LLM to more fields of information, and we have different integration methods for different types of plugins:</p><ul><li><strong>Embedding local files</strong>: This is especially useful when we need to "teach" the LLM the latest regulatory policies, which are often text files. Firstly, the system vectorizes the local text file, executes semantic searches to find matching or similar terms in the local file, extracts the relevant contents and puts them into the LLM parsing window to generate output. </li><li><strong>Third-party plugins</strong>: The marketplace is full of third-party plugins that are designed for all kinds of sectors. With them, the LLM is able to deal with wide-ranging topics. Each plugin has its own prompts and calling function. Once the input question hits a prompt, the relevant plugin will be called.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdnd.selectdb.com/zh-CN/assets/images/Tencent_LLM_5-70a170e771dd9eadcc1488b94d892478.png" width="2001" height="645"></p><p>After we are done with above four optimizations, the SuperSonic framework comes into being.</p><h2 id="the-supersonic-framework">The SuperSonic framework<a href="#the-supersonic-framework" aria-label="The SuperSonic framework的直接链接" title="The SuperSonic framework的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Now let me walk you through this <a href="https://github.com/tencentmusic/supersonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">framework</a>:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdnd.selectdb.com/zh-CN/assets/images/Tencent_LLM_6-cbbbb25041c807376b2b9d14609e82c8.png" width="1280" height="1117"></p><ul><li>An analyst inputs a question.</li><li>The Schema Mapper maps the question to an external knowledge base.</li><li>If there are matching fields in the external knowledge base, the question will not be parsed by the LLM. Instead, a metric computation formula will trigger the OLAP engine to start querying. If there is no matching field, the question will enter the LLM.</li><li>Based on the pre-defined rules, the LLM rates the complexity level of the question. If it is a simple query, it will go directly to the OLAP engine; if it is a complicated query, it will be semantically parsed and converted to a DSL statement.</li><li>At the Semantic Layer, the DSL statement will be split based on its query scenario. For example, if it is a multi-table join query, this layer will generate multiple single-table query SQL statements.</li><li>If the question involves external knowledge, the LLM will call a third-party plugin.</li></ul><p><strong>Example</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdnd.selectdb.com/zh-CN/assets/images/Tencent_LLM_7-c20b3cc2b0b00b32bc2825c1d62b1d5d.png" width="2001" height="1126"></p><p>To answer whether a certain song can be performed on variety shows, the system retrieves the OLAP data warehouse for details about the song, and presents it with results from the Commercial Use Query third-party plugin.</p><h2 id="olap-architecture">OLAP Architecture<a href="#olap-architecture" aria-label="OLAP Architecture的直接链接" title="OLAP Architecture的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>As for the OLAP part of this framework, after several rounds of architectural evolution, this is what our current OLAP pipeline looks like. </p><p>Raw data is sorted into tags and metrics, which are custom-defined by the analysts. The tags and metrics are under unified management in order to avoid inconsistent definitions. Then, they are combined into various tagsets and metricsets for various queries. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdnd.selectdb.com/zh-CN/assets/images/Tencent_LLM_8-6d517a787c782510bf3869176730ce3a.png" width="1709" height="1119"></p><p>We have drawn two main takeaways for you from our architectural optimization experience.</p><p><strong>1. Streamline the links</strong></p><p>Before we adopted Apache Doris, we used to have ClickHouse to accelerate the computation of tags and metrics, and Elasticsearch to process dimensional data. That's two analytic engines and requires us to adapt the query statements to both of them. It was high-maintenance.</p><p>Thus, we replaced ClickHouse with Apache Doris, and utilized the <a href="https://doris.apache.org/docs/dev/lakehouse/multi-catalog/es" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elasticsearch Catalog</a> functionality to connect Elasticsearch data to Doris. In this way, we make Doris our unified query gateway. </p><p><strong>2. Split the flat tables</strong></p><p>In early versions of our OLAP architecture, we used to put data into flat tables, which made things tricky. For one thing, flat tables absorbed all the writing latency from upstreams, and that added up to considerable loss in data realtimeliness. For another, 50% of data in a flat table was dimensional data, which was rarely updated. With every new flat table came some bulky dimensional data that consumed lots of storage space. </p><p>Therefore, we split the flat tables into metric tables and dimension tables. As they are updated in different paces, we put them into different data models.</p><ul><li><strong>Metric tables</strong>: We arrange metric data in the Aggregate Key model of Apache Doris, which means new data will be merged with the old data by way of SUM, MAX, MIN, etc.</li><li><strong>Dimension tables</strong>: These tables are in the Unique Key model of Apache Doris, which means new data record will replace the old. This can greatly increase performance in our query scenarios.</li></ul><p>You might ask, does this cause trouble in queries, since most queries require data from both types of tables? Don't worry, we address that with the Rollup feature of Doris. On the basis of the base tables, we can select the dimensions we need to create Rollup views, which will automatically execute <code>GROUP BY</code>. This relieves us of the need to define tags for each Rollup view and largely speed up queries.</p><h2 id="other-tricks">Other Tricks<a href="#other-tricks" aria-label="Other Tricks的直接链接" title="Other Tricks的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>In our experience with Apache Doris, we also find some other functionalities handy, so I list them here for you, too:</p><p><strong>1. Materialized View</strong></p><p>A Materialized View is a pre-computed dataset. It is a way to accelerate queries when you frequently need to access data of certain dimensions. In these scenarios, we define derived tags and metrics based on the original ones. For example, we create a derived metric by combining Metric 1, Metric 2, and Metric 3: <code>sum(m1+m2+m3)</code>. Then, we can create a Materialized View for it. According to the Doris release schedule, version 2.1 will support multi-table Materialized Views, and we look forward to that.</p><p><strong>2. Flink-Doris-Connector</strong></p><p>This is for Exactly-Once guarantee in data ingestion. The Flink-Doris-Connector implements a checkpoint mechanism and two-stage commit, and allows for auto data synchronization from relational databases to Doris.</p><p><strong>3. Compaction</strong></p><p>When the number of aggregation tasks or data volume becomes overwhelming for Flink, there might be huge latency in data compaction. We solve that with Vertical Compaction and Segment Compaction. Vertical Compaction supports loading of only part of the columns, so it can reduce storage consumption when compacting flat tables. Segment Compaction can avoid generating too much segments during data writing, and allows for compaction while writing simultaneously.   </p><h2 id="whats-next">What's Next<a href="#whats-next" aria-label="What's Next的直接链接" title="What's Next的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>With an aim to reduce costs and increase service availability, we plan to test the newly released Storage-Compute Separation and Cross-Cluster Replication of Doris, and we embrace any ideas and inputs about the SuperSonic framework and the Apache Doris project.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Bringing bad news to your boss; facing an interview panel; making a big presentation. But few things are worse than networking if you are an introvert.</p><p data-component="paragraph">You arrive at an event to find that everyone there apparently knows each other already. And then you look more closely and spot the fellow-sufferers. They are the people who are actually reading the conference blurb. They look at email on their phones with greater intensity than ever happens at the office. They endlessly circulate the room, like bits of plastic in the ocean waiting to be snagged on something. They take a seat in the main hall while the sound engineers are still testing the microphones.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Fortunately, there is advice out there on how to break the ice with strangers. Unfortunately, it’s abysmal. One sage counsels making contact in queues, because it is easier to talk to the person in front of you and behind you. You are meant to ambush people on the escalator, in the toilets and in the queue to get your name tag. In the line for coffee, open the door to jobs and sales by saying six incomprehensible words: “Juicing up for the big keynote?”</p><p data-component="paragraph">On it goes. Don’t be afraid to laugh, because nothing drains the tension from a room like someone who cannot stop chuckling. Bring personal information into the conversation, lest people think you are at a conference on treasury-management software only for commercial gain. Use the other person’s name twice, to appear truly engaged. And take notes on conversations afterwards so you can follow up with them.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Add these ingredients together, and you have the recipe for success:</p><p data-component="paragraph">“Juicing up for the big keynote?”</p><p data-component="paragraph">“What?”</p><p data-component="paragraph">“Juicing up for the big keynote?”</p><p data-component="paragraph">“I don’t know what that means.”</p><p data-component="paragraph">[Scan name badge] “Keith, is it?”</p><p data-component="paragraph">“Er, yes.”</p><p data-component="paragraph">[Laughing] “I’m having a baby, Keith.”</p><p data-component="paragraph">“Keith?”</p><p data-component="paragraph">[Take out notepad]</p><p data-component="paragraph">If this is how to network, no wonder people go to the main hall early.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Making contacts on a site like LinkedIn is a lot less stressful. There is no eye contact, after all, and the rules of the road are agreed. And all those connection requests do appear to help with careers. A paper published last year by Karthik Rajkumar of LinkedIn and co-authors from academia found empirical evidence for the insight that underpins all kinds of networking—that, because they bring you new information, more infrequent and distant relationships (or “weak ties”) are more useful than close contacts.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The researchers randomly changed the “People You May Know” recommendations algorithm that LinkedIn shows its users, so that the prevalence of weaker and stronger connections varied among people on the site. The experiment showed that weaker ties (where a pair of users had only one mutual friend, say) were more likely to lead to job applications and job moves than those where people had 25 mutual friends or more.</p><p data-component="paragraph">This sounds like nirvana for introverts: start spamming everyone with connection requests, close the office door and wait for job offers. But it is not that easy. Even weak ties need tending. Even online, interacting with people is easier if you find it energising; a survey-based study of LinkedIn, by Joanna Davis of Augustana College and her co-authors, found that extroversion was a predictor of networking ability.</p><p data-component="paragraph">There isn’t a genuinely painless way for introverts to network. Still, methods to do it exist that are wiser than standing in a queue and hoping the guy who doesn’t know how to get coffee out of the machine is your ticket to career success.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The real secret is to save your energy for the people who are most likely to be interesting to you. In the online realm, for instance, Dr Rajkumar’s study does not find that the weaker the tie, the better. The sweet spot in networking on LinkedIn is someone with moderately weak ties to you: connecting with a person with ten mutual friends markedly increases the probability of changing jobs compared with someone with just one shared friend.</p><p data-component="paragraph">In other words, networking pays off if you can identify people who can bring you new information but are close enough to your world that this information is useful. In the offline world, a tool like Chat<small>GPT</small> should make it easier to find useful prospects in a list of event attendees. But you still need to overcome all your instincts and approach them.<span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Bartleby, our columnist on management and work:<br></b><i><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/31/the-best-bosses-know-how-to-subtract-work">The best bosses know how to subtract work</a> (Aug 31st)<br></i><i><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/24/the-benefits-of-a-good-workplace-mentoring-scheme-are-undeniable">How to get the most out of mentoring</a> (Aug 24th)<br></i><i><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/article66888-prod.ece" target="_blank">A retiring consultant’s advice on consultants</a> (Jul 17th)</i></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Also: How the Bartleby column <a href="https://www.economist.com/column-names">got its name</a></i></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline "Stranger things"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/">Business</a> <span>September 9th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/03/meet-ernie-chinas-answer-to-chatgpt"><span>Meet Ernie, China’s answer to ChatGPT</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/07/german-builders-are-on-the-brink-of-collapse"><span>German builders are on the brink of collapse</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/07/tiktok-is-wading-into-south-east-asias-e-commerce-wars"><span>TikTok is wading into South-East Asia’s e-commerce wars</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/07/a-strike-at-chevron-shows-a-reinvigorated-union-movement"><span>A strike at Chevron shows a reinvigorated union movement</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/07/meet-the-worlds-most-enduring-product"><span>Meet the world’s most enduring product</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/07/networking-for-introverts-a-how-to-guide"><span>Networking for introverts: a how-to guide</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/04/americas-bosses-just-wont-quit-that-could-spell-trouble"><span>America’s bosses just won’t quit.

    <p>How neat this is – perhaps too neat.

Very often, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/06/15/the-eu-might-just-break-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the authorities are all bark</a>, and no bite – and the European Union is one of the worst offenders in this regard.&nbsp;</p><p>The top Silicon Valley lawyer behind the Microsoft antitrust case, Gary Reback conceded as much when he also advised us not to worry. The mere act of competition scrutiny benefits the market: “the trial is the remedy”, he has said.</p><p>But very often the competition watchdog’s intervention seems to have no impact at all, and has only made the dominant player stronger. Google has run rings around competition authorities by appearing to take it on the chin, then offering up a less onerous behavioural remedy.&nbsp;</p><p>This is accepted and life carries on much as before. Structural remedies do not necessarily improve things much either. When in 2000, a Microsoft breakup was privately shopped around its computer rivals, it seemed nobody wanted to take any of the chopped up pieces of the company.</p><p>So if doing nothing is not an option and doing something is ineffective, what else is left to do?&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I've been floating ways to simplify the memory management story in Rust around the core team lately. Memory management is a contentious topic, since we've worked hard to get to the current state of things, and with the push toward stability lately, there is a (quite reasonable!) resistance to any changes at this state. Still, I think the current memory management story in Rust is worth revisiting, as the current state of things may cause us problems down the line. Working with Dave Herman and Niko Matsakis, I've formulated a fairly concrete proposal at this point. The basic idea is to <em>remove garbage collection from the core language and relegate it to the standard library</em>, with a minimal set of language hooks in place to allow for flexible, pluggable automatic memory management.</p>
<p>This post is designed to explain the "why", not the "how"—I'm leaving the concrete details of the proposed system to a future blog post or mailing list discussion. Rather, this explains the issue that I see with the current system. I think that the garbage collection story as it stands in Rust is not quite ideal, for three reasons: <em>familiarity</em>, <em>simplicity</em>, and <em>flexibility</em>. I'll cover each in turn.</p>
<h2>Familiarity</h2>
<p>One of the most common questions almost every Rust beginner asks is "when do I use managed pointers, and when do I use owned pointers?" Or, more simply, "what are all these <code>~</code> and <code>@</code> symbols everywhere?" Having worked on Rust for many years now, I've seen several reasons for the difficulty. Chief among them are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>The difference between the stack and the heap is a difficult concept to grasp for many programmers used to languages like Java that don't make such a distinction.</em> This is, unfortunately, a fundamental difficulty of working in a systems language. There's little that can be done about this without taking control of allocation out of the hands of the programmer. Doing that, however, would compromise the goals of the language—in low-level, performance-critical programming, being able to precisely control whether allocations occur on the stack or on the heap is crucial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The sigils make the code unfamiliar before the concepts are learned.</em> Unlike the rest of the punctuation in Rust, <code>~</code> and <code>@</code> are not part of the standard repertoire of punctuation in C-like languages, and as a result the language can seem intimidating. One of the benefits of keywords is that they are self-documenting in a way that punctuation is not. This could be fixed by switching to keywords, which I prefer for this reason; however, syntactic beauty is in the eye of the beholder and so I won't lose sleep over this not changing if the community prefers the current syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There are two heaps, not just one, so beginners are confused as to which one to allocate into.</em> This is a result of the "minimize sharing by default" philosophy of the concurrency system. However, the concurrency system has been part of the <em>library</em> rather than the language for several years now, so this seems somewhat out of place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Programmers don't know which to use, since some operations are available with <code>~</code> and some operations are available with <code>@</code></em>. Actually, we were confused on this point for a long time as well—it wasn't clear whether <code>~</code> or <code>@</code> would become dominant. We debated for a long time which to present first, <code>~</code> or <code>@</code>. However, as the language and community evolved, and coding standards became more settled, a clear winner emerged: the owning pointer <code>~</code>. In practice, the rule has been that <em>programmers should use <code>~</code> to allocate in all circumstances except when they have no way of knowing precisely when the object in question should be freed.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Point (4), to me, is the most critical. The rule that emerged—<code>~</code> over <code>@</code>—should not be surprising, in retrospect, as it is how systems software has been developed for decades. The key insight that was missing is that <em>the owning pointer <code>~</code> is just the Rust equivalent of <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.</em> For many, probably most C programs, <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> are just fine (assuming you use them correctly, of course); each heap allocation is allocated in just one place and destroyed in just one place. Only when the lifetimes of objects become very complex do C and C++ programmers resort to manual reference counting to determine when an object should be freed (and many, perhaps most, C programs never get there). <em>This</em> is the role that has emerged for <code>@</code> in Rust programs: <code>@</code> is a replacement for manual reference counting in C programs. The <code>kobject</code> system in the Linux kernel, the <code>GObject</code> system in <code>glib</code>, and so forth, are the C equivalents of <code>@</code> in Rust.</p>
<p>The key point here is that these are very specialized use cases in C, and <code>@</code> has been relegated to a similarly marginal role in idiomatic Rust code. We thought for a while that many Rust programs would use <code>@</code> extensively and that it would ease the learning curve for those not used to destructor-based memory management and references. This has not, however, been the case in practice. In reality, since the libraries all use owning pointers (<code>~</code>), Rust programmers have to learn them quickly anyhow. And once Rust programmers learn how to use <code>~</code> effectively, they quickly find <code>@</code> relegated to a marginal role, if it's used at all. <code>~</code> has so many advantages: deterministic allocation and destruction, interaction with the standard library, freedom from GC marking pauses, simpler semantics, appendability where vectors and strings are concerned, and sendability across tasks.</p>
<p>I think we're better off teaching <code>~</code> as the go-to solution for most programs and relegating <code>@</code> to a specialized role. <code>@</code> has its use cases, to be sure; large, event-driven C++ programs use reference counting for a reason. But those use cases are specialized. Beginners should not be asking "should I use <code>~</code> or <code>@</code>?" The answer is almost always <code>~</code>.</p>
<p>In this regard relegating <code>@</code> to a library is just the natural conclusion of this approach. I feel that what beginners should be taught is that <code>~</code> is the way to allocate in Rust, and letting an <code>~</code> owning pointer go out of scope is the way you free in Rust. This is what we should be teaching in the <em>language</em> tutorial. As beginners become more comfortable with this and explore the libraries, they will learn about ways to achieve more dynamic memory management: tracing garbage collection with the <code>Gc</code> type, reference counting with the <code>Rc</code> type, and thread-safe reference counting with the <code>Arc</code> type. But by building only <code>~</code> into the language, we can reduce confusion by, in effect, making the language more opinionated.</p>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>Although Rust didn't start out that way, one of the most interesting applications of Rust has been very low-level programming, even down to the level of kernels. The interest in this application of Rust was something of a surprise to us, but in hindsight it makes perfect sense. Low-level control over memory management isn't something that most applications software, especially on the server side, wants; most of that software has migrated over to languages like Java, Ruby, and JavaScript that trade control and performance for convenience by making memory management automatically, and dynamically, managed by the runtime. The remaining class of software, most of which is written in C and C++, is software that must manage memory manually in order to achieve some combination of performance, simplicity, and/or the ability to self-host. The prospect of using a new language for <em>this</em> class of software, which includes OS kernels, game engines, and browser engines among others, is what is fueling the growth of the nascent Rust community.</p>
<p>It might be possible to create a language that presents only a simple, fully automatic memory management system at first, and which surfaces the machinery of safe manual memory management* only when the programmer requires it for maximum performance. This would ease the learning curve, as programmers would be able to write many, perhaps most programs without ever learning how to manage memory at all. However, at this point I don't think that this language exists yet, and in particular I don't think Rust is that language. There are basically two problems here: (1) <code>~</code> owning pointers are everywhere in Rust, from the standard library to the built-in macros, making learning about them a necessity from the get-go; and (2) it is basically impossible to program Rust without at least a cursory understanding of references (a.k.a. <code>&amp;</code> pointers) and their lifetime semantics; even <code>vec::each()</code> uses references.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this might seem like a negative result, I actually think it's quite positive for the project. It helps to define the project's scope. I don't think automatic memory management in Rust is ever going to be as convenient as memory management in, say, Ruby or Java, and that's OK! <em>The same level of control that adds cognitive overhead to memory management in Rust compared to other languages also makes Rust able to go where few other industry languages have.</em> This space, I think, is where Rust can really shine.</p>
<p>In short, I think that Rust as a <em>language</em> should focus on roughly the same application domain as C++ does.†</p>
<p>Important to this effort is to have as small of a runtime as possible, just as C++ does, leaving higher-level abstractions to libraries. And, in fact, we are almost there already. The only runtime support that compiled Rust programs require are a small set of "language items", which are magic functions or traits written <em>in Rust</em> that are known to the compiler. Looking at the set of language items, and disqualifying legacy items that will be removed soon such as <code>annihilate</code> and <code>log_type</code>, there are just a few categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Operator traits, like <code>Add</code> and <code>Sub</code>. These are analogous to <code>operator+</code>, <code>operator-</code>, and so forth in C++.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory primitives, like <code>str_eq</code>. These are somewhat legacy at this point and probably could be converted to LLVM intrinsics like <code>memcmp</code> without much trouble, especially after dynamically sized types happens. In any case, in most C++ compilers <code>memcmp</code> and friends are builtins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure: <code>fail</code> and <code>fail_bounds_check</code>. This is analogous to <code>throw</code> in C++, although a Rust program that doesn't want to use stack unwinding might want to use <code>abort</code> instead (which would be like <code>-fno-exceptions</code>) or do something more elaborate like the Linux kernel's "oops" functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocation primitives <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>. These have direct C++ equivalents: <code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Garbage collection primitives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these, the only language items that don't have direct C++ equivalents are the garbage collection primitives. If those were eliminated, then Rust as a language would be every bit as freestanding as C++ is. In terms of suitability for kernel and embedded development, Rust would be on truly equal footing.</p>
<p>In summary: (1) all Rust programmers have to know how <code>~</code> and <code>&amp;</code> work, despite the presence of <code>@</code>; (2) the only additional runtime primitives that Rust exposes and C++ doesn't are those related to <code>@</code>.</p>
<h2>Flexibility</h2>
<p>When it comes to memory management, there are obviously many different strategies: stack allocation, heap allocation with <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>, arena allocation, and garbage collection. What's less well known is that even among garbage collection, there are many different approaches, each with advantages and disadvantages. There's thread-local GC, thread-safe GC, incremental GC, generational GC, reference counting, thread-safe reference counting, deferred reference counting, ulterior reference counting—the list goes on and on. (For a good survey of automatic memory management techniques and how they relate to one another, check out <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs415/reading/bacon-garbage.pdf">"A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection" by Bacon et al.</a>) A program that wants to maximize performance among some axis (latency versus throughput) and remain safe with objects with complex lifetimes may have reasons to choose one or the other.</p>
<p>Specifically, there's the perennial debate between reference counting and tracing garbage collection. Many applications are better with tracing GC because of the increased throughput it provides and straightforward handling of cycles, and many applications are better with reference counting because of implementation simplicity, cache behavior, mostly-incremental operation, and promptness of deallocation. It makes sense for applications to be able to choose between the two. Even more important is the tradeoff between thread-safe and thread-local garbage collection: concurrent garbage collection is practically always more expensive than thread-local garbage collection, so it makes sense for programs to restrict concurrent GC (including atomic reference counting) to be used only when needed.</p>
<p>Integrating multiple tracing garbage collectors or cycle collectors into one system is a hard problem, and I don't think Rust is going to really solve it. However, integrating reference counting into a garbage collected system is straightforward, as long as cycles are not created (and in Rust we can forbid the creation of such cycles through clever use of the type system). In practice this seems to work well: we typically use thread-local tracing GC for data with complex lifetimes within one task, and we use thread-safe reference counting for data that must be shared between tasks.</p>
<p>Equally important is the ability to integrate with <em>external</em> garbage collection systems (usually reference counted ones). This is a problem that is often overlooked, but is terribly important for client software such as mobile apps and browser engines. On Windows, apps must integrate with the reference-counted COM system in order to use DirectX and other APIs. On the Mac and on iOS, apps have to integrate with Objective-C and the closely-related Core Foundation, also reference-counted systems. On Linux, GNOME apps have to integrate with GObject, again a reference-counted system. On Android, apps have to integrate with the garbage-collected Dalvik subsystem via the JNI. All of this requires that the memory management system in the language be deeply flexible.</p>
<p>Because of this, I'm suspect of blessing any particular form of automatic memory management in the core language. In Rust, the <code>@</code> type is not only blessed with special syntax, but is eligible for borrowing and other operations in a way that user-defined types aren't. Although Rust provides the facilities needed to build practically all the other forms of garbage collection, as well as those needed to integrate with external GC systems in a safe way, the resulting smart pointers feel second-class compared to <code>@</code>. A systems language designed to work in a diverse set of environments should have the flexibility to create memory management abstractions that feel first-class.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For these three reasons—familiarity, simplicity, and flexibility—I'd like to propose removing <code>@</code> pointers from the language and replacing them with a small set of hooks allowing the same functionality to be implemented as a library and on user-defined types. We would ship tracing GC as part of the standard library and make it just as powerful and convenient as it is today (except for the <code>@</code> syntax). We'd gain a flexible set of abstractions, make the language easier to learn, and make Rust into a truly freestanding language environment.</p>
<p>* Note that the <em>safe</em> qualifier here disqualifies manually-built free lists in garbage-collected languages, as these manually-built free lists provide no protection against errors like double "frees", leaks, and danging pointers. (They're significantly worse than true manual memory management anyhow; the GC still has to trace through objects in arenas at mark time, copy the objects within out into the tenured generation when they survive a minor collection, write barrier the objects, and so forth.)</p>
<p>† Note that I don't mean you shouldn't write Web frameworks and Web sites in Rust: in fact, I think Rust would be a fantastic language for many classes of Web server software, especially that which must scale to the highest loads and squeeze every ounce of performance out of the servers on the racks.</p>

<p>In September 1993, fictional FBI Special Agents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (David Duchovny) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scully">Dana Scully</a> (Gillian Anderson) made their broadcast TV debut on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files"><em>The X-Files</em></a> and went on to investigate alien abductions and all manner of strange phenomena for nine full seasons and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_(film)">two</a> feature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files:_I_Want_to_Believe">films</a>, followed by two additional limited-run seasons in 2016 and 2018. This hugely popular and influential series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, giving us a prime opportunity to pay homage to our favorite episodes and characters.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>The X-Files</em> below.)</strong></p>

        </div>

<p><em>The X-Files</em> was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Carter_(screenwriter)">Chris Carter</a>, who was a fan of the 1970s horror series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolchak:_The_Night_Stalker"><em>Kolchak: The Night Stalker</em></a>, featuring a wire service reporter (Darren McGavin) investigating mysterious crimes with a supernatural or science fiction element. Other cited influences included <em>The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Twin Peaks</em> (in which Duchovny played a transgender DEA agent), and Jonathan Demme's 1988 Oscar-winning film <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p>
<p>Carter liked the idea of a TV series featuring FBI agents investigating the paranormal. He deliberately made Mulder (nicknamed "Spooky") the true believer and Scully the science-based skeptic—a gender swap to counter broad cultural stereotypes. Carter described the pair as a dichotomy, representing his desire to believe in something versus an inability to believe—the age-old tension between skepticism and faith.</p>
<p>As the characters developed over subsequent seasons, we saw them internalize that tension, with Mulder sometimes getting discouraged and questioning his longing to believe and Scully being forced to confront how her science sometimes conflicted with her devout Catholic faith. They each had deep personal journeys as well; both lost family members, for instance, and Mulder's obsession with alien abductions was fueled by the disappearance of his sister Samantha when he was a kid. And while Carter was adamant early on that this would be a purely platonic relationship—<em>à&nbsp;la</em> Emma Peel and John Steed in <em>The Avengers</em> British TV series—that changed as the friendship between Mulder and Scully deepened, with increasingly romantic overtones. But the series never openly acknowledged the two having sex until season 11's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_One_(The_X-Files)">Plus One</a>."</p>

<p><em>The X-Files</em> quickly blossomed from a cult series into a bona fide pop culture phenomenon throughout its first seven seasons, racking up a lot of Emmy and Golden Globe awards. Scully is often credited with encouraging young women to pursue careers in medicine, science, or the FBI, a phenomenon dubbed the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scully#%22The_Scully_Effect%22">Scully effect</a>."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>While it started out dealing with UFOs and alien abduction, Carter and his writing team realized early on that it would be difficult to sustain that momentum over multiple seasons. So there were essentially two kinds of episodes: those advancing the over-arching "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology_of_The_X-Files">mytharc</a>" of the series canon—often featuring appearances by William B. Davis as the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_Smoking_Man">Cigarette Smoking Man</a> (CSM)—and standalone "Monster of the Week" (MOW) episodes unrelated to the series mythology. From horror to humor, shadowy conspiracies to arcane folklore, the series offered something for everyone, a key factor in its broad popular appeal.</p>
<h2>“The Seasons That Shall Not Be Named”</h2>
<p>For the first five seasons, <em>The X-Files</em> filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, but it moved to Los Angeles starting with the sixth season so that Duchovny could be closer to his then-wife Tea Leoni. When Duchovny's contract expired after the seventh season, he effectively quit the series, though he returned occasionally as Mulder during S8 and S9—or, as I like to call them, "The Seasons That Shall Not Be Named."</p>
<p>This was unquestionably the low point of the series, especially with Anderson also winding down her involvement. Carter apparently convinced himself that he could simply find new leads—in this case, Robert Patrick as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doggett">John Doggett</a> and Annabeth Gish as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Reyes">Monica Reyes</a>—and the show would run indefinitely. But there is simply no <em>X-Files</em> without Mulder and Scully. Add in the deaths of fan favorites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lone_Gunmen">the Lone Gunmen</a> in "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_the_Shark_(The_X-Files)">Jump the Shark</a>" (S9), and no wonder ratings steeply declined.</p>

<p>The show's original run ended with that ninth season. But <em>The X-Files</em> lived on via DVD and (more recently) streaming platforms, and its hardcore fan base remained fiercely loyal. The 2008 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files:_I_Want_to_Believe"><em>The X-Files: I Want to Believe</em></a> (with a standalone MOW plot) received mixed reviews and didn't exactly light up the box office, but it grossed $68 million against its $30 million budget. That was enough to spark rumors of a possible third film; both Duchovny and Anderson expressed a willingness to co-star.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Late last week, Google announced something called the Privacy Sandbox has been rolled out <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-for-the-web-reaches-general-availability">to a “majority” of Chrome users</a>, and will reach 100% of users in the coming months. But what is it, exactly? </p>

<p>The new suite of features represents a fundamental shift in how Chrome will track user data for the benefit of advertisers. Instead of third-party cookies, Chrome can now tap directly into your browsing history to gather information on advertising “topics” (more on that later).</p>

<p>In development since 2019, this change has attracted <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-privacy-sandbox-now-on-every-chrome-browser-1850812404">a great deal of controversy</a>, as some commentators have deemed it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/">invasive in terms of privacy</a>.</p>

<p>Understanding how it works – and whether you want to opt in or out – is important, since Chrome remains the most widely used browser in the world, with a 63% market share <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268254/market-share-of-internet-browsers-worldwide-since-2009/">as of May 2023</a> (Safari is in second place with 13%).</p>

<h2>Wait, what is a cookie?</h2>

<p>In 1994, computer engineer Lou Montulli at Netscape revolutionised the way we browsed the internet with his <a href="https://montulli.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-reasoning-behind-web-cookies.html">invention of the “cookie</a>”. For the first time, web pages could remember our passwords, preferences, language settings and even shopping carts.</p>

<p>This method was supposed to be a private exchange of information just between a user and a website – what’s known as a first-party cookie. But within two years, advertisers worked out how to “hack” cookies <a href="https://qz.com/2000350/the-inventor-of-the-digital-cookie-has-some-regrets">to track users</a>. These are third-party cookies.</p>

<p>You can think of a first-party cookie like a shop assistant who listens to your preferences and is happy to hold your bags or clothes while you make your selection – but only while you are inside their store.</p>

<p>A third-party cookie is like a bug from an old spy movie. It listens to everything in your room, but only shares the info with its allies. The “spy” can place this cookie on other people’s sites, to record what you visit and what data you enter. If you’ve ever wondered how Facebook has served you an ad about something related to a news story you just read, chances are it’s because you have third-party cookies enabled.</p>

<p>Unregulated online tracking and surveillance via cookies were the default until 2018, when the European Union’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulations</a> (GDPR) and the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA) were introduced. If you have noticed more pop-ups notifying you of cookies and asking for your informed consent, you have the GDPR and CCPA to thank.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://clearcode.cc/blog/third-party-cookies-demise/#safari-and-firefox-turn-off-support-for-third-party-cookies">first browsers</a> to turn off support for third-party cookies were Apple’s Safari in 2017 and Mozilla’s Firefox in 2019.</p>

<p>But Google is also a major online advertising company, with ads <a href="https://www.doofinder.com/en/statistics/google-revenue-breakdown">making up 57.8% of Google’s revenue</a> as of 2023. They <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/09/12/the-slow-death-of-third-party-cookies">have been slowest off the mark</a> in turning off third-party cookies in Chrome. With the introduction of the Privacy Sandbox, they now hope to start turning cookies off sometime in 2024.</p>

<h2>How is the Privacy Sandbox different from cookies?</h2>

<p>The details on how the Privacy Sandbox collection of features works <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/shipping-privacy-sandbox/#whats-shipping">are rather technical</a>. But here are a few of the most important aspects.</p>

<p>Instead of using third-party cookies to serve you ads across the internet, Chrome will provide something called advertising Topics. These are high-level summaries of your browsing behaviour, tracked locally (such as in your browsing history), that companies can access on request to serve you ads on particular subjects.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are features such as <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/protected-audience/">Protected Audience</a> that can serve you ads for “remarketing” (for example, Chrome tracked you visiting a listing for a toaster, so now you will get ads for toasters elsewhere), and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/">Attribution Reporting</a>, that gathers data on ad clicks.</p>

<p>In short, instead of third-party cookies doing the spying, the features these cookies enable will be available directly within Chrome.</p>



<h2>Is user tracking necessarily bad?</h2>

<p>While Google pitches the Privacy Sandbox as something that will improve user privacy, <a href="https://movementforanopenweb.com/googles-privacy-sandbox-a-closer-look-at-claims-and-contradictions/">not everyone agrees</a>.</p>

<p>If these features are switched on, Google – one of the world’s biggest advertising companies – is essentially able to listen to you everywhere on the web.</p>

<p>Tracking technology can arguably benefit us as well. For example, it could be helpful if an online store reminds you every three months you need a new toothbrush, or that this time last year you bought a birthday card for your mum.</p>

<p>Offloading cognitive effort, such as reminders like these, is a great way automation can assist humanity. When used in situations where pinpoint accuracy is required, it can make our lives easier and more pleasant.</p>

<p>However, if you are not comfortable with surveillance, the alternative to third-party cookies may not necessarily be the new Privacy Sandbox in Chrome.</p>

<p>The alternative is to completely disable tracking altogether.</p>

<h2>What can you do?</h2>

<p>If you don’t want your online activities to be tracked for advertising purposes, there are a few straightforward choices.</p>

<p>By far the most private browsers are specialist non-tracking browsers that prioritise no tracking, such as <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>. But if you don’t want to get that nerdy, Safari and Firefox already have third-party cookies blocked by default.</p>

<p>If you don’t mind some useful targeted advertising, you can leave the Chrome Privacy Sandbox settings on.</p>

<p>If you want to adjust these settings or switch them off, click the three dots in the upper-right corner and go to <em>Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Ad privacy</em>. It’s unclear if toggling these features off will stop Chrome from collecting these data altogether, or if it just won’t share the data with advertisers. You can find out more details about each feature on <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/13355898">the Google Chrome Help page</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, it’s good to remember nothing truly comes for free. Software costs money to develop. If you’re not paying towards that, then it’s likely you – or your data – are the product. We need to revolutionise how we think about our own data and what value it truly holds.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tip of the Iceberg episode investigated how Facebook targets Palestinian content related to Israel.</em></p></div><div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p>Al Jazeera Arabic presenter Tamer Almisshal has had his Facebook profile deleted by Meta 24 hours after&nbsp;the programme Tip of the Iceberg aired an investigation into Meta’s censorship of Palestinian content titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnj0rmnsAdI" target="_blank">The Locked Space</a>.</p>
<p>The programme’s investigation, which aired on Friday, included admissions by Eric Barbing, former head of Israel’s cybersecurity apparatus, about his organisation’s effort to track Palestinian content according to criteria that included “liking” a photo of a Palestinian killed by Israeli forces.</p>
<p>Then the agency would approach Facebook and argue that the content should be taken down.</p>
<p>According to Barbing, Facebook usually complies with the requests and Israel’s security apparatus follows up cases, including bringing court cases if need be.</p>
<p>The investigation followed up on Barbing’s admissions by interviewing a number of human and digital rights experts who agreed that there was a distinct imbalance in how Palestinian content is restricted.</p>
<p>The programme also interviewed Julie Owono, a member of Facebook’s oversight board, who admitted there is a discrepancy in how rules are interpreted and applied to Palestinian content and added that recommendations had been sent to Facebook to correct this.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera has asked Facebook about why Almisshal’s profile was shut down with no prior warning or explanation. It had not received a response by the time of publication.</p>
<h2 id="targeting-a-journalist">‘Targeting a journalist’</h2>
<p>Almisshal said the profile that was deleted is his personal page, set up by him in 2006 and verified. He had at least 700,000 followers on it.</p>
<p>“After the huge success of the episode, I discovered that my personal Facebook profile had been deleted with no explanations given,” he told Al Jazeera. “It really does seem like some kind of revenge for the programme. We haven’t received any response from Facebook yet.”</p>
<p>The programme’s team had set out to investigate how wide the gap was between how Palestinian and Israeli posts and material are treated by Facebook.</p>
<p>To do that, it set up an experiment in which it built two different pages, one with a pro-Palestinian perspective and the other a pro-Israeli one, and ran trials on them. The team concluded that there was indeed a big discrepancy in how much scrutiny there is and how rules are applied to posts on either page.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A day after Tamer Almisshal, a Palestinian <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/journalist?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#journalist</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jazeera?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Jazeera</a>, presented shocking evidence of Meta's censorship of Palestinian content on its platforms during his "Tip of the Iceberg" TV show, Facebook has taken down his page.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IsraeliCrimes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IsraeliCrimes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Palestine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Palestine</a> <a href="https://t.co/RGQm8sUuzQ">pic.twitter.com/RGQm8sUuzQ</a></p>

<p>It is not clear why Facebook would choose to delete an individual’s page in response to a programme.</p>
<p>“There was no explanation, no warning,” Almisshal said. “There had been no issues with any of the content on my page before. No message saying I had violated any rules.”</p>
<p>Almisshal stands by his programme.</p>
<p>“Last March, Facebook restricted my account, and it has happened other times, but usually the situation is resolved,” he said. “This was a journalistically sound project, and we communicated with Meta for it, giving them the opportunity to speak during the investigation.</p>
<p>“But to target a journalist individually instead – I would never have expected that.”</p>
