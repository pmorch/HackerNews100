<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday, Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release">reported</a> that employees at tech giant OpenAI who wanted to leave the company were confronted with expansive and highly restrictive exit documents. If they refused to sign in relatively short order, they were reportedly threatened with the loss of their vested equity in the company — a severe provision that's fairly uncommon in Silicon Valley. The policy had the effect of forcing ex-employees to choose between giving up what could be millions of dollars they had already earned or agreeing not to criticize the company, with no end date.</p><p>According to sources inside the company, the news caused a firestorm within OpenAI, a private company that is currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/technology/openai-artificial-intelligence-deal-valuation.html">valued at some $80 billion</a>. As with many Silicon Valley startups, employees at OpenAI often get the majority of their overall expected compensation in the form of equity. They tend to assume that once it has “vested,” according to the schedule laid out in their contract, it is theirs and cannot be taken back, any more than a company would claw back salary that has been paid out.</p><p>A day after the Vox piece, CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1791936857594581428">posted</a> an apology, saying:&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>we have never clawed back anyone's vested equity, nor will we do that if people do not sign a separation agreement (or don't agree to a non-disparagement agreement). vested equity is vested equity, full stop.</p><p>there was a provision about potential equity cancellation in our previous exit docs; although we never clawed anything back, it should never have been something we had in any documents or communication. this is on me and one of the few times i've been genuinely embarrassed running openai; i did not know this was happening and i should have.</p></blockquote></div><p>Tl;dr: I didn’t know we had provisions that threatened equity, and I promise we won’t do that anymore.</p><p>That apology has been echoed in internal communications by some members of OpenAI’s executive team. In a message to employees that was leaked to Vox, OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon acknowledged that the provision had been in place since 2019 but that “The team did catch this ~month ago. The fact that it went this long before the catch is on me.”</p><p>But there's a problem with those apologies from company leadership. Company documents obtained by Vox with signatures from Altman and Kwon complicate their claim that the clawback provisions were something they hadn’t known about. A separation letter on the termination documents, which you can read embedded below, says in plain language, “If you have any vested Units ... you are required to sign a release of claims agreement within 60 days in order to retain such Units.” It is signed by Kwon, along with OpenAI VP of people Diane Yoon (who departed OpenAI recently). The secret ultra-restrictive NDA, signed for only the “consideration” of already vested equity, is signed by COO Brad Lightcap.</p><p>Meanwhile, according to documents provided to Vox by ex-employees, the incorporation documents for the holding company that handles equity in OpenAI contains multiple passages with language that gives the company near-arbitrary authority to claw back equity from former employees or — just as importantly — block them from selling it.&nbsp;</p><p>Those incorporation documents were signed on April 10, 2023, by Sam Altman in his capacity as CEO of OpenAI.&nbsp;</p><p>Vox asked OpenAI if they could provide context on whether and how these clauses made it into the incorporation documents without Altman’s knowledge. While that question was not directly answered, Kwon said in a statement to Vox, “We are sorry for the distress this has caused great people who have worked hard for us. We have been working to fix this as quickly as possible. We will work even harder to be better.”&nbsp;</p><p>The seeming contradiction between OpenAI leadership’s recent statements and these documents has ramifications that go far beyond money. OpenAI is arguably the most influential, and certainly the most visible, company in artificial intelligence today, one that has the <a href="https://openai.com/about/">stated ambition</a> to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”&nbsp;</p><p>A little more than a week ago, OpenAI executives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/technology/openai-chatgpt-app.html">were on stage</a> introducing the company’s latest model, ChatGPT-4o, which they were proud to note was capable of carrying out highly realistic conversations with users (with a voice, as it turned out, that was <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/350934/the-double-sexism-of-chatgpts-flirty-her-voice">a bit too close</a> to that of actress Scarlett Johansson).</p><p>But bringing artificial general intelligence to the world is a role that demands enormous public trust and serious transparency. If OpenAI’s own employees haven’t felt free to voice criticism without risking financial retribution, how can the company and its CEO possibly be worthy of that trust?</p><p>(Vox reviewed many documents in the course of reporting this story. Key documents of public interest are reproduced here.)</p><div><p><h2><strong>High-pressure tactics at OpenAI</strong></h2></p></div><p>Throughout the hundreds of pages of documents leaked to Vox, a pattern emerges. Getting ex-employees to sign the ultra-restrictive nondisparagement and nondisclosure agreement involved threatening to cancel their equity — but it also involved much more.&nbsp;</p><p>In two cases Vox reviewed, the lengthy, complex termination documents OpenAI sent out expired after seven days. That meant the former employees had a week to decide whether to accept OpenAI’s muzzle or risk forfeiting what could be millions of dollars — a tight timeline for a decision of that magnitude, and one that left little time to find outside counsel.&nbsp;</p><p>When ex-employees asked for more time to seek legal aid and review the documents, they faced significant pushback from OpenAI. “The General Release and Separation Agreement requires your signature within 7 days,” a representative told one employee in an email this spring when the employee asked for another week to review the complex documents.&nbsp;</p><p>“We want to make sure you understand that if you don't sign, it could impact your equity. That's true for everyone, and we're just doing things by the book,” an OpenAI representative emailed a second employee who had asked for two more weeks to review the agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>(I spoke with four experts in employment and labor law for perspective on whether the termination agreement and surrounding conduct was indeed “by the book” or standard in the industry. “For a company to threaten to claw back already-vested equity is egregious and unusual,” California employment law attorney Chambord Benton-Hayes told me in an emailed statement.)</p><p>Most ex-employees folded under the pressure. For those who persisted, the company pulled out another tool in what one former employee called the “legal retaliation toolbox” he encountered on leaving the company. When he declined to sign the first termination agreement sent to him and sought legal counsel, the company changed tactics. Rather than saying they could cancel his equity if he refused to sign the agreement, they said he could be prevented&nbsp;from selling his equity.&nbsp;</p><p>The later documents the company sent him, which Vox has reviewed, say, “If you have any vested Units and you do not sign the exit documents, including the General Release, as required by company policy, it is important to understand that, among other things, you will not be eligible to participate in future tender events or other liquidity opportunities that we may sponsor or facilitate as a private company.” In other words, sign or give up the chance to sell your equity.</p><div><p><h2><strong>How OpenAI played hardball</strong>&nbsp;</h2></p></div><p>To make sense of that — and to see why it makes OpenAI’s recent apology so hollow — you need to understand what equity at OpenAI means.&nbsp;</p><p>In a publicly traded company, like Google, equity just means shares of stock. Employees are paid partially in their salary and partially in Google stock, which they can hold or sell on the stock market like any shareholder.</p><p>In a private company like OpenAI, employees are still awarded ownership shares of the company (or, more frequently, options to purchase ownership shares of the company at low prices) but have to wait until an opportunity to sell those shares — which may not come for years. Large private companies sometimes do “<a href="https://www.globalshares.com/academy/tender-offers-for-private-companies/">tender offers</a>” where employees and former employees can sell their equity. OpenAI hosts tender offers sometimes, but the exact details are a tightly kept secret.&nbsp;</p><p>By announcing that someone who doesn’t sign the restrictive agreement is locked out of all future tender offers, OpenAI effectively makes that equity, valued at millions of dollars, conditional on the employee signing the agreement — while still truthfully saying that they technically haven’t clawed back anyone’s vested equity, as Altman claimed in his tweet on May 18.&nbsp;</p><p>Vox reached out to OpenAI to clarify whether OpenAI has used or plans to use this tactic to cut former employees off from equity. An OpenAI spokesperson said, “Historically, former employees have been eligible to sell at the same price regardless of where they work; we don’t expect that to change.” It is not clear who authorized telling a former employee that he would be excluded from all future tender offers unless he signed.</p><p>And the ex-employees I spoke with were nervous that, whatever public reassurances the company may be making, the incorporation documents generally gave OpenAI many avenues for legal retaliation, making it less reassuring for the company to retreat from any specific one.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to clauses stating that vested equity will vanish if a former employee does not sign a general release within 60 days, the incorporation documents also contain clauses stating that, “at the sole and absolute discretion of the company,” any employee who is terminated by the company can have their vested equity holdings reduced to zero. There are also clauses stating that the company has absolute discretion over which employees are allowed to participate in tender offers in which their equity is sold.</p><p>“[Those] documents are supposed to be putting the mission of building safe and beneficial AGI first but instead they set up multiple ways to retaliate against departing employees who speak in any way that criticizes the company,” a source close to the company told me.&nbsp;</p><p>These documents are signed by Sam Altman. OpenAI did not respond to a question about whether there was a contradiction between Altman’s public statements that he was unaware company documents included language about clawing back equity and the presence of these clauses in incorporation documents with his signature on them.</p><div><p><h2><strong>Why it matters</strong></h2></p></div><p>OpenAI has long positioned itself as a company that ought to be held to a higher standard. It claimed that its unique corporate structure — which involved a for-profit company governed by a nonprofit — would let them bring transformative technology to the world and ensure it “benefits all of humanity,” as the company mission statement reads, and not just the shareholders. OpenAI’s senior leadership has talked at length about their responsibilities for accountability, transparency, and democratic input, with Altman himself <a href="https://time.com/6280372/sam-altman-chatgpt-regulate-ai/">telling</a> Congress last year that “my worst fears are that we — the field, the technology, the industry — cause significant harm to the world.”</p><p>But for all the high-minded idealism, OpenAI has also had its share of scandals. In November, Altman <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/11/20/23969589/openai-sam-altman-fired-microsoft-chatgpt-emmett-shear-silicon-valley">was fired</a> by the OpenAI board, which said in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/11/17/sam-altman-departs-openai-as-board-alleges-he-was-not-consistently-candid/?sh=1a8a97e9637b">statement</a> only that Altman “was not consistently candid with the board.” The clumsy firing provoked an immediate outcry from employees, especially as the board failed to provide any more detailed explanation of what had justified firing the CEO of a world-leading tech company.&nbsp;</p><p>Altman soon arranged a deal to effectively take the company and most of its employees with him to Microsoft, before he was ultimately reinstated, with much of the board then resigning.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, the board’s language — “not consistently candid” — was puzzling. (Has anyone ever met a CEO who is consistently candid?) But six months on, it seems like we might be starting to see <a href="https://x.com/pkafka/status/1792684401429459196">publicly</a> some of the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/openai-superalignment-20-compute-commitment-never-fulfilled-sutskever-leike-altman-brockman-murati/">issues</a> that drove the unexpected board conflagration.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI can still set things right, and may now be getting started on the long and difficult process of doing so. They have taken some first, necessary steps. Altman’s initial statement was criticized for doing too little to make things right for former employees, but in an emailed statement, OpenAI told me that “we are identifying and reaching out to former employees who signed a standard exit agreement to make it clear that OpenAI has not and will not cancel their vested equity and releases them from nondisparagement obligations” — which goes much further toward fixing their mistake.</p><p>I think that represents a huge step forward over the company’s initial May 18 apology; it is specific about the steps OpenAI is taking and involves proactively reaching out to former employees. But I think OpenAI’s work here is far from done. Former employees felt the company put them under pressure from multiple angles, and OpenAI has not yet committed to changing all of those — specifically, they should commit to not excluding anyone from selling their equity on the basis of not signing a document or criticizing Open AI.&nbsp;</p><p>And, to fully grapple with the situation, OpenAI needs to grapple with responsibility. It's hard to understand how the executive team could have signed documents that laid out avenues to claw back equity from former employees, as well as separation letters which threatened to do the same, without realizing this situation was happening. In order to set this issue right, OpenAI must first acknowledge how extensive it was.</p><div><div><p><h2>How I reported this story</h2></p></div><p>Reporting is full of lots of tedious moments, but then there's the occasional “woah” moment. Reporting this story had three major moments of “woah.” The first is when I reviewed an employee termination contract and saw it casually stating that as “consideration” for signing this super-strict agreement, the employee would get to keep their already vested equity. That might not mean much to people outside the tech world, but I knew that it meant OpenAI had crossed a line many in tech consider close to sacred.</p><p>The second “woah” moment was when I reviewed the second termination agreement sent to one ex-employee who'd challenged the legality of OpenAI's scheme. The company, rather than defending the legality of its approach, had just jumped ship to a new approach.</p><p>That led to the third “woah” moment. I read through the incorporation document that the company cited as the reason it had the authority to do this and confirmed that it did seem to give the company a lot of license to take back vested equity and block employees from selling it. So I scrolled down to the signature page, wondering who at OpenAI had set all this up. The page had three signatures. All three of them were Sam Altman. I slacked my boss on a Sunday night, "Can I call you briefly?"</p></div><div><p><h2>Check out the documents supporting this reporting below:</h2></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

		<p>Voyager 1 has resumed returning science data from two of its four instruments for the first time since a computer issue arose with the spacecraft in November 2023. The mission’s science instrument teams are now determining steps to recalibrate the remaining two instruments, which will likely occur in the coming weeks. The achievement marks significant progress toward restoring the spacecraft to normal operations.</p>
<p>In April, after five months of troubleshooting since the original computer issue, the mission was able to get the spacecraft to <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-1-resumes-sending-engineering-updates-to-earth" rel="noopener">begin returning usable engineering data</a> about the health and status of its onboard systems, including the science instruments. On May 17, the team sent commands to the 46-year-old spacecraft that enabled it to resume sending science data to Earth. With Voyager 1 located more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from its home planet, it takes light over 22 1/2 hours to reach the spacecraft, and 22 1/2 hours for a signal to return to Earth. As a result, the team had to wait nearly two days to see if their commands were successful.</p>
<p>The plasma wave subsystem and magnetometer instrument are now returning usable science data. As part of the effort to restore Voyager 1 to normal operations, the mission is continuing work on the cosmic ray subsystem and low energy charged particle instrument. (<a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft/instruments/" rel="noopener">Six additional instruments</a> aboard Voyager 1 are either no longer working or were turned off after the probe’s flyby of Saturn.)</p>
<p>Normal operations were interrupted last year when Voyager 1 <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/voyager/2024/03/15/engineers-working-to-resolve-issue-with-voyager-1-computer/">began sending a signal back to Earth</a> that contained no science or engineering data. The team eventually determined the issue stemmed from a small portion of corrupted memory in the flight data subsystem, one of the spacecraft’s three computers. Among other things, this system is designed to package data from the science instruments as well as engineering data about the health and status of the spacecraft before that information is sent to Earth.</p>
<p><a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/" rel="noopener">Launched in 1977</a>, Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, will celebrate 47 years of operations later this year. They are NASA’s longest-operating spacecraft as well as the first and only spacecraft to explore outside the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/heliosphere/" rel="noopener">heliosphere</a>. Created by the Sun, this bubble of magnetic fields and solar wind pushes against the interstellar medium, an ocean of particles created by stars that have exploded elsewhere in the Milky Way galaxy. Both probes flew past Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2 also flew past Uranus and Neptune.</p>

<p>After first appearing earlier this year, YouTube once again appears to be rolling out a new redesign for its website that everyone hates.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/youtube-sidebar-redesign-test/">mid-April, Google started testing a redesign</a> to YouTube’s website, which moved the title of the video, its description, and the comments to the side of the screen. In their place, video recommendations were moved directly underneath the video being watched with much larger thumbnails and titles.</p>



<p>The change was widely hated by almost everyone who got it, but it didn’t show up for all users. In the weeks to follow, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/25/youtube-redesign-reverted-backlash/">YouTube reverted the redesign</a>.</p>



<p>Now, the YouTube redesign is back. </p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1793004992384905449">As</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1cxbvx5/its_even_worse_when_not_in_theatre_mode_its_so/">spotted</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1cxt1g6/did_the_person_that_designed_this_fail_uiux_in/">by</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1cxy6n2/this_new_ui_feels_like_it_was_designed_by_ai/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1cy6lfr/why_are_comments_now_on_the_side_while_videos_are/">users</a>, YouTube has started rolling out this redesign yet again. The new look has been appearing over the past few days, though it doesn’t seem like it’s a wide rollout. Rather, it appears to still be a test more than anything else. </p>



<p>What does this second attempt mean?</p>



<p>It’s still unclear if YouTube intends to make this new look the default experience, but a second round of testing certainly implies more data is being gathered. </p>



<p>Notably, some have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1cy1k37/this_is_just_an_experiment_according_to/">pointed</a> to tweets like <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1793363193752142227">this one</a> from YouTube regarding the new layout where YouTube says that it’s just an “experiment.” These largely appear to be canned replies, though, rather than being specific to the individual situation. So, while it’s likely true that this design is just an experiment, that doesn’t give any insight on what YouTube intends to do with the new design in the future. In one reply, <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1793009081336119700">YouTube says</a> that most experiments “only last a few weeks,” which also may or may not apply to this particular situation.</p>

	<li>Record quarterly revenue of $26.0 billion, up 18% from Q4 and up 262% from a year ago&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Record quarterly Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion, up 23% from Q4 and up 427% from a year ago</li>
	<li>Ten-for-one forward stock split effective June 7, 2024</li>
	<li>Quarterly cash dividend raised 150% to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis</li>
</ul>

<p>NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the first quarter ended April 28, 2024, of $26.0 billion, up 18% from the previous quarter and up 262% from a year ago.</p>

<p>For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.98, up 21% from the previous quarter and up 629% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $6.12, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 461% from a year ago.</p>

<p>“The next industrial revolution has begun — companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.</p>

<p>“Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.</p>

<p>“We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIM is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere — from the cloud to on-prem data centers and RTX AI PCs — through our expansive network of ecosystem partners.”</p>

<p>NVIDIA also announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of NVIDIA’s issued common stock to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. The split will be effected through an amendment to NVIDIA’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which will result in a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. Each record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of common stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024. Trading is expected to commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Monday, June 10, 2024.</p>

<p>NVIDIA is increasing its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of common stock. The increased dividend is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis and will be paid on Friday, June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.</p>

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="">https://investor.nvidia.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Conference Call and Webcast Information</strong><br>
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="">https://investor.nvidia.com</a>. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Non-GAAP Measures</strong><br>
To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.</p>

Consumers have good reasons to want their data kept private, and on the surface, the auto industry is an ally on that front.

Signatories of this lobby group's document promised not to hand over location, biometric, or driving behavior data to third parties without driver approval—with some exceptions. One of said exceptions requires police to obtain a court order (or a warrant, a subcategory of court order) to obtain driver info.

There's a major difference between a subpoena and a court order according to the <a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/good-practice/subpoenas-depositions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">APA Practice Organization</a>, which says "a subpoena is a lawyer's assertion that she/he is entitled to the requested information, while a court order determines that the lawyer is in fact entitled to it."

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog">Blog</a><svg width="8" height="12" viewBox="0 0 8 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2 10L6 6L2 2" stroke="#667999" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="square"></path></svg><span>Just shipped: Bluesky Direct Messages!</span></section><div><p>May 22, 2024</p><p><span>by <!-- -->The Bluesky Team</span></p></div></div><div><p>You can now send direct messages (DMs) to people on Bluesky! Say hi to a friend, colleague, or a crush.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/dms-demo.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the DM interface in the Bluesky app" width="400">
</figure>
<p>These are private one-to-one messages directly within the Bluesky app. By default, your permissions allow anyone you follow to DM you. You can change these settings to allow no one or anyone to message you.</p>
<h2>How do I send a DM?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Click the Chat icon. On mobile, you can find the icon at the bottom of your screen. On desktop, this is a chat bubble on the side bar (or go to <a href="https://bsky.app/messages">https://bsky.app/messages</a>).</li>
<li>On mobile, click the plus icon to start a new conversation. On desktop, click “New chat” in the top right to start a new conversation. Search for the user you want to message.</li>
<li>Write your message, and hit send!</li>
<li>If the app says a user cannot be messaged, they may have set their account to only allow messages from people they follow or from no one.</li>
</ol>
<h2>DM Privacy and Safety</h2>
<h3>Who can message me?</h3>
<p>By default, only people you follow can send you DMs. To change this, check the settings in the DM interface. You can allow DMs from no one, only people you follow, or all Bluesky users.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/dms-settings.jpg" alt="Screenshot of DM settings" width="400">
  <figcaption>Set who can message you, and whether you want notification sounds.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Blocked users will not be able to DM you. Muted users are able to DM you. Additionally, you can easily block users right from within the DM feature.</p>
<h3>Reporting DMs</h3>
<p>You can report DMs directly to mods, who will review reported messages for Community Guidelines violations. Moderators are able to view the reported message and surrounding messages for context to assess the report. Infractions may result in temporary or permanent loss of DM privileges or even full account takedowns.</p>
<h3>DM Privacy</h3>
<p>In rare cases, the Bluesky moderation team may need to open your DMs to investigate broader patterns of abuse, such as spam or coordinated harassment. This would only be done when absolutely necessary to keep Bluesky safe. Access is extremely limited and tracked internally.</p>
<p>This first version of DMs has limited features (no images or encryption yet), but we'll be adding more safety enhancements in future updates.</p>
<h2>Future Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Media in DMs:</strong> Currently, Bluesky DMs allow you to send text messages. In the future, you’ll be able to send images and other forms of media!</li>
<li><strong>Group DMs:</strong> In the future, you’ll be able to create direct messages for groups.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted DMs:</strong> We intend to fully support end-to-end encrypted messaging down the line. Read more about our technical plans for E2EE messaging in our <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2024-protocol-roadmap#product-features">2024 protocol roadmap</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Safety improvements:</strong> We’ll continue iterating on anti-harassment and safety tooling for direct messages.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>There’s no denying that S3 is a feat of engineering. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc3J4McebHE" rel="">Building and Operating a Pretty Big Storage System</a><span> is a top-tier technology flex. But S3’s feature set is falling behind its competitors. Notably, S3 has no compare-and-swap (CAS) operation—something every single other competitor has. It also lacks multi-region buckets and object appends. Even </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/express-one-zone/" rel="">S3 Express</a><span> is proving to be lackluster.</span></p><p><span>These missing features haven’t mattered much for data lakes and offline use cases. But new infrastructure is using object storage as their primary persistence layer—</span><a href="https://materializedview.io/p/cloud-storage-triad-latency-cost-durability" rel="">something</a><span> </span><a href="https://materializedview.io/i/138849066/transactional-key-value-stores-on-s" rel="">I’m</a><span> </span><a href="https://materializedview.io/i/138956120/you-should-be-streaming-data-on-s" rel="">excited</a><span> </span><a href="https://materializedview.io/i/139272203/s-express-one-zone-roundup" rel="">about</a><span>. Here, S3’s feature gaps are a bigger problem.</span></p><p><span>Preconditions (also known as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap" rel="">compare-and-swap</a><span> (CAS), conditionals, If-None-Match, If-Match, and so on) allow a client to write an object only if a certain condition is met. A client might wish to write an object only if it doesn’t exist, or update an object only if it hasn’t changed since the client last read it. CAS makes this possible. Such operations are used often for locks and transactions in distributed systems. </span></p><p><span>S3 is the only object store that doesn’t support preconditions. Every other object store—</span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage" rel="">Google Cloud Storage</a><span> (GCS), </span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs" rel="">Azure Blob Store</a><span> (ABS), Cloudflare </span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/" rel="">Ridiculously Reliable</a><span> (R2) storage, </span><a href="https://www.tigrisdata.com/" rel="">Tigris</a><span>, </span><a href="https://min.io/" rel="">MinIO</a><span>—all have this feature.</span></p><p><span>Instead, developers are forced to use a separate transactional store such as </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" rel="">DynamoDB</a><span> to enforce transactional operations. Building a two-phase write between DynamoDB and S3 is not technically difficult, but it’s annoying and </span><a href="https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/aws/enum.S3CopyIfNotExists.html" rel="">leads to ugly abstractions</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>I was </span><a href="https://x.com/criccomini/status/1729546140163395698" rel="">really excited</a><span> about S3 Express One Zone (S3E1Z) when it first came out. The more time I spend with it, the less impressed I am. The first wart that surfaced was a new </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.html" rel="">directory bucket</a><span> type, which Amazon introduced for Express.</span></p><p><span>But the gaps don’t stop here. S3E1Z is </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-differences.html#s3-express-differences-unsupported-features" rel="">missing a </a><em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-differences.html#s3-express-differences-unsupported-features" rel="">ton</a></em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-differences.html#s3-express-differences-unsupported-features" rel=""> of standard S3 features</a><span> including object version support, bucket tags, object locks, object tags, and MD5 checksum ETags. The </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-differences.html#s3-express-differences-unsupported-features" rel="">complete list</a><span> is pretty staggering.</span></p><p><span>S3E1Z buckets can’t be treated like a normal S3 buckets. As with CAS operations, developers must design around these deficiencies. And because S3E1Z is not multi-zonal, developers are left to build </span><a href="https://x.com/richardartoul/status/1756808229542051902" rel="">quorum writes</a><span> to multiple availability zones for higher availability.</span></p><p>Factor in S3E1Z’s high storage cost of $0.16/gig—twice elastic block store’s (EBS)  general purpose SSD (gp3) cost—and S3E1Z looks more like an expensive EBS with a half-implemented S3 API.</p><p><span>S3’s availability feature gaps go beyond S3E1Z. S3 doesn’t have dual-region or multi-region buckets. Such buckets are useful for higher availability. Google offers </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/availability-durability#cross-region-redundancy" rel="">a wide range of options</a><span> in this area.</span></p><p>While not a must-have, higher availability buckets are certainly nice to have.</p><p>The dream is that developers are offered an object store with all of these features: low latency, preconditions, dual-region/multi-region, and so on. But we live in reality, where engineers face a choice: abandon S3 or build around these gaps.</p><p><a href="https://turbopuffer.com/" rel="">Turbopuffer</a><span> is my favorite example of a company that’s gone all-in on abandoning S3.</span></p><p><span>The gamble they’ve made is that S3 will eventually get preconditions. This gamble seems reasonable since Amazon has all of the required building blocks (DynamoDB and S3) and every competitor is beating them here. I’m making the same gamble with the </span><a href="https://materializedview.io/p/cloud-storage-triad-latency-cost-durability" rel="">cloud native LSM I’m working on</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The challenge with this approach is inter-cloud network cost. All cloud providers charge for network egress. Data transferred to infrastructure running outside amazon web services (AWS) will incur network egress fees. But the inter-cloud cost for AWS users isn’t as bad as you might think. </span><a href="https://sirupsen.com/" rel="">Simon Eskildsen</a><span>, Turbopuffer’s founder and CEO, has </span><a href="https://x.com/Sirupsen/status/1766459050378551611" rel="">written about this extensively</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The benefit of this is that Turbopuffer has built a beautiful and minimalist design with </span><a href="https://turbopuffer.com/architecture" rel="">just three components</a><span>: a Turbopuffer binary, a RAM/SSD cache, and Google Cloud Storage.</span></p><p>For many, this will seem extreme. The alternative is to house metadata in a transactional store outside of S3.</p><p><span>Once you open yourself up to a separate metadata plane, you’ll find other use cases for it.

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.neosync.dev/" rel="nofollow">Neosync</a> is an open-source, developer-first way to anonymize PII, generate synthetic data and sync environments for better testing, debugging and developer experience.</p>
<p dir="auto">Companies use Neosync to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Safely test code against production data</strong> - Anonymize sensitive production data in order to safely use it locally for a better testing and developer experience</li>
<li><strong>Easily reproduce production bugs locally</strong> - Anonymize and subset production data to get a safe, representative data set that you can use to locally reproduce production bugs quickly and efficiently</li>
<li><strong>Fix broken staging environments</strong> - Catch bugs before they hit production when you hydrate your staging and QA environments with production-like data</li>
<li><strong>Reduce your compliance scope</strong> - Use anonymized and synthetic data to reduce your compliance scope and easily comply with laws like HIPAA, GDPR, and DPDP</li>
<li><strong>Seed development databases</strong> - Easily seed development databases with synthetic data for unit testing, demos and more</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">

<li><strong>Anonymize existing production-data</strong> for a better developer experience</li>
<li><strong>Subset your production database</strong> for local and CI testing using any SQL query</li>
<li><strong>Complete async pipeline</strong> that automatically handles job retries, failures and playback using an event-sourcing model</li>
<li><strong>Referential integrity</strong> for your data automatically</li>
<li><strong>Declarative, GitOps based configs</strong> as a step in your CI pipeline to hydrate your CI DB</li>
<li><strong>Pre-built data transformers</strong> for all major data types</li>
<li><strong>Custom data transformers</strong> using javascript or LLMs</li>

However, unlike Timeline, Recall doesn't just restore a version of your desktop files, it uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know">AI</a> to take you back to that moment, even opening relevant apps.</p><h2 id="what-apos-s-the-problem-with-windows-recall-3">What's the problem with Windows Recall?</h2><p>On the surface, this <em>sounds</em> like a cool feature, but that paranoid privacy purist in the back of my mind is burying his face in a pillow and screaming. Imagine if almost everything you had done for the past three months was recorded for anyone with access to your computer to see. Well, if you use Recall, you won't have to imagine.</p><p>That might seem like an overreaction, but let me explain: Recall is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-take-a-screenshot-in-windows-11" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-take-a-screenshot-in-windows-11">taking screenshots</a> every few seconds and storing them on your device. Adding encryption into the mix, that's an enormous amount of bloaty visual data that will show <em>almost everything </em>you've been doing on your computer during that period.</p><p>As Microsoft explains, "The default allocation for Recall on a device with 256 GB will be 25 GB, which can store approximately 3 months of snapshots. You can increase the storage allocation for Recall in your PC Settings. Old snapshots will be deleted once you use your allocated storage, allowing new ones to be stored."</p><p>This is worse than keylogging! Recall isn't just recording what you type, it's recording everything you're doing, with photo evidence, every three seconds.</p><figure><blockquote><p>This is worse than keylogging!</p></blockquote></figure><p>I say <em>almost</em> everything because Microsoft claims "Recall also does not take snapshots of certain kinds of content, including InPrivate web browsing sessions in Microsoft Edge. It treats material protected with digital rights management (DRM) similarly; like other Windows apps such as the Snipping Tool, Recall will not store DRM content." That's reassuring on the surface, but it's still far too vague for anyone to actually have any faith in it.&nbsp;</p><p>Will this only work on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/other-software/microsoft-edge-1292485/review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/other-software/microsoft-edge-1292485/review">Microsoft Edge</a>, or will it integrate with Chrome and Firefox too? If it only works with Edge, that feels like an egregious walling off of privacy for not using Microsoft's unpopular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/browser" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/browser">web browser</a>.</p><p>But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Microsoft openly admits that Recall will be taking screenshots of your passwords and private data:</p><p>"Note that Recall does not perform content moderation. It will not hide information such as passwords or financial account numbers. That data may be in snapshots that are stored on your device, especially when sites do not follow standard internet protocols like cloaking password entry."</p><p>So, what you could have here is something that stores your passwords, your information, your account details, etc, and that is visible to anyone on your profile. If you only have one profile for your device, that means everyone with access to that PC will be able to see your Recall data.</p><p>Arguably, the worst part about this is that it will be on by default once you activate your device. Microsoft states:&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>On by default</p></blockquote></figure><p>"On Copilot+ PCs powered by a Snapdragon® X Series processor, you will see the Recall taskbar icon after you first activate your device. You can use that icon to open Recall’s settings and make choices about what snapshots Recall collects and stores on your device."</p><p>I think this is a bad idea. The decision should be made by the individual, and not by Windows. Having it immediately active just means that uninformed people may not be able to act upon this. In my eyes, it's akin to cookie tracking – it can be just as invasive. All of this makes me wonder whether it may hit a snag with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/consent/what-is-valid-consent/" target="_blank" data-url="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/consent/what-is-valid-consent/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">consent under GDPR</a>.</p><h2 id="is-microsoft-making-recall-secure-3">Is Microsoft making Recall secure?</h2><p>In defense of Microsoft, I'd like it to be known that there was an <em>attempt </em>to make it secure. I don't think it was a very good one, but there was an attempt.</p><p>Microsoft states that "Recall snapshots are kept on Copilot+ PCs themselves, on the local hard disk, and are protected using data encryption on your device and (if you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11">Windows 11</a> Pro or an enterprise <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11">Windows 11</a> SKU) BitLocker." From the wording here, that looks like your snapshots will only be encrypted if you have Windows Pro or a business Windows code.&nbsp;</p><p>The omission of Windows Home users is horrifying. If this <em>is</em> the case, it leaves everyday people vulnerable if their devices are compromised.&nbsp;People shouldn't have to pay a premium and upgrade to protect their privacy on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/operating-system" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/operating-system">operating system</a> that's snapshotting their screen every few seconds.</p><figure><blockquote><p>People shouldn't have to pay a premium and upgrade to protect their privacy</p></blockquote></figure><p>The big question, though, is what kind of encryption is being used? I've been working with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/virtual-private-networks" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/virtual-private-networks">virtual private network (VPN)</a> encryption for a while now, and just because something is "encrypted" doesn't mean it's safe. In fact, with developments in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/how-quantum-computing-will-challenge-security" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/how-quantum-computing-will-challenge-security">quantum computing</a>, encryption is under threat, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn">best VPN</a> services are having to come up with quantum-secure encryption methods. We've already seen that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/bad-news-for-bitlocker-users-its-encryption-can-be-cracked-remarkable-easily" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/bad-news-for-bitlocker-users-its-encryption-can-be-cracked-remarkable-easily">BitLocker can be cracked</a>.</p><p>Another note in Microsoft's favor is that the data is stored locally and encrypted, rather than it being uploaded to a cloud server for Microsoft to access.</p><p>"Recall screenshots are only linked to a specific user profile and Recall does not share them with other users, make them available for Microsoft to view, or use them for targeting advertisements."</p><p>This means that, for now, Microsoft isn't peeking behind the curtain. But that doesn't guarantee that'll be the case forever. If Microsoft can legally find a way to make money out of this tool, my guess is that they'll try. For now, the push seems to be to persuade people to upgrade their OS.</p><p>If you're one of those households that has different profiles for each person on the family PC, you can claw back a little bit of privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>"Screenshots are only available to the person whose profile was used to sign in to the device. If two people share a device with different profiles they will not be able to access each other’s screenshots. If they use the same profile to sign-in to the device then they will share a screenshot history. Otherwise, Recall screenshots are not available to other users or accessed by other applications or services."</p><p>The problem is, that's only helpful if you password-protect your profile, and if someone sets parental controls on your profile, that <em>could</em> give them a backdoor.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-security-risks-with-recall-3">What are the security risks with Recall?</h2><p>You're probably thinking "so what?" So let me give you a few scenarios where this could be a problem:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>You're using a public computer:</strong> let's say you do some online shopping or banking on a library computer. You didn't realize Recall was active, and now the person using the computer after you has just gone into the Recall archive to pull up all of your bank details, your address, and your passwords. It's like handing your house keys over to a burglar before telling them you're going on holiday for the week.</li><li><strong>You're using a work laptop:</strong> we've all used a company computer for personal reasons, be it looking at social media on your lunch break, or simply running some errands because you don't have your own laptop. Now your boss, your IT team, and <em>anyone</em> with access to your device, can go through and see every three seconds of how you're using <em>their</em> equipment. They could use this to track your work output and see how productive you are, they could even read private messages you send to people.</li><li><strong>You're using a family PC:</strong> if you've been using the household computer, and you don't have a password-protected profile, anyone could walk in and open up your Recall history. If you've been doing anything <em>unsavory</em> it's about to be obvious, even if you deleted that search history.</li><li><strong>You get hacked or your laptop gets stolen:</strong> this one's pretty obvious, but if someone manages to hack into your device, the encryption won't matter. Similarly, if someone just steals your laptop and you don't have a secure password locking it, then a criminal (cyber or otherwise) can use Recall to pull the whole world out from under your feet.</li></ul><p>There are so many problems that can arise just from someone accessing your Recall data. Using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager">password manager</a> would become irrelevant if someone can see you typing in your master password, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-encrypted-messaging-app-android" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-encrypted-messaging-app-android">private messages</a> will be anything but, and there's no point in deleting your search history because Microsoft is keeping the receipts!</p><h2 id="how-to-protect-your-privacy-with-windows-recall-3">How to protect your privacy with Windows Recall</h2><p>There are a few ways you can protect your privacy from Windows Recall, but the obvious, and most effective one will be to disable it outright. As the saying goes "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." You're better off not having this stuff stored on your device in the first place.</p><p>If, however, you want to use Recall, you're going to need to do the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Make an individual profile on your PC:</strong> this will prevent people from having shared access to your Recall data as long as you follow my next tip.</li><li><strong>Password-protect your profile:</strong> not just your device, but your profile, too. Don't use a weak password, be serious. Use three memorable words with numbers and symbols, and no, don't set your password as "3-Memorable-worD5!"</li><li><strong>Encrypt your Recall data:</strong> you may have to upgrade your OS or pay for BitLocker, but encryption is a non-negotiable. If someone gets past your password, you don't want them to have immediate, unchecked access to what you've been doing for the past three months.</li><li><strong>Don't access sensitive data while Recall is on:</strong> if you're going to type in personal passwords or look at NSFW content, just turn it off. This is obviously going to be annoying and time-consuming, but it's far better than the alternative of having it all screenshotted.</li></ul><h2 id="bottom-line-recall-makes-my-skin-crawl-3">Bottom line: Recall makes my skin crawl</h2><p>Look, I've been a privacy advocate and researcher for years. I don't like the idea of anything tracking what we do. But <em>this</em>... this is something else. The risk that comes with Recall, the sheer devastation it could cause <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/been-hacked-this-is-what-you-need-to-do-now" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/been-hacked-this-is-what-you-need-to-do-now">if your device gets hacked</a>, the idea that Microsoft may be walling off privacy behind what I can only describe as a paywall. It sickens me.</p><p>There is so much opportunity for misuse with this feature. Security cannot be understated. Privacy cannot be bolted on. Taking screenshots of my device from the second I activate my device should <em>not</em> be a default option. Put the user in control of their privacy, and put the decision in their hands.</p><p>All of this just pushes me into the privacy-loving flippers of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-distros" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-distros">Linux</a>.</p><h2 id="section-you-might-also-like"><span>You might also like</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/microsoft-reveals-ai-powered-recall-feature-to-transform-windows-11s-searchability-while-confirming-hardware-requirements" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/microsoft-reveals-ai-powered-recall-feature-to-transform-windows-11s-searchability-while-confirming-hardware-requirements">Microsoft reveals AI-powered 'Recall' feature to transform Windows 11's searchability, while confirming hardware requirements</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/ai-surveillance-is-on-the-horizon-but-mullvad-vpn-might-have-a-fix" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/ai-surveillance-is-on-the-horizon-but-mullvad-vpn-might-have-a-fix">AI surveillance is on the horizon, but Mullvad VPN might have a fix</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-makes-big-promises-with-new-ai-pcs-that-will-come-with-ai-explorer-feature-for-windows-11" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-makes-big-promises-with-new-ai-pcs-that-will-come-with-ai-explorer-feature-for-windows-11">Microsoft makes big promises with new ‘AI PCs’ that will come with AI Explorer feature for Windows 11</a></li></ul>

Let's dive in and explore how to systematically improve your RAG systems together!</p> <!-- more --> <h2 id="start-with-synthetic-data">Start with Synthetic Data<a href="#start-with-synthetic-data" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>I think the biggest mistake around improving the system is that most people are spending too much time on the actual synthesis without actually understanding whether or not the data is being retrieved correctly. To avoid this:</p> <ul> <li>Create synthetic questions for each text chunk in your database</li> <li>Use these questions to test your retrieval system </li> <li>Calculate precision and recall scores to establish a baseline</li> <li>Identify areas for improvement based on the baseline scores</li> </ul> <p>What we should be finding with synthetic data is that synthetic data should just be around 97% recall precision. And synthetic data might just look like something very simple to begin with. </p> <p>We might just say, for every text chunk, I want it to synthetically generate a set of questions that this text chunk answers. For those questions, can we retrieve those text chunks? And you might think the answer is always going to be yes. But I found in practice that when I was doing tests against essays, full text search and embeddings basically performed the same, except full text search was about 10 times faster.</p> <p>Whereas when I did the same experiment on pulling issues from a repository, it was the case that full text search got around 55% recall, and then embedding search got around 65% recall. And just knowing how challenging these questions are on the baseline is super important to figure out what kind of experimentation you need to perform better. This will give you a baseline to work with and help you identify areas for improvement.</p>  <p>Ensuring relevant metadata (e.g., date ranges, file names, ownership) is extracted and searchable is crucial for improving search results. </p> <ul> <li>Extract relevant metadata from your documents</li> <li>Include metadata in your search indexes</li> <li>Use query understanding to extract metadata from user queries</li> <li>Expand search queries with relevant metadata to improve results</li> </ul> <p>For example, if someone asks, "What is the latest x, y, and z?" Text search will never get that answer. Semantic search will never get that answer.</p> <p>You need to perform query understanding to extract date ranges. There will be some prompt engineering that needs to happen. That's the metadata, and being aware that there will be questions that people aren't answering because those filters can never be caught by full text search and semantic search.</p> <p>And what this looks like in practice is if you ask the question, what are recent developments in the field, the search query is now expanded out to more terms. There's a date range where the language model has reasoned about what recent looks like for the research, and it's also decided that you should only be searching specific sources. If you don't do this, then you may not get trusted sources. You may be unable to figure out what recent means.</p> <p>You'll need to do some query understanding to extract date ranges and include metadata in your search.</p> <h2 id="use-both-full-text-search-and-vector-search">Use Both Full-Text Search and Vector Search<a href="#use-both-full-text-search-and-vector-search" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Utilize both full-text search and vector search (embeddings) for retrieving relevant documents. Ideally, you should use a single database system to avoid synchronization issues.</p> <ul> <li>Implement both full-text search and vector search</li> <li>Test the performance of each method on your specific use case</li> <li>Consider using a single database system to store both types of data</li> <li>Evaluate the trade-offs between speed and recall for your application</li> </ul> <p>In my experience, full-text search can be faster, but vector search can provide better recall.</p> <p>What ended up being very complicated was if you have a single knowledge base, maybe that complexity is fine, because you have more configuration of each one.</p> <p>But one of my clients who was doing construction data, they had to create separate indices per project, and now they just had this exploding array of different data sources that get in or out of sync. Like, maybe the database has an outage, and now the data is not in the database, but it's in another system. So if the embedding gets pulled up, then text is missing.</p> <p>And this complex configuration becomes a huge pain. And so, for example, some tools are able to do all 3 in a single object. And so even if you had a lot of partitioned data sources, you can do full text search, embedding search, and write SQL against a single data object. And that has been really helpful, especially when you think about these examples where you want to find the latest. Now you can just do a full text search query and then order by date and have a between clause.</p> <p>Test both and see what works best for your use case.</p> <h2 id="implement-clear-user-feedback-mechanisms">Implement Clear User Feedback Mechanisms<a href="#implement-clear-user-feedback-mechanisms" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Implementing clear user feedback systems (e.g., thumbs up/down) is essential for gathering data on your system's performance and identifying areas for improvement.</p> <ul> <li>Add user feedback mechanisms to your application</li> <li>Make sure the copy for these mechanisms clearly describes what you're measuring</li> <li>Ask specific questions like "Did we answer the question correctly?" instead of general ones like "How did we do?" </li> <li>Use the feedback data to identify areas for improvement and prioritize fixes</li> </ul> <p>I find that it's important to build out these feedback mechanisms as soon as possible. And making sure that the copy of these feedback mechanisms explicitly describe what you're worried about.</p> <p>Sometimes, we'll get a thumbs down even if the answer is correct, but they didn't like the tone. Or the answer was correct, but the latency was too high. Or it took too many hops.</p> <p>This means we couldn't actually produce an evaluation dataset just by figuring out what was a thumbs up and a thumbs down. It was a lot of confounding variables. We had to change the copy to just "Did we answer the question correctly? Yes or no." We need to recognize that improvements in tone and improvements in latency will come eventually. But we needed the user feedback to build us that evaluation dataset.</p> <p>Make sure the copy for these feedback mechanisms explicitly describes what you're worried about. This will help you isolate the specific issues users are facing.</p> <h2 id="cluster-and-model-topics">Cluster and Model Topics<a href="#cluster-and-model-topics" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Analyze user queries and feedback to identify topic clusters, capabilities, and areas of user dissatisfaction. This will help you prioritize improvements.</p> <p>Why should we do this? Let me give you an example. I once worked with a company that provided a technical documentation search system. By clustering user queries, we identified two main issues:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Topic Clusters: A significant portion of user queries were related to a specific product feature that had recently been updated. However, our system was not retrieving the most up-to-date documentation for this feature, leading to confusion and frustration among users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capability Gaps: Another cluster of queries revealed that users were frequently asking for troubleshooting steps and error code explanations. While our system could retrieve relevant documentation, it struggled to provide direct, actionable answers to these types of questions.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Based on these insights, we prioritized updating the product feature documentation and implementing a feature to extract step-by-step instructions and error code explanations. These targeted improvements led to higher user satisfaction and reduced support requests.</p> <p>Look for patterns like:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Topic clusters: Are users asking about specific topics more than others? This could indicate a need for more content in those areas or better retrieval of existing content.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capabilities: Are there types of questions your system categorically cannot answer? This could indicate a need for new features or capabilities, such as direct answer extraction, multi-document summarization, or domain-specific reasoning.</p> </li> </ul> <p>By continuously analyzing topic clusters and capability gaps, you can identify high-impact areas for improvement and allocate your resources more effectively. This data-driven approach to prioritization ensures that you're always working on the most critical issues affecting your users.</p> <p>Once you have this in place, once you have these topics and these clusters, you can talk to domain experts for a couple of weeks to figure out what these categories are explicitly. Then, you can build out systems to tag that as data comes in.</p> <p>In the same way that when you open up ChatGPT and make a conversation, it creates an automatic title in the corner. You can now do that for every question. As part of that capability, you can add the classification, such as what are the topics and what are the capabilities. Capabilities could include ownership and responsibility, fetching tables, fetching images, fetching documents only, no synthesis, compare and contrast, deadlines, and so on.</p> <p>You can then put this information into a tool like Amplitude or Sentry. This will give you a running stream of the types of queries people are asking, which can help you understand how to prioritize these capabilities and topics.</p> <h2 id="continuously-monitor-and-experiment">Continuously Monitor and Experiment<a href="#continuously-monitor-and-experiment" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Continuously monitor your system's performance and run experiments to test improvements.</p> <ul> <li>Set up monitoring and logging to track system performance over time</li> <li>Regularly review the data to identify trends and issues</li> <li>Design and run experiments to test potential improvements</li> <li>Measure the impact of changes on precision, recall, and other relevant metrics</li> <li>Implement changes that show significant improvements</li> </ul> <p>This could include tweaking search parameters, adding metadata, or trying different embedding models. Measure the impact on precision and recall to see if the changes are worthwhile.</p> <p>Once you now have these questions in place, you have your synthetic data set and a bunch of user data with ratings. This is where the real work begins when it comes to systematically improving your RAG.</p> <p>The system will be running many clusters of topic modeling around the questions, modeling that against the thumbs up and thumbs down ratings to figure out what clusters are underperforming. It will then determine the count and probability of user dissatisfaction for each cluster.</p> <p>The system will be doing this on a regular cadence, figuring out for what volume of questions and user satisfaction levels it should focus on improving these specific use cases.</p> <p>What might happen is you onboard a new organization, and all of a sudden, those distributions shift because their use cases are different. That's when you can go in and say, "We onboarded these new clients, and they very much care about deadlines. We knew we decided not to service deadlines, but now we know this is a priority, as it went from 2% of questions asking about deadlines to 80%." You can then determine what kind of education or improvements can be done around that.</p> <h2 id="balance-latency-and-performance">Balance Latency and Performance<a href="#balance-latency-and-performance" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Finally, make informed decisions about trade-offs between system latency and search performance based on your specific use case and user requirements.</p> <ul> <li>Understand the latency and performance requirements for your application</li> <li>Measure the impact of different configurations on latency and performance</li> <li>Make trade-offs based on what's most important for your users</li> <li>Consider different requirements for different use cases (e.g., medical diagnosis vs. general search)</li> </ul> <p>Here, this is where having the synthetic questions that test against will effectively answer that question. Because what we'll do is we'll run the query with and without this parent document retriever, and we will have a recall with and without that feature and the latency improvement of that feature.</p> <p>And so now we'll be able to say, okay. Well, recall doubles. The latency increases by 20%, then a conversation can happen. Or, is that worth the investment? But if latency goes up double and the recall goes up 1%, again, it depends on, okay.</p> <p>Well, if this is a medical diagnostic, maybe I do care that the 1% is included because the stakes are so high. But if it's for a doc page, maybe the increased latency will reduce in churn.</p> <p>If you can improve recall by 1%, and the results are too complex, it's not worth deploying it in the future as well.</p> <p>For example, if you're building a medical diagnostic tool, a slight increase in latency might be worth it for better recall. But if you're building a general-purpose search tool, faster results might be more important.</p> <h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up<a href="#wrapping-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>This is was written based off of a 30 conversation with a client, so I know I'm skipping over many details and implementation details. Leave a comment and let me know and we can get into specifics.</p>    <!-- Synchronize Giscus theme with palette -->  </article> </div>  </main>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">A property-based testing tool for Ruby with experimental features that allow you to run test cases in parallel.</p>
<p dir="auto">PBT stands for Property-Based Testing.</p>
<p dir="auto">As for the results of the parallelization experiment, please refer the talk at RubyKaigi 2024: <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2024/presentations/ohbarye.html" rel="nofollow">Unlocking Potential of Property Based Testing with Ractor</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's Property-Based Testing?</h2><a id="user-content-whats-property-based-testing" aria-label="Permalink: What's Property-Based Testing?" href="#whats-property-based-testing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Property-Based Testing is a testing methodology that focuses on the properties a system should always satisfy, rather than checking individual examples. Instead of writing tests for predefined inputs and outputs, PBT allows you to specify the general characteristics that your code should adhere to and then automatically generates a wide range of inputs to verify these properties.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key benefits of property-based testing include the ability to cover more edge cases and the potential to discover bugs that traditional example-based tests might miss. It's particularly useful for identifying unexpected behaviors in your code by testing it against a vast set of inputs, including those you might not have considered.</p>

<p dir="auto">The above snippet is very simple but contains the basic components.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Runner</h4><a id="user-content-runner" aria-label="Permalink: Runner" href="#runner"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>Pbt.assert</code> is the runner. The runner interprets and executes the given property. <code>Pbt.assert</code> takes a property and runs it multiple times. If the property fails, it tries to shrink the input that caused the failure.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Property</h4><a id="user-content-property" aria-label="Permalink: Property" href="#property"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The snippet above declared a property by calling <code>Pbt.property</code>. The property describes the following:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>What the user wants to evaluate. This corresponds to the block (let's call this <code>predicate</code>) enclosed by <code>do</code> <code>end</code></li>
<li>How to generate inputs for the predicate — using <code>Arbitrary</code></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The <code>predicate</code> block is a function that directly asserts, taking values generated by <code>Arbitrary</code> as input.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Arbitrary</h4><a id="user-content-arbitrary" aria-label="Permalink: Arbitrary" href="#arbitrary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Arbitrary generates random values. It is also responsible for shrinking those values if asked to shrink a failed value as input.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here, we used only one type of arbitrary, <code>Pbt.integer</code>. There are many other built-in arbitraries, and you can create a variety of inputs by combining existing ones.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shrink</h4><a id="user-content-shrink" aria-label="Permalink: Shrink" href="#shrink"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In PBT, If a test fails, it attempts to shrink the case that caused the failure into a form that is easier for humans to understand.
In other words, instead of stopping the test itself the first time it fails and reporting the failed value, it tries to find the minimal value that causes the error.</p>
<p dir="auto">When there is a test that fails when given an even number, a counterexample of <code>2</code> is simpler and easier to understand than <code>432743417662</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Arbitrary</h3><a id="user-content-arbitrary-1" aria-label="Permalink: Arbitrary" href="#arbitrary-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are many built-in arbitraries in <code>Pbt</code>. You can use them to generate random values for your tests. Here are some representative arbitraries.</p>

<p dir="auto">For concurrent processing, you can specify any of the three workers—<code>:ractor</code>, <code>:process</code>, or <code>:thread</code>—using the <code>worker</code> option. Alternatively, choose <code>:none</code> for serial execution.</p>

<p><em>Brave New Words</em> paints an inspiring picture of AI in the classroom.</p>

<p>When GPT-4o launched last week, people across the internet (and the world) were blown away. Talking to AI has always felt a bit surreal—but OpenAI’s latest model feels like talking to a real person. You can actually speak to it, and have it talk back to you, without lags. It’s as lifelike as any AI we’ve seen so far, and the use cases are limitless. One of the first that came to my mind was how big a game-changer it will be in the classroom. Imagine every student having a personal tutor powered by this technology.</p>
<p>I recently read a terrific book on this topic called <em>Brave New Words</em>. It’s written by my friend (and <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Unconfuse-Me-podcast-with-guest-Sal-Khan" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast guest</a>) Sal Khan, a longtime pioneer of innovation in education. Back in 2006, Sal founded Khan Academy to share the tutoring content he’d created for younger family members with a wider audience. Since then, his online educational platform has helped teach over 150 million people worldwide—including me and my kids.</p>
<p>Well before this recent AI boom, I considered him a visionary. When I learned he was writing this book, I couldn’t wait to read it. Like I expected, <em>Brave New Words</em> is a masterclass.</p>
<p>Chapter by chapter, Sal takes readers through his predictions—some have already come true since the book was written—for AI’s many applications in education. His main argument: AI will radically improve both student outcomes and teacher experiences, and help usher in a future where everyone has access to a world-class education.</p>
<p>You might be skeptical, especially if you—like me—have been following the EdTech movement for a while. For decades, exciting technologies and innovations have made headlines, accompanied by similarly bold promises to revolutionize learning and teaching as we know it—only to make a marginal impact in the classroom.</p>
<p>But drawing on his experience creating <a href="https://www.khanmigo.ai/" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khanmigo</a>, an AI-powered tutor, Sal makes a compelling case that AI-powered technologies will be different. That’s because we finally have a way to give every student the kind of personalized learning, support, and guidance that’s historically been out of reach for most kids in most classrooms. As Sal puts it, “Getting every student a dedicated on-call human tutor is cost prohibitive.” AI tutors, on the other hand, aren’t.</p>
<p>Picture this: You're a seventh-grade student who struggles to keep up in math. But now, you have an AI tutor like the one Sal describes by your side. As you work through a challenging set of fraction problems, it won’t just give you the answer—it breaks each problem down into digestible steps. When you get stuck, it gives you easy-to-understand explanations and a gentle nudge in the right direction. When you finally get the answer, it generates targeted practice questions that help build your understanding and confidence.</p>
<p>And with the help of an AI tutor, the past comes to life in remarkable ways. While learning about Abraham Lincoln’s leadership during the Civil War, you can have a “conversation” with the 16<sup>th</sup> president himself. (As Sal demonstrates in the book, conversations with one of my favorite literary figures, Jay Gatsby, are also an option.)</p>
<p>When the time comes to write your essay, don’t worry about the dreaded blank page. Instead, your AI tutor asks you thought-starters to help brainstorm. You get feedback on your outline in seconds, with tips to improve the logic or areas where you need more research. As you draft, the tutor evaluates your writing in real-time—almost impossible without this technology—and shows where you might clarify your ideas, provide more evidence, or address a counterargument. Before you submit, it gives detailed suggestions to refine your language and sharpen your points.</p>
<p>Is this cheating?</p>
<p>It’s a complicated question, and there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Sal notes that bouncing ideas off friends, asking family members to critique work, and using spellcheckers and tools like Grammarly—which can rephrase entire sentences—aren’t considered cheating today by most measures. Similarly, when used right, AI doesn’t work for students but <em>with </em>them to move something forward that they might otherwise get stuck on. That’s why, according to Sal, a lot of educators who first banned AI from class are now encouraging students to use it.</p>
<p>After all, mastery of AI won’t just be nice to have in a few years—for many professions, it’ll be necessary. Employees who can use AI effectively will be far more valuable than those who can’t. By incorporating this technology into education, we're both improving students’ experiences and outcomes <em>and</em> preparing them for the jobs of the future—which will become more enjoyable and fulfilling with AI in the mix.</p>
<p>That includes teaching. With every transformative innovation, there are fears of machines taking jobs. But when it comes to education, I agree with Sal: AI tools and tutors never can and never should replace teachers. What AI can do, though, is support and empower them.</p>
<p>Until now, most EdTech solutions, as great as they may be, haven’t meaningfully made teachers’ lives easier. But with AI, they can have a superhuman teaching assistant to handle routine tasks like lesson planning and grading—which take up almost half of a typical teacher's day. In seconds, an AI assistant can grade spelling tests or create a lesson plan connecting the Industrial Revolution to current events. It can even monitor each student's progress and give teachers instant feedback, allowing for a new era of personalized learning.</p>
<p>With AI assistants handling the mundane stuff, teachers can focus on what they do best: inspiring students, building relationships, and making sure everyone feels seen and supported—especially kids who need a little extra help.</p>
<p>Of course, there are challenges involved in bringing AI into schools at scale, and Sal is candid about them. We need systems that protect student privacy and mitigate biases. And there’s still a lot to do so that every kid has access to the devices and connectivity they need to use AI in the first place. No technology is a silver bullet for education. But I believe AI can be a game-changer and great equalizer in the classroom, the workforce, and beyond.</p>
<p>I recently visited First Avenue School in Newark, New Jersey, where Khanmigo is currently being piloted. We’re still in the early days, but it was amazing to see firsthand how AI can be used in the classroom—and to speak with students and teachers who are already reaping the benefits. It felt like catching a glimpse of the future. No one understands where education is headed better than Sal Khan, and I can't recommend <em>Brave New Words</em> enough.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div><ul><li><em>The “right to roam” movement in England seeks to reclaim common rights to access, use and enjoy both private and public land, since citizens only have access to 8% of their nation’s land currently.</em></li><li><em>Campaigner and activist Jon Moses joins the Mongabay podcast to discuss the history of land ownership change in England with co-host Rachel Donald, and why reestablishing a common “freedom to roam” — a right observed in places like the Czech Republic and Norway — is necessary to reestablishing human connection with nature and repairing damaged landscapes.</em></li><li><em>At least 2,500 landscapes are cut off from public access in England, requiring one to trespass to reach them.</em></li><li><em>“There needs to be a kind of rethinking really of [what] people’s place is in the landscape and how that intersects with a kind of [new] relationship between people and nature as well,” Moses says on this episode.</em></li></ul></div> <p>Like most nations, England doesn’t have legally recognized rights for citizens to cross non-public lands. This means that the nearly 56 million people who live there are only legally allowed to access 8% of the country. One particularly picturesque example of this problem was recently noted by the BBC, which discussed a large piece of public land that’s actually inaccessible due to being <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68278444" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">surrounded</a> by private land, forcing people to trespass in order to reach it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Right to Roam</a> campaigner Jon Moses speaks with Rachel Donald on the latest Mongabay Newscast about a growing movement in England that stages creative events like group walks on private land to point out the benefits of public access for repairing degraded landscapes and improving the lives of everyday citizens, which are outlined in a new book, <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wild-service-9781526673312/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Wild Service: Why Nature Needs You</em></a><em>, </em>that he’s co-edited with Nick Hayes.</p>
<p>Listen here:</p>

<p>Freedom-to-roam laws aren’t widely recognized outside of Scandinavia and Europe, but Moses says these rights are fundamental to repairing the damage caused by centuries of private land ownership.</p>
<p>“I think that there needs to be a kind of rethinking really of [what] people’s place is in the landscape and how that intersects with a kind of new … vision of farming and a new relationship between people and nature as well.”</p>
<p>Among the reasons Moses says is given for the increase in private land ownership over the past few centuries is industrial agriculture, which he says isn’t benefiting the farmers all that much either. Moses says the reasons for decreases in the rights of “commoners,” as they’re referred to, to access and use common land in England were in part to suppress wage growth and quash locals’ autonomy.</p>
<p>“They’re really kind of explicit about this in the documentation, that we need to break common rights in order to create a kind of more dependent class of agricultural laborers that are reliant on a wage,” Moses says.</p>

    </div><p>New research led by King's College London has found that thousands of DNA sequences originating from ancient viral infections are expressed in the brain, with some contributing to susceptibility for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>The work appears in <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p>
<p>About 8% of our genome is comprised of sequences called Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), which are products of ancient viral infections that occurred hundreds of thousands of years ago. Until recently, it was assumed that these "fossil viruses" were simply junk DNA, with no important function in the body. However, due to advances in genomics research, scientists have now discovered where in our DNA these fossil viruses are located, enabling us to better understand when they are expressed and what functions they may have.</p>
<p>This new study builds upon these advances and is the first to show that a set of specific HERVs expressed in the human brain contribute to psychiatric disorder susceptibility, marking a step forward in understanding the complex genetic components that contribute to these conditions.</p>
<p>Dr. Timothy Powell, co-senior author on the study and Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, said, "This study uses a novel and robust approach to assess how genetic susceptibility for psychiatric disorders imparts its effects on the expression of ancient viral sequences present in the modern human genome. Our results suggest that these viral sequences probably play a more important role in the human brain than originally thought, with specific HERV expression profiles being associated with an increased susceptibility for some psychiatric disorders."</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <p>The study analyzed data from large genetic studies involving tens of thousands of people, both with and without mental health conditions, as well as information from autopsy brain samples from 800 individuals, to explore how DNA variations linked to psychiatric disorders affect the expression of HERVs.</p>
<p>Although most genetic risk variants linked to psychiatric diagnoses impacted genes with well-known biological functions, the researchers found that some genetic risk variants preferentially affected the expression of HERVs. The researchers reported five robust HERV expression signatures associated with psychiatric disorders, including two HERVs that are associated with risk for schizophrenia, one associated with risk for both <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bipolar+disorder/" rel="tag">bipolar disorder</a> and schizophrenia, and one associated with risk for depression.</p>
<p>Dr. Rodrigo Duarte, first author and Research Fellow at the IoPPN, King's College London, said, "We know that psychiatric disorders have a substantial genetic component, with many parts of the genome incrementally contributing to susceptibility. In our study, we were able to investigate parts of the genome corresponding to HERVs, which led to the identification of five sequences that are relevant to psychiatric disorders. While it is not clear yet how these HERVs affect <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cells/" rel="tag">brain cells</a> to confer this increase in risk, our findings suggest that their expression regulation is important for brain function."</p>
<p>Dr. Douglas Nixon, co-senior author on the study and and researcher at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health, in the US, said, "Further research is needed to understand the exact function of most HERVs, including those identified in our study. We think that a better understanding of these ancient viruses, and the known genes implicated in <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatric+disorders/" rel="tag">psychiatric disorders</a>, have the potential to revolutionize mental health research and lead to novel ways to treat or diagnose these conditions."</p>

<h2>
	Background
</h2>
<p>
	I used to wonder what my friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Lewis">Benny Lewis</a> was doing.
	He has <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/">a website</a> and social media accounts, but neither gave <strong>an overview of what he’s doing now</strong>.
</p><p>
	Then I realized some people might wonder the same about me.
	So in 2015, I made <a href="https://sive.rs/now">a /now page</a> on my website, saying <strong>what I’d tell a friend I hadn’t seen in a year</strong>.
</p><p>
	It has a nice side-effect of being a public declaration of priorities.
	It’s a good link to give people when <a href="https://sive.rs/n">saying no</a> to invitations and distractions.
</p><p>
	Word spread, and soon <strong><a href="https://nownownow.com/">hundreds of people</a> had a /now page on their personal website</strong>.
	So I made a site to showcase them all: <strong><a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a></strong> — (a static site generated by <a href="https://sive.rs/pg2">PostgreSQL functions</a>.)
	It currently has over <a href="https://nownownow.com/">2300 people</a> worldwide.
	This week I added browse by location and search.
</p>
<h2>
	Got a personal website? Add a /now page
</h2>
<p>
	The three main ingredients are:
</p>
<ol><li>
	a page, usually at URL /now, linked from your main menu, usually alongside /about
</li><li>
	an overview of what’s going on with you — what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year
</li><li>
	the date it was last updated
</li></ol>
<h2>
	WordPress instructions:
</h2>
<p>
	In the left menu, under “<strong>Pages</strong>”, click “<strong>Add New Page</strong>”.
	Then, where it says “Add title”, replace that with just three letters: <strong>now</strong>.
	That will ensure the URL is /now, and after it’s posted, you can change the title to “What I’m doing now” or whatever.

<h2>
	Wix instructions:
</h2>
<p>
	On the left, under “<strong>Site Menu</strong>”, click “<strong>+ Add Page</strong>”.
	Call it <strong>Now</strong>, next to your “About” page.
	Click the (…) to its right, then to “<strong>SEO basics</strong>”, to edit “<strong>URL slug</strong>” and make sure it’s just the three letters: now

<h2>
	No website yet? Use <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear</a>
</h2>
<p>
	If you don’t have a personal website yet, I highly recommend <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear</a> at <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">BearBlog.dev</a>.
	It’s so simple, clean, and free.
	The owner and creator, <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/">Herman in South Africa</a>, runs it himself with great love.
	And no investors so no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>.
	He plans to keep it alive <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/">forever</a>.
</p><p>
	I believe in it so much that I told Herman I would be its godfather.
	If he ever can’t (or doesn’t want to) run it anymore, I will help run it, or fund a foundation to keep it alive.
</p><p>
	To create a /now page on Bear, click “<strong>Pages</strong>”, then “<strong>New page</strong>”.
	Then, after it says “<strong>title:</strong>”, type just three letters: <strong>now</strong>.
	That will ensure the URL is /now, and after it’s posted, you can change the title to “What I’m doing now” or whatever.

<h2>
	Got a /now page? I’ll add you to <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>
</h2>
<p>
	Once it’s live, just <a href="https://sive.rs/contact">email me your URL</a>, and I add it (by hand) to <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.
	(This is also a good time to say hello, if you haven’t yet. I read and reply to every email.)

<p dir="auto"><strong><em>Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?</em></strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
<a href="https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench">vtebench</a> to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.</p>
<p dir="auto">Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have doubts about Alacritty's performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with <strong>your</strong> specific
usecases.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><em>Why isn't feature X implemented?</em></strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it's just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won't find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">terminal multiplexer</a>) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.</p>

    <p>In the hours following the release of <a href="https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2024-17">CVE-2024-4323</a> for the project <a href="https://fluentbit.io/">Fluent Bit</a>, site reliability workers
and systems administrators scrambled to desperately rebuild and patch all their systems to fix a vulnerability in HTTP parsing code that allows for heap corruption and arbitrary code execution by making a HTTP GET request with a megabyte of the letter 'A' in its body. This is due to the affected components being
written in C, the only programming language where these vulnerabilities regularly happen. "This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes
these things just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop them," said programmer Prince Marcel O'Keefe, echoing statements
expressed by hundreds of thousands of programmers who use the only language where 90% of the world's memory safety vulnerabilities have
occurred in the last 50 years, and whose projects are 20 times more likely to have security vulnerabilities. "It's a shame, but what can
we do? There really isn't anything we can do to prevent memory safety vulnerabilities from happening if the programmer doesn't want to
write their code in a robust manner." At press time, users of the only programming language in the world where these vulnerabilities
regularly happen once or twice per quarter for the last eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as "helpless."</p>

Everyone makes mistakes — Lord knows I did plenty of stupid, immoral things when I was 17 — and there is always the opportunity for growth and redemption. I sincerely hope that Pai repents and strives to become a more ethical person. In my view, he should still have the opportunity to attend a good university and build a long, accomplished career.</p><p>However, his award should be revoked. The current situation is unfair to the other participants. The fraud is clear. The $55,000 prize should be given to the runner-up.</p><p>This case highlights a significant oversight failure by the world's most prestigious science fair.
