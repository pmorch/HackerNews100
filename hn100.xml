<p>I’m excited to announce that Beeper has been acquired by Automattic. This acquisition marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter as we continue our mission to create the best chat app on earth.</p>







<blockquote>
<p>If you haven’t heard of <a href="https://beeper.com/">Beeper</a> before, welcome! We make a universal chat app – one app to send and receive messages on 14 different chat networks. You might have also heard about Beeper Mini, our briefly available iMessage-on-Android app.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many ways, our journey has only just begun. Beeper has just over 115,000 users and was, <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-now-available/">until today</a>, in beta. Given the state of the messaging landscape today, we believe there is a huge opportunity for us to push boundaries and create new experiences in chat. The majority of other chat apps have stagnated, entrenched in their positions, with <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1761916874227622299">no significant new players</a> emerging since Discord’s launch in 2015. Given the state of the messaging world, we’ve long felt the need for a strong ally with the resources to support us on our quest. Automattic has a long history of putting user control and privacy first with open source, and great bilateral relationships with Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Matrix and others that we hope can usher in a new era of collaboration.</p>



<p>It’s a fantastic match. Automattic is best known for supporting WordPress and WooCommerce – two open source software projects that underpin huge portions of the internet’s publishing and ecommerce infrastructure. Together, we’ll develop software for a third fundamental pillar of the internet: chat.</p>



<p>Matt, Automattic’s CEO, and I have known each other for years. He was an early user, supporter and investor in Beeper. We’re very well aligned on our goal (build the best chat app on earth), approach (open source where possible), and independence (Beeper will operate independently as part of Automattic’s Other Bets division).</p>



<p>This is a big bet. Automattic is doubling down on chat after their acquisition last year of <a href="http://texts.com/">Texts.com</a>, a messaging app with a similar mission. Our teams and products will merge, and I will take on the role leading the team as Head of Messaging. It will take a bit of time for us to integrate and combine forces under the Beeper brand. We’ve got big plans! I’m really excited about the future of chat 📟</p>



<p><strong>Eric Migicovsky</strong></p>



<p>Beeper CEO → Automattic Head of Messaging<br></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are thrilled to announce the preview of Explore Logs, a new way to browse your logs without writing LogQL. In this post, we’ll cover why we built Explore Logs and we’ll dive deeper into some of its features, including at-a-glance breakdowns by label, detected fields, and our new pattern detection. At the end, we’ll tell you how you can try Explore Logs for yourself today.</p><p>But let’s start from the beginning — with good old LogQL.</p><h2 id="we-love-logql">We love LogQL</h2><p>Grafana Loki, Grafana Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/grafana/loki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source log aggregation project</a>, provides a powerful query language called <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2022/05/12/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-logql/">LogQL</a>. Site reliability engineers (SREs) and other Loki experts love to use it to filter logs for specific keywords, reduce noise by selecting specific labels, and perform other operations to get answers to understand their systems.</p><p>Metrics can be created from logs, which are put into dashboards to visualize key insights. Alerts can be set up and wired into <a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/irm/">Grafana Incident Response &amp; Management</a> (IRM), which includes <a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/oncall/">Grafana OnCall</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/incident/">Grafana Incident,</a> so you can make sure you get early warnings when things go wrong.</p><p>Those same queries can be used to power <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/">Grafana dashboard visualizations</a> so you can make sense of your logs. LogQL is really powerful! There’s just one catch …</p><h2 id="but-i-dont-know-logql">‘But I don’t know LogQL!’</h2><p>If you aren’t digging into your logs every day, you might not have had a reason to learn LogQL. Perhaps you dive in now and again, or maybe only during an incident. And even in those moments, having to remember the details of a query language can slow down response times.&nbsp;</p><p>The point is, you come to your logs platform not because you love logs, but because you <em>need</em> logs to do your job. Whether you need them to see a deployment go smoothly, to investigate a latency issue, or to deal with a 4 a.m. page, the last thing you want to do is wrestle with yet another query language.&nbsp;</p><p>If only you could take advantage of all the great benefits Loki + Grafana provides, without needing to learn LogQL. Well, you guessed it: Now you can!</p><h2 id="introducing-explore-logs-a-new-oss-application">Introducing Explore Logs, a new OSS application</h2><p>Explore Logs is our new OSS application that lets you browse your logs as if they were already neatly organized for you in advance. You can find <a href="https://github.com/grafana/explore-logs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the source code on GitHub</a>, but before you head there to try it, allow us to give you a quick tour.</p><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/explore-logs.gif" itemprop="contentUrl"><img src="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/explore-logs.gif" alt="A GIF showing how to use Explore Logs in Grafana"></a></figure><p>When you come into Explore Logs (in the navigation, head over to <strong>Explore</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong>), you are presented with a list of detected services or apps. Engineers no longer have to fight with teams across the organization to standardize on one convention. Instead, we embrace the chaos.</p><p>Services are presented along with their log volumes and a preview of recent log lines, so you can see, at a glance, which services are the most chatty and what kinds of logs they are emitting.</p><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/recent-log-lines.png" itemprop="contentUrl"><img src="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/recent-log-lines.png" alt="Service log volumes and a preview of recent log lines" data-src="/media/blog/explore-logs/recent-log-lines.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t see the service you are looking for? Simply search for it with the search bar (plain text search, not LogQL).</p><p>As if automatic service detection wasn’t enough, things start to get really interesting when you select a service.</p><h2 id="how-to-breakdown-logs-in-a-service">How to breakdown logs in a service&nbsp;</h2><p>Explore Logs provides tools to further visualize and breakdown a service’s logs by labels, detected fields, and patterns, all while making sure the log lines themselves are always just a click away.</p><ul><li><strong>Labels</strong> are key-value pairs that can be attached to log lines, for example: <code>level=error</code>, <code>environment=prod</code>, <code>app=nginx</code>, <code>team=loki</code></li><li><strong>Detected fields</strong> contain structured key-value pairs extracted automatically from a log line at query time.</li><li><strong>Patterns</strong> are templates automatically derived from the log stream, used to match lines of the same type. New innovations here have led to some powerful capabilities described below.</li></ul><p>Let’s explore (get it?) each of these in turn, and see how Explore Logs makes it easier than ever to make use of these features.</p><h3 id="labels">Labels</h3><p>In Loki, <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/">labels</a> are key-value pairs that are used to organize and identify log streams. Labels are attached to log streams to help users query, filter, and aggregate logs efficiently. They are similar to tags or metadata in other logging systems.</p><p>Explore Logs creates a log volume chart for each label, allowing you to easily see which are the most active.</p><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/labels.png" itemprop="contentUrl"><img src="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/labels.png" alt="Log volume charts for each label in Loki" data-src="/media/blog/explore-logs/labels.png"></a></figure><p>Selecting a label shows you a breakdown of the logs per value. For example, log level is broken down into debug, info, warning, error, and critical.</p><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/logs-per-value.png" itemprop="contentUrl"><img src="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/logs-per-value.png" alt="Logs-per-value panels in Loki" data-src="/media/blog/explore-logs/logs-per-value.png"></a></figure><p>Selecting a value applies the filter (by writing LogQL for you in the background) and immediately jumps to a curated view showing the relevant log lines.</p><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/curated-view.png" itemprop="contentUrl"><img src="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/curated-view.png" alt="A curated view of log lines" data-src="/media/blog/explore-logs/curated-view.png"></a></figure><h3 id="detected-fields">Detected fields</h3><p>Detected fields in Loki refer to fields that are automatically extracted from log messages when they’re ingested. Loki doesn’t index the content of log lines, but it can parse and extract fields from logs at query time. This feature allows users to query logs more efficiently by using these fields without the need to label every possible attribute as labels, which could be costly and inefficient.</p><p>Explore Logs offers a seamless experience when dealing with detected metadata. A selection of the fields is automatically broken out into a grid view, and you can filter the logs down from there.</p><p>To the end user, the mechanics work nearly identically when working with labels and detected fields, reducing the cognitive overhead of having to remember which is which (and the query syntax associated with each one).</p><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/detected-fields.png" itemprop="contentUrl"><img src="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/detected-fields.png" alt="Detected field panels in Loki" data-src="/media/blog/explore-logs/detected-fields.png"></a></figure><h3 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h3><p>Loki extracts log patterns, which helps you understand the different types of log lines produced by your services. Pattern extraction occurs after filtering. For best results, we recommend that you first filter by known values (such as labels, detected fields, and time range) to narrow down the search space and make patterns more useful.</p><p>You can use pattern matching to:</p><ol><li>Understand the kinds of log lines produced by your systems</li><li>Hide noisy or irrelevant lines to quickly narrow down on what’s important</li><li>Focus on specific trends or anomalies by filtering for log lines matching one or more of the patterns</li></ol><p>Explore Logs lets you easily add multiple patterns to your filters, which will include log lines matching any of the selected patterns. You can also exclude a pattern to hide that kind of log line.</p><h4 id="example-use-case-for-pattern-matching">Example use case for pattern matching&nbsp;</h4><p>Say you’re looking for errors among a lot of HTTP traffic logs. It can be tough to spot the individual lines you’re looking for. With patterns, you can simply mute the offending lines by excluding lines of that type at the click of a button.</p><p>Consider the example log lines below. You can clearly see two distinct patterns:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>code=200 method=get path=/page1 trace_id=123
code=500 method=post path=/page2 trace_id=124
err: code=500 msg=”db connection error” trace_id=124
code=201 method=post path=/page2 trace_id=125
code=200 method=get path=/page1 trace_id=126
code=500 method=post path=/page2 trace_id=127
err: code=500 msg=”db connection error” trace_id=127
code=200 method=get path=/page2 trace_id=128
code=200 method=get path=/page2 trace_id=129
code=500 method=post path=/page2 trace_id=130
err: code=500 msg=”db connection error” trace_id=130</code></pre></div><p>The first pattern describes the HTTP requests:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>code=&lt;_&gt; method=&lt;_&gt; path=/&lt;_&gt; trace_id=&lt;_&gt;</code></pre></div><p>And the second pattern describes the error lines:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>err: code=&lt;_&gt; msg=”&lt;_&gt;” trace_id=&lt;_&gt;</code></pre></div><p>The values are stripped away, leaving only string constants and LogQL placeholders that make up the template, or pattern.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Did you know?</strong> In <a href="https://github.com/grafana/loki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loki 3.0</a>, you can use <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/query/#pattern-match-filter-operators">pattern filters</a> in place of RegExp for a faster query time.</p></blockquote><h2 id="what-else-can-you-do-with-explore-logs">What else can you do with Explore Logs?</h2><p>In addition to everything we’ve already covered, there are a few other notable Explore Logs features to call out:</p><h3 id="search">Search</h3><p>Maybe LogQL is hard, but text search is not. Plain text, case-sensitive search of your rendered log lines can come in handy when you’ve narrowed your search far enough.</p><h3 id="copy-url">Copy URL</h3><p>Easily share your current Explore Logs context with a teammate, to help troubleshoot in a team environment.</p><h3 id="open-in-explore">Open in Explore&nbsp;</h3><p>Is there a feature in Explore that you really like that doesn’t exist in Explore Logs yet? Would LogQL be really helpful for you at this point? Easily jump into <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/">Explore</a> — our UI for data exploration of hundreds of data sources, including Loki — while preserving your current context.</p><h2 id="how-explore-logs-works">How Explore Logs works</h2><p>We can probably agree this looks really cool, and it’s a pretty different experience from Explore. But, how can it actually help developers?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, how does solving observability problems faster sound? Faster to close that P1, faster to know what hotfix to push to prod, faster back to bed. Let’s show you how.</p><p>Suppose you need to identify a misbehaving pod in one of your services. You can certainly get that information using LogQL and Explore — construct a LogQL metrics query that counts errors by service, and see which one pops up. But is it the <em>easiest</em> way?</p><p>Not anymore! Now you can:</p><ul><li>Start by selecting your service</li><li>Select the <code>level</code> label selector, then add <code>level=error</code> to your filter criteria</li><li>Select the <code>pod</code> label selector, then see all impacted pods and their error rates</li><li>With just one more click, see the log lines associated with these pods</li></ul><p>Just a handful of clicks, with visual cues at each step of the way and —&nbsp;once more with feeling — <em>without writing LogQL</em>.</p><h2 id="special-thanks">Special thanks</h2><p>Explore Logs was the result of shared empathy, creativity, and hard work.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>At Google, we constantly push the boundaries of computing, exploring what is possible for grand challenges ranging from information retrieval, global video distribution, and of course generative AI. Doing so requires rethinking systems design in deep collaboration with service developers. This rethinking has resulted in our significant investment in custom silicon. Today, we are thrilled to announce the latest incarnation of this work: Google Axion Processors, our first custom Arm®</span><span>-based CPUs designed for the data center. Axion delivers industry-leading performance and energy efficiency and will be available to Google Cloud customers later this year.</span></p></span></section><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_Ab4940U.max-2000x2000.jpg" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_Ab4940U.max-2000x2000.jpg" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Run general-purpose workloads on C4A for exceptional performance, energy-efficiency and advanced capabilities.</p></span></p></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>Axion is but the latest in a long line of custom Google silicon. Since 2015 we’ve released five generations of Tensor Processing Units (TPU); in 2018 we released our first Video Coding Unit (VCU), achieving up to </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3445814.3446723" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>33x</span></a><span> more efficiency for video transcoding; </span><span>in 2021, we </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-past-present-and-future-of-custom-compute-at-google?e=48754805"><span>doubled-down</span></a><span> on custom compute by investing in “system on a chip” (SoC) designs, and released the </span><a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>first of three generations</span></a><span> of Tensor chips for mobile devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While our investments in compute accelerators have transformed our customers’ capabilities, general-purpose compute is and will remain a critical portion of our customers’ workloads. Analytics, information retrieval, and ML training and serving all require a huge amount of compute power. Customers and users who wish to maximize performance, reduce infrastructure costs, and meet sustainability goals have found that the rate of CPU improvements has slowed recently. Amdahl’s Law suggests that as accelerators continue to improve, general purpose compute will dominate the cost and limit the capability of our infrastructure unless we make commensurate investments to keep up.</span></p>
<p><span>Axion processors combine Google’s silicon expertise with Arm’s highest performing CPU cores to deliver instances with up to </span><span>30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances available in the cloud today, up to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based instances<sup>1</sup>.</span><span> </span><span>That’s why we’ve already started deploying Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine, and the YouTube Ads platform on current generation Arm-based servers and plan to deploy and scale these services and more on Axion soon.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Unrivaled performance and efficiency, underpinned by Titanium</strong></h3>
<p><span>Built using the Arm Neoverse</span><span><span>™</span></span><span> V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant leaps in performance </span><span>for general-purpose workloads like web and app servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training and inferencing, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Axion is underpinned b</span><span>y </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/titanium?e=48754805"><span>Titanium</span></a><span>, a system of</span><span> purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads</span><span>. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads storage I/O processing to </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/hyperdisks"><span>Hyperdisk</span></a><span>, our new block storage service that decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically provisioned in real time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>“Google’s announcement of the new Axion CPU marks a significant milestone in delivering custom silicon that is optimized for Google’s infrastructure, and built on our high-performance Arm Neoverse V2 platform. Decades of ecosystem investment, combined with Google’s ongoing innovation and open-source software contributions ensure the best experience for the workloads that matter most to customers running on Arm everywhere."</em> - Rene Haas, CEO, Arm</p>
<p><span>Beyond performance, customers want to operate more efficiently and meet their sustainability goals. </span><span>Google Cloud data centers are already 1.5X more efficient than the industry average and deliver 3X more computing power with the same amount of electrical power compared with five years ago<sup>2</sup>.</span><span> </span><span>We’ve set ambitious </span><a href="https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>goals</span></a><span> to </span><span>operate our offices, campuses, and data centers on carbon-free energy, 24/7</span><span>, and offer </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint"><span>tools</span></a><span> to help you report on carbon emissions. With Axion processors, customers can optimize for even more energy-efficiency.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Axion - out-of-the-box application compatibility and interoperability</strong></h3>
<p><span>Google also has a rich history of contributions to the Arm ecosystem. We built and open sourced Android, Kubernetes, Tensorflow and the Go language, and worked closely with Arm and industry partners to optimize them for the Arm architecture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Axion is built on the standard Armv9 architecture and instruction set. Most recently, we contributed to SystemReady Virtual Environment (VE), Arm’s hardware and firmware interoperability standard that ensures common operating systems and software packages can seamlessly run on Arm-based servers and VMs, making it easier for customers to deploy Arm workloads on Google Cloud with limited-if-any code rewrites. Through this collaboration, we’re accessing an ecosystem of tens of thousands of cloud customers already deploying workloads and leveraging Arm-native software from hundreds of ISVs and open-source projects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Customers will be able to use Axion in many Google Cloud services including Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow, Cloud Batch, and more.&nbsp; Arm-compatible software and solutions are now available on the </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en"><span>Google Cloud Marketplace</span></a><span>, and we've recently launched preview support for Arm-based instances migration in the </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/migrate/virtual-machines"><span>Migrate to Virtual Machines</span></a><span> service.</span></p>

<p dir="auto">On March 1, 2021 Nintendo released Wii U firmware version <a href="https://wiiubrew.org/wiki/5.5.5" rel="nofollow">5.5.5</a>. This update updated the Wii U's SSL verification and recompiled all RPLs (though no code changes were made). The exact purpose for this update is unknown, as nothing of significance was changed, and no other changes were made in this update. With the changes to SSL verification, Nintendo introduced a bug which allows for the forging of SSL certificates. These forged certificates will be seen as "Nintendo Signed" and, due to an existing bug with how the Wii U handles CA common names, will be accepted by all domains.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The bugs</h2><a id="user-content-the-bugs" aria-label="Permalink: The bugs" href="#the-bugs"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are 2 bugs at play:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Normally a CA common name does not accept a single wildcard (*) value. They must contain a hostname, and optionally one or many wildcards for subdomains. The Wii U will accept a single * wildcard in place of a hostname, which allows the CA to be accepted as any domain. This bug has existed since before 5.5.5, but was not useful until now.</li>
<li>As of 5.5.5, CA's crafted in a specific way may take a newly introduced alternate path for verification. This allows for a CA's signature to not be verified correctly. Instead, the Wii U simply checks if the CA matches one already known by the system, but not the signature or contents of the CA. We have no idea why this change was made, as it does not benefit Nintendo at all. It almost feels intentional.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exploiting</h2><a id="user-content-exploiting" aria-label="Permalink: Exploiting" href="#exploiting"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Not any CA will work. There are 3 conditions for a CA which still need to be met even for a forged CA to be accepted:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The CA needs to be one which the Wii U would already accept. The signature is not validated in this case, so modifying an existing CA works.</li>
<li>The Wii U does not allow a Root CA in the cert chain. It will ignore any certs that have a matching subject and authority key.</li>
<li>The title must not roll it's own SSL. WebKit titles such as the eShop, Miiverse, TVii, etc, as well as any game which uses it's own SSL library, will not work with these certificates.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to exploit this bug is to use the Nintendo CA - G3 CA, and is what this script opts to do. This can be dumped from a Wii U's SSL certificates title at <code>/storage_mlc/sys/title/0005001b/10054000/content/scerts/CACERT_NINTENDO_CA_G3.der</code>. Changing the public key to a user-controlled key and changing the authority key identifier to anything else is all that is required. The resulting user-controlled private key and patched CA can be used to bypass SSL verification without any homebrew or CFW at all.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The script</h2><a id="user-content-the-script" aria-label="Permalink: The script" href="#the-script"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This script takes in a PEM encoded copy of Nintendo CA - G3 and does the above patches and exports the patched CA and private key.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/" rel="nofollow">NodeJS</a></li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/SSSL</code></li>
<li><code>cd SSSL</code></li>
<li><code>npm i</code> to install the dependencies</li>
<li><code>node patch</code> to run the patching wizard</li>

That’s the argument of former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who became famous trying to defend debt-laden Greece from its German creditors. Varoufakis has never quite regained the notoriety of 2015. But he has remained a prominent left-wing voice. After a failed campaign for a seat in the European Parliament in 2019, he plans to run again this June. This time, his adversary isn’t Berlin or the banks. It’s the tech companies he accuses of warping the economy while turning people against one other.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span>Courtesy of Penguin Random House</span></p></figure></div><p>Varoufakis is also a prolific author; his 17th book, written as a letter to his techno-curious father, chronicles the evolution of capitalism from the 1960s advertising boom, through Wall Street in the 1980s, to the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic.

The tech giants are the lords, while everyone else is a peasant, working their land for not much in return.</p><p>To Varoufakis, every time you post on X, formerly Twitter, you’re essentially toiling Elon Musk’s estate like a medieval serf. Musk doesn't pay you. But your free labor pays him, in a sense, by increasing the value of his company. On X, the more active users there are, the more people can be shown advertising or sold subscriptions. On Google Maps, he argues, users improve the product—alerting the system to traffic jams on their route.</p><p>The feudal comparison isn’t novel. But <em>Technofeudalism</em> attempts to introduce the idea to a wider audience. Its US release, launched the month before regulators in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doj-sues-apple-antitrust/">US</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-meta-alphabet-eu-digital-markets-act/">European Union</a> simultaneously initiated antitrust actions against Apple, also had impeccable timing.</p><p>Over Zoom, I spoke to Varoufakis, from his home near Athens, about how the tech giants have changed the economy—and why we should care about it.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong>WIRED: That word, <em>technofeudalism</em>, what does it mean? How is the feudal system relevant here?</strong></p><p><strong>Yanis Varoufakis:</strong> Profit drives capitalism, rent drove feudalism. Now we have moved [from one system to the other] because of this new form of super-duper, all-singing, all-dancing capital: cloud capital, algorithmic capital. If I'm right, that is creating new digital fiefdoms like Amazon.com, like Airbnb, where the main mode of wealth extraction comes in the form not of profit but of rent.</p><p>Take the Apple Store. You are producing an app, Apple can withhold 30 percent of your profits [through a commission fee]. That's a rent. That's like a ground rent. It's a bit like the Apple Store is a fiefdom. It's a cloud fiefdom, and Apple extracts a rent exactly as in feudalism. So my argument is not that we went back from capitalism to feudalism. My argument is that we have progressed forward to a new system, which has many of the characteristics of feudalism, but it is one step ahead of capitalism. To signal that, I added the word <em>techno</em>.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><strong>When you're talking about these digital fiefdoms, the idea is easier to understand in terms of platforms that take a cut of the sales, like the Apple App Store or Amazon. But can you also accuse other platforms of operating these digital fiefs, like Facebook?</strong></p><p>Facebook is a classic cloud fief. It creates cloud capital which is attractive to you, to me, to other people who want to communicate with each other—to find friends, or post their views, or news about their dog or their cat. So you're drawn into this fiefdom, and then the next step for Zuckerberg was to draw into the same fiefdom publishers and advertisers in order to sell them the attention of users. And then immediately after that, as Cory Doctorow so beautifully describes through his concept of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittification</a>, you're a publisher, you feel great because your sales go up through Facebook, and then suddenly, you find that you've been downgraded. And then you have to pay a higher cloud rent in order to be re-upgraded [paying for ads, for example, for customers to find your product]. That’s typical cloud capitalism, producing technofeudalism.</p><p><strong>I understand technofeudalism as affecting three groups of people. Can we boil down who is affected into these groups?</strong></p><p>Yes, and I've given them names. The company that produces the electric bicycles sold on Alibaba or Amazon.com, this is a vassal capitalist. Most of the profit margin for that company is skimmed off by Jeff Bezos [Amazon’s founder and executive chairman] in the form of cloud rent.</p><p>Second is cloud proles, or cloud proletarians. Look at the workers in Amazon warehouses who are monitored by algorithms.</p><p>And the third one is you and me. I call us cloud serfs. Because the parallel with the serfs is that we <em>volunteer</em> free labor. It doesn't matter whether we're enjoying it or not. Every time you upload a video on Tiktok, on Facebook, on Instagram, you're adding to the capital stock of these companies. We are adding to it directly through our labor or our movement or our existence. In that way we're serfs, but we are more than serfs, we’re cloud serfs producing capital. And that has never happened in the history of the world.</p><p><strong>A company like Apple might argue that instead of being a fiefdom, maybe the Apple App Store is more like a mall where companies have to rent their stores from whomever owns the building. How is technofeudalism different from the mall dynamic?</strong></p><p>Well, hugely. Say you and I were going into partnership together with a fashion brand. We go to the shopping mall and we hire a shop, the rent is fixed. It is not proportional to our sales. The more money we make, the higher our price-to-rent margin. With the Apple Store, they get 30 percent of all sales. That’s not at all the same thing. That is the equivalent of the ground rent that the feudal lord used to extract from vassal capitalists.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><strong>What makes cloud capitalism a worse economic system than capitalism?</strong></p><p>The first thing is from a macroeconomic perspective. When you have such a large sum of money extracted in the form of cloud rent, that money disappears from a circular flow of income. According to my calculations, between 35 and 40 percent of GDP is being siphoned off the circular flow of income by cloud rent, and that means there is less money in the economy. Investment is low, and that means less good, quality jobs in the rest of the economy.</p><p>The second reason is that this cloud capital is designed to reproduce itself through our attention and through our free labor. And platforms discovered that we spend more time doing this, producing free cloud capital for the owners of cloud capital, if we're angry. So algorithms are primed to poison our conversations. That is highly detrimental to our democracies because consensus is really bad for cloud capital. It doesn't want it. It wants you and me to be angry and shouting at each other.</p><p>Now, as a professor, I have noticed the effect on kids in universities in Britain, in Australia, here in Greece, in America. I find that students today are too scared of having a face-to-face conversation. They want a safe space. They do not want any challenging ideas to be presented to them in class. They protest, they will have you thrown out of university if you say something that upsets them, about anything. But give them a phone and they become toxic and ballistic. Now, that is no way of running a democracy or a civilized society for that matter.</p><p><strong>People have already expressed dissatisfaction with capitalism in various protest movements across Europe. Why should they care that there's been a shift to a slightly different system that's dominated by a slightly different kind of company?</strong></p><p>Ordinary people need to know the reasons behind the discontent. The discontented always ask: Why is this happening? Giving them an answer, in a way that makes sense to them, is hugely empowering. This is the foundation of any possibility of democracy. Because to have democracy, it's not enough to be able to vote every four or five years. You need people who understand what is going on, who are informed about the causes of their discontent. Because if they don't understand the causes of their discontent, then it's easy for them to fall prey to xenophobia, to misogyny, to racism. Then they can say, it’s the Jew. It's the Muslim. It's the foreigner. It's the Brit. It's the German, whatever. Then people latch on to simple solutions, which is the beginning of fascism.</p><p><strong>Are we at the beginning of fascism? And if so, is that really technofeudalism’s fault?</strong></p><p>I think that fascism is already on the rise. In France almost <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220425-victory-in-defeat-le-pen-raises-far-right-s-glass-ceiling-fails-to-crack-it">45 percent</a> of the population are supporting a neofascist [Marine Le Pen]. In Italy, we have a neofascist prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. That was not the doing of technofeudalism, because technofeudalism came later. What happened is, the rise of cloud capital and the siphoning off of money from the circular flow of income increases the discontent within people. At the same time you have the algorithms which make money and accumulate cloud capital to the extent that we hate one another. Hate is the fuel of facism. So if you blend discontent, the fact that most people can’t make ends meet, and you throw in there the hatred that is reinforced by the algorithms, that's fascism.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><strong>So if we have this new system that is fueling a new fascism, then what should we do about it?</strong></p><p>Well, many things. But to begin with, let's understand where we are, so we don't blame the foreigners. We don't blame women. We don't blame trans people. A little bit of knowledge goes a long way towards recreating the circumstances for a decent conversation between us.</p><p>In economic terms, we need to introduce a cloud tax immediately. Tax Amazon 5 percent for every transaction that takes place on its platform. Then, introduce a capacity for you and me to own a digital identity so we don't need Google or Facebook to vouch for who we are on the internet. Having a state-issued digital identity will go a long way towards restoring or handing you property rights over your data, because at the moment you do not own your data.</p><p>You can introduce interoperability. I am on X. I can't go to Bluesky. Let's say that Elon Musk decides to block me because I said something he didn't like. He has blocked me before for a couple of weeks. Now, I have more than a million followers on X. I cannot leave without losing them. If I go to Bluesky, I have 10 followers. Interoperability would mean that if I go to another platform, to Bluesky, when I post something on Bluesky, then my 1 million followers on X can hear it.</p><p><strong>It’s interesting you mention interoperability, because that’s one of the proposals in the EU's Digital Markets Act, which feels like it’s at least trying to get at some of the problems you've outlined. Do you think it goes far enough?</strong></p><p>No, it certainly doesn't go far enough. There are some interesting ideas in there, like interoperability. But nobody in government is actually working on this. This is my problem. Not that it is a hard task, but there is nobody working on it, because they don't care. They are all in the pockets of the big technofeudal lords, as I call them.</p><p><strong>So if you believe no one in government is doing anything, how do you move forward from that?</strong></p><p>That's a very good question. I have no idea. But this is why—against my spirit, against my preferences and my desires—I'm still in politics, because there is no alternative to politics.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h5>April 9, 2024</h5><p>This post is a continuation of my journey to build a complete computer system using discrete logic components. At this point I have made a computer capable of running network applications like an HTTP server or a LAN game.</p><p>Last year I built <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/eth-to-spi">a physical level adapter</a> which converts a 10BASE-T Ethernet signal to SPI and back. Back then I used an STM32 microcontroller to test its operation, now I’m implementing a MAC layer module to connect it to my <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/ccpu">homebrew computer</a>.</p><p>Both adapters are full-duplex and have independent transmitter and receiver parts.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/overview-eth.jpg" alt="Discrete logic computer">
<em>Complete computer. The new module is bottom-right.</em></p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/eth.jpg" alt="ETH MAC adapter">
<em>The new module with PHY shield removed. Bodge wires fix swapped SCK and MOSI.</em></p><h2 id="receiver">Receiver
<a href="#receiver">#</a></h2><p>Summary of receiver operation:</p><ul><li>SPI serial data is converted to bytewise parallel data, byte clock is extracted;</li><li>First 6 bytes are checked against destination MAC address criteria, unmatched frames are rejected;</li><li>Bytes are written into a static RAM buffer;</li><li>When a frame ends, receiver is disabled and further frames are rejected until user re-arms the receiver. Byte counter is stopped, its value is made accessible to the user.</li></ul><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_check_sequence">FCS</a> is not checked in hardware.</p><h3 id="data-collection">Data collection
<a href="#data-collection">#</a></h3><p>Firstly, serial SPI data needs to be converted into a stream of bytes.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/receiver.png" alt="Receiver"></p><p>Serial data is shifted into a shift register (<code>U32</code>). <code>U30</code> and <code>U31</code> count bits and bytes respectively. Static RAM write signal <code>recv_buf_we</code> is formed using a D flip-flop <code>U29B</code>. This signal briefly becomes low after each 8 bits of input data:</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv_buf_we.svg" alt="recv_buf_we"></p><p>Received bytes are written into a 2 kB static RAM buffer 6116 (<code>U20</code>).</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv-buffer.png" alt="receiver buffer"></p><p><code>U13</code>, <code>U16</code> and <code>U18</code> form an address multiplexer: it chooses either byte counter or system address bus as an address input for the SRAM (<code>U20</code>). A tri-state buffer <code>U21</code> forwards the received byte into the RAM.</p><p>To access the received data and its length, RAM and byte counter are connected to the system data bus with tri-state buffers:</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv-output.png" alt="receiver output"></p><p><code>U25</code> connects the receiver RAM with the system data bus. After a frame is complete, the byte counter is not reset and its value is kept on the <code>recv_byte_cnt</code> bus. This bus is connected with the system data bus using <code>U26</code> and <code>U27</code>. They are activated when CPU makes a read request to specific addresses. The other half of <code>U27</code> makes a two-bit read-only status register which is used to query receiver and transmitter status.</p><h3 id="mac-address-filtering">MAC address filtering
<a href="#mac-address-filtering">#</a></h3><p>When analyzing the Ethernet traffic I noticed that frames usually come in small groups (3-4 frames together separated by a short delay). Frames in one group usually have different destination MAC addresses. This made me think that my computer won’t be able to filter received frames by MAC and re-arm the receiver fast enough to catch the frames meant for itself. I needed a hardware MAC address filtering.</p><p>Storing a custom MAC address somewhere and then comparing first 6 received bytes against it is a no-go: too complex. I could also make it a repetition of a single byte (e.g. FE:FE:FE:FE:FE:FE), but that’s boring. To bring some variation to my MAC, I made it a function of the byte index:</p><ul><li>Bit 0 is fixed to 0;</li><li>Bit 1 is fixed to 1;</li><li>Bits 2-4 are an inversion of the byte index;</li><li>Bits 5-7 are fixed to 1.</li></ul><p>Using this rule, the MAC address comes out to be <code>FE:FA:F6:F2:EE:EA</code>. We also need to accept the broadcast MAC <code>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</code> to work with ARP.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/mac-filter.png" alt="MAC filter"></p><p>On this schematics, bus <code>a[0..3]</code> is the lower 4 bits of the byte counter. Bus <code>d[0..7]</code> is the received byte. <code>U33</code> compares data bits 0 and 2-4 with their desired values, the output of <code>U34A</code> will be high when those bits match. <code>U35A</code> implements the broadcast MAC check: its output will be high when bits 0 and 2-4 are all ones. Those two signals are combined with a logical OR (implemented with diodes <code>D7</code> and resistor <code>R6</code>). The remaining bits are checked for being all ones with <code>U35B</code>.</p><p>This block only checks the validity of a single byte. To check all six of them, the result is accumulated in <code>U10A</code>. When no frame is being received, <code>ss</code> (the incoming SPI slave select signal) is low and <code>U10A</code> is set to 1. During frame reception this value is updated for each received byte. If destination MAC address matches the criteria, the value of <code>U10A</code> stays high. When byte address reaches 5, the final value is latched into <code>U36B</code>. Its output is used to inhibit frame reception if destination address is unmatched.</p><h2 id="transmitter">Transmitter
<a href="#transmitter">#</a></h2><p>Similarly to the receiver, the transmitter doesn’t implement FCS generation, it is done in software. To simplify the transmitter even further, I decided to only support frames of a fixed length. This way no complex digital comparator is necessary, the frame transmission logic only depends on a single bit of the byte counter. I selected the frame length to be 1024 bytes, this is close to the usual MTU of 1500 bytes. The frame preamble (the sequence of several 0x55 ending with a 0xD5 required by 10BASE-T) is also included in those 1024 bytes and needs to be loaded there in software.</p><p>Fixing the frame length doesn’t have any effect on higher-level protocols because they encode the packet size in their headers and do not rely on the actual Ethernet frame length.</p><p>Summary of transmitter operation:</p><ul><li>Data is stored in a static RAM;</li><li>20 MHz clock is fed to a 4-bit counter, its overflow output is used as a byte clock;</li><li>To transmit a frame, user writes to a specific write-only memory location which enables the counter;</li><li>Parallel byte data is serialized using a shift register.</li></ul><h3 id="counters">Counters
<a href="#counters">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/tx-counters.png" alt="tx counters"></p><p>Same as in the receiver, two counters are used to count bits (<code>U12</code>) and bytes (<code>U14</code>). First counter is fed by a 20 MHz clock from an integrated oscillator. 20 MHz is not used directly, but only divided at least by 2. This way the duty cycle of the oscillator doesn’t affect the output signal.</p><h3 id="data-flow">Data flow
<a href="#data-flow">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/tx-dataflow.png" alt="tx data flow"></p><p>Same as in the receiver three 74HC157 multiplexors (not shown here) are used to select address input for the RAM (<code>U22</code>). <code>U23</code> is used to load data into the RAM. <code>U24</code> acts as an intermediate storage for the byte currently being transmitted. The idea here is similar to my <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/vga/#image-generation">VGA pipeline</a>: byte counter 74HC4040 is a ripple counter and is slow to stabilize, <code>U24</code> provides a stable output while RAM output is still invalid. This data is fed to the shift register <code>U28</code> and shifted bit-by-bit.</p><p><em>After I’d built the thing I noticed that I’d messed up the order of bits coming from the RAM to the shift register. I had to shuffle bits in software to workaround this hardware bug. This was something I couldn’t test in Verilog beforehand.</em></p><p>To form a nice 10BASE-T signal (see <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/eth-to-spi/#transmitter">my previous post</a>) <code>MOSI</code> and <code>SCK</code> should be precisely synchronized. <code>U11A</code> and <code>U8B</code> achieve that. <code>tx_cnt0</code> (bit 0 of the bit counter, 20 MHz divided by 2) is used as a clock. <code>U11A</code> changes its output in sync with this signal. <code>U8B</code> delays the clock to match the delay introduced by <code>U11A</code>. Because a D-latch is more complex than a simple AND gate and has a slightly larger (by 5 ns) delay, a faster 74LV74A is used here. Its propagation delay is the same as of 74HC08. This is the only chip of a “fast” family on this board.</p><h2 id="cpu-interface">CPU interface
<a href="#cpu-interface">#</a></h2><p>From the programmer’s point of view, my Ethernet adapter has following interface:</p><ul><li>Both frame buffers are mapped at <code>0xF000</code>.</li><li>There are two read-only registers:<ul><li>8-bit status register at <code>0xFB00</code> has two flags:<ul><li><code>RX_FULL</code> - a frame is received,</li><li><code>TX_BUSY</code> - a frame is being transmitted;</li></ul></li><li>16-bit received data length register at <code>0xFB02</code>.</li></ul></li><li>Writing any value at <code>0xFB00</code> re-arms the receiver.</li><li>Writing any value at <code>0xFB01</code> starts a transmission.</li></ul><p>There are no interrupts since my CPU doesn’t support them.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/addr-select.png" alt="address selector"></p><p>Any relevant address starts with an <code>F</code> (upper 4 bits are all ones). This condition is checked by <code>U2A</code>.</p><p>Bit 11 should be 0 for a buffer address. <code>U1D</code>, <code>D2</code>, <code>R2</code> and <code>U1E</code> check that. Then the buffer select signal is combined with either write- or output-enable signals to select writing to the TX buffer or reading from the RX buffer.</p><p>Second hex digit being <code>B</code> (1011) for registers is checked by <code>U1B</code> and <code>U2B</code>. Then another diode logic block (<code>D1</code>, <code>R1</code>, <code>U1C</code>) combines it with the first digit check. Decoders <code>U4A</code> and <code>U4B</code> are used to select the individual function.</p><p>Two LEDs indicate buffer or register access.</p><h2 id="programming">Programming
<a href="#programming">#</a></h2><p>I wanted a network support for my computer, but didn’t want to implement a TCP/IP stack myself. Also I wanted a decent C compiler because my first compiler sucked and programming in assembly is annoying. So I made a <a href="https://github.com/imihajlow/ccpu-cc">C compiler</a>. It is mature enough to compile uIP 1.0 (a tiny TCP/IP library). Despite my CPU having awfully low code density, uIP is small enough to fit into RAM and have some place left for an actual application.</p><p>Network performance is very low, but I’m still very happy with it considering that no commercial CPUs or special chips are involved here:</p><ul><li>Ping round trip average 85 ms;</li><li>HTTP server download speed 2.6 kB/s (serving static files from the SD card).</li></ul><h2 id="project-repository">Project repository

<p><em>Those of you who haven’t been in IT for far, far too long might not know that next month will be the 16th(!) anniversary of the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-1571-1">disclosure</a> of what was, at the time, a fairly earth-shattering revelation: that for about 18 months, the Debian OpenSSL package was <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166">generating entirely predictable private keys</a>.</em></p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor">xz-stential threat</a> (thanks to <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@nixCraft@mastodon.social">@nixCraft</a> for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@nixCraft/112219225728684695">making me aware of that one</a>), has got me thinking about my own serendipitous interaction with a major vulnerability.
Given that the statute of limitations has (probably) run out, I thought I’d share it as a tale of how “huh, that’s weird” can be a powerful threat-hunting tool – but only if you’ve got the time to keep pulling at the thread.</p>

<h2 id="prelude-to-an-adventure">Prelude to an Adventure</h2>

<p>Our story begins back in March 2008.
I was working at Engine Yard (EY), a now largely-forgotten Rails-focused hosting company, which pioneered several advances in Rails application deployment.
Probably EY’s greatest claim to lasting fame is that they helped launch a little code hosting platform you might have heard of, by providing them free infrastructure when they were little more than a glimmer in the Internet’s eye.</p>

<p>I am, of course, talking about everyone’s favourite Microsoft product: GitHub.</p>

<p>Since GitHub was in the right place, at the right time, with a compelling product offering, they quickly started to gain traction, and grow their userbase.
With growth comes challenges, amongst them the one we’re focusing on today: SSH login times.
Then, as now, GitHub provided SSH access to the git repos they hosted, by SSHing to <code>git@github.com</code> with publickey authentication.
They were using the standard way that everyone manages SSH keys: the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file, and that became a problem as the number of keys started to grow.</p>

<p>The way that SSH uses this file is that, when a user connects and asks for publickey authentication, SSH opens the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file and scans all of the keys listed in it, looking for a key which matches the key that the user presented.
This linear search is normally not a huge problem, because nobody in their right mind puts more than a few keys in their <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, right?</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/images/2008_github_auth_keys_sideeye.jpg" alt="2008-era GitHub giving monkey puppet side-eye to the idea that nobody stores many keys in an authorized_keys file">
</figure>

<p>Of course, as a popular, rapidly-growing service, GitHub was gaining users at a fair clip, to the point that the one big file that stored all the SSH keys was starting to visibly impact SSH login times.
This problem was also not going to get any better by itself.
Something Had To Be Done.</p>

<p>EY management was keen on making sure GitHub ran well, and so despite it not <em>really</em> being a hosting problem, they were willing to help fix this problem.
For some reason, the late, great, Ezra Zygmuntowitz pointed GitHub in my direction, and let me take the time to <em>really</em> get into the problem with the GitHub team.
After examining a variety of different possible solutions, we came to the conclusion that the least-worst option was to patch OpenSSH to lookup keys in a MySQL database, indexed on the key fingerprint.</p>

<p>We didn’t take this decision on a whim – it wasn’t a case of “yeah, sure, let’s just hack around with OpenSSH, what could possibly go wrong?”.
We knew it was potentially catastrophic if things went sideways, so you can imagine how much worse the other options available were.
Ensuring that this wouldn’t compromise security was a lot of the effort that went into the change.
In the end, though, we rolled it out in early April, and lo! SSH logins were fast, and we were pretty sure we wouldn’t have to worry about this problem for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Normally, you’d think “patching OpenSSH to make mass SSH logins super fast” would be a good story on its own.
But no, this is just the opening scene.</p>

<h2 id="chekovs-gun-makes-its-appearance">Chekov’s Gun Makes its Appearance</h2>

<p>Fast forward a little under a month, to the first few days of May 2008.
I get a message from one of the GitHub team, saying that <em>somehow</em> users were able to access other users’ repos over SSH.
Naturally, as we’d recently rolled out the OpenSSH patch, which touched <em>this very thing</em>, the code I’d written was suspect number one, so I was called in to help.</p>

</figure>

<p>Eventually, after more than a little debugging, we discovered that, somehow, there were two users with keys that had the same key fingerprint.
This <em>absolutely</em> shouldn’t happen – it’s a bit like winning the lottery twice in a row<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/#fn:1">1</a></sup> – unless the users had somehow shared their keys with each other, of course.
Still, it was worth investigating, just in case it was a web application bug, so the GitHub team reached out to the users impacted, to try and figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>The users professed no knowledge of each other, neither admitted to publicising their key, and couldn’t offer any explanation as to how the other person could possibly have gotten their key.</p>

<p>Then things went from “weird” to “what the…?”.
Because <em>another</em> pair of users showed up, sharing a key fingerprint – but it was a <em>different</em> shared key fingerprint.
The odds now have gone from “winning the lottery multiple times in a row” to as close to “this literally cannot happen” as makes no difference.</p>

</figure>

<p>Once we were really, <em>really</em> confident that the OpenSSH patch wasn’t the cause of the problem, my involvement in the problem basically ended.
I wasn’t a GitHub employee, and EY had plenty of other customers who needed my help, so I wasn’t able to stay deeply involved in the on-going investigation of The Mystery of the Duplicate Keys.</p>

<p>However, the GitHub team did keep talking to the users involved, and managed to determine the only apparent common factor was that all the users claimed to be using Debian or Ubuntu systems, which was where their SSH keys would have been generated.</p>

<p>That was as far as the investigation had really goten, when along came May 13, 2008.</p>

<h2 id="chekovs-gun-goes-off">Chekov’s Gun Goes Off</h2>

<p>With the publication of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-1571-1">DSA-1571-1</a>, everything suddenly became clear.
Through a well-meaning but ultimately disasterous cleanup of OpenSSL’s randomness generation code, the Debian maintainer had inadvertently reduced the number of possible keys that could be generated by a given user from “bazillions” to a little over 32,000.
With so many people signing up to GitHub – some of them no doubt following best practice and freshly generating a separate key – it’s unsurprising that some collisions occurred.</p>

<p>You can imagine the sense of “oooooooh, so <em>that’s</em> what’s going on!” that rippled out once the issue was understood.
I was mostly glad that we had conclusive evidence that my OpenSSH patch wasn’t at fault, little knowing how much more contact I was to have with Debian weak keys in the future, running <a href="https://pwnedkeys.com/">a huge store of known-compromised keys</a> and using them to find <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1620772">misbehaving Certificate Authorities</a>, amongst other things.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>While I’ve not found a description of exactly when and how Luciano Bello discovered the vulnerability that became CVE-2008-0166, I presume he first came across it some time before it was disclosed – likely before GitHub tripped over it.
The stable Debian release that included the vulnerable code had been released a year earlier, so there was plenty of time for Luciano to have discovered key collisions and go “hmm, I wonder what’s going on here?”, then keep digging until the solution presented itself.</p>

<p>The thought “hmm, that’s odd”, followed by intense investigation, leading to the discovery of a major flaw is also what ultimately brought down the recent XZ backdoor.
The critical part of that sequence is the ability to <em>do</em> that intense investigation, though.</p>

<p>When I reflect on my brush with the Debian weak keys vulnerability, what sticks out to me is the fact that I <em>didn’t</em> do the deep investigation.
I wonder if Luciano hadn’t found it, how long it might have been before it was found.
The GitHub team would have continued investigating, presumably, and perhaps they (or I) would have eventually dug deep enough to find it.
But we were all super busy – myself, working support tickets at EY, and GitHub feverishly building features and fighting the fires in their rapidly-growing service.</p>

<p>As it was, Luciano <em>was</em> able to take the time to dig in and find out what was happening, but just like the XZ backdoor, I feel like we, as an industry, got a bit lucky that someone with the skills, time, and energy was on hand at the right time to make a huge difference.</p>

<p>It’s a luxury to be able to take the time to really dig into a problem, and it’s a luxury that most of us rarely have.
Perhaps an understated takeaway is that somehow we all need to wrestle back some time to follow our hunches and really dig into the things that make us go “hmm…”.</p>

<hr>
<p>OAKLAND, Calif. — Bay Area Rapid Transit, the 131-mile electrified rail network in the San Francisco Bay Area, is offering the public a last chance to ride the 1970s-era futuristic railcars that made up its original fleet.</p>
<p>On Saturday, April 20, at 1 p.m. at the MacArthur station in Oakland, BART will commemorate the cars with a ceremony and then run two 10-car trains using original cars for the last time. Anyone can ride for the usual fare.</p>
<p>“We understand that BART cars are iconic, especially the sloped-front A cars,” said BART spokesperson Jim Allison. “We just wanted to give them a proper sendoff so that people had a chance to say goodbye to the cars that have been serving the Bay Area for more than 50 years.”</p>
<p>The special trains will run about 24 miles from MacArthur to Fremont, the first segment of BART to open 52 years ago. The trains will make the usual stops and run more loops between the two stations if needed to accommodate everyone who wants to ride, he said.</p>
<p>The “Riding into History: Final Run of the First Fleet” event will include speeches, a raffle for a couple of railcar plates, and probably some merchandise for sale, Allison said. Some details were still being decided early this month.</p>
<p>April 20 is coincidentally the same day when the electric trains of the Key System, a BART predecessor, ran their final miles in 1958.</p>
<p>The legacy fleet ended regular service in September 2023; when that date was set, BART had indicated it would eventually hold a special farewell event [see <a href="https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/bart-to-retire-last-original-cars-on-sept-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“BART to retire last original cars …,”</a> Trains News Wire, Aug. 25, 2023]. Most of the legacy equipment has already been recycled, but BART is donating three cars — one each of the A, B and C versions — to the Western Railway Museum at Rio Vista Junction, which is run by the Bay Area Electric Railroad Association. Five other cars were awarded in 2022 for reuse ranging from an arcade area at an Oakland bar and grill to use in firefighter training [see “<a href="https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/bart-to-award-eight-retired-cars-for-reuse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BART to award eight retired cars ..,”</a> News Wire, March 16, 2022].</p>
<p>When it opened on Sept. 11, 1972, BART was the first entirely new rail transit system built in the United States in decades, built to an atypical 5-foot, 6-inch gauge for reasons <a href="https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2022/news20220708-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the agency explains here</a>. Its technology, advanced for the time, included central computer control, on-board electronic propulsion and “the lightest weight car per passenger ever built,” the museum says. The intended effect was space age, not subway.</p>
<p>Museum volunteers will ride the last trains, staff a table, and speak for a few minutes at the farewell, said Andy Payne, a museum archivist and author of “Legacy Fleet,” an upcoming book about the cars.</p>
<p>The museum will receive the cars in June and intends to place them in its Loring C. Jensen Memorial Car House 3. “We are planning exhibits near the cars showcasing the history of the BART system and the legacy fleet,” he said. “In the future, if funding allows, we would love to build the <a href="https://www.wrm.org/fundraising-campaigns/rapid-transit-history-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapid Transit History Center</a>” that would feature the cars and other aspects of Bay Area electric rail history.</p>
<p>The museum runs historic equipment from several electric railroads on about 6 miles of ex-Sacramento Northern track with overhead wire, but can’t operate the BART cars, because of their gauge and need for third-rail power.</p>
<p>According to BART, the 669 cars in the legacy fleet used 1,000-volt DC electricity for propulsion, with one 150 hp motor per axle and four motors per car. The fleet had:</p>

<li>59 A2 cars and 380 B2 cars, built by aerospace company Rohr Industries. They began service in 1972, and were rehabilitated in 1997 and 2002.</li>
<li>150 C1 cars from Alstom. They entered service in 1988, and were never rehabilitated.</li>
<li>80 C2 cars from Morrison-Knudsen. They began service in 1994, and were never rehabilitated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each car was 70 feet long, except for the A model, 75 feet with a cab.</p>
<p>BART’s new <a href="https://www.bart.gov/about/projects/cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fleet of the Future</a> consists of 775 cars from Bombardier, later bought by Alstom. Also 70 feet long, each car uses 1,000-volt DC electricity, gets power from a third rail, and has two trucks with one 194-hp motor per axle, and two axles per truck.</p>

<p>
TSAC is an audio compression utility reaching very low bitrates such
as 5.5 kb/s for mono or 7.5 kb/s for stereo at 44.1 kHz with a good
perceptual quality. Hence TSAC compresses a 3.5 minute stereo song to
a file of 192 KiB.
</p>
<p>
An Nvidia GPU is necessary for fast operation. CPU only is also
supported but slower.

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>tsac</code> is based on a modified version of
    the <a href="https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec">Descript
      Audio Codec</a> extended for stereo and a Transformer model to further
    increase the compression ratio. Both models are quantized to 8 bits
    per parameter.</li>
  <li>The Transformer model is evaluated in a deterministic and
    reproducible way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact
    GPU or CPU model nor on the number of configured threads. This key
    point ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a
    different hardware or software configuration.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">llm.c</h2><a id="user-content-llmc" aria-label="Permalink: llm.c" href="#llmc"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">LLM training in simple, pure C/CUDA. There is no need for 245MB of PyTorch or 107MB of cPython. For example, training GPT-2 (CPU, fp32) is ~1,000 lines of clean code in a single file. It compiles and runs instantly, and exactly matches the PyTorch reference implementation. I chose GPT-2 as the first working example because it is the grand-daddy of LLMs, the first time the modern stack was put together.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, I am working on:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>direct CUDA implementation, which will be significantly faster and probably come close to PyTorch.</li>
<li>speed up the CPU version with SIMD instructions, AVX2 on x86 / NEON on ARM (e.g. Apple Silicon).</li>
<li>more modern architectures, e.g. Llama2, Gemma, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For the repo, I'd like to maintain both clean, simple reference implementations alongside a also lot more optimized versions that can come close to PyTorch, but in a tiny fraction of the code and dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">quick start</h2><a id="user-content-quick-start" aria-label="Permalink: quick start" href="#quick-start"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Download and tokenize a dataset. The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt" rel="nofollow">tinyshakespeare</a> dataset is the fastest to download and tokenize:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python prepro_tinyshakespeare.py"><pre>python prepro_tinyshakespeare.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This prints:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Saved 32768 tokens to data/tiny_shakespeare_val.bin
Saved 305260 tokens to data/tiny_shakespeare_train.bin"><pre><code>Saved 32768 tokens to data/tiny_shakespeare_val.bin
Saved 305260 tokens to data/tiny_shakespeare_train.bin
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The .bin files are raw byte streams of int32 numbers indicating the token ids with the GPT-2 tokenizer. Alternatively you could also tokenize the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories" rel="nofollow">TinyStories</a> dataset with <code>prepro_tinystories.py</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In principle we'd be ready to the train the model right here. However the baseline CPU/fp32 reference code is so inefficient that it's not practical to train these models from scratch yet. Instead, we initialize with the GPT-2 weights released by OpenAI and just do finetuning. For that, we have to download the GPT-2 weights and save them as a checkpoint we can load in C:</p>

<p dir="auto">You'll recognize this code from nanoGPT as a simple GPT-2 reference implementation in PyTorch. This script will download the GPT-2 (124M) model, overfit a single batch of data for 10 iterations, run a few steps of generation, and most importantly it will save two files: 1) the <code>gpt2_124M.bin</code> file that contains the raw model weights for loading in C, and <code>gpt2_124M_debug_state.bin</code>, which also contains more debug state: the inputs, targets, logits and loss. This is very useful for debugging C code, for unit testing, and making sure we're exactly matching the PyTorch reference implementation. For now all we care about are the model weights in <code>gpt2_124M.bin</code>. We can now initialize with them and train in raw C. First compile the code:</p>

<p dir="auto">You can have a look inside the <code>Makefile</code> and its comments. It will try to autodetect if OpenMP is available on your system, which is very helpful for speeding up the code at very low cost of code complexity. Once <code>train_gpt2</code> is compiled, you can run it:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 ./train_gpt2"><pre>OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 ./train_gpt2</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You should tune the number of threads depending on how many cores your CPU has. The program will load the model weights, the tokens, it will run a finetuning loop for a few iterations with Adam lr 1e-4, and then generate a sample from the model. The file is (I think) very readable and you should have a look. Simply, there are implementations for the forward and backward pass of all the layers, and they get strung together into a large, manual, forward/backward/update loop. The output looks like this on my MacBook Pro (Apple Silicon M3 Max):</p>

<p dir="auto">I like how Netflix comes up, it's clear that the shadow of the training past is still lurking in the model. I did not attempt to tune the finetuning hyperparameters so it's quite likely this can be improved quite a bit, most likely especially if one was to train a bit longer.</p>

<p dir="auto">We don't yet have a script to run tests locally. For now, we recommend using
<code>very_good test -r</code> in the packages directory to run all shorebird tests.</p>
<p dir="auto">(If you run it in the root, it will find packages in bin/cache/flutter and try
to run tests there, some of which will fail.)</p>
<p dir="auto">To generate a coverage report install <code>lcov</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">Then run tests with the <code>--coverage</code> flag:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="very_good test -r --coverage

They can prove something is possible and lift people up. This doesn’t mean that AI systems will not displace humans at many tasks, and it doesn’t mean that humans can always adapt to keep up with the systems—in fact, the human Go players are not keeping up. But the flourishing of creativity and skills tells us something about what might happen at the tail end of the human skill distribution when more AI systems come online.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		
		
<p>As a child, I’d creep down the basement stairs and watch him: hunched over a table, a single lamp lighting his work. First he’d carve a walnut-sized body out of wood. Then he’d take a tiny brush and paint the figure in bright reds and greens and blues, wrap embroidery thread around its spindly wire legs, and top the whole thing with a shiny lacquer. On the back, he’d add a clasp and sign his name in <em>katakana</em>.&nbsp;





</p><p>The end result: a bird pin so delicate it could fit into the palm of my 8-year-old hand. My grandfather, whom I called <em>jichan</em>, made hundreds of these bird pins over the course of his retirement. I always thought they were unique to him. But in recent years, I’ve learned that he was part of something much larger.&nbsp;





</p><p>It all began in February 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/executive-order-9066">Executive Order 9066</a>, which led to the expulsion and incarceration of roughly 122,000 Japanese Americans. Many were given just 48 hours to pack, forcing them to sell their houses, farms, businesses and possessions at rock-bottom prices —&nbsp;ultimately costing them more than an estimated $12 billion in lost property and income, in today’s dollars.&nbsp;




</p>


<p>Carrying suitcases full of clothes and little else, most “evacuees” were sent to 10 War Relocation Authority camps in remote parts of Wyoming, California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho and Arkansas. Others were brought to lesser-known camps throughout the country, including in Alaska, Montana, New Mexico and Hawai’i.&nbsp;





</p><p>My jichan was sent from his home in California to Poston, in the Arizona desert, the <a href="https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/active_learning/explorations/japanese_internment/camps.cfm">second-largest camp</a> by population. At its peak, Poston held nearly 18,000 men, women and children of Japanese descent, including more than a dozen members of my family.&nbsp;





</p><blockquote>
<p>I always thought they were unique to him. But in recent years, I’ve learned that he was part of something much larger.


</p></blockquote>



<p>Since the camp barracks and grounds were <a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/05/12/126557553/the-creative-art-of-coping-in-japanese-internment">nearly empty</a> when they arrived, the incarcerated people spent their early days making their surroundings habitable: building furniture, carving clothes hangers, planting gardens, opening schools. They also took jobs, initially for no pay. Each camp eventually had a hospital, newspaper, mess hall, dry goods store and police and fire department, so many found ways to continue their careers as doctors, journalists, teachers or farmers. By the end of 1943, <a href="https://dp.la/exhibitions/japanese-internment/employment/farming_agriculture">85% of the vegetables</a> eaten in the camps came from within them.





</p><p>People sought out more leisurely distractions, too. “Stuck in that one-square-mile area, it was like, how do you entertain yourself, how do you keep your sanity?” said Delphine Hirasuna, the author of <em>The Art of Gaman, </em>a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/198042/the-art-of-gaman-by-delphine-hirasuna/">book about the arts and crafts of Japanese incarceration</a>. In addition to forming sports leagues, they taught each other pursuits like flower arranging, doll making, sewing and quilting. “If somebody had a particular skill,” Hirasuna said, “the other people who were stuck in camp would say, ‘Could you teach me?’”&nbsp;





</p><p>In Poston, Roy Takahashi, who’d been an <a href="https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/jarda/ucb/text/cubanc_35_1_00259342ta.pdf">art student</a> prior to the war, offered a bird-carving class in <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83025333/1944-09-05/ed-1/?sp=4&amp;q=%22bird+carving%22&amp;r=-0.711,0.319,2.422,1.268,0">September 1944</a>. Within two weeks, the camp newspaper, the <em>Poston Chronicle</em>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83025333/1944-09-14/ed-1/?sp=3&amp;q=%22bird+carving%22&amp;r=-0.109,0.973,0.967,0.506,0">declared that</a> “bird carving seems to be one of the most popular pastimes now.” Archival records suggest that Takahashi offered several <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83025333/1944-10-05/ed-1/?sp=3&amp;q=%22bird+carving%22&amp;r=0.168,1.083,0.988,0.517,0">more</a> <a href="http://digitalcollections.archives.csudh.edu/digital/collection/p16855coll4/id/38007/rec/11">sessions</a> to meet the demand.&nbsp;

<p>One reason the bird pins were so popular, Hirasuna said, is they didn’t require a lot of materials. Many of the people at camp had knives they’d fashioned out of scrap metal,&nbsp; and paint could be ordered fairly easily from a Sears catalog. For the birds’ bodies, they salvaged scraps of wood from delivery crates; for the legs and feet, they used wire from window screens.&nbsp;





</p><p>They created all manner of birds:&nbsp;My jichan’s repertoire included cranes, wood ducks, road runners, pheasants, eagles — even a toucan. They reportedly used an Audubon field guide for inspiration, as well as copies of <em>National Geographic</em>, which was “deluged” with orders for back issues, according to Allen H. Eaton’s 1952 book <em><a href="https://archive.org/stream/dli.ernet.28835/28835-Beauty%20Behind%20Barbed%20Wire%20(1952)_djvu.txt">Beauty Behind Barbed Wire</a></em>. And, though bird carving spread to many other camps, perhaps through letters and packages sent between them, Eaton wrote that Poston “outnumbered all others in the quantity and quality of carved and painted American birds.”&nbsp;





</p><p>Carol Takahashi (no relation to Roy Takahashi) said her grandparents took one of the bird-carving classes offered at Poston. For them, Takahashi said, the pins served as a form of currency: “I know my grandparents traded some of the early bird pins with other ladies for diapers and stuff like that.”&nbsp;





</p><p>Then, after the war, Takahashi’s grandparents were unable to find work. “Nobody wanted to hire Japanese,” she said. So they turned to the skill they had learned in camp, and made and sold bird pins for the next 40 years. Over time, they became the craft’s <a href="http://www.takahashibirds.com/place_in_history.html">most famous makers</a>; their pins received write-ups in the media and permanent spots in several museums. “They made the best of what they could with the situation,” Takahashi said, noting that the bird pins funded her grandparents’ retirement and their four children’s college educations.&nbsp;




</p>


<p>Kristen Hayashi, the director of collections management and access at the <a href="https://www.janm.org/">Japanese American National Museum</a> in Los Angeles, said the bird pins are “very iconic to the camp experience,” and one of the most common donations the museum receives.





</p><p>“Maybe we’re imbuing a lot of meaning onto it, but it seems very poignant that a lot of these incarcerees were recreating birds,” Hayashi said. “Just the symbolism of birds having the freedom to fly and kind of go wherever they want to —&nbsp;something they weren’t able to do incarcerated behind barbed wire.”&nbsp;





</p><p>My jichan eventually moved back to California, where he worked at a newspaper printing press and as a grocery clerk, among other jobs. In retirement, he returned to making bird pins, which my aunts and I sold at markets on both coasts.





</p><blockquote>
<p>“Just the symbolism of birds having the freedom to fly and kind of go wherever they want to —&nbsp;something they weren’t able to do incarcerated behind barbed wire.”&nbsp;


</p></blockquote>



<p>I know my jichan’s pins are still out there, as they occasionally pop up on Etsy or eBay, complete with his signature. I’m sure that many more, from many other former incarcerees, are hidden in basements or attics or jewelry boxes. When people hold these pins in their hands, I hope they see what I do: not a story of suffering, but a story of resilience —&nbsp;of finding beauty, even in the rawest places.

        <p data-block-key="g4c3e">Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices around the world, starting in the U.S. and Canada. With a new, crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My Device can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items quickly and securely. Here are five ways you can try it out.</p>

Locate offline devices</h2><p data-block-key="1hpqn">Locate your compatible Android phone and tablet by ringing them or viewing their location on a map in the app — even when they’re offline.

Keep track of everyday items with compatible Bluetooth tags</h2><p data-block-key="dl4c6">Starting in May, you’ll be able to locate everyday items like your keys, wallet or luggage with Bluetooth tracker tags from <a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/category/chipolo-point" rt-link-type="external">Chipolo</a> and <a href="https://pebblebee.com/pages/google-find-my-device" rt-link-type="external">Pebblebee</a> in the Find My Device app. These tags, built specifically for the Find My Device network, will be compatible with <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/unknown-tracker-alert-google-android/" rt-link-type="external">unknown tracker alerts across Android</a> and iOS to help protect you from unwanted tracking.
