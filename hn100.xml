    <h3 id="ocaml-first-impressions">OCaml: First impressions</h3>

<h4 id="the-why">The Why</h4>

<p>I’m somewhat of a language nerd to begin with, and it was Rust that originally got me interested in the whole functional paradigm.
Not due to it’s lineage, but the heavy use of chained iterator methods in favor over traditional loops. This is one of the more intimidating hurdles
for newcomers to the language, but after getting used to it, rarely will you see anyone write a <code>for</code> loop again.</p>

<p><strong>Rant:</strong> The argument can be made that what I’m talking about is more similar to Javascript-land where a bunch of pseudo-functional methods and terminology are 
used, but it in reality is as far away from functional programming as <code>useState()</code> would imply it is. 
At least Rust has a few things to back it up, as at least a language that will support you should you desire to write pure functional code. I would argue that for beginners, Rust will simply force you to write functional, immutable code, whether they really understand it or otherwise, as the amount of <code>.clone()</code>‘ing required for a newcomer to compile a non-trivial program will practically almost guarantee that nothing was actually <code>&amp;mut</code>ated*.</p>

<p>So this got me interested in watching some <em>GOTO</em>, <em>strangeloop</em>, and other conference talks about functional programming, and upon discovering @artemslab
(definitely go check it out, awesome content) on YouTube and watching some in-depth videos about Ocaml and it’s runtime integer representations and memory
allocation, that really got me fascinated with the language.</p>

<p>In the past, I typically wouldn’t hesitate to <code>sudo pacman -Sy </code> whatever compiler or interpreter I needed, to get started playing around with a new language I was interested in. However since getting full-time employment, on top of the existing OSS stuff,
as well as doing contracted gigs for the facility I’m in, I haven’t had so much as a moment to spend on anything un-related to these things in quite some time.</p>

<p>Anyways, as usual I’m off track here. My point is that I <em>thought</em> I had a good introduction to the world of FP, and I <em>thought</em> since I’d heard that many of the
features and some of the syntax we love from Rust came directly from tha ‘Caml itself, I thought I would be love it and picking it up would be second nature.</p>

<p>My plan was to do the entire Advent of Code in Ocaml, and I was also going to pick an ambitious project that I would otherwise use Rust for, and force myself
to use Ocaml. I find this is the best way to learn a language, is just take on a project that is significantly more ambitious than your current skill level, and by thetime you finish it, you’ll have not only saved yourself a bunch of wasted time on tutorials, but you’ll have made something cool (hopefully).</p>

<h3 id="i-have-two-gripes-with-the-language-so-far">I have two gripes with the language (so far)..</h3>

<h3 id="where-are-the-types-">Where are the types? 👀</h3>

<p>I underestimated how much I would be thrown off by the fact that the types are <em>heavily</em> inferred, and are almost never explicitly declared, from what I can tell. I found that the combination of this and the strange syntax really screws me up, as now I am having problems inferring my <em>own</em> types at this point…</p>

<p>When dealing with lots of recursive functions, you find yourself looking up often at the function signature to view the parameters, but the concise syntax makes it difficult to mentally parse quickly.</p>

<p>Example, random code snippet from ocaml.org:</p>
<pre><code>  let group list sizes =
    let initial = List.map (fun size -&gt; size, []) sizes in

  let prepend p list =
    let emit l acc = l :: acc in
    let rec aux emit acc = function
      | [] -&gt; emit [] acc
      | (n, l) as h :: t -&gt;
         let acc = if n &gt; 0 then emit ((n - 1, p :: l) :: t) acc
                   else acc in
         aux (fun l acc -&gt; emit (h :: l) acc) acc t
    in
    aux emit [] list
  in
  let rec aux = function
    | [] -&gt; [initial]
    | h :: t -&gt; List.concat_map (prepend h) (aux t)
  in
  let all = aux list in
  let complete = List.filter (List.for_all (fun (x, _) -&gt; x = 0)) all in
    List.map (List.map snd) complete;;
val group : 'a list -&gt; int list -&gt; 'a list list list = &lt;fun&gt;
;;
</code></pre>
<p>Even when you learn what it actually going on here, and it makes immediate sense to you.. It must take a while before it becomes easier to read.</p>

<h3 id="remember-recursion-how-about-linked-lists">Remember recursion? How about linked lists?</h3>

<p>Two things every Computer science student learns, and then are immediately told to never use again*…</p>

<p>Anything that can be done recursively can be done iteratively (and most optimizing compilers will replace your recursion anyway), and linked lists are slow and inefficient with modern CPU caches, and you should almost never use them (and if you’re a web dev, well, you just wouldn’t anyway).</p>

<p>You could describe Ocaml as a language that relies <strong>heavily</strong> on <em>both</em> of these things. This feels even more strange that it might seem it would, and I have
found myself stumbling on absolutely remedial tasks.</p>

<p>Yes, there are libraries with other data structures, and there are in fact <code>for</code> loops (and even <code>while</code> loops), However I feel like I will end up learning more of the language and find that iterator methods will be used more so than any of these, much as in Rust.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Thought provoking. If you don’t believe there is anything to gain from being forced to think about something you do every day in a completely different way… well I’m surprised you made it this far into the post.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Awesome mixture of !significant-whitespace and !brackets. And how cool is the comment syntax? (* doesn’t it just feel like.. middle-eastern-ish *);;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tooling: is way better than it has any right to be, considering the size of it’s user-base and community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great conversation starter, really cool and helpful community.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lots more to learn for sure but these were my initial thoughts anyway, I do really want to like it so we will see how much that helps. I just definitely did not get the head-start I was expecting, but I don’t think that’s a negative thing it just means there is more to learn.</p>

<p>*obviously I know this isn’t true and an extreme exaggeration, but I thought it was funny. There’s always someone who will ‘well ackshually’ you when 
you think it’s obvious.</p>

Will still try to do a blog post on my @CSAW_NYUTandon CTF challenge, NERV Center, but for now here's a thread explaining the key mechanics. I put a lot of work into the aesthetics, like this easter egg credit sequence (all ANSI colors+unicode text) that contains key hints: <span><video controls="" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1723398329193603073/pu/img/BOjilHxex46DHgNz.jpg"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1723398329193603073/pu/vid/avc1/320x270/T7o7Rg69CJYAflcu.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><br>

<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon (Note the karaoke subtitles timed to the credits at the bottom 😁)
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon First, the vulnerability. If you read the man page for select(), you'll see this warning: select() is limited to monitoring file descriptors numbered less than 1024. But modern systems can have many more open files, and importantly the kernel select() interface is NOT limited. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-q-tpjXwAAKWQk.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DESCRIPTION  WARNING: select() can monitor only file descriptors numbers  that  are  less than  FD_SETSIZE  (1024)—an  unreasonably low limit for many modern applications—and this limitation will not change.  All modern  applications  should instead use poll(2) or epoll(7), which do not suffer this limitation." src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-q-tpjXwAAKWQk.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon But IMO the man page understates the severity of the problem. So what happens if you *do* try to monitor fds higher than 1024? Well, the fd_set struct is just a bitset of 1024 bits (128 bytes). So attempting to monitor fds larger than 1024 will cause memory corruption!
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon And the really cool part (to me) is that a) the corruption is bitwise, since the data structure is a bitset, and b) the exact bits that will be written out of bounds depend on the *state* of the file descriptors being monitored.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon So if the fds correspond to, say, network connections, an attacker can make a large number of connections, arrange for them to be in just the right state, and thereby get precise control over the bit pattern that gets written.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon (Side note: I discovered this because very old versions of QEMU—including the one used by our PANDA 1.0-based malware sandbox—had this bug and guests could trigger it in the SLIRP user mode networking by making a large number of connections. Yikes! )<a data-preview="true" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=892977">bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?i…</a>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon select() takes up to three bitsets: readfds, writefds, and exceptfds, so each is susceptible to this overflow. I decided to have the intended overflow occur on exceptfds.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Why? Two reasons: 1) it's third in the argument list so it naturally would be the last one listed in, say, a struct; 2) the fd states can be controlled more easily—with TCP connections, exceptfds is used to indicate connections with pending TCP out-of-band (OOB) data.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon So now the basic exploit strategy is clear: make more than 1024 connections to the server, an send TCP OOB data to the ones with fds higher than 1024 to set your desired bit pattern. But exactly what should get overwritten?
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon That's when this challenge moved from just Pwn to Pwn+Crypto :D I decided to place an RSA public key used for ssh-style challenge/response auth right after the exceptfds bitset, so you can control the upper 64 bits using the vuln. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rD9ZUXEAAySUm.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rD9ZUXEAAySUm.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon What can you do with the ability to control the top 64 bits of a 1024-bit RSA public key N? Well, N = pq, which is hard to factor. But the *corrupted* N' is very likely to be a product of a bunch of smaller primes—which is easy to factor!
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon I first learned of this trick from the super cool USENIX Security 2016 paper Flip Feng Shui by Kaveh Razavi, @bjg et al., who used it in conjunction with RowHammer and memory deduplication to bypass SSH authentication. <a data-preview="true" href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/razavi">usenix.org/conference/use…</a><br>
<span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rFbfPXgAA3Ezz.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rFbfPXgAA3Ezz.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon (One of the players who solved the challenge during CSAW CTF finals actually found an even sweeter way to exploit this vuln: figure out a bit pattern that makes N *prime* and set that. Then the corresponding private key d is just: pow(65537, -1, n-1). Slick!)
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Once you've factored the key (or made it prime) and figured out the secret key d for the corrupted public key, you can use it to forge signatures and bypass the authentication, allowing you to download the flag (encrypted with RSA+AES-256-GCM). <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rInsJXEAAuE0Q.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rInsJXEAAuE0Q.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Okay, but now on to the important stuff: ~aesthetics~. The theme of the challenge was based around Episode 13 of Neon Genesis Evangelion, which features an Angel that hacks NERV's MAGI supercomputer cluster.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon I realized that three computers in the MAGI cluster (Casper, Balthasar, and Melchior) correspond neatly to the three fd_sets readfds, writefds, and exceptds. So I was able to make a cute UI that shows the state of the fd_sets in real-time. <span><video controls="" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1723411409579429888/pu/img/8Bjj0p8WU4HfW3jo.jpg"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1723411409579429888/pu/vid/avc1/320x270/qYrDaeco3ZV7Csnc.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><br>

<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Aside from being my best attempt at recreating the UI from the show (pictured here), the UI elements also have some key clues to the vulnerability. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rKhHpWsAAmxom.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rKhHpWsAAmxom.png"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon - The CODE field shows the highest file descriptor in use, and the EXTENTION (sic) shows the server's max fd ulimit.<br>
- The box on the right turns red when the highest FD is &gt; 1024.<br>
- The UI gets slightly corrupted precisely when there is actual memory corruption happening. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rMd-3XMAAn0aj.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rMd-3XMAAn0aj.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon All of the visuals in the challenge were created using plain unicode characters and ANSI colors, so you can just cat the text files to see them (or dump them over a network socket). <span><video controls="" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1723415475378393089/pu/img/nUXZ6x6EkzpNC3jm.jpg"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1723415475378393089/pu/vid/avc1/320x270/gcU1d77FxNPgoyFt.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><br>

@CSAW_NYUTandon The credit sequence was made with some rather, uh, "rough and ready" techniques. <span><span><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1723409266051051904">https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1723409266051051904</a></blockquote></span></span>

<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon The code for credits generation is also available, though it is not what I would call production-quality <a data-preview="true" href="https://github.com/moyix/csaw23_nervcenter_credits">github.com/moyix/csaw23_n…</a>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Finally, a bit on the mechanics of developing this challenge. First, it ended up being rather a lot of C code, so I was super worried about accidentally introducing an unintended vuln that would make the challenge boring. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rPWU8WIAAVCx8.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rPWU8WIAAVCx8.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon To guard against this I wrote a bunch of libfuzzer targets, network torture tests in Python, and traditional CTest unit tests. I think it worked! I didn't hear of anyone finding a vuln in the challenge except the one I intended. <br>
<span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rQQcYWIAAvqP2.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rQQcYWIAAvqP2.png"></a></span></span><br>

<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Another bit that took some work was making the challenge consistently solvable. With select(), you fill the fd_set with 1s, call select, and the kernel fills the set with the actual fd state. But that means that 1/2 the time the key is corrupted by all 1s instead of your bits!
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon This makes exploitation annoying, to say the least. So I introduced a mechanism that lets players pause and resume the thread calling select(), so the corrupted key stays in place during factoring/signing/encrypting. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rThOzXcAAPWzh.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rThOzXcAAPWzh.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Oh, a couple more bits of aesthetics. The sensor port (the one you actually use for the overflow, lets you look at some cards for the various angels: <br>
<span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rUrwoWAAAD5kP.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rUrwoWAAAD5kP.jpg"></a></span></span><br>
<span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rUzzCW4AA5yaK.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rUzzCW4AA5yaK.jpg"></a></span></span></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon That functionality also hides the easter egg: by calling EXAMINE on three angels in a row where the first letter of their names spell out "RSA" (e.g., Ramiel, Sandalphon, Adam), you can activate the credit sequence shown in the first tweet. <span><span><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1723398619313603068">https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1723398619313603068</a></blockquote></span></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon And I think it's always fun to taunt the players a little bit. That's why when you fail the challenge-response authentication, Asuka shows up to make fun of you. (There are a few other images included for other errors, but they're harder to trigger.) <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rVjxLW0AAlWIQ.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rVjxLW0AAlWIQ.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon I learned a few fun things while making this challenge. First, Python crypto libraries like pycryptodome do NOT enjoy working with prime or multi-prime keys. I used OpenSSL directly instead in my solver, but some players monkeypatched the Python library. <a data-preview="true" href="https://github.com/moyix/csaw23_nervcenter/tree/main/solver">github.com/moyix/csaw23_n…</a>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Second, one variant of the challenge I tried ran into an interesting issue. I considered byte-swapping the key so that players could only set the LSB. But it turns out half of those keys are unusable, because OpenSSL uses Montgomery multiplication, which requires an odd modulus.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Tommaso Gagliardoni of Kudelski Security also suggested a variant on the core RSA overwrite that would also have been fun - allow the overwrite to make the key BIGGER by extending into adjacent data in memory. Sadly I didn't have time to implement this. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rYbWoW8AA561k.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rYbWoW8AA561k.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Okay this thread is now officially WAY too long, so I'll wrap up by saying that I had a great time writing the challenge, and I'm thrilled that it all came together and people enjoyed playing it!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        
  
      <div><p><a title="" href="https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-krallt-sich-Zugangsdaten-Achtung-vorm-neuen-Outlook-9357691.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Microsoft steals access data"</a> - When the well-known German IT portal "Heise Online" uses such drastic words in its headline, then something is up. If Microsoft has its way, all Windows users will have to switch to the latest version of Microsoft Outlook. But: Not only can the IMAP and SMTP access data of your e-mail account be transferred to Microsoft, but all e-mails in the INBOX can also be copied to the Microsoft servers, even if you have your mailbox with a completely different provider such as mailbox.org.</p></div>
<h2>Main risk: Transferring your data to Microsoft "Synchronisation with the Microsoft server" - and everything is copied!</h2>
<p>If you set up a new account in the software, Microsoft offers a supposed security function: It says that non-Microsoft accounts are synchronised with the Microsoft cloud and that copies of "emails, calendars and contacts are therefore synchronised between your email provider and Microsoft data centres".</p>
<p>Anyone who reads this carefully may be perplexed, no question. But we all know how easy it is to agree to supposed banalities without reading them and to click away notices, especially when setting up software. In view of the drastic consequences of giving consent here, the warnings and explanations from Microsoft are probably too inconspicuous. Only a few users will realise that they are giving Microsoft comprehensive access to passwords, mail and more. Therefore, once again clearly:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft gets full access to mails, calendars and contacts!</strong></p>
<div><p>But not only Windows users are at risk: Outlook versions for iOS, Mac and even Android are also affected, according to Heise.</p></div>
<h2>mailbox.org warns against using the new Microsoft Outlook</h2>
<p>mailbox.org warns its users: there is a high risk that sensitive data may be transmitted to Microsoft when using the new Outlook! And by the way: this compromised data includes not only emails, but also calendar and contact data.</p>
  
  
  

</div><p>For <strong>business customers</strong>, storing personal data in this way (albeit unintentionally) may constitute a GDPR offence that is subject to fines. After all, storing data in the Microsoft cloud legally constitutes data processing that requires the conclusion of an order data processing agreement (DPA) with Microsoft - and companies may have to identify this as such in their data protection declarations and in the data processing directory. It is irrelevant whether this is done intentionally by the company management or ultimately through the uninformed consent of an individual employee.</p><div>

        
  
      
<h2>Our recommendation</h2>
<p>Whether business or private: We strongly advise all our customers not to use the new Outlook! And we have the following alternatives for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Another e-mail client:</strong> We advise you to switch to the popular e-mail client "Thunderbird" on your computer. This is compatible with Windows and easy to set up. On mobile devices, there are a number of different IMAP mail clients, such as FairEmail and K9 Mail (which will also be called Thunderbird in the future).</li>
<li><strong>Using the webmailer:</strong> As a mailbox.org customer, you can use our secure webmail portal at any time, which offers an excellent alternative to desktop email clients. In addition to mail, calendar and contacts, you also have secure access to files and Office documents - and your personal video conference with OpenTalk is just a click away.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do everything we can to protect the security and privacy of your e-mail communication. But we also need your help: make sure you use apps from providers that respect and protect your privacy and security.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>
<p>The German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Ulrich Kelber, is also alarmed: On the <a title="social media network Mastodon" href="https://social.mailbox.org/@bfdi@social.bund.de/111381793879390891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media network Mastodon</a>, he described the data collection as "alarming" and announced his intention to pursue the issue at European level through the data protection authorities as early as next Tuesday.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>In the summer of 2022, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/experian-you-have-some-explaining-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> the plight of several readers who had their accounts at big-three consumer credit reporting bureau <strong>Experian</strong> hijacked after identity thieves simply re-registered the accounts using a different email address. Sixteen months later, Experian clearly has not addressed this gaping lack of security. I know that because my account at Experian was recently hacked, and the only way I could recover access was by recreating the account.</p>
<div id="attachment_65607"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-65607" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/exp-forgot.png" alt="" width="749" height="381" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/exp-forgot.png 953w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/exp-forgot-768x391.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/exp-forgot-782x398.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-65607">Entering my SSN and birthday at Experian showed my identity was tied to an email address I did not authorize.</p></div>
<p>I recently ordered a copy of my credit file from Experian via <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annualcreditreport.com</a>, but as usual Experian declined to provide it, saying they couldn’t verify my identity. Attempts to log in to my account directly at Experian.com also failed; the site said it didn’t recognize my username and/or password.</p>
<p>A request for my Experian account username required my full Social Security number and date of birth, after which the website displayed portions of an email address I never authorized and did not recognize (the full address was redacted by Experian).</p>
<p>I immediately suspected that Experian was still allowing anyone to recreate their credit file account using the same personal information but a different email address, a major authentication failure that was explored in last year’s story, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/experian-you-have-some-explaining-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experian, You Have Some Explaining to Do</a>. So once again I sought to re-register as myself at Experian.</p>
<p>The homepage said I needed to provide a Social Security number and mobile phone number, and that I’d soon receive a link that I should click to verify myself. The site claims that the phone number you provide will be used to help validate your identity. But it appears you could supply any phone number in the United States at this stage in the process, and Experian’s website would not balk. <em>Regardless, users can simply skip this step by selecting the option to “Continue another way.”</em></p>
<p>Experian then asks for your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, email address and chosen password. After that, they require you to successfully answer between three to five multiple-choice security questions whose answers are very often based on public records. When I recreated my account this week, only two of the five questions pertained to my real information, and both of those questions concerned street addresses we’ve previously lived at — information that is just a Google search away.</p>
<p>Assuming you sail through the multiple-choice questions, you’re prompted to create a 4-digit PIN and provide an answer to one of several pre-selected challenge questions. After that, your new account is created and you’re directed to the Experian dashboard, which allows you to view your full credit file, and freeze or unfreeze it.</p>
<p>At this point, Experian will send a message to the old email address tied to the account, saying certain aspects of the user profile have changed. But this message isn’t a request seeking verification: It’s just a notification from Experian that the account’s user data has changed, and the original user is offered zero recourse here other than to a click a link to log in at Experian.com.</p>
<div id="attachment_65605"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-65605" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/expupdates.png" alt="" width="750" height="707"></p><p id="caption-attachment-65605">If you don’t have an Experian account, it’s a good idea to create one. Because at least then you will receive one of these&nbsp; emails when someone hijacks your credit file at Experian.</p></div>
<p>And of course, a user who receives one of these notices will find that the credentials to their Experian account no longer work. Nor do their PIN or account recovery question, because those have been changed also. Your only option at this point is recreate your account at Experian and steal it back from the ID thieves!</p>
<p>In contrast, if you try to modify an existing account at either of the other two major consumer credit reporting bureaus — <strong>Equifax</strong> or <strong>TransUnion</strong> — they will ask you to enter a code sent to the email address or phone number on file before any changes can be made.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Experian declined to share the full email address that was added without authorization to my credit file.</p>
<p>“To ensure the protection of consumers’ identities and information, we have implemented a multi-layered security approach, which includes passive and active measures, and are constantly evolving,” Experian spokesperson <strong>Scott Anderson</strong> said in an emailed statement. “This includes knowledge-based questions and answers, and device possession and ownership verification processes.”</p>
<p>Anderson said all consumers have the option to activate a multi-factor authentication method that’s requested each time they log in to their account. But what good is multi-factor authentication if someone can simply recreate your account with a new phone number and email address?<span id="more-65594"></span></p>
<p>Several readers who spotted <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/111383547431806668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my rant about Experian on Mastodon</a> earlier this week responded to a request to validate my findings. The Mastodon user <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@jackerbee@cyberplace.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Jackerbee</a> is a reader from Michican who works in the biotechnology industry. @Jackerbee said when prompted by Experian to provide his phone number and the last four digits of his SSN, he chose the option to “manually enter my information.”</p>
<p>“I put my second phone number and the new email address,” he explained. “I received a single email in my original account inbox that said they’ve updated my information after I ‘signed up.’ No verification required from the original email address at any point. I also did not receive any text alerts at the original phone number. The especially interesting and egregious part is that when I sign in, it does 2FA with the new phone number.”</p>
<p>The Mastodon user <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@PeteMayo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PeteMayo</a> said they recreated their Experian account twice this week, the second time by supplying a random landline number.</p>
<p>“The only difference: it asked me FIVE questions about my personal history (last time it only asked three) before proclaiming, ‘Welcome back, Pete!,’ and granting full access,” @PeteMayo wrote. “I feel silly saving my password for Experian; may as well just make a new account every time.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/petemayo.png" alt="" width="748" height="479"></p>
<p>I was fortunate in that whoever hijacked my account did not also thaw my credit freeze.&nbsp; Or if they did, they politely froze it again when they were done. But I fully expect my Experian account will be hijacked yet again unless Experian makes some important changes to its authentication process.</p>
<p>It boggles the mind that these fundamental authentication weaknesses have been allowed to persist for so long at Experian, which already has a horrible track record in this regard.</p>
<p>In December 2022, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/identity-thieves-bypassed-experian-security-to-view-credit-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alerted</a> Experian that identity thieves had worked out a remarkably simple way to bypass its security and access <em>any</em> consumer’s full credit report — armed with nothing more than a person’s name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number. Experian fixed the glitch, and acknowledged that it <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/experian-glitch-exposing-credit-files-lasted-47-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persisted for nearly seven weeks</a>, between Nov. 9, 2022 and Dec. 26, 2022.</p>
<p>In April 2021, KrebsOnSecurity revealed how identity thieves were&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experians-credit-freeze-security-is-still-a-joke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploiting lax authentication on Experian’s PIN retrieval page</a>&nbsp;to unfreeze consumer credit files. In those cases, Experian failed to send any notice via email when a freeze PIN was retrieved, nor did it require the PIN to be sent to an email address already associated with the consumer’s account.</p>
<p>A few days after that April 2021 story, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experian-api-exposed-credit-scores-of-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Experian API was exposing the credit scores of most Americans</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><b></b><span>Today, almost everything about our lives is digitally recorded and stored somewhere. Each credit card purchase, personal medical diagnosis, and preference about music and books is recorded and then used to predict what we like and dislike, and—ultimately—who we are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This often happens without our knowledge or consent. Personal information that corporations collect from our online behaviors sells for astonishing profits and incentivizes online actors to collect as much as possible. Every mouse click and screen swipe can be tracked and then sold to ad-tech companies and the data brokers that service them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In an attempt to justify this pervasive surveillance ecosystem, corporations often claim to de-identify our data. This supposedly removes all personal information (such as a person’s name) from the data point (such as the fact that an unnamed person bought a particular medicine at a particular time and place). Personal data can also be aggregated, whereby data about multiple people is combined with the intention of removing </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/what-information-personally-identifiable"><span>personal identifying information</span></a><span> and thereby protecting user privacy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes companies say our personal data is “anonymized,” implying a one-way ratched where it can never be dis-aggregated and re-identified. But this is not possible—anonymous data rarely stays this way. As Professor Matt Blaze, an expert in the field of cryptography and data privacy, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/coronavirus-location-tracking.html"><span>succinctly summarized</span></a><span>: “something that seems anonymous, more often than not, is not anonymous, even if it’s designed with the best intentions.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Anonymization…and Re-Identification?</b></h3>
<p><span>Personal data can be considered on a </span><a href="https://georgetownlawtechreview.org/re-identification-of-anonymized-data/GLTR-04-2017/"><span>spectrum of identifiability</span></a><span>. At the top is data that can directly identify people, such as a name or state identity number, which can be referred to as “direct identifiers.” Next is information indirectly linked to individuals, like personal phone numbers and email addresses, which some call “indirect identifiers.” After this comes data connected to multiple people, such as a favorite restaurant or movie. The other end of this spectrum is information that cannot be linked to any specific person—such as aggregated census data, and data that is not directly related to individuals at all like weather reports.</span></p>
<p><span>Data anonymization is often </span><a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=926110097116071012112098112084025092029042041058054022096075006072105102108068091081035042057063112008038075092019127024108106031044060037085067082120125007124123056087053067019094021074127009122023072067065111114088090076068125120081075010085067125&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE"><span>undertaken in two ways</span></a><span>. First, some personal identifiers like our names and social security numbers might be deleted. Second, other categories of personal information might be modified—such as obscuring our bank account numbers. For example, the Safe Harbor provision contained with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that only the </span><a href="https://georgetownlawtechreview.org/re-identification-of-anonymized-data/GLTR-04-2017/"><span>first three digits</span></a><span> of a zip code can be reported in scrubbed data.</span></p>
<p>However, in practice, any attempt at de-identification requires removal not only of your identifiable information, but also of information that can identify you when considered in combination with other information known about you. Here's an example:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>First, think about the number of people that share your specific ZIP or postal code.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Next, think about how many of those people also share your birthday.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Now, think about how many people share your exact birthday, ZIP code, and gender.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>According to one </span><a href="https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf"><span>landmark study</span></a><span>, these three characteristics are enough to uniquely identify 87% of the U.S. population. A </span><a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/census.pdf"><span>different study</span></a><span> showed that 63% of the U.S. population can be uniquely identified from these three facts.</span></p>
<p>We cannot trust corporations to self-regulate. The financial benefit and business usefulness of our personal data often outweighs our privacy and anonymity. In re-obtaining the real identity of the person involved (direct identifier) alongside a person’s preferences (indirect identifier), corporations are able to continue profiting from our most sensitive information. For instance, a website that asks supposedly “anonymous” users for seemingly trivial information about themselves may be able to use that information to make a unique profile for an individual.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Location Surveillance</b></h3>
<p><span>To understand this system in practice, we can look at </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/governments-havent-shown-location-surveillance-would-help-contain-covid-19"><span>location data</span></a><span>. This includes the data collected by </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/location-data-brokers"><span>apps on your mobile device</span></a><span> about your whereabouts: from the weekly trips to your local supermarket to your last appointment at a health center, an immigration clinic, or a protest planning meeting. The collection of this location data on our devices is sufficiently precise for law enforcement to place suspects at the scene of a crime, and for juries to convict people on the basis of that evidence. What’s more, whatever personal data is collected by the government can be </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/california-authorities-still-ignoring-rising-abuse-police-databases"><span>misused</span></a><span> by its employees, </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/"><span>stolen</span></a><span> by criminals or foreign governments, and used in unpredictable ways by agency leaders for </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-mar-31-na-census31-story.html"><span>nefarious new purposes</span></a><span>. And </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/what-we-learned-oakland-raw-alpr-data"><span>all</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/04/next-steps-toward-reforming-californias-unfair-gang-databases"><span>too</span></a> <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/blog/facebook-instagram-and-twitter-provided-data-access-surveillance-product-marketed-target"><span>often</span></a><span>, such high tech surveillance disparately burdens people of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Practically speaking, there is </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/how-protect-privacy-when-aggregating-location-data-fight-covid-19"><span>no way to de-identify individual location data</span></a><span> since these data points serve as unique personal identifiers of their own. And even when location data is said to have been anonymized, re-identification can be achieved by correlating de-identified data with other publicly available data like voter rolls or information that's sold by </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror"><span>data brokers</span></a><span>. One </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376"><span>study from 2013</span></a><span> found that researchers could uniquely identify 50% of people using only two randomly chosen time and location data points.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Done right, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/how-protect-privacy-when-aggregating-location-data-fight-covid-19"><span>aggregating</span></a><span> location data can work towards preserving our personal rights to privacy by producing non-individualized counts of behaviors instead of detailed timelines of individual location history. For instance, an aggregation might tell you how many people’s phones reported their location as being in a certain city within the last month, but not the exact phone number and other data points that would connect this directly and personally to you. However, there’s often pressure on the experts doing the aggregation to generate granular aggregate data sets that might be more meaningful to a particular decision-maker but which simultaneously expose individuals to an erosion of their personal privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, most </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror#Part1"><span>third-party location tracking</span></a><span> is designed to build profiles of real people. This means that every time a tracker collects a piece of information, it needs something to tie that information to a particular person. This can happen indirectly by correlating collected data with a particular device </span><a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/"><span>or browser</span></a><span>, which might later correlate to one person or a group of people, such as a household. Trackers can also use artificial identifiers, like </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror#AdvertisingIDs"><span>mobile ad IDs</span></a><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror#Cookies"><span> and </span><span>cookies</span></a><span> to reach users with targeted messaging. And “anonymous” profiles of personal information can</span><a href="https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-6-3.pdf"> <span>nearly always</span></a><span> be</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html"> <span>linked back to real people</span></a><span>—including where they live, what they read, and what they buy.</span></p>
<p><span>For data brokers dealing in our personal information, our data can either be useful for their profit-making or truly anonymous, but not both. EFF has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-att-data-aggregators-giving-bounty-hunters-and-other-third-parties-access"><span>long</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-carpenter"><span>opposed</span></a><span> location surveillance programs that can turn our lives into </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html"><span>open books</span></a><span> for scrutiny by police, surveillance-based advertisers, identity thieves, and stalkers. We’ve also long blown the whistle on </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/what-information-personally-identifiable"><span>phony anonymization</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As a matter of public policy, it is critical that user privacy is not sacrificed in favor of filling the pockets of corporations. And for any data sharing plan, consent is critical: did each person consent to the method of data collection, and did they consent to the particular use? Consent must be specific, informed, opt-in, and voluntary.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: this post is an extended transcript of the video below.</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z9ongxf3mIg" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video" loading="lazy"></iframe>
</p>

<p>If you’ve been around long enough, you probably remember a project called Glimpse. Originally it was an attempt to create a fork of GIMP for the name change. Then that project got an offspring, Glimpse NX, where a new image editor with a cleaner, more approachable user interface was supposed to be developed.</p>
<p>Neither project was successful, but this is one of the mockups they came up with:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-glimpse-nx-mockup.webp" alt="Glimpse NX mockup" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>I vividly remember that when I first saw this, I thought: “Looks interesting, but there is just no way this is going to work!”. And the main reason for that is…</p>
<h2 id="gimps-complexity">
    <a href="#gimps-complexity">
	GIMP’s complexity
    </a>
</h2>
<p>There is a huge amount of commands and options built into GIMP’s menus and nested menus.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-gimp-nested-menu.webp" alt="Nested menu in GIMP" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The program amassed all that over the years, and then the team tried to solve that with a search dialog:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-gimp-search-box.webp" alt="Search dialog in GIMP" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>Which kinda works when you <em>generally</em> know what you need or how a feature you want could be called. But really not when this is your first rodeo.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is very difficult to represent all this complexity in an application that looks like the thing on the mockup above.</p>
<p>With GTK3 tech, one possible solution to do that is a dropdown menu in the headerbar, like in Siril:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-siril-dropdown-menu-in-headerbar.webp" alt="Dropdown menu in Siril&amp;rsquo;s headerbar" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>But this is not very convenient because when you go to a nested menu in one part of the screen, it opens in an entirely different part of the screen, and it’s very annoying.</p>
<p>And then again, how many menus like that can you fit into one headerbar before users run for pitchforks with a determined look on their faces? So it’s not really great, I think we could do better.</p>
<h2 id="enter-dune-3d">
    <a href="#enter-dune-3d">
	Enter Dune 3D
    </a>
</h2>
<p>One possible solution is coming from a new application called <a href="https://github.com/dune3d/dune3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune 3D</a>. It’s a 3D CAD program built on top of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open CASCADE</a> kernel and <a href="https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SolveSpace</a> constraint solver — all the usual suspects.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-dune3d-main-window.webp" alt="Dune 3D" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The developer is <a href="https://chaos.social/@karotte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same guy</a> who came up with <a href="https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon EDA</a>, a GTK3-based electronic design automation package. Dune 3D is very, very new. The initial code import to GitHub was made just two weeks ago, so not a lot of people even know about this project yet, but that is beside the point.</p>
<p>The interesting part here is when you first look at this, you can’t help yourself wondering: “Okay, I get it, he barely started coding. Still, where is all the functionality?”. Well, since the status bar says “Press Space”, let’s do just that:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-dune3d-menu-search.webp" alt="Search + menu" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>And that gets me really excited. Because you get the search bar for when you know what you’re looking for, when you know the terminology, when you understand what you need. And you also get a kind of menu that is helpful for when you need to navigate into the unknown and see all your options. So this is a very interesting solution that, while not perfect for a lot of complexity, could still be iterated upon, in my opinion.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: as the developer <a href="https://chaos.social/@karotte/111376994265393111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a>, this search/menu dialog has been available in Horizon EDA for the past 7 years, he simply reused his own code in the new program.</p>
<h2 id="interaction-hints">
    <a href="#interaction-hints">
	Interaction hints
    </a>
</h2>
<p>Another interesting thing here is that when you do something like drawing a line, for example, you get these nice visual hints here, just above the status bar:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-dune3d-interaction-hints.webp" alt="Interaction hints" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The idea is coming from Blender obviously, and it would make a lot of sense to use this in applications like GIMP and Inkscape. Here is a good reason why.</p>
<p>When you are coming from an application like Photoshop, you are used to do set of modifiers for working with selections. So when you create the selection and you need to add to it, what you do is press <strong>Shift</strong> in GIMP. But it’s <strong>Ctrl</strong> in Photoshop. A lot of people that I’ve met who come from Photoshop don’t really know that. And the only way they can find that out is by reading a tutorial or a user manual or maybe watching a YouTube video — the status bar hint isn’t specific enough, and not everyone finds the toggles in tool settings.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-gimp-inspecific-toolbar-hint.webp" alt="Inspecific toolbar hint" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>And the same applies, for example, to moving selections, because in GIMP, you need to press <strong>Ctrl+Alt</strong> and then drag to move the contents of the selection, which is not how people expect this to work coming from many other applications. Again, the only way they can find this out is by watching a tutorial or reading the user manual.</p>
<p>So that’s another thing that I think would make sense to sort of backport from Dune 3D to GIMP in the GTK3-based based version (or GTK4, since Dune 3D is GTK4-based). So I’m really hoping that at least this will be considered by the developers.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">
    <a href="#thoughts">
	Thoughts?
    </a>
</h2>
<p>I don’t think that the redesign that the Glimpse NX team came up with should be implemented as is. There are so many more aspects to discuss apart from access to functionality in menus, and the team explored some of those aspects too: how the headerbar should work, how exporting would be implemented, what tool settings would look like etc. (they removed the git repository with mockups and studies, but I have a local copy).</p>
<p>Their redesign definitely makes the program more approachable. And now this solution in Dune 3D <em>probably</em> makes a major deficiency of that design go away. Even more, the interaction hints seem like a great if overlooked idea that could also be a <em>relatively</em> low-effort job.</p>
<p>Trying to revamp GIMP’s UX/UI at any level, especially this much, is obviously a huge effort — or <em>would be</em> a huge effort if the developers would ever decide to do that. But I’m really interested in your opinion. Do you think this old redesign of the program could be revived thanks to Dune 3D?</p>

<blockquote><p>In arid and semi-arid regions, owing to high evaporation, transportation routes were in the form of qanats, which led groundwater to consumption areas along the tunnels. In the long run, the qanat system is not only economical but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainable</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> and agricultural purposes.… The ground water flow was known to depend on grain size of sediments, and, therefore, the tunnels in qanats are filled in with coarser material than the surrounding hose geological formations. The qanats are constructed mainly along the valleys where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary" title="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> sediments are deposited.</p><p>— <cite><i>Underground Aqueducts Handbook</i> (2016)</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Qanats are constructed as a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_well" title="Water well">well-like</a> vertical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaft_mining" title="Shaft mining">shafts</a>, connected by a gently sloping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel" title="Tunnel">tunnel</a> which carries a water channel. Qanats efficiently deliver large amounts of subterranean water to the surface without need for pumping. The water drains by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, typically from an upland <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a>, with the destination lower than the source. Qanats allow water to be transported over long distances in hot dry climates without much water loss to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Angelakis_2016_Handbook_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-Angelakis_2016_Handbook-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>It is very common for a qanat to start below the foothills of mountains, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_table" title="Water table">water table</a> is closest to the surface. From this source, the qanat tunnel slopes gently downward, slowly converging with the steeper slope of the land surface above, and the water finally flows out above ground where the two levels meet. To connect a populated or agricultural area with an aquifer, qanats must often extend for long distances.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Qanats are sometimes split into an underground distribution network of smaller canals called kariz. Like qanats, these smaller canals are below ground to avoid contamination and evaporation. In some cases water from a qanat is stored in a reservoir, typically with night flow stored for daytime use. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_anbar" title="Ab anbar">ab anbar</a> is an example of a traditional Persian qanat-fed reservoir for drinking water.
</p><p>The qanat system has the advantage of being resistant to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, and to deliberate destruction in war. Furthermore, it is almost insensitive to the levels of precipitation, delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to dry years. From a sustainability perspective, qanats are powered only by gravity, and thus have low operation &amp; maintenance costs once built. Qanats transfer freshwater from the mountain plateau to the lower-lying plains with saltier soil. This helps to control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_salinity" title="Soil salinity">soil salinity</a> and prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification" title="Desertification">desertification</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri-21">[21]</a></sup>

<p>The qanat should not be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spring-flow_tunnel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Spring-flow tunnel (page does not exist)">spring-flow tunnel</a> typical to the mountainous area around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Although both are excavated tunnels designed to extract water by gravity flow, there are crucial differences. Firstly, the origin of the qanat was a well that was turned into an artificial spring. In contrast, the origin of the spring-flow tunnel was the development of a natural spring to renew or increase flow following a recession of the water table. Secondly, the shafts essential for the construction of qanats are not essential to spring-flow tunnels.

<p>A typical town or city in Iran, and elsewhere where the qanat is used, has more than one qanat. Fields and gardens are located both over the qanats a short distance before they emerge from the ground and below the surface outlet. Water from the qanats defines both the social regions in the city and the layout of the city.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The water is freshest, cleanest, and coolest in the upper reaches and more prosperous people live at the outlet or immediately upstream of the outlet. When the qanat is still below ground, the water is drawn to the surface via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_well" title="Water well">water wells</a> or animal driven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_well" title="Persian well">Persian wells</a>. Private subterranean reservoirs could supply houses and buildings for domestic use and garden irrigation as well. Further, air flow from the qanat is used to cool an underground summer room (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabestan" title="Shabestan">shabestan</a>) found in many older houses and buildings.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Downstream of the outlet, the water runs through surface canals called jubs (<i>jūbs</i>) which run downhill, with lateral branches to carry water to the neighborhood, gardens and fields. The streets normally parallel the jubs and their lateral branches. As a result, the cities and towns are oriented consistent with the gradient of the land; this is a practical response to efficient water distribution over varying terrain.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-4"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The lower reaches of the canals are less desirable for both residences and agriculture. The water grows progressively more polluted as it passes downstream. In dry years the lower reaches are the most likely to see substantial reductions in flow.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-5"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>The critical, initial step in qanat construction is identification of an appropriate water source. The search begins at the point where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan" title="Alluvial fan">alluvial fan</a> meets the mountains or foothills; water is more abundant in the mountains because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orographic_lifting" title="Orographic lifting">orographic lifting</a> and excavation in the alluvial fan is relatively easy. The <i>muqannīs</i> follow the track of the main water courses coming from the mountains or foothills to identify evidence of subsurface water such as deep-rooted vegetation or seasonal seeps. A trial well is then dug to determine the location of the water table and determine whether a sufficient flow is available to justify construction. If these prerequisites are met, the route is laid out aboveground.
</p><p>Equipment must be assembled. The equipment is straightforward: containers (usually leather bags), ropes, reels to raise the container to the surface at the shaft head, hatchets and shovels for excavation, lights, spirit levels or plumb bobs and string. Depending upon the soil type, qanat liners (usually fired clay hoops) may also be required.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-7"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>Although the construction methods are simple, the construction of a qanat requires a detailed understanding of subterranean geology and a degree of engineering sophistication. The gradient of the qanat must be carefully controlled: too shallow a gradient yields no flow and too steep a gradient will result in excessive erosion, collapsing the qanat. And misreading the soil conditions leads to collapses, which at best require extensive rework and at worst are fatal for the crew.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-1"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>

<h3><span id="Excavation">Excavation</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qanat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Excavation"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Construction of a qanat is usually performed by a crew of 3–4 <i>muqannīs</i>. For a shallow qanat, one worker typically digs the horizontal shaft, one raises the excavated earth from the shaft and one distributes the excavated earth at the top.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-2"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>The crew typically begins from the destination to which the water will be delivered into the soil and works toward the source (the test well). Vertical shafts are excavated along the route, separated at a distance of 20–35&nbsp;m (66–115&nbsp;ft). The separation of the shafts is a balance between the amount of work required to excavate them and the amount of effort required to excavate the space between them, as well as the ultimate maintenance effort. In general, the shallower the qanat, the closer the vertical shafts. If the qanat is long, excavation may begin from both ends at once. Tributary channels are sometimes also constructed to supplement the water flow.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-8"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-3"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>Most qanats in Iran run less than 5&nbsp;km (3.1&nbsp;mi), while some have been measured at ≈70&nbsp;km (43&nbsp;mi) in length near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerman" title="Kerman">Kerman</a>. The vertical shafts usually range from 20 to 200&nbsp;m (66 to 656&nbsp;ft) in depth, although qanats in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Khorasan" title="Province of Khorasan">province of Khorasan</a> have been recorded with vertical shafts of up to 275&nbsp;m (902&nbsp;ft). The vertical shafts support construction and maintenance of the underground channel as well as air interchange. Deep shafts require intermediate platforms to facilitate the process of removing soil.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-9"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-4"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>The construction speed depends on the depth and nature of the ground. If the earth is soft and easy to work, at 20&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;ft) depth a crew of four workers can excavate a horizontal length of 40&nbsp;m (130&nbsp;ft) per day. When the vertical shaft reaches 40&nbsp;m (130&nbsp;ft), they can excavate only 20 meters horizontally per day and at 60&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;ft) in depth this drops below 5 horizontal meters per day. In Algeria, a common speed is just 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft) per day at a depth of 15&nbsp;m (49&nbsp;ft). Deep, long qanats (which many are) require years and even decades to construct.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-10"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-5"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>The excavated material is usually transported by means of leather bags up the vertical shafts. It is mounded around the vertical shaft exit, providing a barrier that prevents windblown or rain driven debris from entering the shafts. These mounds may be covered to provide further protection to the qanat. From the air, these shafts look like a string of bomb craters.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-6"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>The qanat's water-carrying channel must have a sufficient downward slope that water flows easily. However the downward gradient must not be so great as to create conditions under which the water transitions between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_flow" title="Supercritical flow">supercritical</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcritical_flow" title="Subcritical flow">subcritical flow</a>; if this occurs, the waves that result can result in severe erosion that can damage or destroy the qanat. The choice of the slope is a trade off between erosion and sedimentation. Highly sloped tunnels are subject to more erosion as water flows at a higher speed. On the other hand, less sloped tunnels need frequent maintenance due to the problem of sedimentation.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri_21-1"><a href="#cite_note-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri-21">[21]</a></sup> A lower downward gradient also contributes to reducing the solid contents and contamination in water.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri_21-2"><a href="#cite_note-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri-21">[21]</a></sup> In shorter qanats the downward gradient varies between 1:1000 and 1:1500, while in longer qanats it may be almost horizontal. Such precision is routinely obtained with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_level" title="Spirit level">spirit level</a> and string.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-11"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-7"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>In cases where the gradient is steeper, underground waterfalls may be constructed with appropriate design features (usually linings) to absorb the energy with minimal erosion. In some cases the water power has been harnessed to drive underground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_mill" title="Water mill">mills</a>. If it is not possible to bring the outlet of the qanat out near the settlement, it is necessary to run a <i>jub</i> or canal overground. This is avoided when possible to limit pollution, warming and water loss due to evaporation.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-12"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-8"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>

<p>The vertical shafts may be covered to minimize blown-in sand. The channels of qanats must be periodically inspected for erosion or cave-ins, cleaned of sand and mud and otherwise repaired. For safety, air flow must be assured before entry.

One of them, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Drasiah&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Drasiah (page does not exist)">Drasiah</a> qanat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dmeir&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Dmeir (page does not exist)">Dmeir</a>, was completed in 2002. Selection criteria included the availability of a steady groundwater flow, social cohesion and willingness to contribute of the community using the qanat, and the existence of a functioning water-rights system.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

<p>Qanats used in conjunction with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_tower" title="Wind tower">wind tower</a> can provide cooling as well as a water supply. A wind tower is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house; of its four openings, the one opposite the wind direction is opened to move air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house. The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle" title="Bernoulli's principle">Bernoulli effect</a>) and draws cool air up from the qanat tunnel, mixing with it. The air from the qanat is drawn into the tunnel at some distance away and is cooled both by contact with the cool tunnel walls/water and by the transfer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat" title="Latent heat">latent heat</a> of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream. In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15&nbsp;°C reduction in the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still feels dry, so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp). Wind tower and qanat cooling have been used in desert climates for over 1000 years.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>By 400&nbsp;BCE, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia" title="Persia">Persian</a> engineers had mastered the technique of storing ice in the middle of summer in the desert.<sup id="cite_ref-Rael_25-0"><a href="#cite_note-Rael-25">[25]</a></sup>
</p><p>The ice could be brought in during the winters from nearby mountains, but in a more usual and sophisticated method they built a wall in the east–west direction near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhchal" title="Yakhchal">yakhchal</a> (ice pit). In winter, the qanat water would be channeled to the north side of the wall, whose shade made the water freeze more quickly, increasing the ice formed per winter day. Then the ice was stored in yakhchals—specially designed, naturally cooled refrigerators. A large underground space with thick insulated walls was connected to a qanat, and a system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windcatcher" title="Windcatcher">windcatchers</a> or wind towers was used to draw cool subterranean air up from the qanat to maintain temperatures inside the space at low levels, even during hot summer days. As a result, the ice melted slowly and was available year-round.<sup id="cite_ref-Rael_25-1"><a href="#cite_note-Rael-25">[25]</a></sup>

The length of the foggaras in this region is estimated to be thousands of kilometers.
</p><p>Although sources suggest that the foggaras may have been in use as early as 200&nbsp;CE, they were clearly in use by the 11th century after the Arabs took possession of the oases in the 10th century and the residents embraced Islam.

</p><p>The humidity of the oases is also used to supplement the water supply to the foggara. The temperature gradient in the vertical shafts causes air to rise by natural convection, causing a draft to enter the foggara. The moist air of the agricultural area is drawn into the foggara in the opposite direction to the water run-off. In the foggara it condenses on the tunnel walls and the air passes out of the vertical shafts. This condensed moisture is available for reuse.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

<p>According to Herodotus, qanat irrigation technology was introduced to Egypt by the Achaemenid king <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I" title="Darius I">Darius I</a> during his reign of 522 BCE-486 BCE, which is supported by the historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_T._Olmstead" title="Albert T.

</p><p>There are four main oases in the Egyptian desert. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharga_Oasis" title="Kharga Oasis">Kharga Oasis</a> is one that has been extensively studied. There is evidence that as early as the second half of the 5th century BCE water brought in qanats was being used. The qanats were excavated through water-bearing sandstone rock, which seeps into the channel, with water collected in a basin behind a small dam at the end. The width is approximately 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in), but the height ranges from 5 to 9 meters; it is likely that the qanat was deepened to enhance seepage when the water table dropped (as is also seen in Iran). From there the water was used to irrigate fields.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-9"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Wuttman_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-Wuttman-28">[28]</a></sup>
</p><p>There is another instructive structure located at the Kharga oasis. A well that apparently dried up was improved by driving a side shaft through the easily penetrated sandstone (presumably in the direction of greatest water seepage) into the hill of Ayn-Manâwîr to allow collection of additional water. After this side shaft had been extended, another vertical shaft was driven to intersect the side shaft. Side chambers were built, and holes bored into the rock—presumably at points where water seeped from the rocks—are evident.<sup id="cite_ref-Wuttman_28-1"><a href="#cite_note-Wuttman-28">[28]</a></sup>

<p>The territory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> was home to numerous kahrizes many centuries ago. Archaeological findings suggest that long before the ninth century CE, kahrizes by which the inhabitants brought potable and irrigation water to their settlements were in use in Azerbaijan. Traditionally, kahrizes were built and maintained by a group of masons called 'Kankans' with manual labour. The profession was handed down from father to son.
</p><p>It is estimated that until the 20th century, nearly 1500 kahrizes, of which as many as 400 were in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhichevan_Autonomous_Republic" title="Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic">Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic</a>, existed in Azerbaijan. However, following the introduction of electric and fuel-pumped wells during Soviet times, kahrizes were neglected.

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisthenes" title="Callisthenes">Callisthenes</a>, the Persians were using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock" title="Water clock">water clocks</a> in 328&nbsp;BCE to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Qanats of Gonabad and kariz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zibad" title="Zibad">Zibad</a>, dates back to 500&nbsp;BCE. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz" title="Nowruz">Nowruz</a></i>, <i>Chelah</i>, or <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yald%C4%81" title="Yaldā">Yaldā</a></i> – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years.<sup id="cite_ref-Qanat_42-0"><a href="#cite_note-Qanat-42">[42]</a></sup>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock" title="Water clock">Water clock</a>, or <i>Fenjaan</i>, was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from the Qanats of Gonabad until it was replaced by more accurate current clocks.<sup id="cite_ref-amordadnews.com_43-0"><a href="#cite_note-amordadnews.com-43">[43]</a></sup> Many of the Iranian qanats bear some characteristics which allow us to call them feat of engineering, considering the intricate techniques used in their construction. The eastern and central regions of Iran hold the most qanats due to low precipitation and lack of permanent surface streams, whereas a small number of qanats can be found in the northern and western parts which receive more rainfall and enjoy some permanent rivers. Respectively the provinces Khorasan Razavi, Southern Khorasan, Isfahan and Yazd accommodate the most qanats, but from the viewpoint of water discharge the provinces Isfahan, Khorasan Razavi, Fars and Kerman are ranked first to fourth.
</p><p>Henri Golbot explored the genesis of the qanat in his 1979 publication, <span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">Les Qanats. Une technique d'acquisition de l'eau</i></span> (The Qanats. a Technique for Obtaining Water),<sup id="cite_ref-Golbot_1979_44-0"><a href="#cite_note-Golbot_1979-44">[44]</a></sup> He argues that the ancient Iranians made use of the water that the miners wished to get rid of it, and founded a basic system named qanat or Kariz to supply the required water to their farm lands. According to Goblot, this innovation took place in the northwest of the present Iran somewhere bordering Turkey and later was introduced to the neighboring Zagros Mountains.
</p><p>According to an inscription left by Sargon II, the king of Assyria, In 714&nbsp;BCE he invaded the city of Uhlu lying in the northwest of Uroomiye lake that lay in the territory of Urartu empire, and then he noticed that the occupied area enjoyed a very rich vegetation even though there was no river running across it. So he managed to discover the reason why the area could stay green, and realized that there were some qanats behind the matter. In fact it was Ursa, the king of the region, who had rescued the people from thirst and turned Uhlu into a prosperous and green land. Goblot believes that the influence of the Medeans and Achaemenids made the technology of qanat spread from Urartu (in the western north of Iran and near the present border between Iran and Turkey) to all over the Iranian plateau.
It was an Achaemenid ruling that in case someone succeeded in constructing a qanat and bringing groundwater to the surface in order to cultivate land, or in renovating an abandoned qanat, the tax he was supposed to pay the government would be waived not only for him but also for his successors for up to 5 generations. During this period, the technology of qanat was in its heyday and it even spread to other countries. For example, following Darius's order, Silaks the naval commander of the Persian army and Khenombiz the royal architect managed to construct a qanat in the oasis of Kharagha in Egypt. Beadnell believes that qanat construction dates back to two distinct periods: they were first constructed by the Persianse, and later the Romans dug some other qanats during their reign in Egypt from 30&nbsp;BCE to 395&nbsp;CE. The magnificent temple built in this area during Darius's reign shows that there was a considerable population depending on the water of qanats. Ragerz has estimated this population to be 10,000 people. The most reliable document confirming the existence of qanats at this time was written by Polybius who states that: "the streams are running down from everywhere at the base of Alborz mountain, and people have transferred too much water from a long distance through some subterranean canals by spending much cost and labor."
</p><p>During the Seleucid Era, which began after the occupation of Iran by Alexander, it seems that the qanats were abandoned.
</p><p>In terms of the situation of qanats during this era, some historical records have been found. In a study by Russian orientalist scholars it has been mentioned that: the Persians used the side branches of rivers, mountain springs, wells and qanats to supply water. The subterranean galleries excavated to obtain groundwater were named as qanat. These galleries were linked to the surface through some vertical shafts which were sunk in order to get access to the gallery to repair it if necessary.
</p><p>According to the historical records, the Parthian kings did not care about the qanats the way the Achaemenid kings and even Sassanid kings did. As an instance, Arsac III, one of the Parthian kings, destroyed some qanats in order to make it difficult for Seleucid Antiochus to advance further while fighting him. The historical records from this time indicate a perfect regulation on both water distribution and farmlands. All the water rights were recorded in a special document which was referred to in case of any transaction. The lists of farmlands – whether private or governmental – were kept at the tax department. During this period there were some official rulings on qanats, streams, construction of dam, operation and maintenance of qanats, etc. The government proceeded to repair or dredge the qanats that were abandoned or destroyed for any reason, and construct the new qanats if necessary. A document written in the Pahlavi language pointed out the important role of qanats in developing the cities at that time. In Iran, the advent of Islam, which coincided with the overthrow of the Sassanid dynasty, brought about a profound change in religious, political, social and cultural structures. But the qanats stayed intact, because the economic infrastructure, including qanats was of great importance to the Arabs. As an instance, M. Lombard reports that the Moslem clerics who lived during Abbasid period, such as Abooyoosef Ya’qoob (died 798&nbsp;CE) stipulated that whoever can bring water to the idle lands in order to cultivate, his tax would be waived and he would be entitled to the lands cultivated. Therefore, this policy did not differ from that of the Achaemenids in not getting any tax from the people who revived abandoned lands. The Arabs' supportive policy on qanats was so successful that even the holy city of Mecca gained a qanat too. The Persian historian Hamdollah Mostowfi writes: "Zobeyde Khatoon (Haroon al-Rashid's wife) constructed a qanat in Mecca. After the time of Haroon al-Rashid, during the caliph Moghtader's reign this qanat fell into decay, but he rehabilitated it, and the qanat was rehabilitated again after it collapsed during the reign of two other caliphs named Ghaem and Naser. After the era of the caliphs this qanat completely fell into ruin because the desert sand filled it up, but later Amir Choopan repaired the qanat and made it flow again in Mecca."<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>There are also other historical texts proving that the Abbasids were concerned about qanats. For example, according to the "Incidents of Abdollah bin Tahir's Time" written by Gardizi, in 830&nbsp;CE a terrible earthquake struck the town of Forghaneh and reduced many homes to rubble. The inhabitants of Neyshaboor used to come to Abdollah bin Tahir in order to request him to intervene, for they fought over their qanats and found the relevant instruction or law on qanat as a solution neither in the prophet's quotations nor in the clerics' writings. So Abdollah bin Tahir managed to bring together all the clergymen from throughout Khorasan and Iraq to compile a book entitled <i>Alghani</i> (The Book of Qanat). This book collected all the rulings on qanats which could be of use to whoever wanted to judge a dispute over this issue. Gardizi added that this book was still applicable to his time, and everyone made references to this book.
</p><p>One can deduce from these facts that during the above-mentioned period the number of qanats was so considerable that the authorities were prompted to put together some legal instructions concerning them. Also it shows that from the ninth to eleventh centuries the qanats that were the hub of the agricultural systems were also of interest to the government. Apart from The Book of Alghani, which is considered as a law booklet focusing on qanat-related rulings based on Islamic principles, there is another book about groundwater written by Karaji in 1010. This book, entitled <i>Extraction of Hidden Waters</i>, examines just the technical issues associated with the qanat and tries to answer the common questions such as how to construct and repair a qanat, how to find a groundwater supply, how to do leveling, etc.. Some of the innovations described in this book were introduced for the first time in the history of hydrogeology, and some of its technical methods are still valid and can be applied in qanat construction. The content of this book implies that its writer (Karaji) did not have any idea that there was another book on qanats compiled by the clergymen.
</p><p>There are some records dating back to that time, signifying their concern about the legal vicinity of qanats. For example, Mohammad bin Hasan quotes Aboo-Hanifeh that in case someone constructs a qanat in abandoned land, someone else can dig another qanat in the same land on the condition that the second qanat is 500 zera’ (375 meters) away from the first one.
</p><p>Ms. Lambton quotes Moeen al-din Esfarzi who wrote the book <i>Rowzat al-Jannat</i> (the garden of paradise) that Abdollah bin Tahir (from the Taherian dynasty) and Ismaeel Ahmed Samani (from the Samani dynasty) had several qanats constructed in Neyshaboor. Later, in the 11th century, a writer named Nasir Khosrow acknowledged all those qanats with the following words: "Neyshaboor is located in a vast plain at a distance of 40 Farsang (≈240 km) from Serakhs and 70 Farsang (≈420 km) from Mary (Marv) ... all the qanats of this city run underground, and it is said that an Arab who was offended by the people of Neyshaboor has complained that; what a beautiful city Neyshaboor could have become if its qanats would have flowed on the ground surface and instead its people would have been underground." These documents all certify the importance of qanats during the Islamic history within the cultural territories of Iran.

<p>In the 13th century, the invasion of Iran by Mongolian tribes reduced many qanats and irrigation systems to ruin, and many qanats were deserted and dried up. Later, in the era of the Ilkhanid dynasty especially at the time of Ghazan Khan and his Persian minister Rashid al-Din Fazl-Allah, some measures were taken to revive the qanats and irrigation systems. There is a 14th-century book entitled <i>Al-Vaghfiya Al-Rashidiya</i> (Rashid's Deeds of Endowment) that names all the properties located in Yazd, Shiraz, Maraghe, Tabriz, Isfahan and Mowsel that Rashid Fazl-Allah donated to the public or religious places. This book mentions many qanats running at that time and irrigating a considerable area of farmland. At the same time, another book, entitled <i>Jame’ al-Kheyrat</i>, was written by Seyyed Rokn al-Din on the same subject as Rashid's book. In this book, Seyyed Rokn al-Din names the properties he donated in the region of Yazd. These deeds of endowment indicate that much attention was given to the qanats during the reign of Ilkhanids, but it is attributable to their Persian ministers, who influenced them.<sup id="cite_ref-Qanat_42-1"><a href="#cite_note-Qanat-42">[42]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the years 1984–1985 the ministry of energy took a census of 28,038 qanats whose total discharge was 9 billion cubic meters. In the years 1992–1993 the census of 28,054 qanats showed a total discharge of 10 billion cubic meters. 10 years later in 2002–2003 the number of the qanats was reported as 33,691 with a total discharge of 8 billion cubic meters.
</p><p>In the restricted regions there are 317,225 wells, qanats and springs that discharge 36,719 million cubic meters water a year, out of which 3,409 million cubic meters is surplus to the aquifer capacity. in 2005, in the country as a whole, there were 130,008 deep wells with a discharge of 31,403 million cubic meter, 33,8041 semi deep wells with a discharge of 13,491 million cubic meters, 34,355 qanats with a discharge of 8,212 million cubic meters, and 55,912 natural springs with a discharge of 21,240 million cubic meters.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>

<p>In India, there are karez (qanat) systems are located at Bidar, Bijapur, Burhanpur "(Kundi Bhandara)" and Aurgangabad. The Bidar karez systems were probably the first one to have ever been dug in India. It dates to the Bahmani period. Bidar has three karez systems as per Gulam Yazdani's documentation.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> Other than Naubad there are two more karez systems in Bidar, "Shukla Theerth" and "Jamna Mori". The Shukla theerth is the longest karez system in Bidar. The mother well of this karez has been discovered by near Gornalli Kere, a historic embankment. The third system called Jamna mori is more of a distribution system within the old city area with many channels crisscrossing the city lanes.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Restoration efforts commenced in 2014, with the desilting and excavation of the Naubad Karez in 2015, uncovering 27 vertical shafts linked to the Karez.

The cleaning of karez has led to bringing water to higher areas of the plateau, and it has in turn recharged the wells in the vicinity.
</p><p>The Bijapur karez system is much more complicated. A reveals that it has surface water and groundwater connections. The Bijapur karez is a network of shallow masonry aqueducts, terracotta/ceramic pipes, embankments and reservoirs, tanks etc. All weave together a network to ensure water reaches the old city. The system starts at Torwi and extends as shallow aqueducts and further as pipes; further it becomes deeper from the Sainik school area onward which exists as a tunnel dug through the geology. The system can be clearly traced up to Ibrahim Roja.
</p><p>In Aurangabad the karez systems are called nahars. These are shallow aqueducts running through the city. There are 14 aqueducts in Aurangabad. The Nahar-i-Ambari is the oldest and longest. Its again a combination of shallow aqueducts, open channels, pipes, cisterns, etc. The source of water is a surface water body. The karez has been constructed right below the bed of lake. The lake water seeps through the soil into the Karez Gallery.
</p><p>In Burhanpur the karez is called "Kundi-Bhandara", sometimes wrongly referred to as"Khuni Bhandara". The system is approx 6&nbsp;km long starts from the alluvial fans of Satpura hills in the north of the town. Unlike Bidar, Bijapur and Aurgangabad the System airvents are round in shape. Inside the Karez one could see lime depositions on the walls. The Systems ends to carry water further to palaces and public fountains through pipe line.

</p><p>The acute shortage of water resources give water a decisive role in the regional conflicts arose in the course of history of Balochistan. Therefore, in Balochistan, the possession of water resources is more important than ownership of land itself. Hence afterward a complex system for the collection, channeling and distribution of water was developed in Balochistan. Similarly, the distribution and unbiased flow of water to different stockholders also necessitate the importance of different societal classes in Balochistan in general and particularly in Makoran. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarrishta&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Sarrishta (page does not exist)">sarrishta</a> (literally, head of the chain) is responsible for administration of channel. He normally owns the largest water quota. Under sarrishta, there are several heads of owners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Issadar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Issadar (page does not exist)">issadar</a> who also possessed larger water quotas. The social hierarchy within Baloch society of Makoran depends upon the possession of largest quotas of water. The role of sarrishta in some cases hierarchical and passing from generations within the family and he must have the knowledge of the criteria of unbiased distribution of water among different issadar.
</p><p>The sharing of water is based on a complex indigenous system of measurement depends upon time and space particularly to the phases of moon; the hangams. Based on seasonal variations and share of water the hangams are apportioned among various owners over period of seven or fourteen days. However, in some places, instead of hangam, anna used which is based on twelve-hour period for each quota. Therefore, if a person own 16 quotas it means that he is entitled for water for eight days in high seasons and 16 days in winter when water level went down as well as expectation of winter rain (Baharga) in Makran region. The twelve-hour water quota again subdivided into several sub-fractions of local measuring scales such as tas or pad (Dr Gul Hasan Pro VC LUAWMS, 2 day National conference on Kech).

<p>In Oman from the Iron Age period (found in Salut, Bat and other sites) a system of underground aqueducts called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflaj_Irrigation_Systems_of_Oman" title="Aflaj Irrigation Systems of Oman">Falaj</a>' were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently sloping horizontal tunnels.

In the long run, the ganat system is not only economical but also sustainable for irrigation and agricultural purposes... The ground water flow was known to depend on grain size of sediments, and, therefore, the tunnels in qanats are filled in with coarser material than the surrounding hose geological formations. The qanats are constructed mainly along the valleys where Quartenary sediments are deposited.</q></cite><span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.btitle=Underground+Aqueducts+Handbook&amp;rft.pages=244&amp;rft.pub=CRC+Press&amp;rft.date=2016-11-22&amp;rft.isbn=9781498748308&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AQanat"></span></span>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The structure of the Lorentz transformations follows purely from the absence of privileged inertial reference frames and the group structure (closure under composition) of the transformations---two assumptions that are simple and physically necessary. The existence of an invariant speed is \textit{not} a necessary assumption, and in fact is a consequence of the principle of relativity (though the finite value of this speed must, of course, be obtained from experiment). Von Ignatowsky derived this result in 1911, but it is still not widely known and is absent from most textbooks. Here we present a completely elementary proof of the result, suitable for use in an introductory course in special relativity.

We all know how frustrating it is when you can’t remember the name of a song or any of the words but the tune is stuck in your head. Today at <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-on/">Search On</a>, we announced that Google can now help you figure it out—no lyrics, artist name or perfect pitch required.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-block-key="9u86d">Hum to search for your earworm</h3><p data-block-key="0lzz8">Starting today, you can hum, whistle or sing a melody to Google to solve your earworm.&nbsp;On your mobile device, open the latest version of the Google app or find your <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/easier-access-search-chrome-and-gmail-ios-14/">Google Search widget</a>, tap the mic icon and say “what's this song?” or click the “Search a song” button.&nbsp;Then start humming for 10-15 seconds. On Google Assistant, it’s just as simple. Say “Hey Google, what’s this song?” and then hum the tune. This feature is currently available in English on iOS, and in more than 20 languages on Android. And we hope to expand this to more languages in the future.</p><p data-block-key="pyk6x">After you’re finished humming, our machine learning algorithm helps identify potential song matches. And don’t worry, you don’t need perfect pitch to use this feature. We’ll show you the most likely options based on the tune. Then you can select the best match and explore information on the song and artist, view any accompanying music videos or listen to the song on your favorite music app, find the lyrics, read analysis and even check out other recordings of the song when available.&nbsp;</p></div>

An easy way to explain it is that a song’s melody is like its fingerprint: They each have their own unique identity. We've built machine learning models that can match your hum, whistle or singing to the right “fingerprint.”</p><p data-block-key="s197q">When you hum a melody into Search, our machine learning models transform the audio into a number-based sequence representing the song’s melody. Our models are trained to identify songs based on a variety of sources, including humans singing, whistling or humming, as well as studio recordings. The algorithms also take away all the other details, like accompanying instruments and the voice's timbre and tone. What we’re left with is the song’s number-based sequence, or the fingerprint.</p><p data-block-key="rn6n4">We compare these sequences to thousands of songs from around the world and identify potential&nbsp; matches in real time. For example, if you listen to Tones and I’s “Dance Monkey,” you’ll recognize the song whether it was sung, whistled, or hummed. Similarly, our machine learning models recognize the melody of the studio-recorded version of the song, which we can use to match it with a person’s hummed audio.&nbsp;</p><p data-block-key="9qwp7">This builds on the work of our Research team’s <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/googles-next-generation-music.html">music recognition technology</a>. We launched Now Playing on the Pixel 2 in 2017, using deep neural networks to bring low-power recognition of music to mobile devices. In 2018, we brought the same technology to the SoundSearch feature in the Google app and expanded the reach to a catalog of millions of songs. This new experience takes it a step further, because now we can recognize songs without the lyrics or original song. All we need is a hum.</p></div>

<h2>Why I made this site</h2>

<p>
When our Japanese-Finnish son was born, we wanted to find a name that would work in both languages. To help with the search I wrote a simple tool for personal use to look through
all the names in both Japanese and Finnish, finding ones which appear in both.
</p>
<p>Thinking others might find it useful as well, years later I went back and improved it to
the point that I could release it online, which is the page you are now on.</p>
<p>This tool currently supports 58 different languages or cultures. For example if you are German and your wife is Klingon, <a href="https://mixedname.com/german_klingon_masculine_names">it can tell you</a> that the only name option is "Arne". In other words, it finds the intersection of two name lists.
Some languages don't have many options, so it also tries a fuzzy search and some other strategies as well.</p>
<p>Since all of these are found by software, there are no guarantees that the names are any good (for instance it sometimes suggests "Timo" for an Italian name, which wouldn't be great), so it is intended to only give you ideas to consider.</p>
<p>Hope you like it. Oh, and here are the <a href="https://mixedname.com/finnish_japanese_masculine_names">Japanese-Finnish names</a> it found for us. We ended up going with a completely unique one that wasn't in the list, but just having a list to work with was a nice start for our name brainstorming session!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The LockBit crew is claiming to have leaked all of the data it stole from Boeing late last month, after the passenger jet giant apparently refused to pay the ransom demand.</p>
<p>The gang <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1722914117994885515">dumped</a> the files online early Friday morning. This latest leak includes about 50GB of data in the form of compressed archives and backup files for various systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full release comes after the extortionists uploaded some files said to be related to company finances and marketing activities as well as supplier details.</p>

    

<p>Screenshots of the stolen info showed several <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1722957984295223524">Citrix logs</a>, which has led to some <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1722957984295223524">speculation</a> that LockBit exploited <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/31/mass_exploitation_citrix_bleed/">Citrix Bleed</a> to break into the defense contractor's systems. Boeing has so far refused to comment on the initial point of entry into its systems.</p>

        


        

<p>Neither data dump has been verified by <em>The Register</em>, and Boeing declined to answer specific questions about the incident or the stolen files. A spokesperson sent us this comment via email:</p>

<p>According to security researcher Dominic Alvieri, the files also contained corporate emails.</p>
<p>"I haven't gone over the whole data set but Boeing emails and a few others stand out as useful for those with malicious intent," Alvieri told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/boeing_cyber_incident/">Boeing acknowledges cyberattack on parts and distribution biz</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/31/mass_exploitation_citrix_bleed/">'Mass exploitation' of Citrix Bleed underway as ransomware crews pile in</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/10/ransomedvc_shut_down/">Strangely enough, no one wants to buy a ransomware group that has cops' attention</a></li>
</ul>
<p>LockBit first <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/30/security_in_brief/">listed</a> the aircraft giant on its dark-web site on October 28, and on November 2 Boeing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/boeing_cyber_incident/">confirmed</a> to <em>The Register</em> it had suffered an IT intrusion. At the time, a spokesperson said the break-in affected the manufacturer's parts and distribution business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By then, however, the ransomware crew had removed Boeing from its leaks site and told the malware librarians at VX Underground that it was negotiating with the US corporation. It appears that the negotiations failed — or possibly the multinational determined that the criminals hadn't accessed any sensitive info, and thus it wouldn't pay to pay the extortion demand, or no talks ever actually took place — and Boeing is now back on the LockBit extortion website&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also this week, China's largest bank, ICBC, was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/10/icbc_ransomware/">hit by a ransomware attack</a> that disrupted financial services systems on Thursday Beijing time. LockBit <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1722982061298913622">told VX-Underground</a> that it was was responsible for this break-in, too. ®</p>

        <p>On the benefits and lack of demerits of nicotine (research up to 2015)</p>
        
        
      </div><div id="markdownBody">
        
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In 2011, I became curious about nicotine gum/patches as a possible alternative stimulant to <a href="https://gwern.net/modafinil" id="gwern-modafinil" title="'Modafinil', Gwern 2009">modafinil</a>: its much shorter half-life makes it more useful for evenings or scenarios like needing a quick alert on a long drive. I looked briefly into the nicotine/tobacco research to see whether there was convincing evidence that nicotine on its own, without any tobacco or smoke-related delivery mechanism, is either more harmful than most stimulants or likely to lead to severe addiction to tobacco as a ‘gateway drug’.</p>
            <p>The psychological effects of nicotine as a stimulant are long established by a scattershot literature, so there are possible benefits.</p>
            <p>Cost-wise, much of the nicotine/tobacco literature willfully conflates the two, leading to misleading attribution of the harm of tobacco to nicotine; many associations with harm are confounded by past or present tobacco use (eg. <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2020-kenkel.pdf" id="kenkel-et-al-2020" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="E-Cigarettes and Respiratory Disease: A Replication, Extension, and Future Directions"><span><span> <span>et al</span> <span>2020</span></span></span></a>), but when pure nicotine is examined, as in patch/GUM NRT, the harms appeared minimal: like all stimulants, nicotine may raise blood pressure somewhat, and is addictive to some degree, but the risks do not appear much more strikingly harmful than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#bodyContent">caffeine</a> or modafinil (and certainly appear less than the many commonly-used amphetamines). Animal experiments are, like usual, highly ambiguous, of low quality, and of doubtful relevance to humans. There is little evidence from the NRT literature that ‘never-smokers’ like myself are all that likely to become highly addicted, and minimal epidemiological evidence of harm from NRT use over the past 3 decades it has been available.</p>
            <p>‘Vaping’ is another story: few experiments have been done, and its popularity is recent enough that any harms are poorly understood other than it can’t possibly be remotely as harmful as tobacco smoking, and its delivery mechanism plausibly is much more addictive than gum/patch delivery would be.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am personally comfortable using nicotine gum (but not vaping) once in a while, and have done so since 2011 without any noticeable problems or escalation in usage frequency.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>One of the reasons tobacco became so popular in the 1600s, along with tea &amp; coffee (for their caffeine), was that nicotine is a powerful stimulant. Obvious enough; it affects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Central_nervous_system" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#bodyContent">tons of systems</a>. Less obvious is that nicotine has many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Medical" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#bodyContent">beneficial effects</a> (and these benefits may be related to <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/animal-smoking-studieshtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">anomalous</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/smoking-followuphtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">smoking</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/what-anti-smoking-evidencehtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">results</a><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>); the infamous deadliness of smoking would seem to be almost solely from the smoke, not the nicotine. Even less obvious is that nicotine itself may not be especially addictive, and its addictiveness is genetically modulated<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. (If nicotine was all that was going on, why do smokers struggle so much with their transition to NRT en route to quitting entirely? And why do so many people use nicotine gum or patches occasionally for long periods without being addicted, or quitting easily?)</p>
        <p>All of the harm seems to stem from tobacco, and tobacco smoking in particular; this is not necessarily obvious because almost everyone casually conflates tobacco with nicotine (especially public education programs<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>), treating them as a single synonymous evil I dub “nicbacco”. When someone or something says that “nicotine” is harmful and you drill down to the original references for their claims, the references often turn out to actually be talking about tobacco rather than nicotine gums or patches<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Other methodological issues include comparing to current smokers rather than former smokers or failing to control for the subjects being the sort of people who would begin such a societally-disapproved activity like smoking; the studies typically aren’t designed properly even for showing an effect: you need a study which finds deficits in smokers but not in non-smokers <em>or</em> former smokers (eg. <a href="https://www.medlive.cn/uploadfile/2011/1013/20111013114126307.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Smoking-related prospective memory deficits in a real-world task"><span><span><span title="et al">Heffernan</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2011</span></span></span></a> or <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414283" data-link-icon="JAMA" data-link-icon-type="text,sans,quad" title="Smoking History and Cognitive Function in Middle Age From the Whitehall II Study"><span><span><span title="et al">Sabia</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2008</span></span></span></a>/<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2012-sabia.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Impact of smoking on cognitive decline in early old age: the Whitehall II cohort study"><span><span><span title="et al">Sabia</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2012</span></span></span></a> although neither enables nicotine inferences since there was no nicotine-only control group).

          <blockquote>
            <p>The results showed that 40% of smokers receiving the [anti-nicotine] vaccine gave up smoking for nearly six months of follow-up; the highest smoking cessation rate (57%) was associated with the highest antibody response. These results are better than those seen in most nicotine replacement trials, but it is interesting that an unusually high proportion (31%) of the smokers receiving placebo also quit smoking for up to six months [Holman J (2005). “Helping patients kick the habit”. American Diabetes Association, DOC News 2, 1-2].</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>My take away is that there is addiction but it’s drastically overestimated by almost everyone and may been conflated with the habit-formation capability; the latter makes nicotine doubly valuable, but the former means we will want to be more careful with the nicotine than with modafinil or caffeine, where the main consequence of carelessness is tolerance rendering the stimulant useless or messing up our sleep for a few days.</p>
          <p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus#Health_effects" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus#bodyContent">snus</a>, a sort of chewing tobacco, has been studied extensively in Sweden where it is very popular and has been credited with large reductions in the smoking rate<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, and with little hard evidence of harm from snus use<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.

          <blockquote>
            <p>Modern smokeless tobacco products contain nicotine in addictive doses to satisfy smokers’ cravings. University research has documented that smokers who switch to smokeless tobacco reduce their risk for all smoking-related illnesses, including oral cancer. On average, smokers live 8 years less than those who never used tobacco; smokeless users lose just 15 days. Statistically, smokeless users have about the same risk of dying as automobile users.</p>

            <p>“People are unreasonably afraid of nicotine”, Dr.&nbsp;Shiffman said. “The majority of smokers believe that nicotine causes cancer and is a big player in the harm caused by cigarettes.” In fact, carbon monoxide, tar and the countless toxic particles in cigarette smoke are what promote illness. Although smokers may become dependent on nicotine, it does not appear to raise the risk of cancer, lung disease or heart disease. Early reports that people who smoked cigarettes while wearing a patch stood an increased risk of heart attack proved unfounded years ago.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Dr.&nbsp;Siegel, whose graduate school manuscripts Dr.&nbsp;Glantz used to read, says e-cigarette pessimists are stuck on the idea that anything that looks like smoking is bad. “They are so blinded by this ideology that they are not able to see e-cigarettes objectively,” he said. Dr.&nbsp;Glantz disagrees. “E-cigarettes seem like a good idea,” he said, “but they aren’t.”…Public health experts like to say that people smoke for the nicotine but die from the tar. And the reason e-cigarettes have caused such a stir is that they take the deadly tar out of the equation while offering the nicotine fix and the sensation of smoking. For all that is unknown about the new devices - they have been on the American market for only seven years - most researchers agree that puffing on one is far less harmful than smoking a traditional cigarette…E-cigarette skeptics have also raised concerns about nicotine addiction. But many researchers say that the nicotine by itself is not a serious health hazard. Nicotine-replacement therapies like lozenges and patches have been used for years. Some even argue that nicotine is a lot like caffeine: an addictive substance that stimulates the mind. “Nicotine may have some adverse health effects, but they are relatively minor,” said Dr.&nbsp;Neal L. Benowitz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who has spent his career studying the pharmacology of nicotine…“Part of the furniture for us is that the tobacco industry is evil and everything they do has to be opposed,” said John Britton, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham in England, and the director for the U.K. Center for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies. “But one doesn’t want that to get in the way of public health.”</p>

                  <p>A 2011 ADHD review<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> covers nicotine:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><span>Dozens of studies have assessed the effects of nicotine on cognition in healthy, nicotine-naïve samples including studies of memory (<span><span title="et al">McClernon</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2003</span></span>), attention (<span><span title="et al">Froeliger</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2009</span></span>) and inhibitory control (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). In a recent meta-analysis of 48 studies in which nicotine was administered to non-smokers or only minimally deprived smokers (<span><span title="et al">Heishman</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2010</span></span>), nicotine was shown to have positive effects on multiple domains including attention and working memory. Twenty-nine studies specifically assessed non-smokers and among those, positive effects were observed for reaction time on tests of sustained (or alerting) attention and working memory.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Studies of the effects of nicotine on inhibitory control were not included in the meta-analysis, but a handful of studies suggest potential positive effects of nicotine on this domain. Two small studies have observed acute (<span><span title="et al">Levin</span> <span>et al</span> <span>1998</span></span>) and chronic (<span><span title="et al">McClernon</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2006</span></span>) transdermal nicotine administration to result in trends toward decreases in errors of commission on a CPT task. Moreover, nicotine has been shown to reduce CPT commission errors in nonsmokers with schizophrenia (<span><span title="et al">Barr</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2007</span></span>), non-smokers low in attentiveness (Poltavski and Petros, 2006); and decrease stop signal reaction time in adolescents nonsmokers with ADHD (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). Despite these findings, nicotine was not shown to improve response inhibition in adults with ADHD as measured with a CPT task (<span><span title="et al">Levin</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2001</span></span>).</span></p>

                <p>“Our brains normally make these associations between things that support our existence and environmental cues so that we conduct behaviors leading to successful lives. The brain sends a reward signal when we act in a way that contributes to our well being,” said Dr.&nbsp;John A. Dani, professor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the study. “However, nicotine commandeers this subconscious learning process in the brain so we begin to behave as though smoking is a positive action.” Dani said that environmental events linked with smoking can become cues that prompt the smoking urge. Those cues could include alcohol, a meal with friends, or even the drive home from work. To understand why these associations are so strong, Dani and Dr.&nbsp;Jianrong Tang, instructor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the report, decided to record brain activity of mice as they were exposed to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco.</p>
                <p>…“The brain activity change was just amazing,” Dani said. “Compared to injections of saline, nicotine strengthened neuronal connections-sometimes up to 200 percent. This strengthening of connections underlies new memory formation.”…“We found that nicotine could strengthen neuronal synaptic connections only when the so called reward centers sent a dopamine signal. That was a critical process in creating the memory associations even with bad behavior like smoking.”</p>

                <p>I have had success working around ‘Ugh’ reactions to various activities. I took the direct approach. I (intermittently) use nicotine lozenges as a stimulant while exercising. Apart from boosting physical performance and motivation it also happens to be the most potent substance I am aware of for increasing habit formation in the brain…</p>
                <p>And I do use nicotine for studying at times (usually patches that I have cut into the desired dose). Partly for learning mental habits and partly for enhanced focus and motivation without the agitation that comes (with methamphetamine (at least, for me)). Again, I don’t swear by it but it works…<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
                <p>I have never smoked a cigarette. Nor have I ever had a remote tendency towards addiction to any substance. That is even one of the reasons I gave when describing why this is an effective technique for me personally. I am more at risk of becoming addicted to discussing substances on the Internet than the substances themselves….</p>
                <p>I should note that the role nicotine lozenges are taking here is not primarily as a training reward, like giving the rat electronically stimulated orgasms when it presses the lever. Nicotine isn’t particularly strong in that role compared to alternatives (such as abusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate#bodyContent">Ritalin</a>), at least when it is not administered by a massive hit straight into the brain via the lungs. No, the particular potency of nicotine is that it potentates the formation of habits for activities undertaken while under the influence by means more fundamental than a ‘mere’ stimulus-reward mechanism. Habits that are found to be harder to extinct than an impulse to take a drug. This is what makes smoking so notoriously hard to quit even with patches and makes the use of fake cigarettes to suck on useful.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

            <p>The price is not an issue. Nicotine in the US is not as expensive as one might intuitively guess from sky-high cigarette prices &amp; widespread tobacco smuggling; perhaps due to the intrinsic low cost of nicotine or because it is politically unpalatable to tax products which are largely used by people quitting smoking, prices for a 2mg dose of nicotine is easily in the 15-20 cents range:</p>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>2mg may be too much for a non-smoker like me, in which case prices per dose drop further. Nor have I looked hard<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> for low prices; just grabbed random hits on Amazon. You could probably drive it down to the 5-10 cents range with canny shopping and buying in bulk (nicotine is an insecticide, not a perishable foodstuff, so you could buy years’ worth - just like with <a href="https://gwern.net/melatonin" id="gwern-melatonin" title="'Melatonin', Gwern 2008">melatonin</a>). One difficulty with gum, however, is that it’s hard to subdivide: nicotine evaporates from gum and so cutting up a 4mg piece of gum into 4 1mg pieces forces you to either use them all within a few hours, waste some pieces, or store them in some sort of air-tight wrapper for later use.</p>
            <p>Further, the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette#bodyContent">e-cigarettes</a> which use nicotine dissolved in water means that if you are willing to have the nicotine absorbed quickly (which would seem to slightly increase addiction risks), the price for a 2mg dose plummets even further; consider <a href="https://www.nicvape.com/store/p/48-1-liter-of-100-mg-ml.aspx">one liter</a> of fluid for e-cigarettes (<span data-year-original="2012" data-amount-original="232" data-year-current="2023" data-amount-current="306.11" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $232 in 2012 → real $306.11 in 2023">$306.11<span><sup>$232</sup><sub>2012</sub></span></span> as of 2012, but down to <span data-year-original="2013" data-amount-original="160" data-year-current="2023" data-amount-current="207.99" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $160 in 2013 → real $207.99 in 2023">$207.99<span><sup>$160</sup><sub>2013</sub></span></span> as of October 2013).

                <p>On the other hand, even if one does develop tolerance to nicotine, that simply suggests spacing it out or rotating with other stimulants. One could imagine a 3-day cycle: nicotine, caffeine, and modafinil.</p>

                <p>But the increase may not be all that large, especially at a low non-smoker dose; and if there is blood pressure increase, it may be perfectly tolerable.<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

                <p>You could become addicted despite everything. Hypothetically, this could then lead to tobacco use with all the attendant ills.</p>
                <p>This is a truly subjective one. Former smokers probably should not be monkeying about with nicotine. Some people are scared this might happen; others aren’t worried at all. Given what I’ve read about nicotine not being addictive but strengthening habits (see previous quotes from Wedrifid), I think this fear might be overblown.</p>

            <p>Nicotine gum or patch use seems to be extremely rare among people who have not previously smoked (“never smokers”), which makes it hard to judge the risk of developing dependence, or the risk of developing dependence and then moving on to tobacco.</p>
            <p>An example of the rarity comes from <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2008-gerlach.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Use of nicotine replacement therapy among never smokers in the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys"><span><span><span title="et al">Gerlach</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2008</span></span></span></a>: the authors examined a survey of <em>n</em> = 28,000; 8 never-smokers claimed use of nicotine-replacement therapy, but 6 self-reported tobacco use or had blood-levels too high or low - leaving just 2 (probably) valid examples.</p>

              <p>People who were addicted to the nicotine gum could easily find our questionnaire, because it was listed on top of the list in Google. In spite of this effective enrolment strategy, we identified only two never-users of tobacco among daily gum users, which suggests that NRT use in never-users of tobacco is a rare phenomenon. Similarly, a previous survey in people who responded to a newspaper ad that read: “Are you addicted to nicotine gum?” could not enrol any never smoker <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2004-hughes.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Misuse of and dependence on over-the-counter nicotine gum in a volunteer sample', Hughes et al 2004">[5]</a>.

In two surveys in the USA, 2.7% and 4.6% of school drug counsellors indicated that nicotine patches and gums were abused by adolescents, but these “NRT abusers” were mainly smokers who used NRT while smoking, and only 7% to 16% of these “NRT abusers” were never smokers [<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2005-hyland.pdf" id="hyland-et-al-2005" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Drug Counselor Report of Adolescents Abuse of Nicotine Replacement Therapy', Hyland et al 2006">27</a>].

Therefore, addiction to nicotine gum in never smokers is probably very rare. Furthermore, there may be few adverse consequences of being addicted to the nicotine gum, except for the financial cost and the inconvenience of permanent chewing. In particular, NRT products are safe even in patients with heart disease, [<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199612123352402" id="joseph-et-al-1996" data-link-icon="NEJM" data-link-icon-type="text,quad" title="'The safety of transdermal nicotine as an aid to smoking cessation in patients with cardiac disease', Joseph et al 1996">31</a>,<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/1997-mahmarian.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Nicotine Patch Therapy in Smoking Cessation Reduces the Extent of Exercise-Induced Myocardial Ischemia', Mahmarian et al 1997">32</a>] and there was no untoward effect of 5 years of nicotine gum use in the Lung Health Study [<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/1996-murray.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Safety of nicotine polacrilex gum used by 3,094 participants in the Lung Health Study', Murray et al 1996">33</a>].

              <p><span>…Taking a substance over a longer time than intended is a criterion for drug dependence (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), but long-term use does not necessarily imply dependence, because dependence requires other criteria, in particular unsuccessful attempts to quit and withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. Post-marketing data from the U.S., reported by the manufacturers, indicated that only 39 cases of dependence on the nicotine gum were reported per million prescriptions (<span><span title="et al">Spyker</span> <span>et al</span> <span>1996</span></span>). However, the limitations of post-marketing surveillance data are well known (</span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/biology/1999-brewer.pdf" id="brewer-colditz-1999" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Post-marketing surveillance and adverse drug reactions: Current perspectives and future needs">Brewer &amp; Colditz, 1999</a><span>), and survey data indicate that the prevalence of dependence on the nicotine gum in over-the-counter settings is substantially higher than that, at about 1% of ever users (<span><span title="et al">Hughes</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2004</span></span>). About one third of smokers report having ever used NRT products (</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1748084/pdf/v014p00359a.pdf" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cacdd4df20d20420f032a348a1e9026123719754.pdf" title="When California smokers use nicotine replacement therapy, most are trying to quit smoking">Al-Delaimy, Gilpin, &amp; Pierce, 2005</a>). Thus, even if only 1% of users became dependent on the gum, this would still represent tens of thousands of people…Even though some users may be dependent on the gum, it must be emphasized that there is no known adverse consequence of long-term use of NRT, except for the financial cost, and that the potential benefits (ie. prevent late relapse) far outweigh the drawbacks. This is probably why dependence on the nicotine gum has been generally downplayed in the literature (<a href="https://www.hri.global/files/2011/07/13/West_-_Abuse_Liability_-_copyright_refused.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.hri.global/b972f9499e9e5d8846a6c1d9e487d829eff52c5c.pdf" title="A comparison of the abuse liability and dependence potential of nicotine patch, gum, spray and inhaler"><span><span><span title="et al">West</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2000</span></span></span></a> [see also <a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/49.full" data-link-icon="bmj" data-link-icon-type="text,tri,sans" title="A prospective study of off-label use of, abuse of, and dependence on nicotine inhaler"><span><span><span title="et al">Hughes</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2005</span></span></span></a>]).</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>About 35% of users reported becoming addicted, but this was heavily dependent upon variety of nicotine. Among users who smoked normal tobacco cigarettes, 65% reported addiction. Among those who smoked e-cigarettes, only 25% reported addiction (and again, since there’s no time data, it’s possible these people switched to e-cigarettes because they were addicted and not vice versa). Among users of nicotine gum and lozenges, only 7% reported addiction, and only 1% reported major addiction. Although cigarettes are a known gigantic health/addiction risk, the nootropic community’s use of isolated nicotine as a stimulant seems from this survey (subject to the above caveat) to be comparatively but not completely safe.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>One approach to estimating addictiveness of nicotine gum or patches is to borrow a strategy from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611984/" id="fagerström-eissenberg-2012" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Dependence on Tobacco and Nicotine Products: a case for product-specific assessment"><span><span><span>Fagerstrom &amp; Eissenberg</span><span>2012</span></span></span></a> in looking at the success of various studies’ control groups (using nicotine gums or patches) in quitting during those studies:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The intention here was not to estimate the effect of the treatment but rather its placebo to determine how difficult it is to stop using a certain form of tobacco/nicotine product. Therefore, the success rate in the placebo group is used as indicators for difficulty abstaining. Table 2 shows that cigarette smokers, independent of treatment, show a success rate of roughly 10% with little variation (range 9.8-11.2). Those seeking to stop ST use have roughly more than double the success rate of cigarette smokers (range 19.1-33.0). In the study (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2013-tonnesen.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Varenicline to Stop Long-term Nicotine Replacement Use: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial">Tønnesen &amp; Mikkelsen, 2012</a>), where 69 long-term users of pure nicotine mostly in the form of gum, in average seven years, a success rate of 36% was observed. Those who become long-term users of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are recognized as heavy dependent smokers (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/1988-hajek.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Long-term use of nicotine chewing gum. Occurrence, determinants, and effect on weight gain">Hajek, Jackson, &amp; Belcher, 1988</a>), which also seemed to be true in this study. Their cigarette consumption before quitting was 24.5 per day and their recalled FTCD score from when they were smoking was a high 6.7. It can be hypothesized that this type of smoker would have had no better success rate in stopping than the 10% seen normally but when coming off long-term NRT, it was 36%. The 36% was obtained from a 1-year follow-up. Several of the smokeless studies reported success rates from 6 months. It is of interest to note that the authors excluded long-term patch users since it would have been unlikely to see a difference between active and placebo treatment due to the ease by which they normally can stop. Moreover, it is much more infrequent to observe long-term patch use (Shiffman, Hughes, Pillitteri, &amp; Burton, 2003). It seems as a patch is not very likely to be able to support a compulsive use pattern due to its little behavioral involvement and or pharmacokinetic nicotine uptake pattern. The data in Table 2 lead us to conclude that quitting cigarette smoking is more difficult than quitting ST (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2997603/" id="fagerström-et-al-2010" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Stopping smokeless tobacco with varenicline: randomized double blind placebo controlled trial">Fagerström, Gilljam, Metcalfe, Tonstad, &amp; Messig, 2010</a>) and, although there is only one study from the NR category, that quitting these products may be easiest (Tønnesen &amp; Mikkelsen, 2012).</p>

            <p>What does this imply for any never-smoker (not predisposed to tobacco use) using nicotine gum/patches judiciously and self-monitoring for signs of dependence, well aware of the dangers of tobacco use? Given the lack of observations despite large datasets, the low rates of dependence in smokers, the ease of quitting nicotine gum, and so on, my personal opinion is that the risk of dependency should be much lower than the smoker risks of 1-20% and then the risk even lower of then progressing to tobacco use. (In considering cost-benefit, it’s worth remembering that tobacco use has been quit successfully by many millions despite the notorious difficulty, and that the health outcomes of quitters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation#Health_benefits" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation#bodyContent">gradually heal</a> to the baseline of non-smokers.)</p>

          <p>So what’s the upshot? My reading has convinced me to at least give it a try and it has been useful (see the nicotine section of <a href="https://gwern.net/nootropic/nootropics#nicotine" id="gwern-nootropic-nootropics-nicotine">Nootropics</a>). The negatives universally seem to be long-term negatives, and even if nicotine turns out to be something I haul out only in a crisis or every few weeks, it would still have been worth investigating.</p>

Are they right? I don’t know. As deliciously contrarian as it would be to go around shocking people by seriously advocating tobacco use, it’s not a subject I’m interested in tackling. In philosophy, one is taught to not “try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much#bodyContent">prove too much</a>” (inviting people to <a href="https://gwern.net/modus" id="gwern-modus" title="'One Man’s Modus Ponens', Branwen 2012"><em>modus tollens</em> your <em>modus ponens</em></a>), to not do more philosophy than one <em>has</em> to; in programming, you learn to not become an “architecture astronaut” solving some hugely abstract version of your actual problem - such overreach invites disaster.</p>
          <p>It’s much easier for me to defend use of nicotine, so that’s all I try to do: nicotine is pretty much harmless, the studies are clear, the relevant areas &amp; studies comprehensible with not <em>too</em> much work, and I feel I can discuss it with a clean conscience. Really, about the worst you can say about pure nicotine use is that it might be a gateway to tobacco or that one’s blood pressure might increase, which are issues that can be easily addressed empirically via additional studies/surveys or by eg. measuring one’s own blood pressure after taking nicotine, respectively.</p>
          <p>But if I wanted to defend tobacco itself, I have abruptly expanded my task by <em>orders of magnitude</em>: now I need to deal with all the anti-smoking correlational studies, I need to defend an idiosyncratic interpretation of how the tobacco industry’s products have evolved over the last century, I need to defend not just nicotine but all the other substances in tobacco which might override its benefits, I need to explain why the nigh-universal consensus against tobacco is wrong and to give a historical account of how such an error could come into exist and then expand to be universal. This is an <em>incredible</em> amount of work; any one of these points represents more work than this entire article and plausibly more work than this entire site. One could (and men have) spent entire careers working on small parts of the puzzle just outlined.</p>
          <p>It’s also bad from the rhetorical point of view: defending tobacco requires me to engage in what looks like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer?format=preview&amp;theme=classic">partisan</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics?format=preview&amp;theme=classic">politics</a> &amp; revisionist history. It is challenging beliefs that are, rightly or wrongly, deeply entrenched. Many people have enough flexibility to think, even if a relative died horribly of lung cancer, that nicotine was only the addictive stimulating agent and the <em>real</em> killer was the smoke or the tar or something, and so are willing to consider that nicotine - on its own - might be useful. They are not willing to consider the whole package.</p>
          <p>You can see the difference in the tasks by comparing this one page to the multiple threads in Imminst alone with <em>scores</em> of pages in each. One is short and clear and easily evaluated on its own terms (I hope), and has met with neutral or positive reactions from everyone I’ve asked to read it; the other comes off as a crank laying out an entire worldview, filled with ad hominems, bad faith, and clearly has not changed anyone’s minds.</p>

              <p>It’s generally assumed that the tobacco industry held off regulation for so many decades simply because it spent so very much on lobbying; but lobbying isn’t omnipotent (look at Prohibition). I think at least part of it is that the evidence is not as strong as one would expect; the main case comes from epidemiology, which has an execrable track record and <a href="https://gwern.net/replication" id="gwern-replication" title="'The Replication Crisis: Flaws in Mainstream Science', Branwen 2010">many problems</a>.

              <p>I was reading the Wikipedia nicotine article and thought that the figure cited for estimated American cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#bodyContent">ADHD</a> caused by nicotine - 500,000 - seemed remarkably high and suspected it and the previous sentence were not about nicotine at all, but tobacco. I was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicotine&amp;diff=523718473&amp;oldid=523176039" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicotine&amp;diff=523718473&amp;oldid=523176039#bodyContent">partially right</a>: both were about tobacco, but also lead! Sloppy work even for Wikipedia. I don’t think that any malice was involved, just the general assumption that ‘nicbacco’ is harmful and the distinction between nicotine and tobacco unimportant.</p>
              <p>Another example is a breathless media article <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/children-exposed-to-nicotine-in-utero-have-lower-reading-scores/" data-url-archive="/doc/www/scitechdaily.com/7459c763817f10b7b69dafe80664ba9fb85bffff.html">“Children Exposed to Nicotine in Utero Have Lower Reading Scores”</a> on <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2012-cho.pdf" id="cho-et-al-2012" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Prenatal Exposure to Nicotine and Impaired Reading Performance"><span><span><span title="et al">Cho</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2012</span></span></span></a>: here we can’t blame the media or Wikipedia editors because the paper itself (a longitudinal correlational study) has “nicotine” in its title and abstract (a total of 8 times), though the abstract quietly mentions it is <em>actually</em> a study of “maternal smoking”, and so of little interest to anyone interested in nicotine because there are hundreds or thousands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding#bodyContent">confounding</a> substances in tobacco smoke (on top of what smoking while pregnant says about the mothers in the first place, something which is only partially controllable for); the authors construct a sort of nicotine exposure index based on daily cigarette consumption &amp; nicotine-content of brands, but as far as I can tell, they never analyze whether the results based on this index are the same as if they had analyzed it the same way for eg. total cigarettes smoked or total tar content. This is not to say that nicotine has no impact on developing brains (many useful drugs or stimulants are contraindicated for non-adults), but their results do not seem to warrant their description. I was amused in 2013 when a Pubmed alert brought me word of a 2013 paper led by Cho titled “Prenatal Exposure to Nicotine and Impaired Reading Performance”; besides the title, the abstract uses the word “nicotine” 7 times and “maternal smoking” just 1 time - and replicates the above procedure yet again. With research like this, is it any wonder that ‘nicbacco’ is alive and well in phrases like “nicotine-stained”?<a href="#fnref4" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

I totally get it.” Yet for years Quik has endured the skepticism and downright hostility of many of her fellow neuroscientists as she has published some three dozen studies revealing the actions of nicotine within the mammalian brain. “The whole problem with nicotine is that it happens to be found in cigarettes”, she told me. “People can’t disassociate the two in their mind, nicotine and smoking. It’s not the general public that annoys me, it’s the scientists. When I tell them about the studies, they should say, ‘Wow.’ But they say, ‘Oh well, that might be true, but I don’t see the point.’ It’s not even ignorance.

                <p>A study involving sixty-seven people with mild cognitive impairment, in which memory is slightly impaired but decision-making and other cognitive abilities remain within normal levels, found “significant nicotine-associated improvements in attention, memory, and psychomotor speed,” with excellent safety and tolerability….”…And we’ve seen absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. There doesn’t seem to be any abuse liability whatsoever in taking nicotine by patch in nonsmokers. That’s reassuring.” That’s not reassuring: it’s totally bizarre. Nicotine has routinely been described in news accounts as among the most addictive sub-stances known. As the New York Times Magazine famously put it in 1987, “nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine or amphetamines, and for most people more addictive than alcohol.” But that’s just wrong. <em>Tobacco</em> may well be as addictive as heroin, crack, alcohol, and Cherry Garcia combined into one giant crazy sundae. But as laboratory scientists know, getting mice or other ani-mals hooked on nicotine all by its lonesome is dauntingly difficult. As a 2007 paper in the journal Neuropharmacology put it, “Tobacco use has one of the highest rates of addiction of any abused drug. Paradoxically, in animal models, nicotine appears to be a weak reinforcer.” That same study, like many others, found that other ingredients in tobacco smoke are necessary to amp up nicotine’s addictiveness. Those other chemical ingredients - things like acetaldehyde, anab-asine, nornicotine, anatabine, cotinine, and myosmine - help to keep people hooked on tobacco. On its own, nicotine isn’t enough.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>Watching TV for an average of six hours a day could shorten the viewer’s life expectancy by almost five years, indicates <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/46/16/1144.2.abstract" data-link-icon="bmj" data-link-icon-type="text,tri,sans">research published online in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em></a>. The impact rivals that of other well known behavioural risk factors, such as smoking and lack of exercise, the study suggests. Sedentary behaviour - as distinct from too little exercise - is associated with a higher risk of death, particularly from heart attack or stroke. Watching TV accounts for a substantial amount of sedentary activity, but its impact on life expectancy has not been assessed, say the authors. They used previously published data on the relationship between TV viewing time and death from analyses of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab), as well as Australian national population and mortality figures for 2008, to construct a lifetime risk framework.</p>
                <p>…Based on these figures, and expected deaths from all causes, the authors calculated that an individual who spends a lifetime average of six hours a day watching TV can expect to live just under five fewer years than someone who does not watch TV. These figures compare with the impact of other well known lifestyle factors on the risk of death from cardiovascular disease after the age of 50, including physical activity and obesity. For example, other research has shown that lifelong smoking is associated with the shortening of life expectancy by more than 4 years after the age of 50, with the average loss of life from one cigarette calculated to be 11 minutes - equivalent to half an hour of TV watching, according to the authors’ risk framework.</p>

              <p>I am generally a skeptic of any claims to boost IQ in healthy adults. I am a strong believer that fixing deficits like <a href="https://gwern.net/iodine" id="gwern-iodine" title="'Iodine and Adult IQ meta-analysis', Branwen 2012">iodine</a> can lead to real IQ gains, but almost always an initially promising intervention like <a href="https://gwern.net/creatine" id="gwern-creatine" title="'Creatine Cognition Meta-analysis', Branwen 2013">creatine</a> fades out with additional studies and reverts to no net effect - as has happened to <a href="https://gwern.net/dnb-meta-analysis" id="gwern-dnb-meta-analysis" title="'Dual _n_-Back Meta-Analysis', Branwen 2012">dual <em>n</em>-back</a>.

Nicotine, compared to placebo, improved accuracy (P ϭ 0.008) in all active conditions (2%-11%), and had a load-specific effect on latency (P = 0.004; 43.78% decrease at the highest memory load).

                <p>“People with memory loss should not start smoking or using nicotine patches by themselves because there are harmful effects of smoking and a medication such as nicotine should only be used with a doctor’s supervision,” Newhouse said. “But this study provides strong justification for further research into the use of nicotine for people with early signs of memory loss which may help us determine whether benefits persist over long periods of time and provide meaningful improvement.”</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>In human populations, cigarettes and alcohol generally serve as gateway drugs, which people use first before progressing to marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit substances. To understand the biological basis of the gateway sequence of drug use, we developed an animal model in mice and used it to study the effects of nicotine on subsequent responses to cocaine. We found that pretreatment of mice with nicotine increased the response to cocaine, as assessed by addiction-related behaviors and synaptic plasticity in the striatum, a brain region critical for addiction-related reward. Locomotor sensitization was increased by 98%, conditioned place preference was increased by 78%, and cocaine-induced reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced by 24%. The responses to cocaine were altered only when nicotine was administered first, and nicotine and cocaine were then administered concurrently. Reversing the order of drug administration was ineffective; cocaine had no effect on nicotine-induced behaviors and synaptic plasticity. Nicotine primed the response to cocaine by enhancing its ability to induce transcriptional activation of the FosB gene through inhibition of histone deacetylase, which caused global histone acetylation in the striatum. We tested this conclusion further and found that a histone deacetylase inhibitor simulated the actions of nicotine by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)#bodyContent">priming</a> the response to cocaine and enhancing FosB gene expression and LTP depression in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, in a genetic mouse model characterized by reduced histone acetylation, the effects of cocaine on LTP were diminished. We achieved a similar effect by infusing a low dose of theophylline, an activator of histone deacetylase, into the nucleus accumbens. These results from mice prompted an analysis of epidemiological data, which indicated that most cocaine users initiate cocaine use after the onset of smoking and while actively still smoking, and that initiating cocaine use after smoking increases the risk of becoming dependent on cocaine, consistent with our data from mice. If our findings in mice apply to humans, a decrease in smoking rates in young people would be expected to lead to a decrease in cocaine addiction.</p>

The incidences of several minor adverse effects were clearly elevated among the nicotine-patch groups, especially sleep disturbances, nausea or vomiting, localised skin irritation and respiratory symptoms, but the background rates and risk ratios varied considerably across studies. The incidence of nausea or vomiting appeared to be lowest when the patch dose was tapered.

                <p>Of the thousands of proven carcinogens and toxic agents contained within a cigarette, nicotine, while being the addictive agent, is often viewed as the least harmful of these compounds.</p>
                <p>Subsequent studies<sup>2-4</sup> have suggested that chronic nicotine administration might in fact play a beneficial role in slowing the progression of this disease. While this finding is controversial, there is now ample evidence supporting a therapeutic benefit from nicotine in Parkinson’s<sup>5</sup> disease, and as a neuroprotectant to toxic insults such as excitotoxins<sup>6-10</sup> or Beta-amyloid derived peptides.<sup>10-12</sup> Understanding the mechanistic basis for these and other similarly interesting findings,13 including a cognitive benefit from nicotine,<sup>2</sup> would be of obvious importance….This extended expression of nAChRs is of importance because, in addition to their regulation by endogenous agonists such as acetylcholine, choline, and the exogenous compound nicotine, their impact upon peripheral processes can be quite diverse as exemplified by their ability to in some cases enhance (Crohn’s disease) disease or in other cases diminish (ulcerative colitis) progression.<sup>17-20</sup>…While smoking is a major causative factor for lung cancer, relatively few smokers generate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has an incidence rate of ~20%, even among very heavy and long-term smokers.<sup>61</sup></p>
                <p>…While nicotine has anti-inflammatory properties in this disease, the therapeutic value of nicotine does not exceed that of more conventional treatments such as aminosalicylates.<sup>48</sup></p>
                <p>Therefore, while cells are present that are primed for activation, the immune and inflammatory response may be dampened, as has been observed in many smokers.<sup>62</sup> Expanding upon this possibility, Floto and Smith<sup>64</sup> suggested that the inflammatory response to the stimulatory components of tobacco may be counteracted by the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine, which offers a rational explanation for why few smokers generate pulmonary Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis. It has also been pointed out that there is a significantly lower incidence of sarcoidosis in smokers<sup>65</sup> and decreased incidence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) precipitins that develop during allergic alveolitis as occurs both in humans and guinea pigs.<sup>66,67</sup>…A notable outcome of this effect may be that the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine actually enhance the survival of influenza virus in mice and induce significantly higher titers of virus following infection.<sup>63</sup> Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia, is also more frequent in smokers.<sup>90</sup>…While nicotine may inhibit macrophage function to promote pneumonia, it has also been reported that the generation of hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP) is lower in smokers than nonsmokers. HP is caused by inhalation of antigens such as Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, which induces farmer ’s lung (once contracted, however, smoking worsens disease).</p>

<p dir="auto">You can watch a tiny demo of using Spray to interact with a running program here: <a href="https://youtu.be/mjwIrfQkURc" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/mjwIrfQkURc</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Spray is a small debugger for C code that comes with minimal mental overhead. All functionality aims to be simple and easy to grasp.</p>
<p dir="auto">In Spray you can easily control the execution of running programs, and inspect and modify their state.</p>
<p dir="auto">I started work on Spray out of curiosity about the mysterious inner workings of debuggers. In addition, I want to explore ways in which debugging can be made more approachable.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content--features" dir="auto"><a href="#-features">🦾 Features</a></h2>
<ul>

<li> Printing and setting variables, memory at addresses and registers</li>
<li> C syntax highlighting</li>
<li> Backtraces</li>
<li> Instruction, function and line level stepping</li>

<li> Loading external libraries</li>
<li> Catching signals sent to the debugged program</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-️-installation" dir="auto"><a href="#️-installation">💿️ Installation</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Parts of the Spray frontend are written in Scheme and embedded into the application using <a href="https://www.call-cc.org/" rel="nofollow">CHICKEN Scheme</a> which compiles Scheme to C. Currently, you need to have <a href="https://code.call-cc.org/#download" rel="nofollow">CHICKEN installed</a> to build Spray. In the future it's possible that the generated C files are provided instead so that you only need a C compiler.</p>
<p dir="auto">Spray depends on <a href="https://github.com/davea42/libdwarf-code/releases">libdwarf</a>
so if you want to build Spray, you need to install libdwarf first. Then, to install Spray you clone this repository and run <code>make</code>. Note the you
have to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4438292" rel="nofollow">clone all the submodules</a> too.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/d4ckard/spray.git
cd spray
make"><pre>git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/d4ckard/spray.git
<span>cd</span> spray
make</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The compiled binary is named <code>spray</code> and can be found in the <code>build</code> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use <code>spray</code> as a regular command you need to <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/322773" rel="nofollow">add it to your <code>$PATH</code></a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-️-running-spray" dir="auto"><a href="#️-running-spray">🏃‍♀️ Running Spray</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Ensure that the binary you want to debug has debug information enabled, i.e. it was compiled with the <code>-g</code> flag. Also, you should disable all compile-time optimizations to ensure the best output.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Spray is only tested using Clang. The debug information generated by different compilers for the same piece of code varies. Thus, <code>clang</code> should be used to compile the programs you want to debug using Spray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The first argument you pass to <code>spray</code> is the name of the binary that should be debugged (the debugee). All subsequent arguments are the arguments passed to the debugee.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="clang -g examples/free_uninit.c
spray a.out"><pre>clang -g examples/free_uninit.c
spray a.out</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">starts a debugging session with the executable <code>a.out</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-️-commands" dir="auto"><a href="#️-commands">⌨️ Commands</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Spray's REPL offers the following commands to interact with a running program.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-reading-and-writing-values" dir="auto"><a href="#reading-and-writing-values">Reading and writing values</a></h3>
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Command</td>
        <td>Argument(s)</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3"><code>print</code>, <code>p</code></td>
        <td><code>&lt;variable&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Print the value of the runtime variable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;register&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Print the value of the register.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Print the value of the program's memory at the address.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3"><code>set</code>, <code>t</code></td>
        <td><code>&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Set the value of the runtime variable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;register&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Set the value of the register.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><code>&lt;address&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Set the value of the program's memory at the address.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p dir="auto">Register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code>, akin to the AT&amp;T assembly syntax. This avoids name conflicts between register names and variable names. For example, to read the value of <code>rax</code>, use <code>print %rax</code>. You can find a table of all available register names in <code>src/registers.h</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">A <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> can be a hexadecimal or a decimal number. The default is base 10 and hexadecimal will only be chosen if the literal contains a character that's exclusive to base 16 (i.e. one of a - f). You can prefix the literal with <code>0x</code> to explicitly use hexadecimal in cases where decimal would work as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">An <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> is always a hexadecimal number. The prefix <code>0x</code> is again optional.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-breakpoints" dir="auto"><a href="#breakpoints">Breakpoints</a></h3>
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Command</td>
        <td>Argument(s)</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3"><code>break</code>, <code>b</code></td>
        <td><code>&lt;function&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Set a breakpoint on the function.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;file&gt;:&lt;line&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Set a breakpoint on the line in the file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Set a breakpoint on the address.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3"><code>delete</code>, <code>d</code></td>
        <td><code>&lt;function&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Delete a breakpoint on the function.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;file&gt;:&lt;line&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Delete a breakpoint on the line in the file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Delete a breakpoint on the address.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>continue</code>, <code>c</code></td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Continue execution until the next breakpoint.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p dir="auto">It's possible that the location passed to <code>break</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>print</code>, or <code>set</code> is both a valid function name and a valid hexadecimal address. For example, <code>add</code> could refer to a function called <code>add</code> and the number <code>0xadd</code>. In such a case, the default is to interpret the location as a function name. Use the prefix <code>0x</code> to explicitly specify an address.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-stepping" dir="auto"><a href="#stepping">Stepping</a></h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>next</code>, <code>n</code></td>
<td>Go to the next line. Don't step into functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>step</code>, <code>s</code></td>
<td>Go to the next line. Step into functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>leave</code>, <code>l</code></td>
<td>Step out of the current function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>inst</code>, <code>i</code></td>
<td>Step to the next instruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>backtrace</code>, <code>a</code></td>
<td>Print a backtrace starting at the current position.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-filters" dir="auto"><a href="#filters">Filters</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The <code>print</code> and <code>set</code> commands can be followed by a filter, to change how output is displayed. For example, if you want to inspect the binary data in the rdx register, you can enter <code>print %rdx | bin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Filters are separated from the command by a pipe symbol: <code>&lt;command&gt; '|' &lt;filter&gt;</code>. Currently, only one filter can be used at a time.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following table shows how different filters format the same 64-bit word with the value 103.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Filter</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>dec</code> (<em>decimal</em>)</td>
<td><code>103</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>hex</code> (<em>hexadecimal</em>)</td>
<td><code>0x67</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>addr</code> (<em>address</em>)</td>
<td><code>0x0000000000000067</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bits</code></td>
<td><code>00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 01100111</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bytes</code></td>
<td><code>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 67</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>deref</code> <code>*</code></td>
<td><em>Prints the value found at memory address <code>0x67</code></em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">Except for <code>deref</code>, all the above simply change the way the output is formatted. <code>deref</code>, abbreviated as <code>*</code>, interprets the value that would be printed as a memory address, and prints whatever is found it memory that address. Using <code>deref</code>, you can inspect that value that a pointer points to.</p>
