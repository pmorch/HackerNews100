<p>Binge-watching television, watching YouTube videos for hours, or scrolling on your phone every morning may seem harmless, but research shows that too much screen time may be detrimental to your health.</p>
<p>We know children’s brains are affected by spending too much time glued to their cell phones,&nbsp;however&nbsp;research shows that adult brains are also negatively impacted by excessive screen time, defined as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/reduce-screen-time/index.htm">more than two hours</a>&nbsp;a day outside of work hours.</p>
<p>Too much screen time can impact our health in a myriad of ways, from eye strain and neck pain to social isolation and mental health, and in some cases, it may cause harm to our brains.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The negative effects of screen time are insidious because you can’t see what’s happening in your brain as you’re staring at the screen,” says Maris Loeffler, MA, Family and Marriage Therapist, member of the Stanford Lifestyle Medicine Cognitive Enhancement pillar. “If you scrolled on your phone in bed for an hour just one morning, the negative impacts would be minimal. But if it becomes a habit, day after day, month after month, this behavior can take a toll.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the eyes&nbsp;are directly connected&nbsp;to the brain, Loeffler encourages us to think about our eye health to ensure overall brain health. Rather than looking at our phones upon waking, Loeffler recommends starting each morning looking at the horizon or an object outside and far away.</p>
<p>To prevent eye strain throughout the workday,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aao.org/">The American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>&nbsp;recommends the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/computer-usage#:~:text=Take%20regular%20breaks%20using%20the,for%20at%20least%2020%20seconds.">20-20-20 rule</a>&nbsp;for adults who work on a computer. This rule suggests that individuals look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes of the day.</p>
<h2>What is Happening in the Brain During Screen Time?</h2>
<p>This <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-019-00182-2">study</a> found that increased use of screens among adults may harm learning, memory, and mental health, as well as the potential to increase the risk of early neurodegeneration. The study shows that in adults aged 18 – 25, excessive screen time causes thinning of the cerebral cortex, the brain’s outermost layer responsible for processing memory and cognitive functions, such as decision-making and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1525861024002263">study</a> found that adults who watched television for five hours or more per day had an increased risk of developing brain-related disease like dementia, stroke, or Parkinson’s.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9638701/">study</a>&nbsp;found that excessive screen time can hinder sleep, especially when looking at screens late at night. Light from the screen can delay melatonin release from the brain’s pineal gland, impacting the body’s natural circadian rhythm and causing difficulty sleeping.</p>
<p>Additional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/JIN/21/1/10.31083/j.jin2101028/htm">studies</a>&nbsp;found that adults who engage in excessive screen time or have a diagnosed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460319313802#b0080">smartphone addiction</a>&nbsp;had lower&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553239/#:~:text=%5B1%5D%20Grey%20matter%20makes%20up,concentration%20of%20neuronal%20cell%20bodies.">gray matter</a>&nbsp;volume. Gray matter is brain tissue essential for daily human functioning and is responsible for everything from movement to memory to emotions.&nbsp;Gray matter volume naturally decreases as we age, so along with reducing screen time, engaging in activities that maintain our gray matter volume and promote brain health, such as exercise and movement, restorative sleep, social engagement, and stress management, is crucial.</p>
<p>“Passive screen time is like eating sugar but for your brain.&nbsp;It&nbsp;‘tastes’&nbsp;good, and you want it now, but you’re not&nbsp;actually&nbsp;feeding yourself.&nbsp;You’re not giving your brain any nutrition,” says Loeffler. “Instead, replace screen time with an intentional healthy habit that&nbsp;feeds your brain in a healthy way. Lifestyle medicine activities, like exercise, good sleep, social connection, and stress management, function like ‘nutrition’ for your brain and mental health.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Loeffler cautions us not to pick up the phone after the alarm goes off in the morning. She explains that looking at our email or social media on our phones while still in bed jolts the nervous system and can trigger the fight-or-flight response since we aren’t fully awake yet.</p>
<p>Also, if we look at our&nbsp;phones&nbsp;first thing&nbsp;every&nbsp;morning, we create a pattern and can set the flight-or-flight response as our default mode of operation. So, not only does this behavior set an anxiety-filled tone for the day, but&nbsp;we are also training our brains to be more hypervigilant in general.</p>
<p><strong>“One of the biggest issues with picking up the phone right away in the morning is that when you have an object close to your face, it’s registered as a threat,” says Loeffler. “You wouldn’t want to wake up and look a bear in the face every morning. On a physiological level, it’s the same thing.”</strong></p>
<h2>Practice of the Month: No Screen Time for the First Hour of the Day</h2>
<p>Stanford Lifestyle Medicine experts recommend no screen time for the first hour of the day to support cognitive enhancement. Instead, we suggest engaging in a lifestyle medicine activity upon waking to promote whole-body health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Call a friend or family member</li>
<li>Prepare a healthy <a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/04/08/dr-spencers-science-based-smoothie-for-gut-health/">breakfast</a></li>
<li>Meditate and count your&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/11/14/optimism-as-a-means-to-a-longer-life/">blessings</a></li>
<li>Listen to music</li>
<li>Create a&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/11/14/gratitude-is-good-medicine/">gratitude</a>&nbsp;list</li>
<li>Read a book</li>
<li>Spend time outside and get&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/03/11/vitamin-d-benefits-sources-deficiency/">morning light</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“How do you want your day’s energy and mood to start?” says Loeffler. “Intentionally implementing a morning routine that reflects lifestyle medicine choices instead of screen time sets a positive tone for the day and supports brain health and cognitive enhancement.”</p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Fri, 6 Sep 2024 by Thomas ten Cate · <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2024/9/6/why-my-apps-will-soon-be-gone-from-google-play/#isso-thread" data-isso-id="/blog/2024/9/6/why-my-apps-will-soon-be-gone-from-google-play/">Comments</a><br><svg><use xlink:href="https://frozenfractal.com/img/icomoon/symbol-defs.min.svg#icon-price-tags"></use></svg>
&nbsp;<a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/tags/business/">Business</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/tags/bigcanvas/">Bigcanvas</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/tags/patchy/">Patchy</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/tags/twistago/">Twistago</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/tags/rocket-mail/">Rocket Mail</a></p><p>The first real money I ever made from game development was on Android. It was in 2013, when Android was still the underdog compared to the iPhone, and was being touted as a great platform for developers. I’d taken two weeks to build <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/patchy/">Patchy</a>, a retro arcade game revamped for touch controls, and published it on the Google Play Store without any hassle. Since then, I’ve also published <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/twistago/">Twistago</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/rocket-mail/">Rocket Mail</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2015/6/14/bigcanvas-released/">Bigcanvas</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/projects/radio-nul/">Radio Nul</a> and <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/projects/papageno/">Papageno</a>.</p><p>With each next app, the bar for publishing kept getting higher. At some point, Google started publishing developers’ full company address on the store alongside the app. That’s fine for a professional company, but quite problematic for a solo indie developer who works from home, especially if the app <em>or the developer</em> is even remotely controversial. I worked around it at the time by just putting the name of the town instead of the full address, which is only right morally, but not legally.</p><p>The technical requirements also kept going up. To publish an update to an app, it has to target the latest API version, which goes up once or twice a year. Each API update comes with a slew of deprecations, and breaking changes to the already inscrutable build system. And even if you don’t want to update the app, Google will eventually start hiding apps from users if the app doesn’t target some minimum API version. This means you can’t just publish an app and leave it at that; it’s several days of work per app per year to keep up with the latest rug-pulls from Google. Again this is no problem for a company for whom the app is their core business, but bad news for indie and hobbyist developers who just want to make something cool, put it out there, and move on to the next project.</p><p>And then, there’s the latest increase in publishing requirements, the straw that broke the camel’s back, which made me decide to abandon the Google Play Store altogether.</p><h2 id="the-new-rules">The new rules</h2><p>The <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">original announcement</a> just mentioned that organizations will need to provide a D-U-N-S number. It was possible to choose your own deadline, so I set it as far in the future as I could. Now that deadline, 5 November, is getting close, and I can start the verification process. The email, however, makes it clear that they want much more than a D-U-N-S number:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What you need to provide to verify</strong></p><ul><li>a D-U-N-S number for your organization<br>If you don’t have a D-U-N-S number, request one at no cost from Dun &amp; Bradstreet now. This process can take up to 30 days, so we recommend requesting a D-U-N-S number immediately. <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13628312#duns">Learn more about requesting a D-U-N-S number</a></li><li>a phone number and email address for Google Play users to contact you</li><li>a phone number and email address for Google to contact you</li><li>an official document to verify your identity</li><li>an official document to verify your organization</li></ul></blockquote><p>There is only one of these items that I don’t have a problem with.</p><p>The D-U-N-S number is only needed if your Play Store publisher account is for an organization, not an individual. But I’m registered as a sole proprietor, so the rule applies to me. You can <a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/lookup.html">look up</a> your company’s D-U-N-S number, but the form doesn’t (currently?) allow selecting any country except the US. Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s partner in the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.altares.nl/en/our-data/duns-number/">Altares</a>, does allow me to look up my own company, but charges 15 € for the privilege of seeing my own data, <em>including my own D-U-N-S number</em>, which they’ve apparently already assigned when I registered with the Chamber of Commerce. If I didn’t already have one, I don’t see a way on their website to request one either, even though the FAQ mentions that you can (for a fee, of course).</p><p>While that may be just some paperwork and a small expense, the next requirement is more insidious: “a phone number and email address for Google Play users to contact you”. I’m fine showing an email address, but I <em>absolutely do not want</em> my phone number to be available to anyone on the internet. (Even for phone calls. But remember that a phone number is used for much more than phone calls these days.) And that’s just me, a privileged hetero white cis dude who is unlikely to be the target of harassment or doxxing.</p><p>The requirement “a phone number and email address for Google to contact you” is the only one that sounds benign to me, although I have yet to see Google trying to contact small-fry developers like me by phone, instead of just reaching for the algorithmic ban hammer if I cross any line.</p><p>An “official document to verify your identity” would presumably be a scan or photo of my passport. Now, I have reasonable confidence in the security of Google’s systems, but this is something very sensitive and can easily be abused if it fell into the wrong hands. And why is it necessary? I’ve done business with many other companies, where a lot more money was changing hands than I’m getting from my Play Store apps, but they never asked for my passport. Why does Google?</p><p>Those other companies also never asked for “an official document to verify your organization”. Presumably this is a document I can request from the Chamber of Commerce to the tune of another 9 €, but again I’ve never had another company ask for this when doing business with them.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2><p>I sort of understand why Google is doing all this. It’s partly legal requirements (especially EU), partly an attempt to reduce spam and malicious stuff. Some of it might even be in the best interest of the end user.</p><p>Larger companies have the resources to deal with all this, and for personal accounts the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13628312">rules</a> are much more lenient. Sadly, there has been little consideration for sole proprietorships like mine, which fall somewhere in between: bound by the same rules as big companies, but without the means to play by them.</p><p>And this is why I’m just going to let my Play Store developer account expire. Starting on 5 November, you won’t be able to install any of my apps anymore. Most of them were not actively maintained anymore, <em>but they still worked</em>, because the Android operating system itself is actually pretty good at backwards compatibility.</p><p>Even though there was little remaining interest in my older apps, it makes me sad that people won’t be able to use them anymore. The one I’m most sad about, though, is <a href="https://papageno.app/">Papageno</a>, an unfinished side project about bird sounds that I haven’t worked on for three years, but keeps popping into my mind as something I’d really like to finish some day. Maybe it could be in the form of a web app. We’ll see.</p><p><img src="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2024/9/6/why-my-apps-will-soon-be-gone-from-google-play/no_more_google_play.png" alt="The official “Get it on Google Play” button, but with the text “You can no longer” scribbled above it, probably flying in the face of official brand guidelines"></p></div></div>]]></description>

I’ve gotten to a point where I can do this very consistently now, and I think others can learn this too.</p><p><span>There’s a misconception that good faith discussion only happens in close-knit communities like LessWrong or HackerNews. </span><strong>The reality I’m looking at here is that ~everyone on the internet is rational AND is arguing in good faith</strong><span>. If it doesn’t look that way, it’s because you’re speaking different languages.</span></p><p>Let’s look at 2 cases.</p><p><span>Here’s a puzzle: how do you respond to this insult to get them to apologize? </span><br><em>(I’ve blanked out the reply from user “InGoodFaith” for this exercise)</em></p><p>Some incorrect ways to respond:</p><ul><li><p>❌ Insulting them back </p><ul><li><p><em>(that just makes them more angry)</em></p></li></ul></li><li><p>❌ Telling them they’re wrong</p><ul><li><p><em> (they won’t understand what you’re saying because they’re already mad &amp; feeling attacked)</em></p></li><li><p><em>(even if they change their mind, they will not tell you this because it would feel like failure)</em></p></li></ul></li><li><p>❌ Telling them NOT to be rude </p><ul><li><p><em>(no one likes having their tone policied, they feel justified because (1) they are angry (2) your words are the source of their anger. Or at least their intrpretation of your words)</em></p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Here’s the winning move:</p><ul><li><p>✅ Signal that you are genuinely interested in understanding them, not attacking them</p></li></ul><p><span>No one has ever changed their mind while being attacked. People are way more likely to change their mind when they feel understood. </span><strong>It doesn’t matter if you understand them: you have to prove to *them* </strong><span>that you understand them</span><strong>.</strong></p><p>Yes, this is a lot of work. If you’re not willing to do this, then *you’re* not arguing in good faith in my book. You’re just here to beat people over the head with words that they don’t understand. It’s a waste of your time AND their time, and you leave with the (incorrect) belief that people are dumb, or don’t care about the truth etc. </p><p>This was the reply:</p><blockquote><p>sorry, I am too dumb to understand what "fortiori point" means! I think I'm just trying to understand the relationship of left/right towards Norway </p><p>I thought Norway = socialist policies = left-ist people aspire to it, but not republicans? right?</p></blockquote><p>The “too dumb” part I think helps to diffuse the anger, showing him that I’m not interested in fighting, but it’s probably not necessary. I think the important part was articulating what I don’t understand, asking a specific question. I’m also showing vulnerability by stating my beliefs and asking them to correct me. </p><p>This shows a genuine interest in understanding because it cannot be faked. It’s like “proof of work” in blockchain. It’s not enough to say:</p><blockquote><p>I really do want to understand you! Can you please explain your point without the insults?</p></blockquote><p>Because what the other person hears is:</p><blockquote><p><span>You’re not allowed to talk to me this way. Now repeat the point you’ve already said, but in a way that I will understand it. </span><strong>Also, I’m not going to bother telling you what part I didn’t understand</strong><span>, I want *you* to figure that out.</span></p></blockquote><p>I made an open call for anyone who feels like they encountered someone arguing “in bad faith” to send it to me and I will help analyze it/tell you what you could have done differently. </p><p>KJ took me up on it.</p><p>Here is the full interaction between them, and my analysis afterwards:</p><p>(1) 🪓“axial age” posts an anti-government post, in response to an obama quote</p><blockquote><p>Where did all those billions supposed to be spent on EV charging stations go? I patiently await your response.</p><p><em>Obama: "The other side knows it's easier to play on people's fears and cynicism. They will tell you that government is inherently corrupt."</em></p></blockquote><p>(2) 🎵 KJ responds</p><blockquote><p><span>looks like grants have been going out! and round 2 is coming up! </span><em>[link to source]</em></p><p><span>and not sure precisely the percentage that can be attributed to the CFI but there are certainly stations being built! </span><em>[link to source 2]</em></p><p>(i patiently await ur response 😛)</p></blockquote><p>(3) 🪓 axial responds</p><blockquote><p>How many built due to this program and at what cost? Press releases are cheap.</p></blockquote><p>(4) 🎵 KJ</p><blockquote><p>ok so actually, it looks like NONE have been built due to this program yet, bc the first round of funding was only just announced...</p><p>but the plan is to fund 47 projects (~7500 chargers) using 623mil of the total 2.5bil</p><p>(avg 80k per charger)</p></blockquote><p>(5) 🪓 axial </p><blockquote><p>this is why you're getting blocked</p></blockquote><p>From KJ’s prespective, this is bizarre: KJ was polite &amp; sincere, he included links to sources in every reply, he responded to every point axial brought it up. KJ is left with the conclusion that this person must not care at all about truth. </p><p>This is objectively the wrong conclusion. </p><p>Let’s look at this from axial’s side: </p><ol><li><p>He’s making a point about a strawman that Obama is using</p><ol><li><p>Obama says, vote blue, the other side is manipulating you into fearing the gov!</p></li><li><p>axial says, no, it’s not manipulation, it’s a valid criticism! </p></li></ol></li><li><p>Axial’s point is that it’s *not* about fear, it’s about, at best (1) government incompetence wasting tons of money (2) at worst, malicious actors getting rich off of these subsidies without actually providing value for society</p></li><li><p>KJ comes in with “proof” about the funding/plans for this money, and a smug, “patiently awaiting your response 😛”</p></li><li><p>This is totally missing the point. Axial very kindly explains:</p><ol><li><p>Yes, they’re saying they’re using this money for good, but how much good has it *actually* done?</p></li><li><p>And also, even if they did do these things, how much did it cost? Did it really need to cost this much? Could it have been done better &amp; cheaper if it was private? Is it possible that private companies are taking advantage of these gov programs and ripping us off?</p></li></ol></li><li><p>KJ doubles down: </p><ol><li><p>Insists that they’re going to build more, shares more links/press releases</p></li><li><p>Will not concede that there is a maybe a problem here, that maybe *some* government programs are not working, and that the rhetoric of the democratic party can sometimes strawman the other side</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>At this point axial blocks him because KJ comes off as NOT arguing in good faith, NOT interested in the truth. </p><p>KJ’s problem is he came in refuting a point that he didn’t understand. He was in fact arguing the wrong point. This is one of the most common failure modes I see. </p><p>The first step in any online argument is to understand the other side. You must empirically *confirm* this understanding with the other person. I would have said:</p><blockquote><p>“Where *did* those billions go? My understanding is a lot of it is going into building the initial infrastructure, so it’s slow going but we’ll see progress soon. Is that not true?” </p></blockquote><p>See, we don’t even know if axial is against EV and environmental protections, or if he just thinks the gov is doing a bad job executing it. How can you argue against this if you have no idea what he’s even saying? </p><p>So we start by (1) asking a question (2) articulating our understanding of the issue. The first point helps you understand them, the second point signals that you’re genuinely interested in understanding them, you’re laying your cards out. You’re revealing your beliefs and opening yourself up to being corrected.</p><p>It’s not about pretending that you’re willing to change your mind. You’re here because you think the solution is clear, and you don’t understand why people are voting against the things you believe are good. </p><p><span>I used to feel a deep sense of despair about humanity. I used to feel like, we </span><em>*knew*</em><span> how to make the world a better place, and the *only* reason we’re not doing it is because “people suck/are bad/evil/stupid”. </span></p><p><strong>This is a very difficult way to live life, it’s also just flat out false. </strong><span>This is not why the world isn’t getting better. This becomes very clear when talking to people with views &amp; opinions that I find repulsive/evil:</span></p><ol><li><p>I realize I had no idea that there are good reasons to be opposed to solution X</p></li><li><p>Or that a lot of people don’t understand why solution X is good, and they actually change their mind when someone explains it</p></li><li><p>Or that solution X is actually bad/not working. They are on my side, in that they also want to solve the problem, but they are skeptical that X is the way</p></li></ol><p>Everyone always asks me, how do you have so much patience to engage with “these trolls/haters”. I don’t do this for them. I do this for me. I share the earth with these people we call vile. Their opinions &amp; actions affect me greatly. Closing my eyes &amp; ears only hurts me. </p><p>The more I lean into things I hate &amp; that I know nothing about, the more I realize a lot of them are all good, reasonable people. A lot of us are really on the same side in wanting to make the world a better place for ourselves, our family, our community.</p><p>I’ll leave you with this reminder:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png" width="411" height="253.26486486486488" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:342,&quot;width&quot;:555,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:411,&quot;bytes&quot;:32240,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c5064b-7a9e-477e-ba16-8a107f5d40b0_555x342.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Thanks for reading!

      <p>The underwater caves of the Yucatán Peninsula are a window to the distant past. Through two million years and over multiple glaciation cycles, these caves have been transformed. When the sea level was high, the caves flooded, and their reach expanded.</p>

<p>During the ice ages, the caves dried out as the sea level dropped, and the seeping water from the surface decorated the caverns with deposits such as stalagmites and stalactites, collectively known as <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/speleothem">speleothems</a>. Then, with the next cycle came higher sea levels again, flooding the caves and preserving in time the speleothems and everything else with them.</p>

<p>I have been diving the unique submerged landscapes of Mexican cenotes, or sinkholes, for almost ten years, exploring their dark, flooded tunnels and capturing their secrets. The last time the shallow caves on the Yucatán Peninsula flooded was around 8,000 years ago, which means that every diver in these caves travels back in time to a prehistoric age. The paleontological and archaeological remains preserved within them would disintegrate at the surface, which makes these caves a perfect time capsule.</p>

<h2>How Mexico’s cenotes came to be</h2>

<p>This underworld is formed by a massive underground aquifer in the northern Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. It is accessible by cenotes that connect the surface of the Earth to the longest underground river systems in the world. Here, water doesn’t accumulate on the surface as rivers, but instead gets absorbed through the porous limestone to flow within underground tunnels. Much as our blood vessels send life-sustaining fluid throughout our bodies, these tunnels convey the precious water that sustains all life in this region. It is no wonder that cenotes were considered sacred by the Maya.</p>

<p>The Maya established their civilization on the Yucatán Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In order to thrive, they needed to settle close to a freshwater source. All of their largest settlements on the northern part of the peninsula—including the famed Chichén Itzá—were built beside cenotes. During the region’s dry season, cenotes were the only source of water; therefore, the sinkholes were not only a fundamental part of Maya life but also a place for worship and rituals related to rain, life, death and rebirth.</p>

<p>Each Maya <em>d’zonot </em>(the Maya word from which the word cenote comes from) was an entrance to the mystical underworld called Xibalba, where various deities and supernatural beings resided. It is a mysterious and powerful realm associated with death, a portal to a domain where ritualistic offerings honored both the gods and the deceased and sought protection and guidance for the living. Living within, and the protector of this underworld, was Chaac, the god of rain, fertility and agriculture. He was an important deity in Maya mythology, as rain was vital for the success of crops and the well-being of the community.</p>

<p>Beneath the cenotes, deeper in their caves, artifacts and human remains from the Maya civilization have lain undisturbed for centuries and can be seen by explorers. But these are not the only indicators of human presence. While the Maya settled the region only a few thousand years ago, evidence found in the cenotes points to human settlements in the area dating back more than 13,000 years. These finds challenge the accepted notion of when our ancestors first crossed into America via the Bering Land Bridge between Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age.</p>

<p>These ancient hunter-gatherers also depended on the cenotes as a water source, and probably for shelter as well. Back then, the cenotes were much drier, with the water level some 300 feet below current-day levels. The ancient inhabitants had to venture deep into the caves to access the water, crossing paths with huge prehistoric animals from the late Pleistocene—now long extinct—that also sought fresh water.</p>

<p>It’s challenging to put into words the raw and profound sensation that accompanies encountering a human skull in the darkness of the flooded caves. Long before I recognize a skull as mere remains, I can feel its gaze upon me from the shadows, a haunting presence that defies description. Particularly in the area of the Ring of Cenotes, many sacrificial cenotes hold skulls of the higher-ranking Maya families. Along with modified front teeth to host ornaments, these skulls were artificially deformed to create a physical distinction. The higher-ranking Maya used different techniques to shape their children’s skulls, creating an oblique deformation, which made their heads look longer than the average Maya’s. Said to resemble a jaguar’s head, this shape was a symbol of power. Also rare sightings for cave explorers are sophisticated Maya paintings on cave walls close to the entrances of cenotes. Depicting wars, animals, gods and stories, these treasures can be forever lost once submerged, washed away over time.</p>

<p>Long before the Maya settled in the area, the first Homo sapiens crossed into America over the Bering Land Bridge at least 25,000 years ago. They made their way down to South America and arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula at the end of the last ice age around 13,000 years ago. There they used the caves to extract water and minerals, to find shelter, and to bury their dead. While it is typically hard to find remains of these hunter-gatherers on the surface of the Earth, evidence of early human presence was preserved in these caves from before the last time the caves flooded. That evidence gives us clues to understanding early humans’ biology and even their social interactions.</p>

<p>Within the flooded caves it is common to see purposely broken formations that create passages through the tunnels, and even cairns—made of piles of rocks or broken speleothems—placed at the junctions of tunnels to navigate the intricate cave labyrinths. Early humans also excavated rocks and mined red ocher using only Stone Age tools and their mastery of fire. They used the ocher to decorate objects for personal ornamentation and burials. They also decorated the caves with multiple art forms, from paintings on the walls to sculptures. A well-known example is the figure of a woman at the entrance of Cenote Dos Ojos; while it was not sculpted as such, it is a carefully selected speleothem that resembles the silhouette of a woman and was intentionally exhibited on a pedestal to decorate the cave entrance, evidence of paleoart from more than 8,000 years ago that anyone can visit.</p>

<h2>Diving for fossil evidence of extinct megafauna</h2>

<p>As if they were corridors of a museum, the submerged passageways of these time capsules also offer divers the opportunity to uncover exquisitely preserved fossils of diverse creatures—most of which are now extinct—that once inhabited the Yucatán during the late Pleistocene.</p>

<p>Following the cataclysmic impact of the Chicxulub asteroid 66 million years ago, which marked the end of the dinosaur age, mammals began to dominate the lands once ruled by dinosaurs. Over time, North and South America underwent distinct evolutionary trajectories. However, around 2.7 million years ago, the formation of the Panamanian land bridge facilitated a pivotal event: the Great American Biotic Interchange.</p>

<p>During this exchange, North American fauna migrated southward, including large mammals called megafauna, like saber-toothed cats, lions, gomphotheres (related to modern elephants), horses and camels. Meanwhile, South American megafauna moved northward, including giant ground sloths and glyptodonts (enormous armadillos). This monumental event significantly influenced and sculpted the ecosystems and biodiversity of both continents, affecting the composition of species and ecosystems we see today.</p>

<p>The thrill of exploring the underwater caves of the Yucatán is heightened upon uncovering the fossilized remains of these long-extinct megafauna. Visualizing these colossal creatures coming to life right where you are diving, in what was once a prehistoric cave that had been frozen in time by these waters, is like being teleported back to their era, immersed in a thrilling journey through time. How their fossils came to be submerged underwater can be easily imagined. With the water level during the last ice age up to 300 feet lower than it is today, these animals had to venture down dark, dry cave passages to reach drinking water, sometimes surprisingly far away from an entrance. Trapped in sinkholes or lost within labyrinthine passages, these animals died, and their remains became fossilized and preserved by rising water levels.</p>

<p>Among the many extinct species that lived in this region are members of the family Megalonychidae (including the genus <em>Megalonyx</em>, Greek for “large claw”). Fossils of these giant ground sloths are commonly found in the caves, as they probably took refuge within them, such as members of the genus <em>Xibalbaonyx</em> (“great claw of Xibalba”), a polar bear-sized ground sloth with big claws that measured up to 12 feet in height and weighed nearly a ton. They are joined by members of related families, including the genus <em>Nothrotheriops</em>, a grizzly bear-sized mammal that reached five feet tall and weighed 1,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Representing archaeological and paleontological marvels, the fossils concealed within the caves constitute genuine treasures, allowing for teams of specialized scientists to explore these wonders, aiming to unravel scientific enigmas, construct hypotheses and shed light on the mysteries that shroud our planet’s history.</p>

<h2>Many more mysteries to be solved</h2>

<p>There’s a symbiotic relationship between the passionate and technical cave explorers who investigate every hole in a cave in their free time (and just for fun) and those in the scientific community who want to study these prehistoric materials but cannot reach where they’re hidden in the underwater darkness. This relationship of discovery and research has already provided evidence of many newly discovered extinct species, as well as ancient humans who had vanished for millennia, a relationship that could be fostered even more by leveraging the world-class level of the dive explorers in the area. After all, the majority of these secrets remain yet to be discovered!</p>

<p>The caves also hold evidence that could solve a prehistoric murder mystery. After the Great American Biotic Interchange, these megafauna species coexisted in this region for hundreds of thousands of years and through multiple ice age cycles, until their abrupt extinction more than 10,000 years ago when a new species arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula: Homo sapiens.</p>

<p>After humans arrived in the region, many genera of large mammals became extinct. There are different ways to explain this mass extinction event. One leading hypothesis states that the already reduced populations of those animals, stressed due to the changing climate after the latest ice age, were hunted to extinction by the humans. These big mammals, which needed a long time to become sexually mature and had slow reproduction rates (up to 22 months), were particularly vulnerable to this new threat.</p>

<p>Among the fossils preserved within the flooded caves, I have witnessed many examples indicating that these extinct species had been hunted and eaten by our predecessors, such as preserved megafauna bones exhibiting cut marks from human-made stone tools, the repetitive marks showing the methodical action taken to remove flesh from the bone. Also noted are perforations on fossilized bones inflicted by projectiles, extinct animal remains beside cooking pits with bones in them, organized piles of bones, and burn marks on animal fossils inside the cave. Indications such as these have been found at cave depths that correspond to the time horizon when humans and the now-extinct animals coexisted and within areas that also exhibit indications of the kind of sophisticated social organization required for early humans to hunt these big creatures, like the mining of red ocher.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of the Paleo-Americans overhunting these species to extinction still needs to be validated, but it is undeniable that these caves protect invaluable material for scientists to study, information that will help us understand our past—and hopefully inform our future.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> is well-known for
its <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">polyglot fat binary</a> hack
that lets your executables run on six OSes for AMD64 / ARM64. What may
surprise you is that it could also be the best C library for your
production workloads too. To demonstrate this point, let's compare
Cosmo's mutex library with other platforms.

</p><p>
We'll do this by writing a simple test that spawns <strong>30
threads</strong> which increment the same integer <strong>100,000
times</strong>. This tests how well a mutex implementation performs in
the heavily contended use case. In essence, that means the following
(see the segment at the bottom of the page for the full source code).

</p><pre><span>int</span> g_chores;
<span>pthread_mutex_t</span> g_locker = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

<span>void</span> *<span>worker</span>(<span>void</span> *arg) {
  <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; ++i) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;g_locker);
    ++g_chores;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;g_locker);
  }
  <span>return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Now let's start with the exciting part, which are my benchmark results.

</p><h3>Benchmarks</h3>

<p>
Times will be measured in microseconds. Wall time is how long the test
program takes to run. That includes the overhead of spawning and joining
threads. User time is how much CPU time was spent in userspace, and
system time is how much CPU time was spent in the kernel. System and
user time can exceed the actual wall time because multiple threads are
running in parallel.

</p><p>
The first results I'll show are for Windows because Mark Waterman did an
excellent <a href="https://github.com/markwaterman/MutexShootout">mutex
shootout</a> three months ago, where he said, "in the highly contended
scenario, Windows wins the day with its SRWLOCK". Contention is where
mutex implementations show their inequality. Mark was so impressed by
Microsoft's SRWLOCK that he went on to recommend Linux and FreeBSD users
consider targeting Windows if mutex contention is an issue.

<p>
As we can see, Cosmopolitan Libc mutexes go 2.75x faster than
Microsoft's SRWLOCK (which was previously believed to be the best of the
best) while consuming 18x fewer CPU resources. Cosmopolitan mutexes were
also 65x faster than Cygwin, which like Cosmopolitan provides a POSIX
implementation on Windows. Cygwin's mutexes are so bad that they would
have been better off for this use case just using a spin lock.

  Here we see Cosmopolitan mutexes are:

</p><ul>
<li>3x faster than glibc
</li><li>11x faster than glibc
</li><li>42x less CPU time than glibc
</li><li>178x less CPU time than Musl Libc
</li></ul>

<p>
Here's how things actually work in practice. Imagine you have a workload
where all your threads need to do a serialized operation. With Cosmo, if
you're looking at htop, then it's going to appear like only one core is
active, whereas glibc and musl libc will fill up your entire CPU meter.
That's bad news if you're running a lot of jobs on the same server. If
just one of your servers has a mutex bloodbath, then all your resources
are gone, unless you're using cosmo. It's still a new C library and it's
a little rough around the edges. But it's getting so good, so fast, that
I'm starting to view <em>not</em> using it in production as an
abandonment of professional responsibility. The C library is so deeply
embedded in the software supply chain, and so depended upon, that you
really don't want it to be a planet killer. If essential unquestioned
tools are this wasteful then it's no wonder Amazon Cloud makes such a
fortune.

</p><p>
Last but not least, we have MacOS.

<p>
On MacOS with an M2 ARM64 microprocessor, Apple's Libc slightly
outperforms Cosmopolitan's mutexes. For reasons I do not yet fully
understand, Cosmopolitan's normal mutex implementation doesn't work well
on this platform. It's possibly because the M2 and XNU are in league. So
on MacOS ARM, Cosmopolitan uses a simpler algorithm based on Ulrich
Drepper's
"<a href="https://dept-info.labri.fr/~denis/Enseignement/2008-IR/Articles/01-futex.pdf">Futexes
Are Tricky</a>" paper that basically just farms out all the heavy
lifting to XNU's ulock system calls. That's why performance is nearly
identical to what Apple does.

</p><p>
So in summary, these benchmark results indicate that Cosmopolitan
mutexes, in the best case, will be overwhelmingly better than
alternatives at the contended + tiny critical section use case, and in
the worst case, Cosmopolitan will be roughly as good.

</p><h3>How I Did It</h3>

<p>
The reason why Cosmopolitan Mutexes are so good is because I used a
library called <a href="https://github.com/google/nsync">nsync</a>. It
only has 371 stars on GitHub, but it was written by a distinguished
engineer at Google named Mike Burrows. If you don't know who he is, he's
the guy who coded Google's fiercest competitor, which was Altavista. If
you're not old enough to remember Altavista, it was the first search
engine that was good, and it ran on a single computer.

</p><p>
I've had a lot of fun integrating nsync into Cosmopolitan. I've even
had the opportunity to make upstream contributions. For example, I found
and fixed a bug in his mutex unlock function that had gone undiscovered
for years. I also managed to make contended nsync mutexes go 30% faster
than nsync upstream on AARCH64, by porting it to use C11 atomics. I
wrote new system integration for things like futexes that enable it do
portability at runtime. Lastly I made it work seamlessly with POSIX
thread cancelations.

</p><p>
So how does nsync do it? What are the tricks that it uses? Here's some
of my takes and analysis:

</p><ul>

<li>
nsync uses an optimistic CAS (compare and swap) immediately, so that
locking happens quickly when there's no contention.

</li><li>
When a lock can't be acquired, nsync adds the calling thread to a
doubly linked list of waiters. Each waiter gets its own semaphore on a
separate independent cacheline. This serves an important purpose. Once a
thread enters the wait state, it's no longer touching the main lock. To
understand why that's important, read Ulrich Drepper's paper
"<a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf">What
Every Programmer Should Know About Memory</a>". He goes into great depth
on the coherency protocols used by modern microprocessors, where cores
basically talk to each other under the hood about which cachelines
they're using. When multiple cores touch the same ones, that creates a
lot of communication overhead within the processor.

</li><li>
nsync enlists the help of the operating system by using futexes. This is
a great abstraction invented by Linux some years ago, that quickly found
its way into other OSes. On MacOS, futexes are called ulock. On Windows,
futexes are called <code>WaitOnAddress()</code>. The only OS Cosmo
supports that doesn't have futexes is NetBSD, which implements POSIX
semaphores in kernelspace, and each semaphore sadly requires creating a
new file descriptor. But the important thing about futexes and
semaphores is they allow the OS to put a thread to sleep. That's what
lets nsync avoid consuming CPU time when there's nothing to do.

</li><li>
nsync avoids starvation with this concept of a "long wait". If a waiter
gets woken 30 times and fails to acquire the lock internally every time,
then nsync adds a bit to the lock that prevents threads that haven't
waited yet from acquiring. This means that initial CAS at the beginning
will fail for everyone else until the queue has had some time to clear.

</li><li>
nsync makes the use case we benchmarked go fast (contended lock with a
small critical section) using this concept of a "designated waker". This
bit on the main lock is set when a thread is awake and trying to acquire
the lock. In nsync, the unlock function is what's responsible for waking
the next thread in line waiting for the lock. Having this bit allows the
unlocking thread to know it needn't bother waking a second locker since
one is already awake.

</li></ul>

<p>
To learn more of nsync's secrets, you can read the source code here:
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/tree/master/third_party/nsync/mu.c"><code>cosmopolitan/third_party/nsync/mu.c</code></a>.

</p><h3>Online Proof</h3>

<p>
If you want to see a live demo of a piece of software built with Cosmo
mutexes, then do your worst DDOS to the
<a href="http://ipv4.games/">http://ipv4.games/</a> web server. Now this
is truly a game for hackers, competing to dominate the Internet. You're
already playing this game because your IP was just claimed for jart. The
service runs on a GCE VM with 2 cores and so far it's managed to survive
being DDOS'd by botnets as large as 49,131,669 IPs. A lot of that is
thanks to nsync which allowed me to move SQL queries to background
threads which send messages to each other. There are still improvements
to be made, but overall it's held up well. You can even monitor
its <a href="http://ipv4.games/statusz">/statusz</a> health metrics.

</pre>

<p>
The reason we care about the contended case, because that's where mutex
implementations show their inequality. Uncontended mutexes usually
perform the same across implementations, and even then you might be
better off with a spin lock, which only takes a few lines:

</p><pre><span>void</span> <span>spin_lock</span>(<span>atomic_int</span> *lock) {
  if (atomic_exchange_explicit(lock, 1, memory_order_acquire)) {
    <span>for</span> (;;) {
      <span>for</span> (;;)
        <span>if</span> (!atomic_load_explicit(lock, memory_order_relaxed))
          <span>break</span>;
      <span>if</span> (!atomic_exchange_explicit(lock, 1, memory_order_acquire))
        <span>break</span>;
    }
  }
}

<span>void</span> <span>spin_unlock</span>(<span>atomic_int</span> *lock) {
  atomic_store_explicit(lock, 0, memory_order_release);
}
</pre>

<p>
Please note that spin locks should really only be used when you have no
other choice. They're useful in kernels, where extreme low level
constraints disallow anything fancy. Spin locks are also a useful
implementation detail in nsync locks. But overall they're bad. I imagine
many developers believe they're good. If so, it's probably because
they've only benchmarked wall time. With locks, it's important to take
CPU time into consideration too. That's why we use
<code>getrusage()</code>.

<p>What follows is an unusual story of perseverance. We start with a conjecture and after some plot twists  end up discussing the meaning of truth. While the title is a spoiler, you might not be able to guess how we got there…</p>



<h4>The conjecture</h4>



<p>The <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkbed_conjecture">bunkbed conjecture</a></em></strong> (BBC) is a basic claim about random subgraphs. Start with a finite graph <em><strong>G</strong></em><strong>=(<em>V</em>,<em>E</em>)</strong> and consider a product graph <strong><em>G</em> <em>x</em> <em>K</em><sub>2</sub></strong> obtained by connecting the corresponding vertices on levels <strong><em>V</em><sup>(1)</sup></strong> and <strong><em>V</em><sup>(2)</sup></strong>.  Sort of like a <a href="https://i.etsystatic.com/22453533/r/il/81fe4f/3189746867/il_1588xN.3189746867_dodu.jpg">bunkbed</a>.  Now consider random subgraphs of a this product graph.  </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><mark>Bunkbed Conjecture:</mark></strong>  The probability that vertices <em><strong>u</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> and <em><strong>v</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> are connected is greater or equal than the probability that vertices <em><strong>u</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> and <strong><em>v</em></strong><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup> are connected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In other words, the probability of connecting two vertices on the same level cannot be smaller than when connect vertices on different levels. This is completely obvious, of course! And yet the conjecture this problem defeated several generations of probabilists and remained open until now. For a good reason, of course. It was <em><a href="https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/04/87/13/32/1000_F_487133220_dPDd98wC3pFZcHxs4wfEnZYDAO4wDqLd.jpg">false</a></em>!</p>



<p>The origins of the conjecture are murky, but according to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2652916">van den Berg and Kahn</a> it was conjectured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Kasteleyn">Kasteleyn </a>in the early 1980s. There are many versions of this conjecture; notably one can condition on the subset of vertical edges and ask the same question. Many partial results are known, as well as results for other probabilistic models. The conjecture is <em><strong><mark>false</mark></strong></em> nonetheless!</p>



<h4>The direction</h4>



<p>Why look for a counterexample if the conjecture is so obviously true?  Well, because you always should.  For any conjecture.  Especially if everyone else is so <em><strong>sure</strong></em>, as in <em>completely absolutely sure without a doubt</em>, that the conjecture is true.  <strong><em><mark>What if they are all wrong?</mark></em></strong>  I discuss this at length in <a href="https://wp.me/p211iQ-uT">this blog post</a>, so there is no need to rehash this point.  </p>



<h4>The counterexample</h4>



<p>We disprove the conjecture in a<strong> <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/BunkBed4.pdf">joint paper</a></strong> with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~gladkovna/">Nikita Gladkov</a> (UCLA) and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/azimin/www/">Alexandr Zimin</a> (MIT), both graduate students.  Roughly speaking we take the following 3-hypergraph from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01790">recent paper</a> by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PabtgaQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Hollom</a>.  </p>

<p>We then replace each yellow triangle with the following gadget using <em>n</em>=1204, placing <em>a</em> in the shaded vertex, while <em><strong>v</strong></em><sub><strong>1</strong></sub> and <em><strong>v</strong></em><sub><strong>n</strong></sub> are placed in the other vertices of the triangle (so the red path goes into the red path).  For a stronger version of the conjecture that’s all there is.  For a weaker version, some additional tweaks needed to be made (they are not so important).  And we are done!  </p>

<p>The resulting graph is has 7523 vertices and 15654 edges.   The difference between probabilities for paths between <strong><em>u</em><sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><em>u</em><sub>10</sub></strong> at the same and different levels as in the conjecture is astronomically small, on the order of -10<sup>-6500</sup>.  But it’s negative, which is all we need.  Very very roughly speaking, the red path is the only path which avoids shaded vertices and creates a certain bias which give this probability gap.  Formalizing this is a bit technical.  </p>



<h4>The experiments</h4>



<p>Of course, the obvious way to verify our counterexample computationally would fail miserably — the graph is much too large.  Instead, we give a relatively elementary completely combinatorial disproof of the BBC that is accessible to a wide audience.  I would rather not rehash technical details and ideas in the proof — it’s all in <strong><a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/BunkBed4.pdf">our paper</a></strong>, which is only 12 pages!   See also the <a href="https://github.com/Kroneckera/bunkbed-counterexample">GitHub code</a> and some <a href="https://web.mit.edu/azimin/www/notebooks/bunkbed_counterexample.html">explanation</a>. </p>



<p>I do want to mention that giving formal disproof was not our first choice.  It’s what we ended up doing after many failures.  There is always a bit of a stigma people have about publicly discussing their failures.  I know very few examples, only <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/549797884/How-Not-to-Prove-Poincare-Conjecture">this one</a> famous enough to be mentioned.   So let me mention briefly how we failed.  </p>



<p>Since I was sure the bunkbed conjecture is false (for reasons somewhat different from my contrarian philosophy), we started with a myriad of computer experiments trying all small graphs.  When those failed, we tried to use AI and other computer assisted tools.  We burned many hours on a giant <em><a href="https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/">UCLA Hoffman2 Cluster</a></em> getting closer for a while.  In hindsight, we didn’t look in the right place, obviously.  After several months of computer experiments and no clear counterexample, it felt we are wasting time.  We then thought a bit more about philosophy of what we are doing and stopped.  </p>



<p>Before I tell you why we stopped, let me make a <strong>general recommendation</strong>.  Please do try computer experiments for whatever you are working on.  Make an effort to think it through and design a good experiment.  Work hard to test as much as your computer technology allows.  If you need some computing power, ask around.  Your university might just have the resources.  Occasionally, you can even <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/120867366">ask a private company</a> to donate theirs.  </p>



<p>If you succeed, write a paper and publish it.  Make your code and work notes publicly available.  If you fail, do exactly the same.  If the journals refuse to publish your paper, just keep it on the arXiv.  Other people in your area would want to know.  And as far as the NSF is concerned, all of this is “work product”.  You can’t change the nature of the problem and the results you are getting, but you deserve the credit regardless.  </p>



<p><strong>Let me repeat:</strong> Do not fear telling other you have not succeeded in your computer testing.  Fear others making the same mistakes or repeating the same work that you did.</p>



<h4>The curse</h4>



<p>One reason we stopped is because in our initial rush to testing we failed to contemplate the implications of Monte Carlo testing of even moderately large graphs.  Here is a quote from the paper:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we did find a potential counterexample graph with only <em>m</em>=100 edges and the probability gap was large enough to be statistically detectable. Since analyzing all of 2<sup>m</sup> ≈ 10<sup>30</sup> subgraphs is not feasible, our Monte Carlo simulations could only confirm the desired inequality with high probability. While this probability could be amplified by repeated testing, one could never formally disprove the bunkbed conjecture this way, of course. </p>



<p><br>This raises somewhat uncomfortable questions whether the mathematical community is ready to live with an uncertainty over validity of formal claims that are only known with high probability. It is also unclear whether in this imaginary world the granting agencies would be willing to support costly computational projects to further increase such probabilities (cf. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543">Garrabrant+’16</a>], [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9301202">Zeilberger’93</a>]). Fortunately, our failed computational effort avoided this dystopian reality, and we were able to disprove the bunkbed conjecture by a formal argument.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Societal implications aside, it is an interesting question whether a reputable math journal <em>should </em>accept a counterexample that is tested with 99.99% confidence, and the results can be replicated and rechecked by others.  Five sigma may be a <a href="https://home.cern/resources/faqs/five-sigma">gold standard</a> in nuclear physics, but math journals tend to prefer 100% correctness (even though <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/13/journal-retracts-paper-state-senator-former-mathematician/">some papers</a> they publish are 100% incorrect).  </p>



<p>What I <em>do know</em>, is that most journals would refuse to even <em>consider</em> a “five sigma counterexample”.  While details of the situations differ quite a bit, I knew <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion121.html">what happened</a> to the (rather interesting) Sills–Zeilberger paper, which was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10236198.2012.678837">eventually published</a>, but not after several desk rejections.  But PhD students need jobs in reality, not in theory.  That is really why we stopped.  Why persevere and create controversy when you can just try doing something else?  </p>



<p><strong>P.S.</strong> There is yet another layer to all of this. Back in 1999, I asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Wigderson">Avi Wigderson</a> if <strong>P=BPP</strong>? He said “<em>Yes</em>“. Last week I asked him again. This is 25 years later, almost to the day. He said “<em>Yes, I am absolutely sure of that</em>.” It’s one of his <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-turing-award-winner-everything-is-computation-and-some-problems-are-unsolvable/">favorite conjectures</a>, of course. If he is right, every probabilistic counterexample can be turned into deterministic. In other words, there would be a fully rigorous way to estimate both probabilities and prove on a computer that the conjecture is false. But you must have guessed what I was thinking when I heard what he said — now he used “<em>absolutely sure</em>“…</p>

  <div dir="" data-test-bidi=""><p>There are times in life, when we have to be present. We can't be seen looking at our phones, no matter how boring the activity in front of us may be. So we just sit there, losing brain cells by the second. At least, thats how things were BEFORE TIK!</p><p>LIFE AFTER TIK:<br>Boredom is a thing of the past! Tik has no sounds or visuals, meaning you can play it anytime, anywhere! Just hold your phone in your hand, whether it be under a desk or in your pocket, and tap away! Because Tik uses haptic feedback (the thing your phone does when you make a purchase, or hold the send button in iMessages for a couple seconds) in order to provide interactive, immersive gameplay, there's no need to ever look at the screen or hear anything!</p><p>OK. SO HOW DOES TIK WORK?<br>You will feel a series of 5 to 8 “Tiks” (haptic vibrations). Then, try to copy the rhythm of the sequence by tapping it anywhere on the screen. If the timing of your taps is close enough, you win! If not, Tik will replay the sequence so you can try again.</p><p>THIS SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!<br>It Is! Well, almost, because it is true! Download Tik today and say goodbye to mundane meetings and boring presentations forever!</p><p>HAVE A QUESTION?<br>We would love to hear it! Please reach out to us at freestyle.feedback@gmail.com</p><p>(One more thing. We realize that Tik may be accessible to those with certain disabilities since the game relies solely on haptic feedback. We have added accessibility support within the app, but if there is anything else we can add to make the app more accessible please let us know by reaching out at freestyle.feedback@gmail.com or by telling us in a review. Thank you!)</p></div>
