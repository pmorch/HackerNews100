            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>In a moment of clarity after initially moving forward a deeply flawed piece of legislation, the French National Assembly has done the right thing: it rejected a dangerous proposal that would have gutted end-to-end encryption in the name of fighting drug trafficking. Despite heavy pressure from the Interior Ministry, </span><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2025/03/21/l-assemblee-vote-pour-le-maintien-de-la-confidentialite-des-messageries-cryptees-lors-d-une-nuit-agitee_6584121_3224.html"><span>lawmakers voted Thursday night</span></a><span> (article in French) to strike down a provision that would have forced messaging platforms like Signal and WhatsApp to allow hidden access to private conversations.</span></p>
<p><span>The vote is a victory for digital rights, for privacy and security, and for common sense.</span></p>
<p><span>The proposed law was a surveillance wishlist disguised as anti-drug legislation. Tucked into its text was a resurrection of the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/give-ghost-backdoor-another-name"><span>widely discredited "ghost” participant model</span></a><span>—a backdoor that pretends not to be one. Under this scheme, law enforcement could silently join encrypted chats, undermining the very idea of private communication. Security experts have </span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/64968/why-the-ghost-keys-solution-to-encryption-is-no-solution/"><span>condemned</span></a><span> the approach, </span><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-ghost-proposals/"><span>warning</span></a><span> it would introduce systemic vulnerabilities, damage trust in secure communication platforms, and create tools ripe for abuse.</span></p>
<p><span>The French lawmakers who voted this provision down deserve credit. They listened—not only to </span><a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/warondrugslaw/"><span>French digital rights organizations</span></a><span> and technologists, but also to basic principles of cybersecurity and civil liberties. They understood that encryption protects everyone, not just activists and dissidents, but also journalists, medical professionals, abuse survivors, and ordinary citizens trying to live private lives in an increasingly surveilled world.</span></p>
<h3><b>A Global Signal</b></h3>
<p><span>France’s rejection of the backdoor provision should send a message to legislatures around the world: you don’t have to sacrifice fundamental rights in the name of public safety. Encryption is not the enemy of justice; it’s a tool that </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/european-court-human-rights-confirms-undermining-encryption-violates-fundamental"><span>supports our fundamental human rights</span></a><span>, including the right to have a private conversation. It is a pillar of modern democracy and cybersecurity.</span></p>
<p><span>As governments in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and elsewhere </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/defending-encryption-us-and-abroad"><span>continue to flirt with anti-encryption laws</span></a><span>, this decision should serve as a model—and a warning. Undermining encryption doesn’t make society safer. It makes everyone more vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span>This victory was not inevitable. It came after sustained public pressure, expert input, and tireless advocacy from civil society. It shows that pushing back works. But for the foreseeable future, misguided lobbyists for police national security agencies will continue to push similar proposals—perhaps repackaged, or rushed through quieter legislative moments.</span></p>
<p><span>Supporters of privacy should celebrate this win today. Tomorrow, we will continue to keep watch. </span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) just made a move that will protect bad patents at the expense of everyone else. In a <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/news-updates/uspto-rescinds-memorandum-addressing-discretionary-denial-procedures">memo released February 28</a>, the USPTO further restricted access to inter partes review, or IPR—the process Congress created to let the public challenge invalid patents without having to wage million-dollar court battles.</p>
<p>If left unchecked, this decision will shield bad patents from scrutiny, embolden patent trolls, and make it even easier for hedge funds and large corporations to weaponize weak patents against small businesses and developers.</p>
<h3><strong>IPR Exists Because the Patent Office Makes Mistakes</strong></h3>
<p>The USPTO grants <a href="https://ipo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-Top-300-Patent-Owners-List.pdf">over 300,000 patents a year</a>, but many of them <a href="https://ipwatchdog.com/2021/01/07/alice-in-2020-slashing-software-patents-and-searching-for-functional-language-at-the-federal-circuit-part-i/id=128802/">should not have been issued</a> in the first place. Patent examiners spend, on average, around <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=261400">20 hours per patent</a>, often missing key prior art or granting patents that are overly broad or vague. That’s how bogus patents on basic ideas—like <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/effs-podcasting-patent-win-highlights-disturbing-trend">podcasting</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/how-newegg-crushed-the-shopping-cart-patent-and-saved-online-retail/">online shopping carts</a>, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/a-patent-on-watching-ads-online-no-problem-says-top-patent-court/">watching ads online</a>—have ended up in court.</p>
<p>Congress created IPR in 2012 to fix this problem. IPR allows anyone to challenge a patent’s validity based on prior art, and it’s done before specialized judges at the USPTO, where experts can re-evaluate whether a patent was properly granted. It’s faster, cheaper, and often fairer than fighting it out in federal court.</p>
<h3><strong>The USPTO is Blocking Patent Challenges—Again</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of defending IPR, the USPTO is working to sabotage it. The February 28 memo reinstates a rule that allows for widespread use of “discretionary denials.” That’s when the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) refuses to hear an IPR case for procedural reasons—even if the patent is likely invalid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The February 28 memo reinstates widespread use of the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/IPR2020-00019,%20Apple%20v.%20Fintiv,%20Paper%2011%20(3.20.20).pdf"><i>Apple v. Fintiv</i> rule</a>, under which the USPTO often rejected IPR petitions whenever there’s an ongoing district court case about the same patent. This is backwards. If anything, an active lawsuit is proof that a patent’s validity needs to be reviewed—not an excuse to dodge the issue.</p>
<p>In 2022, former USPTO Director Kathi Vidal issued a <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/interim_proc_discretionary_denials_aia_parallel_district_court_litigation_memo_20220621_.pdf">memo</a> making clear that the PTAB should hear patent challenges when “a petition presents compelling evidence of unpatentability,” even if there is parallel court litigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That 2022 guidance essentially saved the IPR system. Once PTAB judges were told to consider all petitions that showed “compelling evidence,” the procedural denials <a href="https://www.unifiedpatents.com/insights/2022/10/27/q3-ptab-discretionary-denial-report-use-of-fintiv-drops-to-near-zero">dropped to almost nothing</a>. This February 28 memo signals that the USPTO will once again use discretionary denials to sharply limit access to IPR<span>—effectively making patent challenges harder across the board.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Discretionary Denials Let Patent Trolls Rig the System</b></h3>
<p><span>The top beneficiary of this decision will be patent trolls, shell companies formed expressly for the purpose of filing patent lawsuits. Often patent trolls seek to extract a quick settlement before a patent can be challenged. With IPR becoming increasingly unavailable, that will be easier than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Patent owners know that discretionary denials will block IPRs if they file a lawsuit first. That’s why trolls flock to specific courts, like the </span><a href="https://www2.law.temple.edu/10q/how-the-west-became-the-east-the-patent-litigation-explosion-in-the-western-district-of-texas/"><span>Western District of Texas</span></a><span>, where judges move cases quickly and rarely rule against patent owners.</span></p>
<p><span>By filing lawsuits in these troll-friendly courts, patent owners can game the system—forcing companies to pay up rather than risk millions in litigation costs.</span></p>
<p><span>The recent USPTO memo makes this problem even worse. Instead of stopping the abuse of discretionary denials, the USPTO is doubling down—undermining one of the most effective ways businesses, developers, and consumers can fight back against bad patents.</span></p>
<h3><b>Congress Created IPR to Protect the Public—Not Just Patent Owners</b></h3>
<p><span>The USPTO doesn’t get to rewrite the law. Congress passed IPR to ensure that weak patents don’t become weapons for extortionary lawsuits. By reinforcing discretionary denials with minimal restrictions, and, as a result, blocking access to IPRs, the USPTO is directly undermining what Congress intended.</span></p>
<p><span>Leaders at the USPTO should immediately revoke the February 28 memo. If they refuse, as </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/when-us-patent-office-wont-do-its-job-congress-should-step"><span>we pointed out the last time IPR denials spiraled out of control</span></a><span>, it’s time for Congress to step in and fix this. They must ensure that IPR remains a fast, affordable way to challenge bad patents—not just a tool for the largest corporations. Patent quality matters—because when bad patents stand, we all pay the price.</span></p>

[...] not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which [everyone] shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position”</blockquote><p>I wanted to know what these words meant to us today. I needed to know what parts of the American Dream we all still had in common. I had to make some sense of what was happening to our country. I’ve been writing on my blog since 2004, and on November 7th, I started writing the most difficult piece I have ever written. </p><p>I asked so many Americans to tell me what the American Dream personally meant to them, and I wrote it all down.</p><p>Later in November, I attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son’s public high school - an adaptation of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1742507328643679&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GgwTbUV3qWhPvsHuYFgy7" rel="noreferrer">the 1967 novel by S.E. Hinton</a>. All I really knew was the famous “stay gold” line from the 1983 movie. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what "stay gold" meant: <em>sharing the American Dream.</em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_7003.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2894" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/IMG_7003.jpg 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/IMG_7003.jpg 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/IMG_7003.jpg 1600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/03/IMG_7003.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We cannot merely attain the Dream. The dream is incomplete until we share it with our fellow Americans. That act of sharing is the final realization of everything the dream stands for.</p><p>Thanks to S.E. Hinton, I finally had a name for my essay, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">“Stay Gold, America.”</a> I published it on January 7th, with a <strong>Pledge to Share the American Dream</strong>.</p><p>In the first part of the Pledge, the short term, our family made eight 1 million dollar donations to the following nonprofit groups: <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org/" rel="noreferrer">Team Rubicon</a>, <a href="https://childrenshungerfund.org/" rel="noreferrer">Children’s Hunger Fund</a>, <a href="https://pen.org/">PEN America</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Trevor Project</a>, <a href="https://www.naacpldf.org/" rel="noreferrer">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.firstgenerationinvestors.com/" rel="noreferrer">First Generation Investors</a>, <a href="https://www.globalrefuge.org/" rel="noreferrer">Global Refuge</a>, and <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="noreferrer">Planned Parenthood</a>. </p><p>Beyond that, we made many additional one million dollar donations to reinforce our technical infrastructure in America – <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Common Crawl Foundation</a>, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noreferrer">Let’s Encrypt</a>, pioneering independent internet journalism, and several other crucial open source software infrastructure projects that power much of the world today.</p><p>I encourage every American to <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/" rel="noreferrer">contribute soon</a>, however you can, to organizations you feel are effectively helping those most currently in need.</p><p>But short term fixes are not enough.</p><p>The <strong>Pledge To Share The American Dream</strong> requires a much more ambitious second act – deeper, long term changes that will take decades. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth to plant a seed toward foundational long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have the same fair access to the American Dream.</p><p>Let me tell you about my own path to the American Dream. It was rocky. My parents were born into deep poverty in Mercer County, West Virginia, and Beaufort County, North Carolina. Our family eventually clawed our way to the bottom of the middle class in Virginia. </p><p>I won’t dwell on it, but every family has their own problems. We did not remain middle class for long. But through all this, my parents got the most important thing right: they loved me openly and unconditionally. That is everything. It’s the only reason I am standing here in front of you today.</p><p>With my family’s support, I managed to achieve a solid public education in Chesterfield County, Virginia, and had the incredible privilege of an affordable state education at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/aboutuva/" rel="noreferrer">University of Virginia</a>. This is a college uniquely rooted in the beliefs of one of the most prominent Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson. He was a living paradox. A man of profound ideals and yet flawed – trapped in the values of his time and place. </p><p>Still, he wrote “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” at the top of the Declaration of Independence. These words were, and still are, revolutionary. They define our fundamental shared American values, although we have not always lived up to them. The American Dream isn’t about us succeeding, alone, by ourselves, but about connecting with each other and succeeding together as Americans.</p><p>I’ve been concerned about wealth concentration in America ever since I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM" rel="noreferrer">2012 video by politizane</a> illustrating just how extreme wealth concentration already was. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPKKQnijnsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Wealth Inequality in America"></iframe></figure><p>I had no idea how close we were to the American Gilded Age from the late 1800s. This period was given a name in the 1920s by historians referencing Mark Twain’s 1873 novel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gilded_Age:_A_Tale_of_Today" rel="noreferrer">The Gilded Age, A Tale of Today</a>. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-151.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-151.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-151.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-151.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>During this time, labor strikes often turned violent, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike" rel="noreferrer">Homestead Strike of 1892</a> resulting in deadly confrontations between workers and Pinkerton guards hired by factory owners. Rapid industrialization created hazardous working conditions in factories, mines, and railroads, where thousands died due to insufficient safety regulations and employers who prioritized profit over worker welfare.</p><p>In January 2025, while I was still writing <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">“Stay Gold, America”</a>, we entered the period of greatest wealth concentration in the entirety of American history. As of 2021, the <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-this-chart-explains-americans-wealth-across-income-levels/" rel="noreferrer">top 1% of households controlled 32% of all wealth</a>, while the bottom 50% only have 2.6%. It's difficult to find more recent data, but wealth concentration has only intensified in the last four years.</p><p>We can no longer say “Gilded Age”.</p><p>We must now say “The First Gilded Age”.</p><p>Today, in our <em>second</em> Gilded Age, more and more people find their path to the American Dream blocked. When Americans face unaffordable education, lack of accessible healthcare, or lack affordable housing, they aren't just disadvantaged – they're trapped, often burdened by massive debt. They have no stable foundation to build their lives. They watch desperately, working as hard as they can, while life simply passes them by, without even the freedom to choose their own lives.</p><p>They don't have time to build a career. They don't have time to learn, to improve. They don't get to start a business. They can’t choose where their kids will grow up, or whether to have children at all, because they can’t afford to. Here in the land of opportunity, the pursuit of happiness has become an endless task for too many. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-152.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1178" height="1141" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-152.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-152.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-152.png 1178w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We are denying people any real chance of achieving the dream that we promised them – that we promised the entire world – when we founded this nation. It is such a profound betrayal of everything we ever dreamed about. Without a stable foundation to build a life on, our fellow Americans cannot even <em>pursue</em> the American Dream, much less achieve it.</p><p>I ask you this: as an American, what is the purpose of a dream left unshared with so many for so long? What’s happening to our dream? Are we really willing to let go of our values so easily? We’re Americans. We fight for our values, the values embodied in our dream, the ones we founded this country on. </p><p>Why aren’t we sharing the American Dream? </p><p>Why aren’t we giving everyone a fair chance at Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness by providing them the fundamentals they need to get there?</p><p>The Dream worked for me, decades ago, and I deeply believe that the American Dream can still work for everyone – if we ensure every American has the same fair chance we did. The American Dream was never about a few people being extraordinarily wealthy. It’s about everyone having an equal chance to succeed and pursue their dreams – their own happiness. It belongs to them. I think we owe them at least that. I think we owe <em>ourselves</em> at least that.</p><p>What can we do about this? There are no easy answers. I can’t even pretend to have the answer, because there isn’t any one answer to give. Nothing worth doing is ever that simple. But I can tell you this: all the studies and all the data I’ve looked at have strongly pointed to one foundational thing we can do here in America over the next five years.</p><p>Natalie Foster, co-founder of the <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/" rel="noreferrer">Economic Security Project</a>, makes a powerful case for the idea that, with all this concentrated wealth, we can offer a <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in the poorest areas of this country – the areas of most need, where money goes the farthest – to unlock vast amounts of untapped American potential. </p><figure><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620978466/"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/the-guarantee-book-natalie-foster-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="467" height="700"></a></figure><p>This isn’t a new idea. We’ve been doing this a while now in different forms, but we never called it Guaranteed Minimum Income.</p><p>In <strong>1797</strong>, Thomas Paine proposed a retirement pension funded by estate taxes. It didn’t go anywhere, but it planted a seed. Much later we implemented the Social Security Act in <strong>1935</strong> . The economic chaos of the Great Depression coupled with the inability of private philanthropy to provide economic security inspired Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal government programs. The most popular and effective program to emerge from this era was Social Security, providing a guaranteed income for retirees. Before Social Security, <em>half</em> of seniors lived in poverty. Today only 10% of seniors live in poverty.</p><p>In his <strong>1967</strong> book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F" rel="noreferrer">Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community</a>, Martin Luther King Jr made the moral case for a form of UBI, Universal Basic Income. King believed that economic insecurity was at the root of all inequality. He stated that a guaranteed income — direct cash disbursements — was the simplest and best way to fight poverty.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-147.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1401" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-147.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-147.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-147.png 1600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-147.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In <strong>1972</strong>, Congress established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, providing direct cash assistance to low-income elderly, blind, and disabled individuals with little or no income. This cash can be used for food, housing, and medical expenses, the essentials for financial stability. As of January, 2025, over 7.3 million people receive SSI benefits.</p><p>In 1975, Congress passed the Tax Reduction Act, establishing the Earned Income Tax Credit. This tax credit benefits working-class parents with children, encouraging work by increasing the income of low-income workers. In 2023, it lifted about 6.4 million people out of poverty, including 3.4 million children. <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.pdf" rel="noreferrer">According to the Census Bureau</a>, it is the second most effective anti-poverty tool after Social Security.</p><p>In 2019, directly inspired by King, mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs" rel="noreferrer">Michael Tubbs</a> – at age 26, one of the youngest mayors in American history – launched the $3 million <a href="https://www.stocktondemonstration.org/" rel="noreferrer">Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration</a>. It provided 125 residents with $500 per month in unconditional cash payments for two years. The program found that recipients experienced improved financial stability, increased full-time employment, and enhanced well-being.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-150.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-150.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-150.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-150.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Michael Tubbs, Former Mayor of Stockton</span></figcaption></figure><p>In my “Stay Gold, America” blog post, I referenced the Robert Frost "Stay Gold" poem and S.E. Hinton's famous famous novel The Outsiders, urging us to retain our youthful ideals as we grow older. Ideals embodied in the American Dream.</p><p>Which brings us to another Robert Frost poem, the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken" rel="noreferrer">Road Not Taken</a>. Our proposal to ensure access to the American Dream is to follow the path less travelled by:  <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income. </strong>GMI is a simpler, more practical, more scalable plan to directly address the root of economic insecurity with minimum bureaucracy.</p><p>We are partnering with GiveDirectly, who oversaw <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/united-states/" rel="noreferrer">the most GMI studies</a> in the United States, and OpenResearch, who just completed the <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study" rel="noreferrer">largest, most detailed GMI study</a> ever conducted in this country in 2023. We are working together to launch a new Guaranteed Minimum Income initiative in rural American communities.</p><p>Network effects within communities explain why equality of opportunity is so effective, and why a shared American Dream is the most powerful dream of all. The potential of the American Dream becomes vastly greater as more people have access to it, <strong>because they share it</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfd8X08RPpuTlf2hnkYH_SF9VY0by5uu7P6q5ANdin5beZlN-_hNxVOEcU2KhLkjS7_IIi4F01zcx_0ReiSLLwZALqMRHfFjcvGVHbVdoo--o_LBqrzN3LzAqhhMe-95CgGZ3_KNw?key=oivBMdfm9lVOB8R5dWgCy3LV" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="351"><figcaption><span>Source: GiveDirectly</span></figcaption></figure><p>They share it with their families, their friends, and their neighbors. The groundbreaking, massive <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation" rel="noreferrer">2023 OpenResearch UBI study data</a> showed that when you give money to the poorest among us, they consistently go <em>out</em> <em>of their way</em> to share that money with others in desperate need.</p><p>The power of opportunity is not in what it can do for one person, but how it connects and strengthens bonds between people. When you empower a couple, you allow them to build a family. When you empower families, you allow them to build a community. When you guarantee fundamentals, you're providing a foundation for those connections to grow and thrive. This is the incredible power and value of community. That is what we are investing in – each other.</p><p>A system where there are no guarantees creates conflict. It creates inequality. A massive concentration of wealth in so few hands weakens connections between us and prevents new ones. America began as a place of connection. Millions of us came together to build this nation, not individually, but together. Equality is connection, and connection is more valuable than any product any company will ever sell you.</p><p>You may ask, why focus on rural communities? There are consistently higher poverty rates in rural counties, with fewer job opportunities, lower wages, and worse access to healthcare and education. It’s not a new problem, either — places like Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and American Indian reservations have been stuck in poverty for decades, with some counties like Oglala Lakota, SD (55.8%) and McDowell, WV (37.6%) hitting extreme levels. Meanwhile, urban counties rarely see numbers that high. The data from the US Census and USDA Economic Research Service make it clear: if you’re poor in America, being rural makes it even harder to escape.</p><p>Rural areas offer smaller populations, which is helpful because we need to start small with lots of tightly controlled studies that we can carefully scale and improve on for larger areas. We hope to build a large body of scientific data showing that GMI really does improve the lives, and the communities, of our fellow Americans.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-149.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-149.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-149.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-149.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="the-initial-plan-is-to-target-a-few-counties-that-i-have-a-personal-connection-to-and-are-still-currently-in-poverty-decades-later">The initial plan is to target a few counties that I have a personal connection to, and are still currently in poverty, decades later:</h3><ul><li>My father was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_West_Virginia" rel="noreferrer">Mercer County</a>, West Virginia, where the collapse of coal mining left good people struggling to survive. Their living and their way of life is now all but gone, and good jobs are hard to find.</li><li>My mother’s birthplace, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_County,_North_Carolina" rel="noreferrer">Beaufort County</a>, North Carolina, has been hit just as hard, with farming and factory jobs disappearing and families left wondering what’s next.</li><li>Our third county is yet to be decided, but will be a community also facing the same systemic, generational obstacles to economic stability and achieving the American Dream.</li></ul><p>We will work with existing local groups to coordinate GMI studies where community members choose to enroll. We will conduct outreach and and provide mentorship to these opt-in study participants. It will be teamwork between Americans.</p><p>We hope Veterans will play a crucial role in our effort. We plan to work with local communities and veteran-serving organizations to engage veterans to support and execute our GMI programs – the same veterans who served our country with distinction, returning home with exceptional leadership skills and a deep commitment to their communities. Their involvement ensures these programs reflect core American values of self-reliance and community service to fellow Americans. </p><p>We'll also partner with established community organizations — churches, civic groups, community colleges, local businesses. These partnerships help integrate our GMI studies with existing support systems, rather than creating new ones.</p><p>GiveDirectly and OpenResearch will build on their existing body of work, gathering extensive data from these refined studies. We'll measure employment, entrepreneurship, education, health, and community engagement. We'll conduct regular interviews with participants to understand their experience. How is this working for you? How can we make it better? You tell us. How can we make it better together?</p><p>Economic security isn't only about individual well-being – it's the bedrock of democracy. When people aren't constantly worried about feeding themselves, feeding their family, having decent healthcare, having a place to live… we have given them room to breathe. We have given them freedom. The freedom to raise their children, the freedom to start businesses, the freedom to choose where they work, the freedom to volunteer... the freedom to <em>vote</em>.</p><p>This isn’t about ideology or government. It’s about us, as Americans, working together to invest in our future – possibly the greatest unlocking of human potential in our entire history. I do not say these things lightly. I’ve seen it work. I’ve looked at all the existing study data. A little bit of money is incredibly transformational for people in poverty – the people who need it the most – the people who cannot live up to their potential because they’re so busy simply trying to survive. Imagine what they could do if we gave them just a little breathing room.</p><p>GMI is a long term investment in the future of what America should be, the way we wrote it down in the Declaration of Independence, perhaps incompletely – but our democracy was always meant to be malleable, to change, to adapt, and improve.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-148.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-148.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-148.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-148.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I’d like to conclude by mentioning Aaron Swartz. He was a precocious teenage programmer much like myself. Aaron helped develop RSS web feeds, co-founded Reddit, and worked with Creative Commons to create flexible copyright licenses for the common good. He used technology to make information universally accessible to everyone.</p><p>Aaron created a system to download public domain court documents from PACER, a government database that charged fees for accessing what he believed should be freely available public information. A few years later, while visiting MIT under their open campus policy and as a research fellow at Harvard, he used MIT's network to download millions of academic articles from JSTOR, another fee-charging online academic journal repository, intending to make this knowledge freely accessible. Since taxpayers had funded much of this research, why shouldn’t that knowledge be freely available to everyone?</p><p>What Aaron saw as an act of academic freedom and information equality, authorities viewed as a crime—he was arrested in January 2011 and charged with multiple felonies for what many considered to be nothing more than accessing knowledge that should have been freely available to the public in the first place.</p><p>Despite JSTOR declining to pursue charges and MIT eventually calling for leniency, federal prosecutors aggressively pursued felony charges against Aaron with up to 35 years in prison. Facing overwhelming legal pressure and the prospect of being labeled a felon, Aaron took his own life at 26. This sparked widespread criticism of prosecutorial overreach and prompted discussions about open access to information. Deservedly so. Eight days later, in this very hall, there was a standing room only memorial service praising Aaron for his commitment to the public good.</p><p>Aaron pursued what was right for we, the people.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>On January 5th 2025, Congestion Pricing went into effect in New York City. It was a long and winding road (as I detailed </span><a href="https://bettercities.substack.com/p/congestion-pricing-chronicles" rel="">here</a><span> last summer), but Governor Hochul finally made the right decision and allowed the policy to go into effect (albeit at a $9 price point vs. the initial $15). While I was a bit concerned at first that this lower price would reduce the effectiveness of the congestion relief zone, it has still been a resounding success over the past two months. </span></p><p><span>Despite this, Trump has issued an order demanding the MTA shut down the program tomorrow, March 21st. </span><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/19/king-trump-kills-congestion-pricing-can-he-really-do-this-not-legally" rel="">Thankfully, Trump’s legal authority here is questionable at best </a><span>and the MTA is making the decision to keep the program running absent any court order forcing their hand. </span></p><p>With so much debate over the impacts of congestion pricing, let’s take a look at the hard data and see exactly what’s happening:</p><p>First and foremost, congestion pricing has been stunningly effective at reducing traffic in Manhattan and the bridges/tunnels entering the city. </p><p><span>In the first month of congestion pricing, the MTA reported </span><strong><a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/new-congestion-relief-zone-data-captures-magnitude-of-faster-commutes-drivers-and-bus" rel="">over 1 million fewer vehicle entries</a></strong><span> into the toll zone than would be expected without the program​, driving the significant traffic reduction seen above. It’s also worth noting that the above chart shows reduction in </span><em>travel times</em><span> rather than congestion—in many cases, </span><em>congestion</em><span> has completely disappeared, and the new travel times represent a congestion-free trip. </span><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/13/its-working-initial-data-show-congestion-pricing-has-stemmed-the-tide-of-years-of-increasing-traffic" rel="">This reduction reverses a years-long trend of rising traffic into Manhattan​</a><span> - congestion pricing took a worsening gridlock problem and solved a significant portion of it </span><em>overnight. </em><span>Additionally, while there were fears that congestion pricing would just re-route traffic to other boroughs, the data from the first months of congestion pricing suggests that </span><strong><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/19/gridlock-sam-trucks-arent-rerouting-into-the-bronx-or-staten-island-to-avoid-congestion-pricing" rel="">traffic has not increased elsewhere in the city.</a></strong></p><p>Transit ridership has seen a notable spike since the implementation of congestion pricing as travelers into Manhattan are switching from driving to transit.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png" width="1125" height="565" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:565,&quot;width&quot;:1125,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:45774,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://bettercities.substack.com/i/158255958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The MTA as a whole is averaging 448K more public transit riders per day this year. To put this into perspective, the second-highest ridership subway in the US is the DC Metro, which a</span><a href="https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/ridership-portal/Metrorail-Ridership-Summary.cfm" rel="">veraged 304K riders per day in January</a><span> this year. The MTA ridership growth since congestion pricing went into effect is almost 50% larger than the </span><em>total</em><span> ridership of America’s next-largest subway system. </span></p><p>Unsurprisingly, bus ridership has seen the greatest relative growth, likely due to the fact that it most immediately benefits from congestion pricing thanks to faster travel times. </p><p><span>As you can see in the above chart, median trip times are down significantly, meaning that buses can go faster.  However, the most interesting aspect of the above chart is the “P90” savings: P90 is the 90th percentile trip (basically the bus rides from hell that get caught in horrible traffic). These trip times are down even more drastically, reflecting the increased reliability of bus rides and shaving off the long tail of major delays. And it’s not just the MTA - buses in </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-results.html" rel="">New Jersey are seeing significantly faster travel times, here’s quote from the CEO of Boxcar, a private bus company in New Jersey. </a></p><blockquote><p><em>“There’s been no need for subtle data analysis,” said Joe Colangelo, 39, Boxcar’s founder and chief executive, who has heard from customers who say they can’t believe how fast their rides are. “The buses are just flying.”</em></p><p><em>Boxcar has already added six more trips a week to and from Manhattan in response to a surge in ridership and is considering adding more, Mr. Colangelo said.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>One of the loudest criticisms of congestion pricing is that it “forces people to take the unsafe subway.”  Putting aside the fact that the </span><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/12/19/heres-how-much-safer-transit-is-compared-to-driving" rel="">subway is already far safer than driving</a><span>, increased transit ridership has driven down subway crime as more “eyes on the train” reduce the appeal of crime and make the system more safe. In January of 2025, </span><a href="https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-subway-crime-plummets-ridership-jumps-2025/" rel="">subway crimes were down 37% vs. 2024. </a><span> This is on an absolute basis, and when adjusting for ridership, the rate of crime went from one crime per 397K riders to one crime per 672K riders. To put that number into perspective, if someone rode the train twice per day, every day, for the next fifty years, that’s ~36,500 rides, and that rider would have only a ~5% chance of ever being a victim of a crime over the course of their lifetime. The risk of being a crime victim on the subway was already slim, but it’s exceedingly so now that congestion pricing has raised ridership and made the trains safer.  On top of that, congestion pricing will likely be used to help fund improved fare gates that will further increase safety in the system. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png" width="744" height="408" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:408,&quot;width&quot;:744,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:638415,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://bettercities.substack.com/i/158255958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Source: Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on MTA Fare and Toll Evasion</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>But it’s not just the trains that are safer.

If we have a compound optical system made of a series of lenses, mirrors, etc., we can treat each optical element as the layer of a neural network. The data flowing through this network are not images, sounds, or text, but rays of light. Each layer affects light rays depending on its internal parameters (surface shape, refractive material...) and following the very much non‑linear Snell's law. Inference, or the forward model, is the optical simulation where given some input light, we compute the system's output light. Training, or optimization, is finding the best shapes for lenses to focus light where we want&nbsp;it.</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>Neural Network</strong></th><th><strong>Optical system</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Data</strong></td><td>Images, Text, Audio</td><td>Light rays</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Layers</strong></td><td>Conv2d, Linear, ReLU</td><td>Refraction, Reflection, Gap</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Loss Function</strong></td><td>Prediction error to labeled examples</td><td>Focusing error in the image plane</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The magic is that we can pretty much use <code>torch.nn</code> and <code>nn.Module</code> directly, stacking lenses and mirrors as if they were <code>Conv2d</code> and <code>ReLU</code>. Then, pass the whole thing through a standard PyTorch <code>optimize()</code> to find the optimal values for parametric surfaces, and designing lenses is surprisingly like training a neural network!

            <pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 12:16:45 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tobloef.com/blog/wheel-reinventors-principles/">https://tobloef.com/blog/wheel-reinventors-principles/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43434730">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <nav data-astro-cid-4dqtj3le="">   <a id="theme-switcher" data-astro-cid-dz5h74bc="">Switch to dark mode</a>   </nav>  <p data-astro-cid-4dqtj3le="">Why and how I sometimes write stuff from scratch.</p> <h2 id="why-reinvent"><a href="#why-reinvent">Why reinvent?</a></h2>
<p>The Wheel Reinventor enjoys reinventing wheels. A lot of wheels have been invented before, some are even very popular. So why does the Wheel Reinventor make new ones?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning:</strong> By reinventing the wheel, the Wheel Reinventor learns much. Not only about how to create new wheels, but also about how existing wheels work.</li>
<li><strong>Specificity:</strong> No one wheel fits all. When creating their own wheel, the Wheel Reinventor can tailor it for their exact use case, whether that’s a wheelbarrow or a monster truck.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Although popular, some existing wheels are quite bad. While reinventing, the Wheel Reinventor has the opportunity to explore new possibilities in a way that existing solutions cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> Wheel reinvention does, in truth, not need much of a reason. It can simply be out of love of the craft and the satisfaction of work well done.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges"><a href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h2>
<p>The Wheel Reinventor must however be careful. Reinventing wheels can be time-consuming and the end product may be inferior to existing solutions. The Wheel Reinventor also tends to fall into infinite rabbit holes. To create a wheel, must they also create the hammer that they need? Must they fell a tree for the hammer’s handle? If the Wheel Reinventor begins by planting a forest, they will not be building vehicles any time soon.</p>
<p>The Wheel Reinventor must therefore first and foremost be deliberate. They must consider whether it is appropriate for a given wheel to be reinvented, especially when accountable to others. They must also consider the scope of what is being reinvented (and crucially, what is not), as to not get needlessly sidetracked.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Wheel Reinventor must be honest with themself. They must keep in mind why they’re reinventing a particular wheel and not lose sight of that. A wheel reinvented for learning looks different than a wheel reinvented for innovation.</p>
<h2 id="development-principles"><a href="#development-principles">Development Principles</a></h2>
<p>(While not strictly tied to the principles above, I have found the points below to help me foster a healthy mindset when doing wheel reinvention projects.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize third-party dependencies. Master the platform’s built-ins and accumulate your own toolbox over time.</li>
<li>Embrace the strengths of DIY. Create what <em>you</em> need and little more. Be wary of abstractions made for fabricated use cases.</li>
<li>Avoid magic where possible. Try to stay close to the metal, preferring simple tools and not losing touch with the underlying technology.</li>
<li>Share your work. Open-source your code where possible. Write about your approach and let others learn from your experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading. Good luck with the wheels.</p> <p data-astro-cid-4dqtj3le="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>It’s no secret that I’m not a fan of big-company HR practices.&nbsp; I’m more of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently-ebook/dp/B00HL2S4LW">First Break all the Rules</a> type.&nbsp; Despite my general skepticism of many standard practices, we still do annual performance reviews at my company, though I’m thinking seriously of dropping them.&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Get-Rid-Performance-Review-Managing/dp/B004X8WB48">Get Rid of the Performance Review</a>.)</p>
<p>Another practice I’m not hugely fond of is “leveling” — the creation of a set of granular levels to classify jobs across the organization.&nbsp; Leveling typically results in something that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/kellblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/level.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/kellblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/level.png?resize=500%2C114&amp;ssl=1" alt="level" width="500" height="114"></a></p>
<p>While I am a huge fan of compensation benchmarking (i.e., figuring out what someone is worth in the market before they do by getting another job), I think classical leveling has a number of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s futile to level across functions. Yes, you might discover that a Senior FPA Analyst II earns the same as a Product Marketing Director I, but why does that matter?&nbsp; It’s a coincidence.&nbsp; It’s like saying with $3.65 I can buy either a grande non-fat latte or a head of organic lettuce.&nbsp; What matters is the fair price of each of those goods in the market — not they that happen to have the same price.&nbsp; So I object to the whole notion of levels across the organization. &nbsp;It’s not canonical; it’s coincidence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most leveling systems are too granular, with the levels separated by arbitrary characterizations. It’s makework.&nbsp; It’s fake science.&nbsp; It’s bureaucratic and encourages a non-thinking “climb the ladder” approach to career development.&nbsp; (“Hey, let’s develop you to go from somewhat-independent to rather-independent this year.”)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It conflates career development and salary negotiation. It encourages a mindset of saying, “what must I do to make L10” when you want to say, “I want a $10K raise.”&nbsp; I can’t tell you the number of times people have asked me for “development” or “leveling” conversations where I get excited and start talking about learning, skills gaps, and such and it’s clear all they wanted to talk about was salary.&nbsp; Disappointing.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I do believe there are three meaningful levels in management and it’s important to understand the differences among them.&nbsp; I can’t tell you the number of times someone has sincerely asked me, “what does it take to be a director?” or, “how can I develop myself into a VP?”</p>
<p>It’s a hard question.&nbsp; You can turn to the leveling system for an answer, but it’s not in there.&nbsp; For years, in fact, I’ve struggled to find what I consider to be a good answer to the question.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about Senior VP vs. Executive VP or Director vs. Senior Director.&nbsp; I view such adjectives as window dressing or <a href="https://www.englishclub.com/ref/esl/Idioms/E/earn_your_stripes_162.htm">stripes</a>:&nbsp; important recognition along the way, but nothing that fundamentally changes one’s level.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about how many people you manage.&nbsp; In call centers, a director might manage 500 people.&nbsp; In startups, a VP might manage zero.</p>
<p>I am talking about one of three levels at which people operate:&nbsp; manager, director, and vice president.&nbsp; Here are my definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managers are paid to drive results with some support</strong>. They have experience in the function, can take responsibility, but are still learning the job and will have questions and need support.&nbsp; They can execute the tactical plan for a project but typically can’t make it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directors are paid to drive results with little or no supervision</strong> (“set and forget”). Directors know how to do the job.&nbsp; They can make a project’s tactical plan in their sleep.&nbsp; They can work across the organization to get it done.&nbsp; I love strong directors.&nbsp; They get shit done.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>VPs are paid to make the plan</strong>. Say you run marketing.&nbsp; Your job is to understand the company’s business situation, make a plan to address it, build consensus to get approval of that plan, and then go execute it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest single development issue I’ve seen over the years is that many VPs still think like directors. [1]</p>
<p>Say the plan didn’t work.&nbsp;&nbsp; “But, we executed the plan we agreed to,” they might say, hoping to play a get-out-of-jail-free card with the CEO (which is about to boomerang).</p>
<p>Of course, the VP got approval to execute the plan. &nbsp;Otherwise, you’d be having a different conversation, one about termination for insubordination.</p>
<p>But the plan didn’t work.&nbsp; Because directors are primarily execution engines, they can successfully play this card.&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; Good directors challenge their plans to make them better.&nbsp; But they can still play the approval&nbsp;card successfully because their primary duty is to execute the plan, not make it.</p>
<p>VP’s, however, cannot play the approval card. &nbsp;The VP’s job is to get the right answer. &nbsp;They are the functional expert.&nbsp; No one on the team knows their function better than they do.&nbsp; And even if someone did, they are still playing the VP of function role and it’s their job – and no one else’s — to get the right answer.</p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking, “glad I don’t work for Dave” right now — he’s putting failure of a plan to which he and the team agreed on the back of the VP.&nbsp; And I am.</p>
<p>But it’s the same standard to which the CEO is held.&nbsp; If the CEO makes a plan, gets it approved by the board, and executes it well but it doesn’t work, they cannot tell the board “but, but, it’s the plan we agreed to.”&nbsp; Most CEOs wouldn’t even dream of saying that.&nbsp; It’s because CEOs understand they are held accountable not for effort or activity, but results.</p>
<p>Part of truly operating at the VP level is to internalize this fact.&nbsp; You are accountable for results.&nbsp; Make a plan that you believe in.&nbsp; Because if the plan doesn’t work, you can’t hide behind approval.&nbsp; Your job was to make a plan that worked.&nbsp; If the risk of dying on a hill is inevitable, you may as well die on your own hill, and not someone else’s.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing the ancient <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHug0AIhVoQ">Fram oil filter commercial</a>, I call this “you can fire me now or fire me later” principle.&nbsp; An executive should never sign up for a plan they don’t believe in.&nbsp; They should risk being fired now for refusing to sign up for the plan (e.g., challenging assumptions, delivering bad news) as opposed to halfheartedly executing a plan they don’t believe in and almost certainly getting fired for its failure later. &nbsp;The former is a far better way to go than the latter.</p>
<p>This is important not only because it prepares the VP to one day become a&nbsp; CEO, but also because it empowers the VP in making their plan.&nbsp; If this my plan, if I am to be judged on its success or failure, if I am not able to use approval as a get-out-of-jail-free card, then is it the right plan?</p>
<p>That’s the thinking I want to stimulate. &nbsp;That’s how great VPs think.</p>

							<p><span>Almost four years ago to the day, the FBI entered U.S. Private Vaults (USPV), a storage business in Beverly Hills, and raided the safe-deposit boxes there, pocketing tens of millions of dollars in cash, valuables, and personal items. Among those owners was Linda Martin, from whom agents took $40,200—her life savings—despite that she had not been charged with a crime.</span></p> <p><span>Those charges would never come. Although USPV itself was ultimately indicted in federal court, the government had no case against unknowing customers like Martin, in a scheme that attorneys have </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/08/04/prosecutors-tried-to-seize-57k-from-a-safe-deposit-box-because-its-owner-sold-bongs-without-a-permit/"><span>compared</span></a><span> to seizing property from individual apartment units because the tenants' landlord was suspected of criminal wrongdoing. At USPV, the agency confiscated over $100 million in valuables from a slew of such people via civil forfeiture, the legal process that allows the government to take people's property without having to prove its owners committed any crime.</span></p> <p><span>The FBI was found to have exceeded the terms of its warrant and to have <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/23/appeals-court-fbis-safe-deposit-box-seizures-violated-fourth-amendment/">violated the Fourth Amendment</a>. But it still refused to give back Martin's life savings. She had opted not to store it in a bank account, she says, because she was saving it for a house and did not want to be tempted to spend it. Her bank, meanwhile, did not have a safe-deposit box available, prompting her to turn to USPV.</span></p> <p><span>About two years post-seizure, the bureau returned Martin's money—shortly after she filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit. But while the bureau may have hoped that would persuade her to drop it, she has continued with her suit, which was back in court last week and seeks a ruling that will prevent the FBI from proceeding with others as it did with her.</span></p> <p><span>At the core of her argument is the notice the federal government sent alerting her to the fact that agents had seized her property. The problem: It didn't give her a reason.</span></p> <p><span>Martin's claim, her </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CADC-15-Brief-of-Appellant.pdf"><span>appellant brief</span></a><span> notes, "is that when the FBI attempts to forfeit someone's property, due process requires that it say why, citing </span><i><span>specific facts and laws</span></i><span>." Instead, the notice she received listed hundreds of possible federal crimes that would justify a seizure, though it didn't provide Martin's supposed connection to those offenses. "By sending notices that initiate and, often, consummate property's forfeiture—all without ever saying what exactly the FBI thinks justifies the forfeiture," her brief says, "the FBI deprives owners of crucial information they need to protect their rights."</span></p> <p><span>Those notices, which Martin alleges violate the Fifth Amendment, are standard practice for the bureau. And they have already drawn the ire of a federal judge, who in 2021 <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/24/judge-orders-fbi-to-halt-forfeiture-of-cash-jewelry-from-safe-deposit-boxes/">ordered</a> the agency to halt its forfeiture from hundreds of USPV safe-deposit boxes because the "anemic" notices provided "no factual basis for the seizure."</span></p> <p><span>That ruling, however, applied only to those USPV plaintiffs. Martin would like to see it apply nationwide. "Without specific notice, property owners can't understand what this is all about, and therefore can't do any investigation or get meaningful advice from attorneys," says Robert Frommer, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Martin. "Owners must decide whether to fight against the federal government, default, or plead for mercy, all without knowing why the FBI is doing this to them. It's therefore little surprise that 93% of federal forfeitures never get to a court, meaning the FBI gets to keep the money without ever telling </span><i><span>anyone</span></i><span> why they should be allowed to." The hearing last week was on a jurisdictional issue and has yet to be evaluated on the merits.</span></p> <p><span>From the outset, the USPV raid was defined by illegal activity—on the part of federal law enforcement. The warrant, which agents <a href="https://reason.com/2022/08/19/fbi-misled-judge-in-obtaining-warrant-to-seize-hundreds-of-safe-deposit-boxes/">misled a judge</a> to obtain, explicitly <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700649-21-notice-of-motion-and-motion-for-return-of-property-pursuant-to-fed-r-crim-p-41g/#document/p10">forbade</a> them from engaging in a "criminal search or seizure" of the content of the safe-deposit boxes; they violated that condition (and the Constitution) and did it anyway. Agents seized a litany of valuables, from cash to <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/11/fbi-raid-safety-deposit-boxes-los-angeles-jennifer-paul-snitko-85-million-civil-forfeiture/">personal items</a>—a baptismal certificate, a marriage certificate, a birth certificate—to gold coins. (In the latter case, the FBI could not find 63 of those coins, belonging to Don Mellein, worth over $100,000. Oops!)</span></p> <p><span>But Martin's suit raises another issue, which strikes at the root: If the government cannot articulate why agents are taking someone's life savings, then perhaps they shouldn't be taking it.</span></p>						</div></div>]]></description>

<h3>New features</h3><ul>
<li><span>Much improved Kobo support</span>
<p>calibre can now natively edit, view and convert KEPUB format files used by the Kobo. It also automatically converts EPUB to KEPUB when sending books to Kobo devices (can be configured by right clicking the kobo icon in calibre).</p>

<p>If you do not know what the Content server is, you do not use it, and these do not apply to you. If you have set a password to access the Content server that you have not shared with anyone, these do not affect you. A remote code execution bug in the Content server introduced in calibre version 6.9.0 (released on 2022-11-25) means that anyone with access to the server also has access to the rest of the computer the server is running on. If you are using a password to protect access to the server only people that know the password can gain access via the bug.

<li><span>Much improved Kobo support [8.0.1]</span>
<p>calibre can now natively edit, view and convert KEPUB format files used by the Kobo. It also automatically converts EPUB to KEPUB when sending books to Kobo devices (can be configured by right clicking the kobo icon in calibre).</p>
</li>
<li><span>Connect to folder: Allow connecting a specific device [8.0.1]</span>
<p>calibre can now connect to a folder and treat it as though it is a USBMS based device. This is useful particularly on Chromebooks where USB devices appear as folders rather than actual devices.</p>
</li>
<li><span>Edit book: A new tool to create an audio overlay in EPUB files for all text using the Read aloud facility [7.21]</span>
<p>This allows readers of the book to listen to it with sentence tracking, even if they do not have a functioning text-to-speech system in the reading software. You can even assign different voices to different parts of the text for a more immersive experience. The tool is available from the Tools menu in the book editor.</p>
</li>
<li><span>PDF Input: Automatic header/footer detection and removal [7.20]</span>
<p>A new, dedicated PDF Input engine for calibre that implements automatic detection of headers and footers based on document analysis. The new engine is the default to go back to using the old engine, select it in the PDF Input section of the Conversion dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Halve the time taken to open large EPUB format books for the first time [7.19]</span>
<p>A four hundred thousand word EPUB book now opens in under a second on typical hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Read aloud: A new Text-to-Speech engine (Piper) that uses a neural network for realistic sounding voices [7.18]</span>
<p>To use it access the viewer controls and click the Read aloud button or press 'Ctrl+S'. The neural network is run locally, no cloud services are used. Using the OS Text-to-Speech engine is still possible by clicking the configure button on the Read aloud control bar. Note that the new engine highlights the currently read sentence rather than word.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Support for jumping to and displaying paper edition page numbers [7.17]</span>
<p>If an e-book contains embedded information about the pages from the paper edition of the book, the calibre E-book viewer can now jump to a page number via the Go to button in the viewer controls. You can also optionally have the current paper edition page number displayed in the header/footer by adding "Pages from paper edition" to either the header or footer in the viewer settings.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Allow saving current settings in "profiles" that can be quickly and easily swapped between [7.6]</span>
<p>Closes tickets: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/+bug/1979022" target="_blank">1979022</a></p>
<p>To create a profile or switch to a previously saved profile access "Profiles" from the viewer controls or press the `Alt+P` shortcut.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://boycott-ietf127.org/">https://boycott-ietf127.org/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43431780">Hacker News</a></p>

            They say:
        </p>
        <p>
                <em>"... it would be inappropriate to make any change without clear evidence of a direct issue"</em>
            </p>
        <p>
            However, the threat is real:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The IETF Administration LLC has decided to continue to hold meetings in the US,
            in spite of significant threats to the safety of the community in traveling there.
            As an Internet community we strive to include everyone. Holding a meeting in the
            US is incompatible with our values.
            We call on the IETF community to refuse to travel to the 127<sup>th</sup> IETF meeting,
            to be held in San Francisco.
        </p>

        <h2>The US is dangerous</h2>
        <p>
            For many, the US was already a country for which it was not safe to travel to.
            But now, it is an actively hostile state to almost anyone travelling there.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Surely this won't affect me; I'm white, male, and European?' Think again.
            Here are the examples we know about of people being detained at the US border,
            and put into camps:
        </p>

            There are undoubtedly more cases we do not know about.
            These people are being held in utterly inhumane conditions, often without access to appropriate
            medical care, legal representation, food, nor even a bed. Some have been tortured.

            <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8718.html#RFC8711">RFC 8718</a> sets the
            criteria for the selection of a meeting venue for the IETF meetings. Amongst the <i>core</i> values listed
            is that of inclusiveness. Specifically, the IETF should:
        </p>
        <p>
                Avoid meeting in countries with laws that effectively exclude people on the basis of race, ethnicity,
                religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, or gender identity.

In a new role, Rockwell will be in charge of the Siri virtual assistant, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the moves haven’t been announced.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi, removing Siri completely from Giannandrea’s command. Apple announced the changes to employees on Thursday following Bloomberg News’ initial report.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The iPhone maker’s senior leaders — a group known as the Top 100 — just met at a secretive, annual offsite gathering to discuss the future of the company. Its AI efforts were a key talking point at the summit, Bloomberg has reported.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The moves underscore the plight facing Apple: Its AI technology is severely lagging industry rivals, and the company has shown little sign of catching up. The Apple Intelligence platform was late to arrive and largely a flop, despite being the main selling point for the iPhone 16.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>    <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Rockwell is currently the vice president in charge of the Vision Products Group, or VPG, the division that developed Apple’s headset. As part of the changes, he’ll be leaving that team, though the Vision Pro software groups will follow him to Federighi’s software engineering group. The hardware team will remain under John Ternus and report to Paul Meade, a hardware engineering executive who worked on the Vision Pro.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the moves.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The need to rescue Siri is especially urgent. The company has struggled to release new features that were announced last June, including the ability to tap into a user’s data to fulfill queries. Despite the technology not being ready, Apple advertised the enhancements for months on TV in order to sell the iPhone 16. Following development snags, the company further delayed the features earlier this month.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div>    <hr> <ul><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-678e58da-88a7-3821-9d51-68db9be95a7a"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-eafef4e4-4d58-4f99-a239-925b801527b8"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-01508a48-f82d-3959-81ee-b52ac16b1a0c"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-bc62164c-57ca-3a96-95a0-c9ef417ed696"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-bc78c840-6810-385f-9e5e-f833f364c540"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-ad2d6a58-93c0-321c-b00e-705b11b8182d"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-e8d3a548-38c9-4792-b407-6b9246abcc88"> </li></ul> <section><header> </header>   </section></div></article> </section></div>]]></description>

            London’s Heathrow Airport has been brought to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/london-heathrow-airport-shut-intl-hnk-03-21-25/index.html">complete standstill</a> by a “significant power outage,” setting off waves of global travel chaos from one of the world’s busiest <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/21/business/heathrow-airport-closure-disruption-losses-hnk-intl/index.html">transit hubs</a>.

            Friday’s shutdown was caused by a fire in an electrical substation in the town of Hayes, just a few miles from the airport, which disrupted the local power supply, throwing more than 1,000 flights into disarray and forcing pilots to divert their journeys in midair.

            More than 145,000 air passengers could be impacted by the closure, which officials warned could spiral into “significant disruption” over the coming days.

            “We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” Heathrow Airport said in a statement to CNN, adding that they “do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored.”

            A transformer at an electrical substation <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/london-heathrow-airport-shut-intl-hnk-03-21-25#cm8ia7aww000h3b6m8n78ton5">in the London suburb of Hayes</a> caught fire Thursday night, according to the London Fire Brigade (LFB).
    </p>

            Ten trucks and around 70 firefighters were deployed to battle the blaze, the fire brigade said. A 200-meter (650-feet) cordon was set up around the scene.
    </p>

            “The fire in Hayes is now under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day,” the LFB said in an <a href="https://x.com/LondonFire/status/1902992793745641904" target="_blank">update</a> on X.

            “As of the most recent update that I have received, approximately 10% remains alight” of the “high voltage substation,” LFB Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Smith also said in a news conference Friday morning.

            “The fire involved a transformer comprising of 25,000 liters of cooling oil, fully alight. This created a major hazard due to the still-live, high-voltage equipment and the nature of the oil fuel fire,” Smith added.

            Britain’s energy minister also said there was “no suggestion” of foul play. “At the moment, the focus is on restoring the power. We don’t yet have any… real understanding… of what caused the fire,” Ed Miliband told London’s LBC Radio.

            Analysts forecast myriad supply challenges for airlines trying to reroute hundreds of flights to and from the London airport – a travel base that hosts a quarter of a million passengers and 1,300 flights from the United States, Southeast Asia and the Middle East every day.

            Heathrow was the world’s fourth-busiest airport in 2023, according to the most recent data. Last year, a record-breaking 83.9 million passengers passed through. Spread across four terminals, it usually runs at 99% capacity, with every major airline crossing the hub.

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8inarr3001p396m6ytmrao3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Just on Friday, more than 1,350 flights going in or out of the airport will be affected, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. At the time of the closure, 120 airborne flights were immediately diverted to other airports or turned back to their original location.

            The process to decide where the flights would be diverted is a dynamic and “fast-moving” one, according to aviation analyst Shukor Yusof.

            “It requires a lot of coordination between the UK authority and the airline coming to land,” Yusof said, adding long-haul flights present “a more complex challenge” for rerouting.

            Only a limited number of spots at nearby airports would be available, forcing airlines to potentially seek other options outside of the UK in this case, he explained. One important, potentially deciding factor in rerouting would be fuel, as pilots may also be asked to circle midair while waiting for a free runway to land on, he added.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 22 Feb 2025</p>
<p>
  There's a corner of the Internet where people have been reclaiming
  their digital independence by hosting their own websites and
  promoting the idea of owning your own content—it's called the
  IndieWeb.  This community has its
  own <a href="https://indieweb.org/">website</a>, IRC channels,
  social media presence, etc.  This movement promotes the idea that
  individuals should control their own digital presence through
  personal websites.  But every time this topic comes up in online
  discussions, someone inevitably claims that the IndieWeb hasn't
  taken off!
</p>
<p>
  I feel that such claims about the IndieWeb not "taking off" are
  either stating the obvious or, if that's not the intention,
  completely missing the point.  It's like saying that gardening
  hasn't taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the
  supermarket.  The IndieWeb doesn't need to "take off" to be valuable
  to those who participate in it.  Maintaining a personal website is
  about owning your digital presence, embracing creative freedom, and
  expressing your individuality!  It's not about appealing to the
  masses!
</p>
<p>
  I remember how, in the early 2000s, I used to spend my spare time
  learning HTML and writing my website, one HTML tag at a time.
  Writing a few lines of code in a text editor and then watching the
  browser render that code into a vibrant web page full of colours and
  images felt like an art form.  It was doubly fun to find other
  netizens who shared that same joy of maintaining and publishing
  their websites.  The IndieWeb is about preserving that hacker
  culture where websites are crafted and hosted not for mass appeal
  but for the sheer joy of creation and sharing with like-minded
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  The IndieWeb doesn't need to go mainstream to be meaningful.  It's a
  celebration of a more personal, decentralised, and creative world
  wide web.  For those of us who still care about these values, it is
  already meaningful.
