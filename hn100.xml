<p dir="auto">The described vulnerability affects multiple D-Link NAS devices, including models DNS-340L, DNS-320L, DNS-327L, and DNS-325, among others. The vulnerability lies within the <strong><code>nas_sharing.cgi</code></strong> uri, which is vulnerable due to two main issues: a backdoor facilitated by hardcoded credentials, and a command injection vulnerability via the <strong><code>system</code></strong> parameter. This exploitation could lead to arbitrary command execution on the affected D-Link NAS devices, granting attackers potential access to sensitive information, system configuration alteration, or denial of service, by specifying a command,affecting over 92,000 devices on the Internet.</p>

<p>"This is yet another important step forward for 3M as we continue to deliver on our priorities.

They've been linked to a variety of health problems, including liver and immune-system damage and some cancers.</p>

    
    

<p>The compounds have been detected at varying levels in drinking water nationwide. The Environmental Protection Agency in March 2023 proposed strict limits on two common types, PFOA and PFOS, and said it wanted to regulate four others. Water providers would be responsible for monitoring their systems for the chemicals.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/pfas-in-minnesota-how-forever-chemicals-changed-the-state-of-water/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">PFAS in Minnesota: How "forever chemicals" changed the state of water</a></span></strong></p><p><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-house-approves-environment-package-that-includes-ban-on-forever-chemicals-pfas/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">A new state law passed last year</a></span>&nbsp;will ban PFAS in some consumer products starting in 2025 with a full ban in 2032.

The payment will help cover the costs of filtering PFAS from systems.</p><p>Some of the settlement money will help additional water systems test for contamination from PFAS, said Scott Summy, one of the lead attorneys for those suing 3M and other manufacturers. They have until June 2026 to apply for compensation if contamination is found. </p><p>"That's great news for American citizens who drink from that water," Summy said.

<p><strong>It's not that easy.</strong></p>
<p>The most efficient method to calculate square root is to calculate inverse/reciprocal of the square root using Newton-Raphson iterations, and then multiply it with the original.</p>
<p>This is best known as the <a href="https://thatonegamedev.com/math/fast-square-root-quake-iii/" rel="noreferrer">"Quake method"</a> (see also <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/q/4615/79">Where did Fast InvSqrt() come from?</a>). The more modern version used by contemporary CPU and GPUs are generalized into two instructions, one for estimating the initial guess (e.g. <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2022-03/SIMD-FP-Instructions/FRSQRTE--Floating-point-Reciprocal-Square-Root-Estimate-?lang=en" rel="noreferrer">frsqrte of ARMv8</a>), another to run the following iterations (e.g. <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2022-03/SIMD-FP-Instructions/FRSQRTS--Floating-point-Reciprocal-Square-Root-Step-?lang=en" rel="noreferrer">frsqrts of ARMv8</a>). Single-instruction version of sqrt is a micro-coded or pseudo-instruction version of these two instructions.</p>
<p><strong>The prerequisite for all of this is a multiplier.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to calculate FP (i)sqrt, then you need a (fast) FP multiplier, which all FPUs have.</p>
<p>If you want to calculate integer (i)sqrt, then you need a (fast) integer multiplier, which most CPUs <strong>don't</strong> have (historically). Otherwise it would be called a <strong>DSP</strong>.</p>
<p>To make it better, you need a (fast) multiplier that is twice the width of your input to have sufficient precision, which most CPUs definitely don't have until "relatively" recently (relative to RetroComputing).</p>
<p><strong>And precision matters, or not?</strong></p>
<p>If you look at the "Quake method" closely, you notice that one of the iterations was commented out.</p>
<p>There are a lot of use cases where the extreme precision isn't necessary and it'll be better to leave the choice of precision/speed trade off to programmers. <code>isqrt</code> was intentionally separated into <code>fsqrte</code> and <code>fsqrts</code> on ARMv8 exactly for this reason: so that the programmer can adjust the number of <code>fsqrts</code> for the desired speed and accuracy tradeoff.</p>
<p>So I don't quite agree to the statement that single instruction sqrt is very common. It's there because the IEEEE754 and the C stand math library requires it (for the flag bits and exceptions), but that doesn't mean it's frequently used.</p>

<h2>
Epilog
</h2>
<p>
Back in 2013 we launched ElephantSQL as one of the first services out there to offer hosted PostgreSQL.
Since then we’ve assisted many customers building all kinds of applications on the platform.
</p>
<p>
In the spirit of keeping our company agile, we’ve made the strategic decision to focus on something else: the AMQP protocol via CloudAMQP.
We're noticing significant growth and interest in both RabbitMQ and LavinMQ (our high performance AMQP broker), where we continue as market leaders.
As such, we plan to invest more in these areas with the full attention from the company.
</p>
<p>
We want to express our gratitude to our customers and partners who have been with us throughout this time.
Though this chapter may be ending, our commitment to supporting you remains. We're here to help you
until you continue your PostgreSQL journey elsewhere.
</p>
<h2>
Service Shutdown Schedule
</h2>
<p>
Existing customers will have complete access to the service until its discontinuation on January 27, 2025.
After May 1, 2024, we will cease to accept new users. Comprehensive information regarding our shutdown
process is available under
<a href="https://www.elephantsql.com/eol.html">
End of Life - Customer Information
</a>
</p>
<h2>
Customer Information and Action Plan
</h2>
<p>
Our top priority is ensuring a smooth transition for our current customers.
For this reason, we have compiled all necessary information, including contact and
support details as well as migration options here.
</p>

<h2>
The next chapter for our team
</h2>
<p>
As we navigate through this transition, our team is not saying goodbye but rather stepping
into a new chapter. The expertise, dedication, and passion that powered ElephantSQL are now
joining forces with our colleagues at CloudAMQP and LavinMQ. This strategic shift allows us
to focus our collective efforts on advancing our service offerings in Message Queuing and
Message Streaming solutions.
</p>
<p>
For more details on our journey ahead and what this means for our team and services, we invite you to read our
announcement:

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) plays a central role in communications and signal processing — but does it reveal some deeper, unseen truth about the universe? For example, do square waves exist at all? After all, the transform turns them into </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/square-waves-or-non-elephant-biology" rel="">a series of odd-numbered sine harmonics</a><span> — and this model somehow predicts the behavior of electronic circuits in real life.</span></p><p>Today, I’d like to knock the Fourier transform off the pedestal. To be sure, sine waves are ubiquitous in nature and they are well-suited for a number of tasks as an analytical tool. That said, it’s eminently possible to construct other well-behaved frequency domains that play by different rules — including one where only square waves are real, and everything else is just harmonics. </p><p>To get started, let’s circle back to discrete cosine transform — a simplified, real-numbers-only version of DFT. From the earlier article, you might recall the following DCT-II formula:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(F_k = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} s_n \cdot cos ( \pi k { n + \frac12 \over N} )\)</span></p></div><p><span>The construct at the heart of this algorithm is the </span><em>cos()</em><span> expression that generates a sine wave with a frequency corresponding to the number of the current DCT bin (</span><em><span>F</span><sub>k</sub></em><span>). This is known as the </span><em>basis function</em><span>; we can abstract it away and rewrite the formula as:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(F_k = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} s_n \cdot B(k,n)\)</span></p></div><p><span>In this generalized notation for a frequency-domain transform, </span><em>B(k, n) </em><span>returns </span><em>some sort of a</em><span> </span><em>multiplier</em><span> based on the values of </span><em>k</em><span> and </span><em>n</em><span>.</span><em> </em><span>Software engineers might find it intuitive to think about </span><em>B(k, n)</em><span> as a lookup array.

Huh?</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>At a glance, the plot looks chaotic, but it’s simply a reordering of the Walsh matrix. For example, row #1 in the Walsh matrix ends up in row #8 above. But its main perk is that unlike the Walsh matrix, it’s pretty easy to construct.</p><p>To get the ball rolling, we start with the following trivial 1×1 array:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(H_0 = \begin{bmatrix}
+1
\end{bmatrix}\)</span></p></div><p><span>From there, we iteratively extend it by taking the array generated in the previous step (</span><em><span>H</span><sub>n-1</sub></em><span>) and tiling four copies of it on a grid with twice the original dimensions. The first three copies are verbatim, and the final one — bottom right — has all the signs flipped. The mathematical notation for this extension is:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(H_{n} = N_{n-1} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}
+1 &amp; +1 \\
+1 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}\)</span></p></div><p><span>The fancy operator (⊗) is known as the </span><em>Kronecker product</em><span>, but it really just glorified copy-and-paste. The first extension is:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(H_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
\begin{array}{c | c }
+1 &amp; +1 \\
\hline
+1 &amp; -1
\end{array}\end{bmatrix}
\)</span></p></div><p>Another iteration gives us:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(H_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
\begin{array}{c c | c c}
+1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 \\
+1 &amp; -1 &amp; +1 &amp; -1 \\
\hline
+1 &amp; +1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\
+1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; +1
\end{array}
\end{bmatrix}\)</span></p></div><p>…and so on.</p><p><span>On a computer, the matrix can be computed by following this tiling algorithm, but there’s a cute bitwise arithmetic trick we can employ instead: as it turns out, the value of the Hadamard function at a particular cell can be divined by calculating </span><em>x &amp; y</em><span> and then checking if the number of bits set in the result is even or odd. The following C code does just that, and then displays an 8×8 Hadamard matrix on the screen:</span></p><blockquote><pre><code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define HD_LEN 8

int8_t hadamard(uint32_t x, uint32_t y) {  
  return (__builtin_popcount(x &amp; y) % 2) ? -1 : 1;
}

int main() {
  for (uint32_t y = 0; y &lt; HD_LEN; y++) {
    for (uint32_t x = 0; x &lt; HD_LEN; x++) printf("%+d ", hadamard(x, y));
    putchar('\n');
  }
}</code></pre></blockquote><p>In principle, the Hadamard matrix is sufficient to construct a frequency-domain transform. That said, its ordering of the frequency bins is unintuitive, so we could use some help from that Walsh guy we mentioned before.</p><p>To turn the Hadamard matrix in the nicely-ordered flavor showcased earlier, we need to sort the rows based on their sequency. I’m not aware of an algorithm more elegant than counting the number of zero crossings, but in any case, this implementation is pretty fast — and prints a sorted 8×8 array on the screen:</p><blockquote><pre><code><code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#define HD_LEN 8

int8_t hadamard(uint32_t x, uint32_t y) {  
  return (__builtin_popcount(x &amp; y) % 2) ? -1 : 1;
}

int8_t walsh_array[HD_LEN][HD_LEN];

void precompute_walsh() {
  int8_t tmp[HD_LEN];

  for (uint32_t y = 0; y &lt; HD_LEN; y++) {
    uint32_t sign_cnt = 0;
    int8_t prev_val = 1;
    for (int x = 0; x &lt; HD_LEN; x++) {
      tmp[x] = hadamard(x, y);
      if (tmp[x] != prev_val) { sign_cnt++; prev_val = tmp[x]; }
    }
    memcpy(walsh_array[sign_cnt], tmp, HD_LEN);
  }
}

int main() {
  precompute_walsh();
  for (uint32_t y = 0; y &lt; HD_LEN; y++) {
    for (uint32_t  x = 0; x &lt; HD_LEN; x++) printf("%+d ", walsh_array[y][x]);
    putchar('\n');
  }
}</code></code></pre></blockquote><p>Equipped with this, we can gut the DCT implementation and make a “discrete square transform” and its inverse:</p><blockquote><pre><code>void sqft(double* out_buf, double* in_buf, uint32_t len) {

  for (uint32_t bin_no = 0; bin_no &lt; len; bin_no++) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (uint32_t s_no = 0; s_no &lt; len; s_no++)
      sum += in_buf[s_no] * walsh_array[s_no][bin_no];
    out_buf[bin_no] = sum;
  }

}

void isqft(double* out_buf, double* in_buf, uint32_t len) {

  for (int s_no = 0; s_no &lt; len; s_no++) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int bin_no = 0; bin_no &lt; len; bin_no++)
      sum += in_buf[bin_no] * walsh_array[bin_no][s_no];
    out_buf[s_no] = sum / len;
  }

}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>Technically, this is called the </span><em>Walsh–Hadamard transform</em><span>, but never mind. Let’s confirm that it works:</span></p><blockquote><pre><code>...previous code here...

void print_buf(const char* prefix, double* buf, uint32_t len) {
  printf("%s", prefix);
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) printf("%+.2f ", buf[i]);
  putchar('\n');
}

int main() {

  double in[HD_LEN] = { 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5 };
  double sq_freq[HD_LEN], out[HD_LEN];

  precompute_walsh();
  sqft(sq_freq, in, HD_LEN);
  isqft(out, sq_freq, HD_LEN);

  print_buf("Input : ", in, HD_LEN);
  print_buf("SQFT  : ", sq_freq, HD_LEN);
  print_buf("ISQFT : ", out, HD_LEN);

  return 0;
}</code></pre></blockquote><p>The input is a square-wave-ish sequence of numbers: 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5. The output from DFT or DCT would be a bunch of harmonics across multiple frequency bins:</p><blockquote><pre><code><code>DCT   : +24.00 -10.25 -0.00 +3.60 +0.00 -2.41 -0.00 +2.04</code></code></pre></blockquote><p><span>In contrast, the frequency-domain representation generated by the program shows non-zero components only in F</span><sub>0</sub><span> (DC) and F</span><sub>1</sub><span>, confirming that we have an algorithm that deconstructs the signal into pure square waves:</span></p><blockquote><pre><code><code>SQFT  : +24.00 -16.00 +0.00 +0.00 +0.00 +0.00 +0.00 +0.00</code></code></pre></blockquote><p><span>Finally, we can verify that the inverse function — </span><em>isqft() —</em><span> transforms the frequency domain back to what we started with:</span></p><blockquote><pre><code>ISQFT : +1.00 +1.00 +1.00 +1.00 +5.00 +5.00 +5.00 +5.00</code></pre></blockquote><p>The Walsh-Hadamard transform, being computationally efficient and well-suited for certain types of data, finds uses here and there. The point isn’t that it needs to be used more; it’s just that discrete Fourier doesn’t have a monopoly on truth.</p><p><em><span>For more articles on electronics, click </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/offsite.shtml" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Discussions of housing policy often focus on issues of zoning, regulation, and other supply restrictions which manifest as increased land prices, but for most American housing, the largest cost comes from building the physical structure itself. However, in dense urban areas — the places where building new housing is arguably most important — this changes, and high land prices driven by regulatory restrictions become the dominant factor.&nbsp;</p><p>People concerned about building more housing are right to pay attention to zoning and land use rules: over 100 million Americans live in places where most of the cost of residential property comes from the land itself. But they should not neglect the physical costs of building homes, which are overall more important. Unfortunately, as we’ll see, reducing these physical costs is far from straightforward.</p><p><span>We’ll look at housing costs chiefly through the lens of single-family homes, for a few reasons. </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/every-building-in-america-an-analysis" rel="">Most housing in the US consists of single-family homes</a><span>, so the costs of building them largely map to US housing costs generally. There’s also a large amount of data available on single-family home construction that doesn’t exist (or is much less accessible) for other types of housing. And most multi-family apartment buildings in the US will be built using the same basic technology, light-framed wood, used to build single-family homes, so much of what we learn about single-family costs, particularly on the construction side, will apply to multi-family apartments as well.</span></p><p><span>We can start by looking at the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) </span><a href="https://www.nahb.org/-/media/NAHB/news-and-economics/docs/housing-economics-plus/special-studies/2023/special-study-cost-of-constructing-a-home-2022-february-2023.pdf" rel="">construction cost survey</a><span>. This survey is periodically sent out by the NAHB to several thousand home builders. It divides home building into several dozen separate activities (framing, plumbing fixtures, drywall, etc.) and asks home builders about their typical costs for each task. Note that while the survey is based on the average costs of thousands of different home builders, it does not represent the costs of an average home. Because every home builder gets equal weight in the survey, it overweighs the costs from boutique, luxury home builders (who might build just a few homes a year) and underweighs larger volume economy builders (who might build hundreds or thousands of homes a year). The “average” home cost given by the survey is almost $100,000 higher than the average home cost indicated by the Census. But while absolute costs won’t necessarily be representative, I expect the relative proportions devoted to each task to vary less between the low and high ends of the market (and we’ll do a bit of checking to be sure this is the case).</span></p><p>We can divide the costs of a new home into roughly three buckets: “hard costs” (physically constructing the home), “soft costs” (design, administration, marketing, and other non-physical construction costs), and the costs of land. Per the NAHB, on average hard costs are about 56% of the total costs, soft costs (including builder profits) are about 25%, and land costs are about 18%.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png" width="574" height="123" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:123,&quot;width&quot;:574,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40511f-bc60-45a7-b29e-95277d87b88f_574x123.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via NAHB</figcaption></figure></div><p>Let’s take a deeper look at each one of these items.</p><p><span>Hard costs are inherent to constructing the building itself: digging and pouring the foundations, building the framing, installing the HVAC system, and so on.

And neither is subcontracting the work out to many separate trades. Ford uses more than 1,400 Tier 1 suppliers to supply parts and components. What is different about construction is the level of coordination that takes place: whereas in a car everything is carefully designed to tightly integrate together, in housing construction the work can be done (and often is) with surprisingly little coordination between the various trades. Even something as seemingly basic as getting subcontractors together at the beginning of the design process to come up with a coordinated design is a </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/book-review-building-an-affordable" rel="">very unusual practice in home construction</a><span>. This style of work organization reduces upfront cost required, and allows homes to be built with an unusually inexpensive design process compared to other products, but it also means that </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innovate-in-construction" rel="">innovation is risky</a><span>, and new products </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-construction-innovation-uptake" rel="">tend to be evolutionary</a><span> ones that don’t change the overall construction process.</span></p><p>But this doesn’t mean that innovation doesn’t take place. For each of these tasks there is constant industry effort to try and improve them. In some cases, those efforts are successful, as with PEX piping replacing copper piping. In other cases, industry hasn’t made great strides. Framing technology, for instance, has changed comparatively little, despite many attempts to develop alternative framing systems.</p><p><span>Something else that stands out is the relatively large fraction of tasks that have an aesthetic component. Interior and exterior finishes combined — trim, drywall, exterior finishes, and so on — make up more than a third of the hard costs of a new home. These costs can also be difficult to reduce, because people’s preferences about how various parts of the house look or feel can be surprisingly strong, and constrain the use of new systems. Luxury vinyl tile or synthetic stone bathroom panels are probably superior to hardwood floors and ceramic tile from the perspective of functionality, but people’s preferences for more “natural” materials are hard to displace. Similarly, the flimsiness and visible joints of </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/comparing-process-improvement-in" rel="">inexpensive drywall substitutes</a><span> like vinyl on gypsum makes it hard to replace drywall outside of the low end of the market.</span></p><p>We can further break down the hard costs of construction by separating tasks into the cost of materials and the cost of labor.

This is yet another thing that makes reducing construction costs difficult. A large fraction of hard costs are due to the cost of materials, and there’s no obvious path for making these cheaper.

An electrician that costs $78 per hour to hire in Houston might cost almost $170 to hire in New York City.

Because of this, people are often optimistic about technologies like prefabrication that allow for faster construction, and the potential money such rapid construction would save.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But per the NAHB survey, construction financing cost, one of the main avenues of potential savings from accelerated construction, is fairly low, just 1.9% of the total cost of a new home.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-143167718" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-makes-housing-so-expensive#footnote-4-143167718" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> Depending on the technology chosen, speeding up construction might have surprisingly little impact on this. Prefabrication, for instance, can reduce on-site construction time, but using prefabrication often requires the fabricator to begin work months beforehand. If you need to make a downpayment to the fabricator before they start work, you might not have reduced your financing costs at all, merely shifted when they take place.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, soft costs like design work, permits, and inspections are fairly small proportions of overall costs. (</span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/on-klein-on-construction" rel="">We also found</a><span> fairly small costs associated with things like OSHA regulations.) Builders profit is somewhat high (above 10% of the costs of a new home according to the NAHB), but this is probably in part skewed by the sample, which overweights smaller, luxury builders. The National Construction Estimator (whose estimates are roughly in line with Census cost data, and thus probably a good average) suggests a much more modest 5% builders profit. Sales commission is also on the higher side, though this may be on the cusp of being reduced. While real estate startups like Zillow, Redfin and Trulia have not managed to dislodge realtors from the homebuying process, a recent court ruling is expected to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/15/economy/nar-realtor-commissions-settlement/index.html#:~:text=In%20a%20sweeping%20move%20expected,and%20eliminating%20rules%20on%20commissions." rel="">greatly reduce realtor fees</a><span>.</span></p><p>As with hard costs, so with soft costs: No one dominant item, and few obvious paths for cost reduction.</p><p>The third major cost of building a new house is the cost of the land itself. Given how prominent regulatory restrictions on housing are in online discourse (zoning, NIMBY vs YIMBY, and so on), I think many people would be surprised that land only makes up around 20% of the cost of a new home. But we can confirm this with Census data, which shows that over the last 30 years, the fraction of the price of a new single-family home that’s due to the cost of land has remained remarkably steady, generally hovering between 20 and 25% of the total cost. (“20% of your costs should be for the property itself” is also a common rule of thumb among homebuilders.) Partly this is due to selection effects: we’ll tend to see houses built where land is more easily built on, and in those places land will be cheaper. If it was harder to build on it, the land would be more expensive. Nevertheless, for most new housing built in the US, land is not the major cost determinant.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png" width="653" height="438" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:438,&quot;width&quot;:653,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc16ad424-e7ef-4d90-b2d2-07366c322b1e_653x438.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Census</figcaption></figure></div><p>This, of course, is for new homes. For existing homes, we can expect the land to be a larger fraction of the total cost of a home, if for no other reason than because the value of the physical home itself will depreciate as it ages. What do we know about the land fractions of existing homes?</p><p><span>At a high level, we can estimate the fraction of housing cost associated with land by using the Federal Reserve’s </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/" rel="">household balance sheet report</a><span>. Per the Fed, the total value of all real estate held by households is $44.8 trillion, while the replacement cost of the structures themselves (which will include both hard and soft costs) is $27.2 trillion. This gives $17.6 trillion dollars as the value of householder land, or almost 40% of the price of all homes nationally. Though this seems high, it actually seems to be roughly the average value for the </span><a href="https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/land-sales-rose-2-in-2019-with-steady-growth-in-2020-according-to-rli-nar-survey" rel="">past 30 years</a><span> (though historically land fractions were much lower).</span></p><p><span>We can try to calculate this another way by using American Housing Survey data. Per the 2021 AHS, the average size of a US detached single family home was about 2,200 square feet, which at then-current median construction costs would cost $293,000 to replace. Using 1.1% annual depreciation (roughly the depreciation rate </span><a href="https://apps.bea.gov/national/pdf/BEA_depreciation_rates.pdf" rel="">used by the BEA</a><span> for single family homes), and a median home age of 40 years, this gets us a median replacement value of around $188,000 for US homes. Per the Census, the median homeowner during that period </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/HSG495222#HSG495222" rel="">valued their home around $282,000</a><span>. Taking into account that homeowners systematically overvalue their homes by around 7%, this gives a median home value of around $262,000.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-143167718" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-makes-housing-so-expensive#footnote-5-143167718" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> This means that for the median US home, 72% of the value is from the structure itself, leaving 28% for the land. This is less than the Federal Reserve estimate of an average 40% land fraction nationally, but still higher than the roughly 20% value from new construction. So while for new housing, land is about 20-25% of the cost of a home, for existing housing this is closer to 30-40%.</span></p><p><span>But this is a national average. Land fractions will be higher, often much higher, in dense urban areas. </span><a href="https://www.aei.org/housing/land-price-indicators/" rel="">This site</a><span> from AEI gives zip code level estimates for the fraction of home prices due to land for the 100 largest metro areas in the US.

It’s the “permission slip” that makes up the majority of the value of most residential land parcels:&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…when Ed Glaeser calculated [the hedonic value of land] for 21 metro areas in early 2000 (by analyzing home price sales and estimating how much a larger lot added to the home’s value), he found that in 16 of them, the hedonic value was less than (inflation adjusted) $1.50 per square foot, or less than $12,000 dollars for the median lot size of ~8,000 square feet…By comparison, the median new home in 2020 sold for around $330,000.</em></p><p><em>A similar study of single family homes in Boston found that the hedonic value of land for the average lot was just $11,200, compared to an average house cost of $450,000.</em></p><p><em>The permission slip, by contrast, is often incredibly valuable, especially if the permitting body limits how many of them it gives out. For instance, in the previous study Glaeser calculated the hedonic value of land for single family homes in San Francisco at $4.10 per square foot (the highest out of any metro examined), or about $10,000 for the average lot size at that time. The ‘zoning tax’ portion, by contrast (the portion of the cost due to various building and supply restrictions), was priced at around $220,000 - in other words, over 95% of the land’s value (and over half the price of the house), was due from being allowed to build on it.</em></p><p><em>Similarly, multifamily developers have told me that they will generally value land in terms of how many housing units they’re allowed to build on it. Increase the number of housing units you’re allowed to build (say, by getting it rezoned), and you greatly increase the value of the land. This is a lever developers have to work with when putting together a development deal - they might decide to take a risk and buy a cheaper piece of land that’s zoned for a relatively small number of units, in the hopes of getting permission to build more on it than is currently allowed.</em><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-143167718" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-makes-housing-so-expensive#footnote-6-143167718" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p></blockquote><p>So while the price of a lot is not a particularly large fraction of the cost of new housing, it's a much larger proportion of the cost of existing housing. And in dense metro areas (the places that need housing the most), it can be even higher, exceeding 70% of the cost of a home. This high cost of land, in turn, isn’t because people value having lots of space for their kids to play on — it's because of regulatory and zoning restrictions that limit how much housing can be built on a given parcel or in a given place.</p><p>The cost of housing comes from a variety of sources. In most cases, for both new construction and existing housing, the largest line item is the cost of constructing the home itself. For new construction this is on average 80% of the cost of a home (including hard and soft costs), while for existing construction it's still in the neighborhood of 60-70%.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s only in dense urban areas that the cost of land begins to dominate the cost of new housing, driven by regulatory and zoning restrictions that limit how much housing can be built in a given area. Another way of looking at it is that in the areas that we need housing the most, zoning and regulatory factors are responsible for the lion’s share of housing costs.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/lago-a-paris-based-open-source-billing-platform-banks-22m/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/lago-a-paris-based-open-source-billing-platform-banks-22m/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39957607">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">A startup out of Paris that began life building marketing tools has raised $22 million after making a successful pivot into billing — a space it discovered was even more broken among potential customers. <a href="https://www.getlago.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lago</a>, developer of an open source billing platform, has picked up the funding across two rounds of funding it’s revealing to coincide with its official launch.</p>
<p>It’s launching today, but it has been in business in closed beta for some time, during which it’s picked up a number of notable startups such as Mistral.ai, Together.ai and Juni as early customers. The company’s focus on open source is very intentional, said CEO Anh-Tho Chuong: It’s targeting developers who are looking for solutions to tailor their billing to fit whatever cutting-edge, creative new services they are cooking up, a gap in the market that Lago believes is not being addressed well enough by incumbents, and which Lago is betting might best be addressed through an open source approach.</p>
<p>“We’re a partner to developers,” she said in an interview. “We honor [their] abstraction, and we use data to meter usage, to help companies handle subscriptions [or other] pricing plans in an easy way.”</p>
<p>A strong list of investors have taken note: The latest Series A of $15 million was led by FirstMark; the previous seed of $7 million was led by SignalFire, Chuong said. Other backers include Y Combinator, New Wave, and Script, as well as a number of individuals whose participation underscores the segment of the market Lago is targeting. They include MongoDB monetization head Meghan Gill; Romain Huet (previously of Stripe, now in developer relations at OpenAI); and Hugging Face CEO Clément Delangue.</p>
<p>We understand from sources that its valuation is now around $100 million.</p>
<p>The Lago doing business today as a billing platform got its start in a very classical startup way: It had no idea that it would be a billing platform.</p>
<p>Chuong and her co-founder Raffi Sarkissian were both working at business banking startup Qonto when they decided to strike out on their own and build a new startup. They applied to Y Combinator and got into the Summer 2021 cohort on the strength of their backgrounds. “But we went to YC without a product,” she said.</p>
<p>They settled while there on marketing, specifically around the idea of building a “Zapier for marketing teams.”</p>
<p>“We honestly thought this was going to be a big one,” she recalled. “It was okay.” Okay was just not going to cut it though. Marketing tech is very crowded, the company was picking up almost no traction for its product.</p>
<p>In a moment of trying to growth hack their way into an audience, Sarkissian decided to write a post for Hacker News in which he lamented the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31424450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems with billing for developers</a>.</p>
<p>It had a catchy title: “Billing systems are a nightmare for engineers,” and it was written with the kind of freedom you might only be able to capture as a creator when you are really writing from the heart. That was because it was something he and Chuong knew well, since their time at Qonto was spent building a product to address that very issue.</p>
<p>Chuong said this was really not the point. The impetus for posting on this was to pick something they knew well so that they could monitor engagement and possibly use that to pivot attention to Lago, the “Zapier for marketing teams.”</p>
<p>But the post struck a nerve, and to their surprise a lot of people began to speak up about their own billing issues. Lago had its “a-ha” moment: If what they really wanted to do was build something to solve a problem for developers, here was a problem they actually could solve, and they knew they could do it well. Cue the pivot to billing and the startup taking off.</p>
<p>Taking off not just with users, but also investors.</p>
<p>“We first spotted Lago via HackerNews in early 2023: They had so much traction, for a seemingly solved or trivial topic, that it seemed obvious people had been waiting for an open source solution like theirs. We then reached out to their stargazers on GitHub and the feedback was nothing but stellar,” said Oana Olteanu, a partner at SignalFire, in a statement.</p>
<p>If you think marketing is a competitive market, billing is more crowded than Billingsgate Fish Market on a Friday morning. Larger tech companies like Stripe, Adyen, Salesforce, Zoho, Paddle and many more offer billing solutions. There are even a number of providers already pursuing an open source approach, including FOSSBilling, ChargeBee, Kill Bill, AppDirect’s jBilling and the imaginatively named “Open Source Billing.” (Why beat around the bush?)</p>
<p>Chuong believes that there is still very much an opportunity, however, for a focus on extensibility and tailored solutions for startups trying to push the boundaries in their own competitive spaces.</p>
<p>The AI sector is a strong example of that, in her view. Companies building AI-based products are still working out what the viable business models will be, and in the meantime we are seeing a lot of examples of companies considering hybrid approaches, mixing elements of flat-rate subscriptions with consumption-based pricing. All of this is tricky to manage and relies on tools that can integrate with whatever developers are building, with the ability to discern and apply their usage data.</p>
<p>“If you have very simple pricing and billing, there are a lot of those solutions around for that, but for complex billing, there has been no solution,” she said. That leads to many companies (as Qonto did) building their own solutions. “But engineers hate it. And it’s very expensive to hire engineers for that, obviously. So it’s still an unsolved problem.” In Lago’s view, offering open source tools is that best solution to meet a variety of needs and ideas.</p>
<p>For some of those users, the open source ethos also lines up with what they are hoping to espouse themselves as businesses.</p>
<p>“We chose Lago as our billing provider because we believe in the open-source ecosystem,” Timothée Lacroix, co-founder and CTO at Mistral.ai, said in a statement. “They have been able to follow the pace of our releases and have allowed us to focus on what we do best.” Yes, some will argue that open source might be getting stretched a lot as a concept right now, and may well be exactly the opposite of what many so-called open source companies are building.</p>
<p>The company’s aim is to continue building out its existing business but also to start considering what more it might add next. One obvious area is to dip back into Lago’s original thoughts about marketing, and to provide more data analytics to customers about what people are consuming and paying for, and the patterns of their payments. Another is to explore the other side of the billing coin: payments.</p>
<p>Lago is unlikely to build a payments stack; however, she added: The focus is almost certainly going to be on payments orchestration, giving users control over what they use but make sure that it integrates well with their billing platform (one that is, ideally, going to be covered by Lago of course).</p>

<h2><span>1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<p> Given the title of this paper, it is incumbent on the authors to assure the reader that we do not claim to have done the impossible. A viscous fluid is, after all, a non-Hamiltonian system (Millikan <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Millikan</span>1929</a>; Finlayson <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Finlayson</span>1972<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Finlayson</span><em>b</em></a>). There is no action integral for which Hamilton's principle (Hamilton <a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1833</a>, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1834</a>, <a href="#ref50"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1835</a>) yields the Navier–Stokes equations (Stokes <a href="#ref98"><span>Reference Stokes</span>1845</a>; Anderson, Tannehill &amp; Pletcher <a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Anderson, Tannehill and Pletcher</span>1984</a>; Anderson <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Anderson</span>1995</a>; Batchelor <a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Batchelor</span>2000</a>; White <a href="#ref116"><span>Reference White</span>2006</a>; Pozrikidis <a href="#ref81"><span>Reference Pozrikidis</span>2009</a>; Cengel &amp; Cimbala <a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Cengel and Cimbala</span>2018</a>) in their usual form (Millikan <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Millikan</span>1929</a>; Finlayson <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Finlayson</span>1972<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Finlayson</span><em>b</em></a>), and we do not claim otherwise. Remarkably, however, a Hamiltonian formulation can still be found by considering a mathematically equivalent higher-order problem, as we will now demonstrate via simple example.</p>

<p> In summary, by doubling the order of the governing equation and supplying additional auxiliary conditions, we made a non-Hamiltonian problem into a Hamiltonian one (Sanders <a href="#ref88"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2021</a>, <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2022</a>, <a href="#ref90"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2023<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref91"><span>Reference Sanders</span><em>b</em></a>; Sanders &amp; Inman <a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Sanders and Inman</span>2023</a>). Furthermore, this simple example demonstrates that the method correctly gives the solution to the original, non-Hamiltonian problem. Indeed, it would appear that every non-Hamiltonian problem belongs to an equivalence class of problems with the same solution, and within each such equivalence class there are Hamiltonian variants. The remainder of this paper applies that concept to the isotropic Navier–Stokes problem (Stokes <a href="#ref98"><span>Reference Stokes</span>1845</a>; Anderson <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Anderson, Tannehill and Pletcher</span>1984</a>; Anderson <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Anderson</span>1995</a>; Batchelor <a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Batchelor</span>2000</a>; White <a href="#ref116"><span>Reference White</span>2006</a>; Pozrikidis <a href="#ref81"><span>Reference Pozrikidis</span>2009</a>; Cengel &amp; Cimbala <a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Cengel and Cimbala</span>2018</a>).</p>

<h2><span>2.</span> Literature review</h2>
<p> The field of analytical mechanics, with foundations planted in Hamilton's principle of stationary action (Hamilton <a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1833</a>, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1834</a>, <a href="#ref50"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1835</a>) or d'Alembert's principle of virtual work (d'Alembert <a href="#ref25"><span>Reference d'Alembert</span>1743</a>), has been vital to the development of both classical and quantum physics since the eighteenth century. This approach is versatile and helpful to the physical understanding of the problem in question, and the foundation, structure and utility of Hamiltonian formalism is well documented (Becker <a href="#ref9"><span>Reference Becker</span>1954</a>; Taylor <a href="#ref106"><span>Reference Taylor</span>2005</a>; Hamill <a href="#ref47"><span>Reference Hamill</span>2014</a>; Bohn <a href="#ref20"><span>Reference Bohn</span>2018</a>; Cline <a href="#ref24"><span>Reference Cline</span>2023</a>; Fowler <a href="#ref35"><span>Reference Fowler</span>2023</a>). The supporting mathematics of the calculus of variations as well as symplectic and differential geometry can also be found in many excellent sources (Arnold <a href="#ref4"><span>Reference Arnold</span>1989</a>; Berndt <a href="#ref16"><span>Reference Berndt</span>2001</a>; Hall <a href="#ref46"><span>Reference Hall</span>2003</a>; Boas <a href="#ref19"><span>Reference Boas</span>2006</a>; Stone &amp; Goldbart <a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Stone and Goldbart</span>2009</a>; Gelfand &amp; Fomin <a href="#ref42"><span>Reference Gelfand and Fomin</span>2012</a>; Arfken <a href="#ref3"><span>Reference Arfken</span>2013</a>; Needham <a href="#ref77"><span>Reference Needham</span>2021</a>). It is therefore no surprise that researchers have been applying analytical formalism to classical fluids dating back to the time of Lagrange (Lagrange <a href="#ref62"><span>Reference Lagrange</span>1811</a>; Lichtenstein <a href="#ref67"><span>Reference Lichtenstein</span>1929</a>; Morrison <a href="#ref73"><span>Reference Morrison</span>1998</a>, <a href="#ref74"><span>Reference Morrison</span>2006</a>; Berdichevsky <a href="#ref14"><span>Reference Berdichevsky</span>2009<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Berdichevsky</span><em>b</em></a>; dell'Isola &amp; Gavrilyuk <a href="#ref27"><span>Reference dell'Isola and Gavrilyuk</span>2011</a>; Badin &amp; Crisciani <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Badin and Crisciani</span>2018</a>; Bedford <a href="#ref10"><span>Reference Bedford</span>2021</a>).</p>
<p> The task of obtaining solutions to the governing equations of fluid flow represents one of the most challenging problems in science and engineering. In most cases, the mathematical formulation is expressed as an initial-boundary-value problem: a set of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations, which are to be solved subject to various initial and boundary conditions. The degree of complication of the governing equations depends on the type of the fluid. For a viscous fluid where the transport phenomena of friction and thermal conduction are included, the governing equations are called the Navier–Stokes equations (Stokes <a href="#ref98"><span>Reference Stokes</span>1845</a>; Anderson <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Anderson, Tannehill and Pletcher</span>1984</a>; Anderson <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Anderson</span>1995</a>; Batchelor <a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Batchelor</span>2000</a>; White <a href="#ref116"><span>Reference White</span>2006</a>; Pozrikidis <a href="#ref81"><span>Reference Pozrikidis</span>2009</a>; Cengel &amp; Cimbala <a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Cengel and Cimbala</span>2018</a>). The Navier–Stokes equations are derived by applying fundamental physical principles – conservation of mass, conservation of momentum and conservation of energy – to a viscous fluid, and the derivation can be found in any fluid mechanics textbook (Anderson <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Anderson, Tannehill and Pletcher</span>1984</a>; Anderson <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Anderson</span>1995</a>; Batchelor <a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Batchelor</span>2000</a>; White <a href="#ref116"><span>Reference White</span>2006</a>; Pozrikidis <a href="#ref81"><span>Reference Pozrikidis</span>2009</a>; Cengel &amp; Cimbala <a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Cengel and Cimbala</span>2018</a>). It is important to recognize that the Navier–Stokes equations as they are known today were not developed solely by Navier and Stokes; indeed, Poisson, Cauchy and others were also heavily involved in their development (Darrigol <a href="#ref26"><span>Reference Darrigol</span>2002</a>). As far as the present authors are aware, to date there is still no firm answer to the question of whether or not there always exist unique, smooth, non-singular solutions to the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations (Lemarie-Rieusset <a href="#ref65"><span>Reference Lemarie-Rieusset</span>2018</a>), and this constitutes one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.</p>
<p> The application of analytical mechanics (Goldstein <a href="#ref44"><span>Reference Goldstein</span>1980</a>; Arnold <a href="#ref4"><span>Reference Arnold</span>1989</a>; Fetter &amp; Walecka <a href="#ref31"><span>Reference Fetter and Walecka</span>2003</a>; Gelfand &amp; Fomin <a href="#ref42"><span>Reference Gelfand and Fomin</span>2012</a>) to the field of fluid mechanics (Lanczos <a href="#ref63"><span>Reference Lanczos</span>1970</a>) has recently seen a resurgence in interest (Salmon <a href="#ref86"><span>Reference Salmon</span>1983</a>, <a href="#ref87"><span>Reference Salmon</span>1988</a>; Brenier <a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Brenier</span>2017</a>; Giga, Kirshtein &amp; Liu <a href="#ref43"><span>Reference Giga, Kirshtein and Liu</span>2018</a>; Mottaghi, Gabbai &amp; Benaroya <a href="#ref76"><span>Reference Mottaghi, Gabbai and Benaroya</span>2019</a>; Taroco, Blanco &amp; Feijoo <a href="#ref104"><span>Reference Taroco, Blanco and Feijoo</span>2020</a>; Bedford <a href="#ref10"><span>Reference Bedford</span>2021</a>; Mavroeidis &amp; Athanassoulis <a href="#ref70"><span>Reference Mavroeidis and Athanassoulis</span>2022</a>) after a long history. In the absence of non-conservative forces, an inviscid fluid is a Hamiltonian system, and so the classical Hamiltonian theory applies. Serrin (<a href="#ref95"><span>Reference Serrin</span>1959</a>), Benjamin (<a href="#ref12"><span>Reference Benjamin</span>1984</a>) and Holm, Marsden &amp; Ratiu (<a href="#ref53"><span>Reference Holm, Marsden and Ratiu</span>1986</a>) have all described variational and Hamiltonian formulations of incompressible, inviscid fluid flow. Roberts (<a href="#ref84"><span>Reference Roberts</span>1972</a>) presented a Hamiltonian dynamic for weakly interacting vortices. This research obtained the canonical equations of Hamiltonian dynamics for a set of two well-separated vortex rings by setting up a Hamiltonian to define the set. Olver (<a href="#ref78"><span>Reference Olver</span>1982</a>) showed that the Euler equations of inviscid and incompressible fluid flow can be put into Hamiltonian form. Benjamin &amp; Olver (<a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Benjamin and Olver</span>1982</a>) investigated the Hamiltonian structure of the water waves problem. They examined the symmetry groups of this problem, finding that Hamiltonian analysis enables the solution of conservative elements of the problem. However, the study also acknowledged that further study is needed to identify the physical significance of the mathematical results. Maddocks &amp; Pego (<a href="#ref68"><span>Reference Maddocks and Pego</span>1995</a>) presented a novel Hamiltonian formulation of ideal fluid flow expressed in material coordinates. Their Hamiltonian formulation arises from a general approach for constrained systems that is not restricted to problems in fluid mechanics. Rather, it is widely applicable for obtaining unconstrained Hamiltonian dynamical systems from Lagrangian field equations that are subject to pointwise constraints. More recently, Arnold (<a href="#ref5"><span>Reference Arnold</span>2014</a>) also studied the Hamiltonian nature of the ideal Euler equations.</p>
<p> Viscous forces are non-conservative, which presents a fundamental challenge when applying Hamilton's principle to viscous fluids (Millikan <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Millikan</span>1929</a>; Finlayson <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Finlayson</span>1972<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Finlayson</span><em>b</em></a>; Lemarie-Rieusset <a href="#ref65"><span>Reference Lemarie-Rieusset</span>2018</a>). Indeed, it is a well-known theorem (first proven by Millikan <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Millikan</span>1929</a>) that the Navier–Stokes equations in their usual form cannot be derived from a classical action principle (Millikan <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Millikan</span>1929</a>; Finlayson <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Finlayson</span>1972<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Finlayson</span><em>b</em></a>).

More generally, it has been shown that the existence of variational formulations is related to self-adjointness of the system with respect to a standard duality relation, a property that all non-conservative systems lack (Vainberg <a href="#ref112"><span>Reference Vainberg</span>1964</a>). Within the last 80 years, many alternative methods have been developed in an attempt to circumvent the non-self-adjointness of dissipative systems (Prigogine &amp; Glansdorff <a href="#ref82"><span>Reference Prigogine and Glansdorff</span>1965</a>; Biot <a href="#ref18"><span>Reference Biot</span>1970</a>; Finlayson <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Finlayson</span>1972<em>a</em></a>; Lebon &amp; Lambermont <a href="#ref64"><span>Reference Lebon and Lambermont</span>1973</a>; Tonti <a href="#ref110"><span>Reference Tonti</span>1973</a>; Magri <a href="#ref69"><span>Reference Magri</span>1974</a>; Telega <a href="#ref107"><span>Reference Telega</span>1979</a>; Tonti <a href="#ref111"><span>Reference Tonti</span>1984</a>; Filippov <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference Filippov</span>1989</a>; Sieniutycz <a href="#ref96"><span>Reference Sieniutycz</span>2000</a>; Robinson <a href="#ref85"><span>Reference Robinson</span>2001</a>; Galley <a href="#ref37"><span>Reference Galley</span>2013</a>; Kim, Dargush &amp; Lee <a href="#ref60"><span>Reference Kim, Dargush and Lee</span>2016</a>; Mottaghi <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref76"><span>Reference Mottaghi, Gabbai and Benaroya</span>2019</a>; Taroco <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref104"><span>Reference Taroco, Blanco and Feijoo</span>2020</a>; Bersani &amp; Caressa <a href="#ref17"><span>Reference Bersani and Caressa</span>2021</a>; Junker &amp; Balzani <a href="#ref58"><span>Reference Junker and Balzani</span>2021</a>). The mathematical study of alternative variational methods as applied to the Navier–Stokes equations in particular remains an ongoing endeavour (Oseledets <a href="#ref79"><span>Reference Oseledets</span>1989</a>; Vujanovic &amp; Jones <a href="#ref115"><span>Reference Vujanovic and Jones</span>1989</a>; Doering &amp; Gibbon <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Doering and Gibbon</span>1995</a>; Fukagawa &amp; Fujitani <a href="#ref36"><span>Reference Fukagawa and Fujitani</span>2012</a>; Jones <a href="#ref56"><span>Reference Jones</span>2015</a>; Gay-Balmaz &amp; Yoshimura <a href="#ref39"><span>Reference Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura</span>2017</a>; Hieber, Robinson &amp; Shibata <a href="#ref51"><span>Reference Hieber, Robinson and Shibata</span>2017</a>; Hochgerner <a href="#ref52"><span>Reference Hochgerner</span>2018</a>; Gay-Balmaz &amp; Yoshimura <a href="#ref40"><span>Reference Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura</span>2019<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref41"><span>Reference Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura</span><em>b</em></a>; Rashad <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref83"><span>Reference Rashad, Califano, Brugnoli, Schuller and Stramigioli</span>2021</a>; Gonzalez &amp; Taha <a href="#ref45"><span>Reference Gonzalez and Taha</span>2022</a>; Taha &amp; Gonzalez <a href="#ref102"><span>Reference Taha and Gonzalez</span>2022</a>; Sanders <a href="#ref91"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2023<em>b</em></a>).</p>
<p> Oseledets (<a href="#ref79"><span>Reference Oseledets</span>1989</a>) attempted to express the Navier–Stokes equations using Hamiltonian formalism. He was able to formalize the incompressible Euler equation but stated that his result is not valid for a compressible fluid. More recent attempts, such as Fukagawa &amp; Fujitani (<a href="#ref36"><span>Reference Fukagawa and Fujitani</span>2012</a>), Jones (<a href="#ref56"><span>Reference Jones</span>2015</a>) and Gay-Balmaz &amp; Yoshimura (<a href="#ref39"><span>Reference Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura</span>2017</a>, <a href="#ref40"><span>Reference Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura</span>2019<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref41"><span>Reference Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura</span><em>b</em></a>), have enforced dissipation using a non-holonomic constraint on the entropy. Hochgerner (<a href="#ref52"><span>Reference Hochgerner</span>2018</a>) attempted to obtain a Hamiltonian interacting particle system that could accurately model the fluid dynamics. His research separated the dynamics into slow (deterministic) and fast (stochastic) components to capture fine-scale effects. The study was able to derive the Navier–Stokes equation from a stochastic Hamiltonian system but ignored the stress tensor, was unable to separate configuration and momentum variables and did not establish energy conservation or dissipation.</p>
<p> Rashad <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> (<a href="#ref83"><span>Reference Rashad, Califano, Brugnoli, Schuller and Stramigioli</span>2021</a>) modelled the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in so-called ‘port-Hamiltonian’ framework rather than the standard Hamiltonian framework. Their model used vector calculus instead of exterior calculus to minimize the number of operators. While the main goal of this research was increasing the interest of computational researchers in using vector calculus, they also demonstrated that vector calculus can help in the formulation of individual subsystems of Navier–Stokes equations and boundary ports of the model.</p>
<p> Gonzalez &amp; Taha (<a href="#ref45"><span>Reference Gonzalez and Taha</span>2022</a>), Taha &amp; Gonzalez (<a href="#ref102"><span>Reference Taha and Gonzalez</span>2022</a>) and Taha, Gonzalez &amp; Shorbagy (<a href="#ref103"><span>Reference Taha, Gonzalez and Shorbagy</span>2023</a>) have recently applied Gauss's principle of least constraint (Gauss <a href="#ref38"><span>Reference Gauss</span>1829</a>) to the Navier–Stokes problem. Using Gauss's principle, Taha <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> (<a href="#ref103"><span>Reference Taha, Gonzalez and Shorbagy</span>2023</a>) have shown that, for an incompressible fluid, the magnitude of the pressure gradient is minimum over the domain, which they term the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). When applied to an inviscid fluid in two dimensions, the PMPG provides a closure condition based in first principles that could be considered a generalization of the Kutta condition to smooth geometries. It should be noted that Gauss's principle (Gauss <a href="#ref38"><span>Reference Gauss</span>1829</a>) is fundamentally different from Hamilton's principle (Hamilton <a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1833</a>, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1834</a>, <a href="#ref50"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1835</a>). Whereas the Hamiltonian framework involves an invariant action integral and employs variations in the coordinates (or, in continuum mechanics, the field quantities), Gauss's principle employs variations in the accelerations. As a result, the framework of Gauss's principle does not lead to canonical transformations.</p>
<p> Particularly relevant to the present work, Sanders (<a href="#ref88"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2021</a>, <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2022</a>, <a href="#ref90"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2023<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref91"><span>Reference Sanders</span><em>b</em></a>) has shown that the higher-order dynamics are ‘intrinsically variational’, in the sense that higher-derivative versions of the classical equations of motion can be derived from a minimum-action principle even for dissipative systems, thus allowing inherently non-Hamiltonian problems to be treated as though they are Hamiltonian. This discovery has already led to two applications: the direct modal analysis of damped dynamical systems (Sanders <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2022</a>) and, subsequently, a new and more efficient algorithm for computing a damped system's resonant frequencies (Sanders &amp; Inman <a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Sanders and Inman</span>2023</a>). Higher-derivative theories had been studied before in the realm of quantum gravity physics (Pais &amp; Uhlenbeck <a href="#ref80"><span>Reference Pais and Uhlenbeck</span>1950</a>; Van den Berg &amp; VanderVorst <a href="#ref113"><span>Reference Van den Berg and VanderVorst</span>2002</a>; Kalies &amp; VanderVorst <a href="#ref59"><span>Reference Kalies and VanderVorst</span>2004</a>; Bender &amp; Mannheim <a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Bender and Mannheim</span>2008</a>; Smilga <a href="#ref97"><span>Reference Smilga</span>2009</a>; Mostafazadeh <a href="#ref75"><span>Reference Mostafazadeh</span>2010</a>; Baleanu <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref7"><span>Reference Baleanu, Petras, Asad and Velasco</span>2012</a>; Chen <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref23"><span>Reference Chen, Fasiello, Lim and Tolley</span>2013</a>) but until now they have not been applied to classical fluids. While the Navier–Stokes equations, in their standard form, may be unsuited to Hamiltonian formalism (Millikan <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Millikan</span>1929</a>; Finlayson <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Finlayson</span>1972<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Finlayson</span><em>b</em></a>; Doering &amp; Gibbon <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Doering and Gibbon</span>1995</a>; Hieber <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> <a href="#ref51"><span>Reference Hieber, Robinson and Shibata</span>2017</a>; Lemarie-Rieusset <a href="#ref65"><span>Reference Lemarie-Rieusset</span>2018</a>), it will be shown here that the higher-order dynamics can be used to restate the problem in a form consistent with Hamiltonian and Hamilton–Jacobi formalism.</p>
<p> In conclusion, although the body of research surrounding the Navier–Stokes equations is extensive, it would appear that no canonical Hamiltonian formulation of the Navier–Stokes problem has been found to date. That is what the present work aims to achieve.</p>

<p> The proof is straightforward. Consider the two formulations separately, and impose on the second-order formulation identical auxiliary conditions to those of the first-order formulation. In particular, just like the simple example given in §&nbsp;<a href="#sec1-1">1.1</a>, the second-order formulation requires additional auxiliary conditions over and above those applied to the first-order formulation.

<h3><span>4.1.</span> Hamilton–Jacobi equation</h3>
<p> One of the most significant aspects of the Hamiltonian formalism is that it leads to the transformation theory of Hamilton (<a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1833</a>, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1834</a>, <a href="#ref50"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1835</a>) and Jacobi (<a href="#ref54"><span>Reference Jacobi</span>1837</a>, <a href="#ref55"><span>Reference Jacobi</span>1842–1843</a>) (see Whittaker (<a href="#ref117"><span>Reference Whittaker</span>1904</a>) and Lanczos (<a href="#ref63"><span>Reference Lanczos</span>1970</a>)), celebrated both for unifying particle mechanics with wave optics (Hamilton <a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>1833</a>) and for its relationship to the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics (Schrödinger <a href="#ref93"><span>Reference Schrödinger</span>1926<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref94"><span>Reference Schrödinger</span><em>b</em></a>). Here, we will obtain a Hamilton–Jacobi equation representing the Navier–Stokes problem.</p>
<p> In the context of discrete mechanics, Hamilton's principal function is obtained as the solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, which is in turn defined by the functional form of the Hamiltonian. Hamilton's principal function provides the generating function for a canonical transformation to a new set of generalized coordinates and conjugate momenta for which the Hamiltonian vanishes identically, in which case Hamilton's equations do, in fact, become trivial. The new coordinates and their conjugate momenta are simply equal to their initial values.</p>

<p> It must be acknowledged that the Hamilton–Jacobi equation developed above (either (<a href="#eqn53">4.11</a>) for the compressible case or (<a href="#eqn54">4.12</a>) in the incompressible limit) contains Volterra (<a href="#ref114"><span>Reference Volterra</span>1930</a>) functional derivatives and is thus by no means trivial to solve. Indeed, it appears that solving such equations is itself a long-standing open problem in mathematics, which has received very little attention since the first half of the twentieth century (Michal <a href="#ref71"><span>Reference Michal</span>1926</a>; Jordan &amp; Pauli <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Jordan and Pauli</span>1928</a>; Levy <a href="#ref66"><span>Reference Levy</span>1951</a>; Tatarskii <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Tatarskii</span>1961</a>; Syavavko &amp; Mel'nichak <a href="#ref101"><span>Reference Syavavko and Mel'nichak</span>1974</a>; Dieudonne <a href="#ref28"><span>Reference Dieudonne</span>1981</a>; Koval'chik <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Koval'chik</span>1993</a>). Nevertheless, if a rigorous theory of such equations can be developed, the present formulation of the Navier–Stokes problem might be solved as one special case. The present authors submit that such an endeavour is worthwhile and merits further study.</p>
<p> We conclude this section by remarking that, in the inviscid limit (<span data-mathjax-status="alt-graphic"><span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline291.png?pub-status=live" width="78" height="20" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline291.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline291.png"><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$\mu =\lambda =0$</span></span></span></span>), all of the preceding formalism remains perfectly well posed. In that limit, the present approach yields a mathematically equivalent second-order formulation of the inviscid Euler equations, as one would expect.

In the present context, these boundary conditions are ostensibly tantamount to specification of the viscous stress on the boundary by way of velocity gradients.</p>
<p> In general, the conditions at a boundary require two transition relations (Batchelor <a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Batchelor</span>2000</a>; White <a href="#ref116"><span>Reference White</span>2006</a>) to ultimately describe the momentum transport. Mathematically speaking, these conditions are the jump in velocity (momentum intensity) and the jump in stress (momentum flux). Under ordinary physical circumstances the velocity and stress are assumed to be continuous. However, this is one particular form of the transition relations, and there are familiar examples to which they do not apply. For example, at a liquid–gas interface the stress relation is modified to account for a non-zero jump in the normal stress that is balanced by a force due to surface tension (the tangential stress component usually still taken to be continuous). Similarly, in the event that molecular slip occurs, the typical transition relation gives an expression for the slip velocity (e.g. Thompson &amp; Troian <a href="#ref109"><span>Reference Thompson and Troian</span>1997</a>; Thalakkottor &amp; Mohseni <a href="#ref108"><span>Reference Thalakkottor and Mohseni</span>2016</a>). In the case of energy transport, analogous conditions are needed regarding jumps in temperature (intensity) and heat flow (flux), which are recognized as the concept of thermal contact resistance.</p>

<h2><span>6.</span> Case study</h2>
<p> We can explore how this method can be applied by considering a simplified example with a known field solution. In looking at the variety of cases in which the Navier–Stokes equations have a known analytical solution, the simplest are those involving steady flows. While the Euler–Lagrange equations (<a href="#eqn35">3.9</a>), (<a href="#eqn36">3.10</a>) can be written for these cases, the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi equation is trivial because for steady flows the fields are already equal to their initial values.</p>
<p> It is therefore worthwhile to examine the simplest unsteady flows, which should result in a non-trivial Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Indeed, there exists a class of flows for which the Navier–Stokes equations take the same simplified form: those in which the flow is incompressible and unidirectional (Batchelor <a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Batchelor</span>2000</a>). This class of problems include both of Stokes's flows (Stokes <a href="#ref99"><span>Reference Stokes</span>1851</a>), in which a semi-infinite fluid is influenced by a boundary moving in its own plane. In the first of these cases, the boundary is impulsively started and in the second, the boundary oscillates. We can also include developing flow in a channel or pipe. The only difference between these flows results from initial and boundary conditions, but the Navier–Stokes equations and therefore the present Hamilton–Jacobi equation take the same form.</p>

<p> Despite knowing the analytical solution for these fields in this particular example, the present authors have not been able to solve this Hamilton–Jacobi equation, since again the solution of such equations is itself an open problem (Michal <a href="#ref71"><span>Reference Michal</span>1926</a>; Jordan &amp; Pauli <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Jordan and Pauli</span>1928</a>; Levy <a href="#ref66"><span>Reference Levy</span>1951</a>; Tatarskii <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Tatarskii</span>1961</a>; Syavavko &amp; Mel'nichak <a href="#ref101"><span>Reference Syavavko and Mel'nichak</span>1974</a>; Dieudonne <a href="#ref28"><span>Reference Dieudonne</span>1981</a>; Koval'chik <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Koval'chik</span>1993</a>). This example therefore appears to be a good place to start for tackling the general problem. Another interesting example to consider might be a two-dimensional Taylor–Green vortex such as that considered by Wu, Ma &amp; Zhou (<a href="#ref118"><span>Reference Wu, Ma and Zhou</span>2006</a>).</p>

<p> This paper has presented a novel Hamiltonian formulation of the isotropic Navier–Stokes problem for both compressible and incompressible fluids. This canonical formulation opens several previously unexplored avenues toward a final resolution of the problem, which we briefly describe below.</p>
<p> Perhaps the most obvious route would be to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi equation – either (<a href="#eqn53">4.11</a>) for the compressible case or (<a href="#eqn54">4.12</a>) for the incompressible case – for Hamilton's principal functional <span data-mathjax-status="alt-graphic"><span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline333.png?pub-status=live" width="76" height="21" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline333.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline333.png"><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>${S}^{*}[u_{i},p,t]$</span></span></span></span> directly.

Alternatively, if one can simply establish based on emerging analytical techniques that a complete solution to this Hamilton–Jacobi equation does (or does not) exist under the usual assumptions, that will also settle the question of existence of solutions.</p>
<p> An alternative strategy might be to investigate the corresponding Lagrangian formulation based on the action <span data-mathjax-status="alt-graphic"><span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline335.png?pub-status=live" width="21" height="16" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline335.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline335.png"><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$\mathcal {S}^{*}$</span></span></span></span> as given by (<a href="#eqn23">3.3</a>). Because the first- and second-order formulations are mathematically equivalent (recall the proof in §&nbsp;<a href="#sec3-2">3.2</a>), <span data-mathjax-status="alt-graphic"><span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline336.png?pub-status=live" width="21" height="16" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline336.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline336.png"><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$\mathcal {S}^{*}$</span></span></span></span> must have as many local minima as there are solutions to the traditional, first-order formulation. Intuitively, it seems as though it ought to be possible to determine – or at least to establish bounds on – the number of critical points an action has based on the form of the Lagrangian (Van den Berg &amp; VanderVorst <a href="#ref113"><span>Reference Van den Berg and VanderVorst</span>2002</a>; Kalies &amp; VanderVorst <a href="#ref59"><span>Reference Kalies and VanderVorst</span>2004</a>). If one can establish that, under the usual assumptions, <span data-mathjax-status="alt-graphic"><span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline337.png?pub-status=live" width="21" height="16" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline337.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20240328184703666-0405:S0022112024002295:S0022112024002295_inline337.png"><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$\mathcal {S}^{*}$</span></span></span></span> always has exactly one local minimum, or else demonstrate that there are cases where it fails to achieve a local minimum, that too will resolve the question of existence and uniqueness.</p>
<p> By no means is either of the above programs trivial. As pointed out in §&nbsp;<a href="#sec4-1">4.1</a>, solving equations containing Volterra (<a href="#ref114"><span>Reference Volterra</span>1930</a>) functional derivatives is itself a long-standing open problem in mathematics, which has received very little attention since the first half of the twentieth century (Michal <a href="#ref71"><span>Reference Michal</span>1926</a>; Jordan &amp; Pauli <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Jordan and Pauli</span>1928</a>; Levy <a href="#ref66"><span>Reference Levy</span>1951</a>; Tatarskii <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Tatarskii</span>1961</a>; Syavavko &amp; Mel'nichak <a href="#ref101"><span>Reference Syavavko and Mel'nichak</span>1974</a>; Dieudonne <a href="#ref28"><span>Reference Dieudonne</span>1981</a>; Koval'chik <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Koval'chik</span>1993</a>). One might even go so far as to call it a ‘forgotten’ open problem (as did one of the reviewers of the present paper, who generously drew our attention to Jordan &amp; Pauli <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Jordan and Pauli</span>1928</a>; Levy <a href="#ref66"><span>Reference Levy</span>1951</a>; Tatarskii <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Tatarskii</span>1961</a>; Syavavko &amp; Mel'nichak <a href="#ref101"><span>Reference Syavavko and Mel'nichak</span>1974</a>; Dieudonne <a href="#ref28"><span>Reference Dieudonne</span>1981</a>; Koval'chik <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Koval'chik</span>1993</a>). We see the lack of work on such equations as a challenge, yes, but at the same time we also see it as a significant opportunity for advancing the field of analytical continuum mechanics. Perhaps, despite an apparent increase in complexity, a rigorous theory of such equations can be developed after all, in which case the present formulation of the Navier–Stokes problem might be solved as one example. We submit that, at the very least, such an endeavour merits further study, which we intend to continue in future work.</p>
<p> Finally, it is worth noting that the techniques employed here are by no means specific to the Navier–Stokes problem, nor are they restricted to the field of classical mechanics. The suitably averaged principle of least squares (Sanders <a href="#ref88"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2021</a>, <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2022</a>, <a href="#ref90"><span>Reference Sanders</span>2023<em>a</em></a>,<a href="#ref91"><span>Reference Sanders</span><em>b</em></a>; Sanders &amp; Inman <a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Sanders and Inman</span>2023</a>) can be applied to any traditionally non-Hamiltonian dynamical system in order to formulate a mathematically equivalent higher-order Hamiltonian system. It is believed that this fundamental result will also find uses in other branches of pure and applied mathematics.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does it work?</h3><a id="user-content-how-does-it-work" aria-label="Permalink: How does it work?" href="#how-does-it-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dot is built with Electron JS, but its main functionalities come from a bundled install of Python that contains all libraries and necessary files. A multitude of libraries are used to make everything work, but perhaps the most important to be aware of are: llama.cpp to run the LLM, FAISS to create local vector stores, and Langchain &amp; Huggingface to setup the conversation chains and embedding process.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Install</h3><a id="user-content-install" aria-label="Permalink: Install" href="#install"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can either install the packaged app in the <a href="https://dotapp.uk/" rel="nofollow">Dot website </a> or can set up the project for development, to do so follow these steps:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Clone the repository <code>$ https://github.com/alexpinel/Dot.git</code></li>
<li>Install Node js and then run <code>npm install</code> inside the project repository, you can run <code>npm install --force</code> if you face any issues at this stage</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Now, it is time to add a full python bundle to the app. The purpose of this is to create a distributable environment with all necessary libraries, if you only plan on using Dot from the console you might not need to follow this particular step but then make sure to replace the python path locations specified in <code>src/index.js</code>. Creating the python bundle is covered in detail here: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/electron/python-inside-electron" rel="nofollow">https://til.simonwillison.net/electron/python-inside-electron</a> , the bundles can also be installed from here: <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20240224">https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20240224</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Having created the bundle, please rename it to 'python' and place it inside the <code>llm</code> directory. It is now time to get all necessary libraries, keep in mind that running a simple <code>pip install</code> will not work without specifying the actual path of the bundle so use this instead: <code>path/to/python/.bin/or/.exe -m pip install</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Required python libraries:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>pytorch <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" rel="nofollow">link</a> (CPU version recommended as it is lighter than GPU)</li>
<li>langchain <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart" rel="nofollow">link</a></li>
<li>FAISS <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss" rel="nofollow">link</a></li>
<li>HuggingFace <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/platforms/huggingface" rel="nofollow">link</a></li>
<li>llama.cpp <a href="https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python">link</a> (Use CUDA implementation if you have an Nvidia GPU!)</li>
<li>pypdf <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/pdf" rel="nofollow">link</a></li>
<li>docx2txt <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/microsoft_word" rel="nofollow">link</a></li>
<li>Unstructured <a href="https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured">link</a> (Use <code>pip install "unstructured[pptx, md, xlsx]</code> for the file formats)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Now python should be setup and running! However, there is still a few more steps left, now is the time to add the final magic to Dot! First, create a folder inside the <code>llm</code> directory and name it <code>mpnet</code>, there you will need to install sentence-transformers to use for the document embeddings, fetch all the files from the following link and place them inside the new folder: <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2/tree/main" rel="nofollow">sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, download the Mistral 7B LLM from the following link and place it inside the <code>llm/scripts</code> directory alongside the python scripts used by Dot: <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/blob/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf" rel="nofollow">TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF</a></p>
<p dir="auto">That's it! If you follow these steps you should be able to get it all running, please let me know if you are facing any issues :)</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Linux support</li>
<li>Ability to choose LLM</li>
<li>Image support would be cool</li>
<li>Increased awarnes of documents apart from merely their content</li>
<li>Loading individual files instead of selecting a folder  (This is really needed, some users get confused by this and I cannot blame them at all)</li>
<li>Increased security considerations, after all this is the whole point of using a local LLM</li>
<li>Support for more docs</li>
<li>Storing file databases, allowing users to quickly switch between groups of files without having to load them all again</li>
<li>idk, will find out along the way</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>A majority of the GitHub Action workflows we see at Blacksmith use Docker. Whether it is to setup containers to run tests against, or build custom Docker images and push them to a registry, Docker is everywhere. It is also common knowledge that for a healthy Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, one has to think through an effective caching strategy - there are few things as mind-numbing as watching tests rebuild undifferentiated dependencies on every run.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I was helping a customer setup their Docker workflows, and started reading about the best way to enable caching in GitHub Actions. Surprisingly, I found <em>at least</em> three ways to achieve this, each with its own quirks. This blog is a one-stop shop with everything I learned and will help you choose the most suitable caching strategy for your workflows.</p><h2>Docker caching 101</h2><p>Docker images are best visualized as a stack of layers, where each layer represents a set of filesystem changes resulting from an instruction in the <code>Dockerfile</code>. Each layer only contains the changes from the layer before it. This ensures that there is no duplication of data across layers. A big advantage of the layered structure is that the intermediate filesystems (layers) can be re-used in subsequent Docker builds. This re-using of layers is what forms the basis of Docker caching, and results in much faster, incremental builds, instead of always building the image from scratch.</p><p>The best <code>Dockerfile</code> s are the ones that stack layers in order from least frequently to most frequently mutated. Consolidating the layers that are least likely to change as the base of every Docker build, allows for the most effective re-use of layers when building subsequent Docker images. There are several, much more informed blogs out there about <code>Dockerfile</code> best practices, so that’s the last I’ll speak of it.</p><h2><strong>Starting simple</strong></h2><p>If you are familiar with how a Docker build and push step is written in GitHub Actions, feel free to skip over to the next section that talks about caching.</p><div><pre translate="no"><code><span>name</span>: Build and Push Docker Image

<span>on</span>:
<span>  push</span>:

<span>        with</span>:
<span>          context</span>: <span>.</span></code></pre></div><p>This is what a vanilla GitHub Action workflow that builds and pushes a Docker image looks like. This workflow assumes the <code>Dockerfile</code> is in the root of the repository, and uses two popular Docker actions:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><code><a href="https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setup-buildx-action</a></code>&nbsp;to configure <a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx" rel="noopener">Docker Buildx</a> to create a builder instance for running the image build</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><code><a href="https://github.com/docker/build-push-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build-push-action</a></code>&nbsp;to build and push the Docker image using the builder configured in the previous step</p></li></ul><p>Notably, there is no caching occurring in this workflow - so, every time the job is run, Docker will have to build the image from scratch!</p><h2>Docker caching with GitHub Actions cache</h2><p>The first caching strategy we are going to explore is caching Docker layer blobs to the native Github Actions <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cache</a>. This approach is the simplest to reconcile, and I’d recommend it as a good starting point to build intuition. There are, however, some limitations to this approach as your codebase scales.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Each GitHub repository is only given 10GB of cache space, after which, the oldest entries in the cache are evicted. If your Docker image is reasonably large, or has several layers, you will likely run into this limit and not reap the benefits of effective caching.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>GitHub’s cache is only scoped to the development branch running the Docker build. Sharing the cached layers across your organization, or with other build systems, is not possible with this approach.</p></li></ul><p>Here is how you would edit the above workflow file to enable caching backed by GitHub’s cache.</p><div><pre translate="no"><code><span>name</span>: Build and Push Docker Image

<span>          cache-from</span>: type=gha
<span>          cache-to</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s take a second to understand <code>cache-from</code> and <code>cache-to</code>.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><code>cache-from</code> points to the source where the build process will attempt to find a cache to use while building the Docker image</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><code>cache-to</code> specifies the destination where the cache generated during the build process will be stored</p></li></ul><p>In the above workflow, the first run will be an uncached run, since there is no cache at <code>cache-from</code> to import. At the end of this run, cache blobs will be written to <code>cache-to</code>. Subsequent runs will be able to leverage these cached Docker layers, and just like that, you’re running much faster than you were!</p><h2>Docker caching with a registry backed cache</h2><p>The second flavour of Docker caching we’ll look at uses a Docker registry as the cache backend. A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. There are two ways you can leverage a registry backed cache, each with its own strengths and limitations.</p><h3>1. Inline cache</h3><p>An inline cache is the simplest registry backed cache to setup. This method embeds the build cache artifacts directly into the Docker image. Let’s modify our workflow file before diving in.</p><div><pre translate="no"><code><span>name</span>: Build and Push Docker Image

<span>          cache-to</span>

</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, our <code>cache-to</code> now points to a different cache backend. The <code>type=inline</code> instructs the Docker builder to embed cache artifacts into the Docker image, and push them to the same location as the Docker image Subsequent runs of this workflow will use the image referenced in <code>cache-from</code> as their base, to significantly speed-up Docker builds.</p><p>So… why is this better than the GitHub Action’s cache backend?</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>You are not subject to GitHub’s cache size limits and eviction policies.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>You can re-use the cache artifacts across your organization or with other build systems.</p></li></ul><p>So… why aren’t we done yet?</p><p>For this we need to take a slight detour to understand “multi-stage” Docker builds. A <a href="https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-stage</a> Docker build is one where the <code>Dockerfile</code> is organized into multiple stages. Each stage has its own base image and set of instructions. The author has complete flexibility to decide what artifacts from the previous stage should be copied over to the next stage. For example, you can have a <code>Build</code> stage that includes all the tools and dependancies, but have your <code>Final</code> stage only have the necessary pieces to run your application.</p><div><pre translate="no"><code><span># Build stage</span>
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

<span># Final stage</span>
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/build /app
CMD [<span>"node"</span>, <span>"server.js"</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Having only the necessary files and dependencies copied into the final production image allows for it to be much smaller and more secure, than if the entire <code>Dockerfile</code> were to be written in a single stage.</p><p>The <code>inline</code> cache only supports <code>mode=min</code> . This mode only caches the layers of the final stage, not any of the intermediate layers in a multi-stage Docker build. This significantly reduces the chances of a cache hit in subsequent Docker builds.</p><p>Another shortcoming of the <code>inline</code> cache is that since it embeds the cache artifacts into the Docker image, it can significantly inflate the size of your Docker image. Enter, our final caching solution.</p><h3>2. Registry cache</h3><p>The registry cache backend is the <code>inline</code> cache++. This backend pushes cache artifacts as a separate image than the Docker image to a dedicated location in the registry.</p><div><pre translate="no"><code><span>name</span>: Build and Push Docker Image

<span>on</span>:
<span>  push</span>:

<span>          cache-to</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Contrary to the <code>inline</code> cache, the registry cache supports caching of intermediate layers in a multi-stage Docker build when configured with <code>mode=max</code> . This increases the chances of cache hits on subsequent builds. It also supports a host of <a href="https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/registry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">options</a> to control compression type, levels, and naming of the cache image etc. At the cost of some additional complexity to set up, this is the best-in-class caching solution for Docker builds.</p><p>At Blacksmith, we are always thinking of ways to boost the performance of your CI jobs.

<p dir="auto">WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs.
A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the Linux kernel,
and should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It is also included
as part of the free operating system <a href="https://www.reactos.org/" rel="nofollow">ReactOS</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If your Btrfs filesystem is on a MD software RAID device created by Linux, you
will also need <a href="https://github.com/maharmstone/winmd">WinMD</a> to get this to appear
under Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">See also <a href="https://github.com/maharmstone/quibble">Quibble</a>, an experimental
bootloader allowing Windows to boot from Btrfs, and <a href="https://github.com/maharmstone/ntfs2btrfs">Ntfs2btrfs</a>,
a tool which allows in-place conversion of NTFS filesystems.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, a disclaimer:</p>
<p dir="auto">You use this software at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any damage
it may do to your filesystem. It ought to be suitable for day-to-day use, but
make sure you take backups anyway.</p>

<p dir="auto">To install the driver, <a href="https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs/releases">download and extract the latest release</a>,
right-click btrfs.inf, and choose Install. The driver is signed, so should work out
of the box on modern versions of Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you using Windows 10 and have Secure Boot enabled, you may have to make a Registry
change in order for the driver to be loaded - see <a href="#secureboot">below</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">WinBtrfs is also available on the following package managers:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/winbtrfs" rel="nofollow">Chocolatey</a></li>
</ul>

<ul dir="auto">

</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Uninstalling</h2><a id="user-content-uninstalling" aria-label="Permalink: Uninstalling" href="#uninstalling"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to uninstall, from a command prompt run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="RUNDLL32.EXE SETUPAPI.DLL,InstallHinfSection DefaultUninstall 132 btrfs.inf"><pre><code>RUNDLL32.EXE SETUPAPI.DLL,InstallHinfSection DefaultUninstall 132 btrfs.inf
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You may need to give the full path to btrfs.inf.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also go to Device Manager, find "Btrfs controller" under
"Storage volumes", right click and choose "Uninstall". Tick the checkbox to
uninstall the driver as well, and let Windows reboot itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you need to uninstall via the registry, open regedit and set the value of
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\btrfs\Start to 4, to disable the service.
After you reboot, you can then delete the btrfs key and remove
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\btrfs.sys.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compilation</h2><a id="user-content-compilation" aria-label="Permalink: Compilation" href="#compilation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To compile with Visual C++ 2019, open the directory and let CMake do its thing.
If you have the Windows DDK installed correctly, it should just work.</p>
<p dir="auto">To compile with GCC on Linux, you will need a cross-compiler set up, for either
<code>i686-w64-mingw32</code> or <code>x86_64-w64-mingw32</code>. Create a build directory, then use
either <code>mingw-x86.cmake</code> or <code>mingw-amd64.cmake</code> as CMake toolchain files to
generate your Makefile.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mappings</h2><a id="user-content-mappings" aria-label="Permalink: Mappings" href="#mappings"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The user mappings are stored in the registry key
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\btrfs\Mappings. Create a DWORD with the
name of your Windows SID (e.g. S-1-5-21-1379886684-2432464051-424789967-1001),
and the value of your Linux uid (e.g. 1000). It will take effect next time the
driver is loaded.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find your current SID by running <code>wmic useraccount get name,sid</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Similarly, the group mappings are stored in under GroupMappings. The default
entry maps Windows' Users group to gid 100, which is usually "users" on Linux.
You can also specify user SIDs here to force files created by a user to belong
to a certain group. The setgid flag also works as on Linux.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">LXSS ("Ubuntu on Windows" / "Windows Subsystem for Linux")</h2><a id="user-content-lxss-ubuntu-on-windows--windows-subsystem-for-linux" aria-label="Permalink: LXSS (&quot;Ubuntu on Windows&quot; / &quot;Windows Subsystem for Linux&quot;)" href="#lxss-ubuntu-on-windows--windows-subsystem-for-linux"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The driver will passthrough Linux metadata to recent versions of LXSS, but you
will have to let Windows know that you wish to do this. From a Bash prompt on
Windows, edit <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> to look like the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[automount]
enabled = true
options = &quot;metadata&quot;
mountFsTab = false"><pre><code>[automount]
enabled = true
options = "metadata"
mountFsTab = false
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It will then take effect next time you reboot. Yes, you should be able to chroot
into an actual Linux installation, if you wish.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Commands</h2><a id="user-content-commands" aria-label="Permalink: Commands" href="#commands"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The DLL file shellbtrfs.dll provides the GUI interface, but it can also be used
with rundll32.exe to carry out some tasks from the command line, which may be
useful if you wish to schedule something to run periodically.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bear in mind that rundll32 provides no mechanism to return any error codes, so
any of these commands may fail silently.</p>

default on most setups nowadays - if you're not using UTF-8, it's probably worth
looking into converting your files.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a name="user-content-secureboot"></a>How do I get this working with Secure Boot turned on?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For the very latest versions of Windows 10, Microsoft introduced more onerous
requirements for signing, which seemingly aren't available for open-source drivers.</p>
<p dir="auto">To work around this, go to <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CI\Policy</code> in Regedit,
create a new DWORD value called <code>UpgradedSystem</code> and set to 1, and reboot.</p>
<p dir="auto">Or you could always just turn off Secure Boot in your BIOS settings.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The root of the drive isn't case-sensitive in LXSS</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This is something Microsoft hardcoded into LXSS, presumably to stop people hosing
their systems by running <code>mkdir /mnt/c/WiNdOwS</code>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How do I change the drive letter?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">With the shell extension installed, right-click the drive in Explorer, click Properties,
and go to the Btrfs tab. There should be a button which allows you to change the drive
letter.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I'm still having problems with drive letters</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In Regedit, try deleting the relevant entries in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices</code>,
then rebooting.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How do I format a partition as Btrfs?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Use the included command line program mkbtrfs.exe. We can't add Btrfs to Windows' own
dialog box, unfortunately, as its list of filesystems has been hardcoded. You can also
run <code>format /fs:btrfs</code>, if you don't need to set any Btrfs-specific options.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I can't reformat a mounted Btrfs filesystem</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If Windows' Format dialog box refuses to appear, try running format.com with the /fs
flag, e.g. <code>format /fs:ntfs D:</code>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I can't mount a Synology NAS</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Synology seems to use LVM for its block devices. Until somebody writes an LVM driver
for Windows, you're out of luck.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I can't mount a Thecus NAS</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Thecus uses Linux's MD raid for its block devices. You will need to install <a href="https://github.com/maharmstone/winmd">WinMD</a>
as well.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>64-bit Windows 7 won't load the driver</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Make sure that you have <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=46148" rel="nofollow">KB3033929</a> installed.
Or consider installing from an "escrow" ISO which includes all updates.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The drive doesn't show up and Paragon software has been installed</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Paragon's filesystem-reading software is known to disable automount. Disable or
uninstall Paragon, then re-enable automount by running <code>diskpart</code> and typing
<code>automount enable</code>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The drive doesn't show up on very old versions of Windows</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">On very old versions of Windows (XP, Server 2003?), Windows ignores Linux partitions
entirely. If this is the case for you, try running <code>fdisk</code> on Linux and changing your
partition type from 83 to 7.</p>

<p dir="auto">v0.1 (2016-02-21):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Initial alpha release.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debug log</h2><a id="user-content-debug-log" aria-label="Permalink: Debug log" href="#debug-log"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">WinBtrfs has three levels of debug messages: errors and FIXMEs, warnings, and traces.
The release version of the driver only displays the errors and FIXMEs, which it logs
via <code>DbgPrint</code>. You can view these messages via the Microsoft program DebugView, available
at <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/debugview" rel="nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/debugview</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to report a problem, it'd be of great help if you could also attach a full
debug log. To do this, you will need to use the debug versions of the drivers; copy the files
in Debug\x64 or Debug\x86 into x64 or x86. You will also need to set the registry entries in
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\btrfs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>DebugLogLevel</code> (DWORD): 0 for no messages, 1 for errors and FIXMEs, 2 for warnings also,
and 3 for absolutely everything, including traces.</li>
<li><code>LogDevice</code> (string, optional): the serial device you want to output to, such as
<code>\Device\Serial0</code>. This is probably only useful on virtual machines.</li>
<li><code>LogFile</code> (string, optional): the file you wish to output to, if <code>LogDevice</code> isn't set.
Bear in mind this is a kernel filename, so you'll have to prefix it with "\??\" (e.g.,
"\??\C:\btrfs.log"). It probably goes without saying, but don't store this on a volume the
driver itself is using, or you'll cause an infinite loop.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mount options</h2><a id="user-content-mount-options" aria-label="Permalink: Mount options" href="#mount-options"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The driver will create subkeys in the registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\btrfs
for each mounted filesystem, named after its UUID. If you're unsure which UUID refers to which
volume, you can check using <code>btrfs fi show</code> on Linux. You can add per-volume mount options to this
subkey, which will take effect on reboot. If a value is set in the key above this, it will use this
by default.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>Ignore</code> (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver not to attempt loading this filesystem. With the
<code>Readonly</code> flag, this is probably redundant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>Readonly</code> (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver not to allow writing to this volume. This is
the equivalent of the <code>ro</code> flag on Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>Compress</code> (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver to write files as compressed by default. This is
the equivalent of the <code>compress</code> flag on Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>CompressForce</code> (DWORD): set this to 1 to force compression, i.e. to ignore the <code>nocompress</code> inode
flag and even attempt compression of incompressible files. This isn't a good idea, but is the equivalent
of the <code>compress-force</code> flag on Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>CompressType</code> (DWORD): set this to 1 to prefer zlib compression, 2 to prefer lzo compression, or 3
to prefer zstd compression. The default is 0, which uses zstd or lzo compression if the incompat flags
are set, and zlib otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>FlushInterval</code> (DWORD): the interval in seconds between metadata flushes. The default is 30, as on Linux -
the parameter is called <code>commit</code> there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>ZlibLevel</code> (DWORD): a number between -1 and 9, which determines how much CPU time is spent trying to
compress files. You might want to fiddle with this if you have a fast CPU but a slow disk, or vice versa.
The default is 3, which is the hard-coded value on Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>MaxInline</code> (DWORD): the maximum size that will be allowed for "inline" files, i.e. those stored in the
metadata. The default is 2048, which is also the default on modern versions of Linux - the parameter is
called <code>max_inline</code> there. It will be clipped to the maximum value, which unless you've changed your node
size will be a shade under 16 KB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>SubvolId</code> (QWORD): the ID of the subvolume that we will attempt to mount as the root. If it doesn't
exist, this parameter will be silently ignored. The subvolume ID can be found on the inode property
sheet; it's in hex there, as opposed to decimal on the Linux tools. The default is whatever has been set
via <code>btrfs subvolume set-default</code>; or, failing that, subvolume 5. The equivalent parameter on Linux is
called <code>subvolid</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>SkipBalance</code> (DWORD): set to 1 to tell the driver not to attempt resuming a balance which was running
when the system last powered down. The default is 0. The equivalent parameter on Linux is <code>skip_balance</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>NoPNP</code> (DWORD): useful for debugging only, this forces any volumes to appear rather than exposing them
via the usual Plug and Play method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>ZstdLevel</code> (DWORD): Zstd compression level, default 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>NoTrim</code> (DWORD): set this to 1 to disable TRIM support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>AllowDegraded</code> (DWORD): set this to 1 to allow mounting a degraded volume, i.e. one with a device
missing. You are strongly advised not to enable this unless you need to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>NoRootDir</code> (DWORD): if you have changed your default subvolume, either natively or by a registry option,
there will be a hidden directory called $Root which points to where the root would normally be. Set this
value to 1 to prevent this appearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>NoDataCOW</code> (DWORD): set this to 1 to disable copy-on-write for new files. This is the equivalent of the
<code>nodatacow</code> flag on Linux.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We find that, simply via a sampling-and-voting method, the performance of large language models (LLMs) scales with the number of agents instantiated. Also, this method is orthogonal to existing complicated methods to further enhance LLMs, while the degree of enhancement is correlated to the task difficulty. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLM benchmarks to verify the presence of our finding, and to study the properties that can facilitate its occurrence. Our code is publicly available at: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/more_agent_is_all_you_need}.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="incArticle">
          
<p>Internet users in a handful of states across the US are finding it more difficult to <a href="https://www.popsci.com/article/technology/end-anonymity/">browse parts of the web anonymously</a>. Over a dozen states, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-wins-after-pornography-companies-sued-texas-over-age-verification#:~:text=HB%201181%20requires%20purveyors%20of,injunction%20from%20a%20district%20court.">Texas</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/08/1147762020/louisianas-new-porn-law-carries-user-privacy-risks">Louisiana</a>, have enacted legislation forcing Pornhub and other purveyors of streaming online adult videos to verify the identities of its users to ensure children and teens aren’t accessing “sexual material harmful to minors.” Elsewhere, in states like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/25/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-protect-children-and-uphold-parental-rights/">Florida</a>, lawmakers have introduced so-called <a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/9-states-kids-social-media-block-age-gate-social-media-1850567724#:~:text=The%20law,%20called%20the%20Securing,under%20the%20age%20of%2018.">online parental consent laws</a> that would limit or ban underage users from accessing social media services over <a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/surgeon-general-kids-social-media-warning-instagram-1850465452">claims they cause psychological harm</a>. In each case, lawmakers want online platforms to collect government-IDs from users or have them submit to third-party age verification methods to ensure they are indeed adults.</p>



<p>But determining whether or not kids and teens are actually accessing those sites means platforms have no choice but to verify the ages of all users accessing their sites, minor or otherwise. Adult porn viewers, who could previously dip in and out of websites with a relative degree of anonymity, may now fear having their government name and photograph at arms length away from their last Pornhub search query. At the same time, critics of the new laws worry some far-right, religiously conservative lawmakers <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/heritage/status/1660111875818790913?s=61">could broadly interpret</a> “adult” material to include content from LGBTQ+ creators or other people from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/law-should-not-require-parental-consent-all-minors-access-social-media">marginalized groups who rely on the internet for a sense of community</a>. In that scenario, teens from abusive or difficult family structures could find themselves shut out from support structures online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts speaking with <em>PopSci</em> say there are signs internet users in many of these states are turning to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to access otherwise blocked materials. Leading VPN provider Top10 VPN claims demand from VPN services <a target="_blank" href="https://www.top10vpn.com/research/vpn-demand-statistics/">jumped 275% on March 15</a>, the same day Pornhub cut off access in Texas. The site says demand for <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/how-does-a-vpn-work/">VPNs</a> similarly surged by 210% the day after a similar law took effect in Louisiana last year. ExpressVPN, another popular VPN provider, told <em>PopSci </em>it saw increased web traffic to its site the day anti-porn, online age verification bills took effect in seven out of eight states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wherever U.S. lawmakers have imposed age verification on internet users trying to access adult content online over the past 12 months, there has been a clear trend in the corresponding surges in demand for VPNs,” Top10 VPN Head of Research Simon Migliano told <em>PopSci. </em>In the most extreme case, Migliano claims Top10 VPN saw demand for the technology jolt up 847% the day the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2023/8/8/23824414/utah-law-pornhub-industry-retreats/">state’s new laws came into effect</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-are-vpns-being-used"><strong>How are VPNs being used?</strong></h2>



<p>VPNs, which date back to the mid 1990s, create an encrypted tunnel for user’s data and can make it appear as if their computer is based in a different geographical location. Digital streaming viewers often use this VPN masking technology to access shows restricted in certain markets and <a target="_blank" href="https://cybernews.com/how-to-use-vpn/how-to-get-around-espn-blackout/#workaround-with-a-vpn">blacked out sports events</a>. Others view VPNs as useful tools for adding layers of security to private communications. That same technology has, for years, been used by whistleblowers, journalists, and political dissidents worldwide to bolster their anonymity online, especially in authoritarian countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A VPN is an effective tool for circumventing any kind of internet censorship, as it allows users to access the restricted content via an IP address from a location under a different jurisdiction from their own,” Migliano said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though commonly used to bypass content restrictions in other countries, Center for Democracy and Technology Vice President of Policy Samir Jain says their apparent use by Americans to sidestep domestic content restrictions feels “relatively new.” That sudden shift, Jain said, owes itself partly to the language of these new laws which would have previously struggled to stand up to legal scrutiny. Jain, whose organization <a target="_blank" href="https://cdt.org/insights/cdt-and-rights-groups-file-amicus-brief-in-texas-online-age-verification-case/">signed onto an amicus’s brief</a> calling on a court to block the Texas law, said he wasn’t surprised users from affected areas states appeared to be seeking out VPNs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you provide a government ID to prove you are in effect no longer anonymous,” Center for Democracy and Technology Vice President of Policy Samir Jain told <em>PopSci</em>. “If people no longer feel like they can do that [access information anonymously] that infringes on their First Amendment expression right.”</p>



<p>ExpressVPN Privacy Advocate Lauren Hendry Parsons echoed that sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We know that when legislators restrict consumer access to services like porn, citizens still find a way to access it,” Hendry Parsons told <em>PopSci. “</em>There is absolutely a middle ground to be found that leans on third-party cooperation instead of limiting consumer rights.”</p>



<h2 id="h-how-are-platforms-responding-to-the-new-laws"><strong>How are platforms responding to the new laws?</strong></h2>



<p>As of writing, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/14/porn-texas-shut-down/72976270007/">seven mostly Republican-led states</a> have passed some form of legislation relying on age-verification to prevent minors from accessing pornographic material. Nearly all of these so-called “age-gating” bills are copy-cat versions of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/05/1146933317/louisiana-new-porn-law-government-id-restriction-privacy">pioneering Louisiana legislation</a>, which passed in 2022 and took effect early last year. <em>The Verge</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/29/23849375/kosa-child-safety-free-speech-louisiana-utah-parental-consent">estimates</a> the Louisiana bill inspired at least 17 copycat bills, a handful of which are on their way to becoming laws. In Texas, sites found in violation of its law <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/leading-adult-entertainment-website-blocks-service-in-texas/">could face penalties of up to $10,000 per day</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some adult content sites like Pornhub have opted to block IP addresses originating from states with these new laws in order to avoid running afoul of the laws. Last month, internet users in Texas attempting to access the world’s largest purveyor of online adult video content were greeted instead with a 10 paragraph note from the company explaining its opposition to the state’s “ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous” law. Pornhub has similarly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/14/porn-texas-shut-down/72976270007/">restricted access to users from half a dozen other states </a>with similar age verification laws. In addition to wanting to steer clear of penalties, experts told <em>PopSci</em> platforms also oppose the laws because they don’t want to be responsible for collecting and maintaining torrents of sensitive users’ data that could pose a ripe target for cybercriminals.</p>



<p>“Age verification systems collect a huge amount of data, not only the personal information from each ID but also a record of each and every authentication made—essentially any site you access that features adult content,” Hendry Parsons said. “Combined with the data profiling social media companies create about their users, this treasure trove of personal information is a perfect target for bad actors.”</p>



<h2 id="h-rising-vpn-use-could-attract-new-lawmaker-scrutiny"><strong>Rising VPN use could attract new lawmaker scrutiny</strong></h2>



<p>US internet users are reportedly using VPNs to access non-porn related material as well. College students around the country are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/9/23864469/tiktok-college-campus-ban-students-vpn-data-instagram-reels">reportedly already using VPNs</a> to get around efforts from some universities to ban TikTok on campus networks. In Montana, where lawmakers passed a first-of-its kind statewide TikTok ban, creators have been preparing to similarly use the technology to stay connected to their followers. Lawmakers interested in restricting popular online content of various kinds will inevitably find themselves running into a VPN service willing to offer users an escape tunnel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a continued uptick in VPN to access blocked risks inviting unintended consequences. Internet users appearing to use VPNs to blatantly run afoul of new legislation could incentivize lawmakers to clamp down on the technology. Some of the anti-porn laws, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/05/utahs-porn-crackdown-has-vpn-problem/">like the one enacted in Utah</a>, already possess language explicitly prohibiting online platforms from letting minors “change or bypass restrictions on access.” Digital rights activists fear other recently proposed legislation aimed at limiting US user access to foreign apps may include provisions in it that would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3ddb/restrict-act-insanely-broad-ban-tiktok-vpns">criminalize the use of VPNs</a>.</p>



<p>Jain, from the Center for Democracy and Technology, acknowledged those concerns but said new laws banning criminalizing or restricting VPNs could do more harm than good and may face constitutional legal challenges. As for the new wave of laws appearing to fuel the rise in American VPN adoption, Jain said debates over one of those laws could eventually make its way up to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are a lot of legitimate reasons to use VPNs to protect your privacy and anonymity,” Jain said.</p>

Kudos. Wish I had even one such project in my long career but alas.</p><p>That being said, we should always qualify our statements. Your code likely never has to work in 100K+ requests per second conditions, and latency barely matters -- as long as people don't see 30s HTTP timeout canned pages then it's all good, right?</p><p>Many of us work on much more demanding stuff however, and there the programming stack actually makes very real and measurable difference on many axii -- programmer productivity, runtime resilience to bursts or just high loads, raw speed, easiness of deploying a hot fix, and others.</p><p>Again, you have my respect. Choosing boring / old tech is viable in many cases. But definitely not all. All our tools come with tradeoffs. You simply chose one whose negative tradeoffs will never manifest.

The techlead also didn't allow anyone to do this work because he feared people wouldn't be as attentive as him. I remember there was one time when it was 11 PM and he was still verifying the commits and the release managers had to wait and couldn't go home.<p>I wrote a script which finds new commits not present in the master branch and compares them to the corresponding issues in the issue tracker (each commit message has an issue ID as a rule so it's easy to find the connections), and then generates a nice report like "the release branch cannot be released as is because issue 1234 is not marked as ready by QA, while commit 3456 is not present in any of the listed feature branches and could be a result of an accidental merge".</p><p>After we started using this script, the time it took to verify release branches decreased to something like 10 minutes. The techlead finally decided to delegate this kind of check to other devs (not a bottleneck anymore).</p><p>The idea was then copied by all other teams (web devs, etc.) and the script is still in use today, with many more features than I originally envisioned.</p><p>That small silly script was probably my most useful contribution because it saved a lot of time for everyone.

Anyone can learn that too. It’s just "enhanced software development," there is nothing magical about it. We have a healthy mix of young and old people. There are more women than in other software companies. It’s fun and, in the end, we all want to do a good job.</p><p>My whole post may be scary but it’s not. It’s still a regular 9 to 5 job and, most of the time, there are healthy boundaries. I’m not working overtime until 2AM, I just organize myself and work better if I’m in a healthy environment, and the well-defined organization is better for my mental health.</p><p>As _HeyLaughingBoy_ said, we follow procedures because it’s the law. Most of the time it’s respected by bosses because they know that it can bite them in the ass should a problem happen. If something bad happens, I’m still not legally responsible though but I’ll feel guilty inside, that why it works too for the motivation but I don’t think about it every day, I do my job like a regular job. Also nothing bad ever happened because of my code, the real motivation is the good things that can happen.</p><p>You can make mistakes, but if someone is injured because of a bug, the whole company will have to figure out where the process was not followed properly. You still can be fired for various reasons, but I’m pretty sure that someone will notice that I fucked up before it is released.</p><p>The main procedure is called the "ISO 62304" and you may find the PDF on pirate sites if you want to see what it is about. Every medical software company tries to follow it because it is mandatory to get all the certifications. Some companies do take it more seriously by paying for training for the devs which is nice.</p><p>I interact with real QA people who take their job seriously. They will write Jira tickets for literally anything that is not precisely defined in the spec. Sometimes they will piss me off for small details but I can’t avoid it, they are part of the process and there is no negotiation.</p><p>We also have UX teams who define the best colors and placement of the buttons in the final product.</p><p>Most of my job is writing standard software, and nothing critical, but the work is the same. If you have a bug, it must be linked to a spec. Sometimes you have to find the spec, write it, or bother your boss until he finds the spec. Then you write the code and the test to cover that spec. A bug is never a simple bug, it’s a deviation from a previously defined feature, and fixing it needs you to interact with different teams as part of the whole process: Did it happen in production or not? Is there a spec? Where is the spec? Fix the bug, write the test, optionally make sure that it has code coverage, annoy the QA team to validate that it has been fixed, and make sure that you have documented your fix in all the web tools (docs, user manual, GitLab PR, Jira, QMS stuff…). The QA team may also write their own automated tests in addition to unit tests.</p><p>As an example, I recently had a meeting with my boss and the QA team because I was asked to fix an obvious bug that was not defined in a specification. It looked like a bug BUT if it’s not defined in a requested feature or spec, is it really a bug? Who decides that it’s a bug if the proper behavior is not documented?</p><p>I do actually enjoy writing docs, specs, and tests now. And this whole thing made me a better dev.</p><p>Everything is not perfect though. Some companies have bad managers, bad planning, deadlines, everything like a regular company, but I can be proud of the result even if it’s a small fix that took me days to make sure that everyone is happy.

These were daily or weekly activity reports for the platform I was expanding and supporting. When I joined, each report required custom coding and it took about two weeks to turn around.<p>I got bored of coding these reports. Bit by bit, I built a templating system and a configuration-based way of building these reports. Users were able to get reports not only in CSV files, but also in HTML, plaintext, and Excel files. They could get them not only by email, but also via FTP and SFTP. Reports could be customized in a variety of ways. Most importantly, with the new system, I could turn a report around in about five minutes.</p><p>When I joined there were less than 20 reports in the system. When I left, there were hundreds. Our internal users found these reports valuable, but the emotional cost of requesting and waiting for one was a burden. Removing this burden was a pleasure.</p><p>No one ever said that this needed to be done. It was an itch that got scratched.

I needed to restore a backup to fix a bug in the ASP 3.0 app.  Being a Windows server I right clicked on the DB, and hit delete.<p>A few minutes later my boss gets a call saying someone is having trouble accessing the server.  Turns out that single machine hosted staging and production.

Most of our students had struggled at some point in their lives, in a way that had impacted their learning. So they came to us with transcripts that were all over the place: for example some had finished all their math credits but had failed all their social studies classes. Many had earned partial credit in some areas.<p>This made academic advising difficult for a variety of reasons. One big reason was the fact that all transcripts were text based. To figure out where a student stood academically, you had to take a pen and mark up their transcript, totaling their credits in different areas, in order to see which graduation requirements they had met and which they still needed to fulfill.</p><p>I wrote a program that parsed every student's text-based transcript, and generated a visual transcript for each student. What used to take 15-30 minutes for each student now took about 30 seconds. You could look at one of these documents and see exactly where a student's strengths were, in what areas they had struggled, and most importantly what they still needed to do in order to graduate.</p><p>It wasn't just a time-saver. The main benefit was that those 15-30 minutes that used to be spent parsing a transcript, with fingers crossed that no one was making a mistake, were now spent focused on formulating a plan that students could buy into and feel confident about.</p><p>I wrote that tool during some inservice days where my very cooperative principal let me skip out on boring repetitive trainings to focus on building the tool. I was able to build something I could run in that time, but it would have taken a lot longer to build a general-purpose tool that they could run indefinitely after I left. I haven't looked in a while, but I <i>hope</i> that some of the companies that handle student records have built these kinds of tools into their software. There was some movement in that direction last time I checked.

Analog tv changed channels fast, because hopefully you got signal lock quickly, and then you can start decoding wherever you are on the screen, and when the next vblank comes, you're good. Tuning latency less than one field.<p>Digital TV tuning is slow because of compression; when you tune to a stream in progress, you usually can't meaningfully decode it until you receive a I-frame. But I-frames are bigger than motion predicted frames, so it makes sense to only ocassionally send I-frames. Latency: technically unbounded, usually a couple of seconds.</p><p>It potentially gets a bit worse if you're on a switched video cable system where your box has to request channels, as now there's a request / response delay. But it shouldn't be too long for local comms... And in theory, the head end could start the stream with an I-frame (otoh, it may not have the processing power to decode/encode).</p><p>In theory, a TV with multiple tuners could do predictive decoding to help with channel surfing, but I don't think anybody actually does that.

                  <p><span>I wonder if another solution would be for channels broadcast a subchannel which has more frequent i-frames, but lowered resolution and framerate to compensate for it in terms of overall bandwidth. When you surf, the TV could first hit up the subchannel, get the low-rez i-frame, and start showing a lower-quality version of the channel's video feed much faster, then start working on fetching and decoding the "real," full-resolution video feed and switch it over when it's ready. It still wouldn't be as fast and perfect as it was for analog and it'd require some industry collaboration and a bit of new hardware, but it still should be a more pleasant experience for people who just want to quickly see what's on.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I wrote this reusing code from another contract I did while still in secondary school, and I'm mentioning it thanks to a user named lush berry who wrote "literally the most helpful thing i ever found on the internet. it helps me memorize stuff even when i'm procrastinating which is amazing. however, i have a lot of suggestions, does anyone know how i can contact the makers of this extension?". I wish I had the time to listen to these users and make the changes they want.

It took like a minute or more to log in, navigate to the right place and copy and paste the right number.<p>I think the 30 minutes I spent to automate this was the best return on investment I ever reached, because the script was used for years by many people and did not only help to prevent us from penalties but must have saved a considerable amount of time over the years.

Rather than try to teach a bunch of crusty journalists what relative paths were, I just wrote a bit of code to fix those URLs for them. With the client's permission I later cleaned up and open-sourced that module.</p><p>At its peak it was installed on over 70,000 Drupal installations that we know of (not all of them reported usage data). It's still being developed, though by other developers in the last few years as I have lost interest (and client work) in Drupal, but I'm still quite proud of it, and I still love to hear from people who say it was a must-have for their sites and made their lives so much easier.</p><p><a href="https://drupal.org/project/pathologic" rel="nofollow">https://drupal.org/project/pathologic</a>

I suspect "none of the code I wrote during this time actually shipped, but the project was a success*" is a common story in the industry at this point?<p>* though my understanding is almost everyone on the project struggled to get promoted since it was behind schedule

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><h2>faces.js</h2><h3>A JavaScript library for generating vector-based cartoon faces</h3><p><i>To load new random faces, click here or press "r" on your keyboard.</i></p><p>faces.js is a JavaScript library that generates and displays cartoon faces, somewhat reminiscent of how the Nintendo Wii generates random Miis. Faces are drawn as scalable vector graphics (SVG). Each face can also be represented by a small JavaScript object, which allows you to store that object and then draw the same face again later.</p><p>As you can probably tell, the number of options for each facial feature (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.) is fairly limited, and some of the current options are fairly crude. So <b><a href="https://github.com/zengm-games/facesjs">fork it on GitHub</a></b> and add some new options!</p><h2>Usage</h2><p>1. Install from npm:</p><pre><code>$ npm install --save facesjs</code></pre><p>Or yarn:</p><pre><code>$ yarn add facesjs</code></pre><p>2. Display a randomly-generated face (the size of the <code>#my-div-id</code> div determines the size of the displayed face):</p><pre><code>import { display, generate } from "facesjs";

// Generate a random face
const face = generate();

// Display in a div with id "my-div-id"
display("my-div-id", face);
</code></pre><h2>More</h2><p>See all the available facial features in <a href="https://zengm.com/facesjs/editor.html">the faces.js editor</a>.</p><p>For more documentation and information (additional options, SVG export, CLI), <a href="https://github.com/zengm-games/facesjs">see the README on GitHub</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>
