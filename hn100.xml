<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This year, the YJIT team has been working hard to improve and optimize YJIT. We’re proud
to say that the version of YJIT to be included with Ruby 3.3 is leaps and bounds ahead
of Ruby 3.2’s. It provides better performance across the board, while also warming up faster
and using less memory. The 3.3 release is also more robust, including a number of
bug fixes along with an improved test suite. In this blog post, we share some early
numbers.</p>

<h2 id="yjit-33s-optimizations">YJIT 3.3’s Optimizations</h2>

<p>YJIT 3.3 includes several optimizations not present in 3.2. One of the main
differences, performance-wise, is that we have much better JIT coverage. That
is, there are much fewer situations where YJIT needs to fall back to the
interpreter. In particular, YJIT is now able to better handle calls with
splats as well as optional parameters, it’s able to compile exception
handlers, and it can handle megamorphic call sites and instance variable
accesses without falling back to the interpreter.</p>

<p>We’ve also implemented specialized inlined primitives for certain core
method calls such as <code>Integer#!=</code>, <code>String#!=</code>, <code>Kernel#block_given?</code>,
<code>Kernel#is_a?</code>, <code>Kernel#instance_of?</code>, <code>Module#===</code>, and more. It also inlines
trivial Ruby methods that only return a constant value such as <code>#blank?</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49909">specialized <code>#present?</code></a> from Rails.
These can now be used without needing to perform expensive method calls in
most cases.
Lastly, YJIT has a new register allocator which results in slightly
more efficient machine code.</p>

<p>In terms of reducing YJIT’s memory usage, this may be surprising to
some, but the bulk of the memory used by YJIT is not taken by generated
machine code, but rather by metadata YJIT uses to keep track of various
pieces of information associated with said generated code. As such, we’ve
spent a good amount of effort making multiple incremental improvements
to cut down the size of the metadata that we keep.</p>

<p>Another key piece in terms of memory usage has been the introduction of
a “cold threshold” heuristic. With this new heuristic, YJIT tries to cut
down on the amount of “cold”, rarely used method that get compiled. This
doesn’t make any difference on benchmarks, but it’s important for real-world
production scenarios, because there is often a long tail of rarely used
methods that get compiled, which keeps gradually increasing the size of
the generated machine code, sometimes even multiple days after code has
been deployed to production. With this heuristic, we’ve been able to cut
down the size of the generated machine code and its associated metadata
by about 20%. The key takeaway is, we’ve reduced memory usage not just by
using less memory per piece of compiled code, but also by compiling less
code in the first place.</p>

<p>Finally, this may or may not count as an optimization, but we’ve also
made some changes to try and ship YJIT with better defaults out of the
box. Following the 3.2 release, we’ve received feedback from multiple
production deployments that it was necessary to adjust the YJIT
configuration to change the memory size and call threshold values to
get better performance. With YJIT 3.3, we’ve set default values that
should work better for most production deployments. YJIT should now
automatically increase the call threshold for any deployments that
load more than a trivial amount of code, which should result in
a smoother warm-up.</p>

<h2 id="new-features-in-yjit-33">New Features in YJIT 3.3</h2>

<p>YJIT 3.3 doesn’t just include performance improvements. We’ve also added some
new features to make your life easier. One such feature is that it’s now possible
to enable YJIT at run-time from Ruby code by calling <code>RubyVM::YJIT.enable</code>. This
makes it possible to selectively enable YJIT on some forked processes without
enabling it on all processes. It also makes it
possible to only enable YJIT after your app is done booting, so that you can
completely avoid compiling initialization code. The next Rails release will
take advantage of this to
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49947">automatically enable YJIT</a> in an initializer.</p>

<p>We’ve also improved the way we collect run-time stats.
Prior to this, in order to collect performance statistics, you needed to
rebuild Ruby from source to produce a special stats build. Most end users found
this inconvenient, particularly in a production environment. Most of the stats
provided by <code>--yjit-stats</code> are now available in release builds. This will make
troubleshooting performance issues easier.
Please note here that we are talking about statistics for you to consult about
your programs. For security and privacy reasons, YJIT does not “phone home”.</p>

<p>Another recent addition is a new <code>--yjit-perf</code> command-line option which
enables profiling with Linux perf by setting up frame pointers for YJIT
frames and producing a perf map.
More details about new additions to YJIT and Ruby 3.3 are provided in
the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2023/12/11/ruby-3-3-0-rc1-released/">release notes</a> for Ruby 3.3.0-rc1.</p>

<h2 id="performance-on-benchmarks">Performance on benchmarks</h2>

<p>We’ve benchmarked YJIT using the headline benchmarks from the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench">yjit-bench</a> suite.
These are benchmarks based on real-world gems which aim to be representative of real-world use cases,
with a bias towards things that we believe represent typical web workloads.
The graph below shows a comparison of the performance of the Ruby 3.2 interpreter, Ruby 3.3 interpreter,
Ruby 3.2 + YJIT, and Ruby 3.3 + YJIT. The benchmarks were run on a Ryzen 7 3700X machine running Ubuntu Linux 22.04.
Higher is better, with bars being normalized to 1.0 for the performance
of the Ruby 3.2 interpreter. For these experiments, we used a bleeding edge commit directly from the Ruby/master
branch of the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">git repository</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/bars_speedup.png" alt="" width="95%"></p>

<p>As you can see, YJIT 3.3 delivers a performance boost over YJIT 3.2 on every benchmark,
and the difference is usually quite significant.
Notably, rendering liquid templates is now over 2.5x faster with YJIT enabled than it is using only the
Ruby 3.2 interpreter. Railsbench is about 65% faster with YJIT. We’ve turned the
<a href="https://railsatscale.com/2023-08-25-we-turned-lobsters-into-a-rails-benchmark-for-yjit/">lobste.rs</a> website
into a benchmark, which we can render over 50% faster with YJIT as well, and if you’re using the Ruby LSP
language server in your code editor, YJIT also provides a 50%+ performance boost there too.</p>

<h2 id="memory-usage-on-benchmarks">Memory usage on benchmarks</h2>

<p>JIT compilers typically come with a tradeoff, which is that to some extent, they’re trading slightly
increased memory usage for better performance. As outlined previously, we’ve done a lot to reduce
the amount of memory overhead YJIT incurs. The overhead is still nonzero, but it has been
much improved, to the extent that it’s no longer an issue for our production deployments
at Shopify.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/bars_memory.png" alt="" width="95%"></p>

<p>The graph above shows the memory usage on each of our benchmarks running with and without YJIT enabled for
both Ruby 3.2.2 and 3.3.0. The great news is that the memory usage for YJIT 3.3 is below that
of YJIT 3.2 on almost every benchmark. Part of this reduction in memory usage is due to the work the YJIT team put in to
use memory more effectively. YJIT executes a higher percentage of total YARV instructions than before,
it generates more machine code per Ruby method compiled, and manages to do this with less total overhead.</p>

<p>However, much of the credit for the reduced total memory usage goes to my colleagues
Peter Zhu and Matthew Valentine-House. They’ve done some great work on the Ruby Garbage Collector (GC)
to <a href="https://railsatscale.com/2023-08-08-two-garbage-collection-improvements-made-our-storefronts-8-faster/">improve its performance</a>
and reduce CRuby’s memory usage. You can see this in the above graphs too. It’s not just YJIT’s memory usage
that went down. The memory usage of the CRuby 3.3.0 interpreter is below that of the 3.2.2
interpreter for most benchmarks.</p>

<p>In the spirit of transparency, we note that in the graph above, there is an anomaly, which is that YJIT’s
memory overhead on the <code>hexapdf</code> benchmark is much higher than on other benchmarks. This is something
we’ve discovered as we were producing graphs for this blog post, and are currently investigating. As far
as we can tell so far, it seems to be an issue caused by glibc’s malloc not releasing memory to the
operating system often enough in the presence of <code>mmap</code> calls. Manually calling <code>malloc_trim(3)</code> or
using <code>jemalloc</code> seems to fix the issue.</p>

<h2 id="sfr-production-deployment">SFR Production Deployment</h2>

<p>YJIT has been deployed to all of Shopify’s StoreFront Renderer (SFR) infrastructure for all of 2023.
For context, SFR renders all Shopify storefronts, which is the first thing buyers see when they navigate
to a store hosted by Shopify. It is mostly written in Ruby, depends on over 220 Ruby gems, renders millions of
Shopify stores in over 175 countries, and is served by multiple clusters distributed worldwide.
We’ve deployed Ruby 3.2.2 and 3.3.0 (Ruby master) to experimental clusters (a subset of SFR servers) so
we could gather experimental data for this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="performance-yjit-33-vs-the-cruby-33-interpreter">Performance: YJIT 3.3 vs the CRuby 3.3 Interpreter</h3>

<p>The following graph is a snapshot from our dashboard comparing the performance of the Ruby 3.3.0 interpreter vs YJIT 3.3.0
over the last 12 hours. The speedup figures that we see tend to change over time depending on web traffic, but we believe
it’s representative of the kinds of speedups you can hope to get from YJIT 3.3.
The Y-axis shows the speedup YJIT provides compared to the interpreter. This is computed based on the
total end-to-end time needed to generate a response, including time the SFR servers spend doing I/O, waiting on
databases, and other operations YJIT cannot optimize.
As we can see, the amount of speed boost that YJIT provides over the interpreter changes depending on time of
day and web traffic, but YJIT is consistently faster than the interpreter on average, even on the p99 slowest
requests. This is great, because speeding up the slowest requests makes the most difference to user experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/sfr_interp_33_vs_yjit.png" alt="" width="95%"></p>

<p>YJIT 3.3 is generally quite a bit faster than YJIT 3.2 on average. The difference is especially marked on the p99
slowest requests. This is likely because of targeted optimizations made to reduce the time YJIT takes to generate
code, as well as the addition of a “cold threshold” heuristic to reduce the
long tail of code that YJIT compiles. That is, YJIT 3.3 is more selective about which Ruby code it optimizes.</p>

<h3 id="memory-usage-yjit-33-vs-the-cruby-33-interpreter">Memory usage: YJIT 3.3 vs the CRuby 3.3 Interpreter</h3>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/sfr_mem_yjit33_interp.png" alt="" width="75%"></p>

<p>The graph above shows the RSS (Resident Set Size) and PSS (Proportional Set Size) of processes running YJIT
3.3 vs the CRuby 3.3 interpreter over the last 12 hours. When looking at the PSS, which takes into consideration
memory shared between multiple server processes with Unicorn, the memory overhead of enabling YJIT is
currently below 8% for our SFR deployment, which we deem to be a good memory vs performance tradeoff.</p>

<h2 id="optcarrot-and-ruby3x3">Optcarrot and Ruby3x3</h2>

<p>At RubyConf 2015, Yukihiro Matsumoto (aka Matz), chief designer of the Ruby programming language,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE0g2TUsJ4U&amp;t=3248s">announced Ruby3x3</a>, the goal of making Ruby 3
three times faster than Ruby 2. He compared this objective to John F. Kennedy’s goal of landing
humans on the moon within the decade. Despite the lack of concrete plans to achieve this, Matz
stated that a JIT compiler may be useful in achieving his inspiring objective.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mame/optcarrot">optcarrot benchmark</a> is not one that we look at often at Shopify, because
we don’t consider it to be representative of web workloads, or the workloads that the majority of Ruby users
typically run. This benchmark is a NES emulator. It implements its own interpreter loop, and contains multiple
large methods that perform a lot of bitwise arithmetic, which is something that is almost nonexistent in web
software. However, NES emulators will always be cool, and as self-respecting programmers, we have a moral
duty to ensure that Ruby can make them run fast, akin to the hippocratic oath sworn by doctors.</p>

<p>In December of 2020, Takashi Kokubun’s MJIT achieved <a href="https://k0kubun.medium.com/ruby-3-0-jit-and-beyond-4d9404ce33c">a significant milestone</a> by showing that it could run <code>optcarrot</code>
more than 3 times faster than Ruby 2.0, thereby achieving the Ruby3x3 goal (as long as you accept
performance on <code>optcarrot</code> to be a representative metric of Ruby’s performance).
Today, with the imminent release of YJIT 3.3, we can proudly say that Ruby 3.3 is over 3.3 times
faster than the CRuby 3.3 interpreter on this benchmark, thereby hitting a new major milestone, which
we have coined post-hoc as Ruby3.3x3.3.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/bars_optcarrot.png" alt="" width="95%"></p>

<p>As can be seen in the graph above, performance on <code>optcarrot</code> has gone up markedly with every new
YJIT release. According to stats produced by <code>--yjit-stats</code>, YJIT now executes more
than 99.1% of the instructions in this benchmark, and is also able to inline 79.9% of C function calls,
most of which are calls to Ruby runtime functions which YJIT is able to optimize. We hope to be able
to deliver even better performance for Ruby NES emulators next year.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Ruby 3.3.0 release will be available for you to download <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">on ruby-lang.org</a>
on December 25th. In the mean time, if you’re feeling really impatient to play with Ruby 3.3, you can find the latest
release candidate along with its release notes on the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/">Ruby releases page</a>.
With this release comes a much more capable version of YJIT, with multiple major improvements. The bottom line is that YJIT
performs better, while using memory more efficiently and warming up faster.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning more about YJIT, we’ve published a paper at the MPLR 2023 conference, which is now freely available
through <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617651.3622982">ACM open access</a>. A video recording of our presentation at MPLR is also
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMGuQXNqlaE&amp;t=9900s">available on YouTube</a>.
There are also multiple presentations about YJIT available on YouTube, ranging from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0JRhh8w_4I">very approachable</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMchdR9C8XM">deeply technical</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’d like to give a big thanks to Shopify, Ruby &amp; Rails Infrastructure and the YJIT team for making this project possible.
Thank you Aaron Patterson for helping me put together this blog post.
A special shout out goes to Alan Wu and Takashi Kokubun. Two incredibly talented programmers that I have the privilege to work
with on the YJIT project. They’ve worked tirelessly to make the Ruby 3.3 release as performant and stable as possible.
If you’re using YJIT in production, please give us a shout out on Twitter/X. It’s always very rewarding for us to hear about
YJIT being deployed in the wild!</p>

      <p><em>The “forever chemicals” found in the Cape Fear River were detected through a non-targeted testing method developed at UNC-Chapel Hill that broadens researchers’ abilities to identify the hazardous compounds.</em></p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/comptox-chemicals-dashboard">keeps a list</a> of more than 14,000 known or potential per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Called “forever chemicals” for how long the molecules take to break down, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-explained">PFAS can be found</a> just about everywhere, and have been <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html">linked to health issues</a> like cancer and infertility.</p>
<p>PFAS are potentially hazardous to people and animals, so detecting them is vital. That’s why <a href="https://chem.unc.edu/faculty/baker-erin/">Erin Baker</a>, associate professor of chemistry within the UNC College of Arts and Sciences, and her lab are expanding testing methods to find them — efforts that were recently published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adj7048"><em>Science Advances</em></a>.</p>
<p>Researchers collaborating with Baker’s lab collected samples from North Carolina’s Cape Fear River in 2016. Using this new detection method, they tested the samples and found 47 different PFAS. Of those, 11 had not been previously detected in the river, and eight had not been detected anywhere outside of a lab.</p>
<p>“Eight of them weren’t on the EPA’s list of PFAS, which makes us think there are many more PFAS than we previously thought,” Baker says.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding the search</strong></p>
<p>For years, PFAS contaminants like GenX have been found in drinking water originating from the Cape Fear River, making it an ideal testing site for Baker and her team. Some of <a href="https://capefearriverwatch.org/genx/">this pollution has been directly linked</a> to production at the Chemours Fayetteville Works site, where chemicals are manufactured. Surrounding residents rely on testing conducted by scientists to understand what types of compounds they are being exposed to.</p>
<p>“Current testing methods used by the EPA can only find the PFAS that we already know exist,” Baker says. “That means we have to rely on chemical companies to provide a list of what they manufacture and hope those samples are comprehensive.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_127078"><a href="https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000.jpg" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1703905077" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="127075"><img decoding="async" src="https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000-296x300.jpg" alt="The structures of 11 different molecules." width="296" height="300" srcset="https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000-296x300.jpg 296w, https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000-768x780.jpg 768w, https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000-64x64.jpg 64w, https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px"></a><figcaption>Researchers mapped out the structures of the 11 new molecules they found in the Cape Fear River. The underlined compounds represent the eight PFAS that were unknown to the EPA.</figcaption></figure>
<p>PFAS are commonly detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, a method that looks at the mass, charge, and polarity of ions — positively or negatively charged molecules. The EPA uses targeted mass spectrometry, which requires matching PFAS found in people or the environment with “standards” — PFAS chemicals created in a lab for testing purposes. It’s like combing through a word search puzzle and only being able to search for a specific set of words. Baker’s lab has developed a non-targeted approach, which allows them to search for any word in a puzzle.</p>
<p>“There are so many known PFAS that standards don’t exist for many of them,” says Kaylie Kirkwood-Donelson, who led the study when she was an NC State University PhD student in Baker’s lab. “Having a non-targeted approach lets us have an open-ended search for known and unknown compounds.”</p>
<p>The non-targeted approach uses <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832852/">ion mobility spectrometry</a> (IMS) to look at how ions move. To do this, ions are placed in gas and an electric field is added. The electric field causes the ions to move differently based on their individual charges. An ion’s size and shape affect the speed at which it moves through the gas, with larger ions moving slower than smaller ones. Information on an ion’s size and shape provides more insight into the structure of the molecule. And in this case, can help researchers determine if a molecule could be considered PFAS.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing the results</strong></p>
<p>As researchers investigate PFAS in the Cape Fear River, the number of known chemicals present in the water continues to grow. More testing is needed to understand the quantities and how toxic they are to people and animals.</p>
<p>“It’s also very important to expand non-targeted testing for PFAS,” says Kirkwood-Donelson, who is now a chemist for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “Even in this study, there were still some molecules that we could not figure out the chemical structures for, so we believe there are more PFAS in the Cape Fear River to be discovered.”</p>
<p>Baker’s lab is working to streamline their non-targeted testing process to make it more efficient. The technology and equipment needed to conduct ion mobility spectrometry is expensive, but more PFAS-focused labs are getting the special tools needed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Baker’s lab will keep testing samples from the Cape Fear River. They are currently comparing some collected before and after environmental regulations were <a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/news/key-issues/genx-investigation/chemours-consent-order">enacted by the state in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Their work is getting attention from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/27/chemours-forever-chemicals-pfas-north-carolina-water-pollution">news</a> and <a href="https://popsci.com/environment/news-pfas-chemours-north-carolina/">science</a> outlets, and <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article282184358.html">the United Nations has even weighed in</a> on the issue, issuing letters to Chemours, the U.S. government, and other involved parties stating “serious concern regarding human rights and environmental impacts.” Baker hopes this attention will inspire more investigation by scientists and regulation from government agencies.</p>
<p>“If industries create molecules that they don’t tell the public about, and we only test for the molecules they do tell us about, we could be missing things,” says Baker. “We need to use non-targeted testing to have more information on what our communities are being exposed to.”</p>

          <p>We’re Fly.io, and if you’ve been following us awhile you probably just did a double-take. We’re building a new public cloud that runs containerized applications with virtual machine isolation on our own hardware around the world. And we’ve been doing it without any K8s. Until now!</p>
<p>We’ll own it: we’ve been snarky about Kubernetes. We are, at heart, old-school Unix nerds. We’re still scandalized by <code>systemd</code>.</p>

<p>To make matters more complicated, the problems we’re working on <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/">have a lot of overlap with K8s</a>, but <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/#numad">just enough impedance mismatch</a> that it (<a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">or anything that looks like it</a>) is a bad fit for our own platform.</p>

<p>But, come on: you never took us too seriously about K8s, right? K8s is hard for us to use, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great fit for what you’re building. We’ve been clear about that all along, right? Sure we have!</p>

<p>Well, good news, everybody! If K8s is important for your project, and that’s all that’s been holding you back from <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">trying out Fly.io</a>, we’ve spent the past several months building something for you.</p>
<h2 id="fly-io-for-kubernetians"><a href="#fly-io-for-kubernetians" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Fly.io For Kubernetians</h2>
<p>Fly.io works by transmogrifying Docker containers into filesystems for <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">lightweight hypervisors</a>, and running them on servers we rack in dozens of regions around the world.</p>

<p>You can build something like Fly.io with “standard” orchestration tools like K8s. In fact, that’s what we did to start, too. To keep things simple, we used Nomad, and instead of K8s CNIs, we built our own Rust-based TLS-terminating Anycast proxy (and designed a WireGuard/IPv6-based private network system <a href="https://fly.io/blog/bpf-xdp-packet-filters-and-udp/">based on eBPF</a>). But the ideas are the same.</p>

<p>The way we look at it, the signature feature of a “standard” orchestrator is the global scheduler: the global eye in the sky that keeps track of vacancies on servers and optimized placement of new workloads. That’s the problem we ran into. We’re running over 200,000 applications, and we’re doing so on every continent except Antarctica. The speed of light (and a globally distributed network of backhoes) has something to say about keeping a perfectly consistent global picture of hundreds of thousands of applications, and it’s not pleasant.</p>

<p>The other problem we ran into is that our Nomad scheduler kept trying to outsmart us, and, worse, our customers. It turns out that our users have pretty firm ideas of where they’d like their apps to run. If they ask for São Paulo, they want São Paulo, not Rio. But global schedulers have other priorities, like optimally bin-packing resources, and sometimes <code>GIG</code> looks just as good as <code>GRU</code> to them.</p>

<p>To escape the scaling and DX problems we were hitting, we rethought orchestration. Where orchestrators like K8s tend to work through distributed consensus, we keep state local to workers. Each racked server in our fleet is a source of truth about the apps running on it, and provide an API to a market-style “scheduler” that bids on resources in regions. <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/#numad">You can read more about here, if you’re interested.</a> We call this system the <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines API.</a></p>

<p>An important detail to grok about how this all works –&nbsp;a reason we haven’t, like, beaten the CAP theorem by doing this – is that Fly Machines API calls can fail. If Nomad or K8s tries to place a workload on some server, only to find out that it’s filled up or thrown a rod, it will go hunt around for some other place to put it, like a good little robot. The Machines API won’t do this. It’ll just fail the request. In fact, it goes out of its way to fail the request quickly, to deliver feedback; if we can’t schedule work in <code>JNB</code> right now, you might want instead to quickly deploy to <code>BOM</code>.</p>
<h2 id="pluggable-orchestration-and-fks"><a href="#pluggable-orchestration-and-fks" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Pluggable Orchestration and FKS</h2>
<p>In a real sense what we’ve done here is extract a chunk of the scheduling problem out of our orchestrator, and handed it off to other components. For most of our users, that component is <a href="https://github.com/superfly/flyctl"><code>flyctl</code>, our intrepid CLI</a>.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/working-with-machines/">Fly Machines is an API</a>, and anything can drive it. A lot of our users want quick answers to requests to schedule apps in specific regions, and <code>flyctl</code> does a fine job of that. But it’s totally reasonable to want something that works more like the good little robots inside of K8s.</p>

<p>You can build your own orchestrator with our API, but if what you’re looking for is literally Kubernetes, we’ve saved you the trouble. It’s called Fly Kubernetes, or FKS for short.</p>

<p>FKS is an implementation of Kubernetes that runs on top of Fly.io. You start it up using <code>flyctl</code>, by running <code>flyctl ext k8s create</code>.</p>

<p>Under the hood, FKS is a straightforward combination of two well-known Kubernetes projects: <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s, the lightweight CNCF-certified K8s distro</a>, and <a href="https://virtual-kubelet.io/">Virtual Kubelet</a>.</p>

<p>Virtual Kubelet is interesting. In K8s-land, a <code>kubelet</code> is a host agent; it’s the thing that runs on every server in your fleet that knows how to run a K8s Pod. Virtual Kubelet isn’t a host agent; it’s a software component that pretends to be a host, registering itself with K8s as if it was one, but then sneakily proxying the Kubelet API elsewhere.</p>

<p>In FKS, “elsewhere” is <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines</a>. All we have to do is satisfy various APIs that virtual kubelet exposes. For example, the API for the lifecycle of a pod:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code>type PodLifecycleHandler interface {
    CreatePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error
    UpdatePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error
    DeletePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error
    GetPod(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) (*corev1.Pod, error)
    GetPodStatus(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) (*corev1.PodStatus, error)
    GetPods(context.Context) ([]*corev1.Pod, error)
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This interface is easy to map to the Fly Machines API. For example:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code>CreatePod -&gt; POST /apps/{app_name}/machines
UpdatePod -&gt; POST /apps/{app_name}/machines/{machine_id}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>K3s, meanwhile, is a stripped-down implementation of all of K8s that fits into a single binary. K3s does a bunch of clever things to be as streamlined as it is, but the most notable of them is <a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/kine">kine, an API shim that switches <code>etcd</code> out with databases like SQLite</a>. Because of <code>kine</code>, K3s can manage multiple servers, but also gracefully runs on a single server, without distributed state.</p>

<p>So that’s what we do. When you create a cluster, we run K3s and the Virtual Kubelet on a single Fly Machine. We compile a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/">kubeconfig</a>, with which you can talk to your K3s via <code>kubectl</code>. We set the whole thing up to run Pods on individual Fly Machines, so your cluster scales out directly using our platform, but with K8s tooling.</p>

<p>One thing we like about this design is how much of the lifting is already done for us by the underlying platform. If you’re a K8s person, take a second to think of all the different components you’re dealing with: <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>, specifically provisioned nodes, the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/">kube-proxy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel">a CNI </a>binary and configuration and its integration with the host network, containerd, registries. But Fly.io already does most of those things. So this project was mostly chipping away components until we found the bare minumum: CoreDNS, SQLite persistence, and Virtual Kubelet.</p>

<p>We ended up with something significantly simpler than K3s, which is saying something.</p>

<p>Fly Kubernetes has some advantages over plain <code>flyctl</code> and <code>fly.toml</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your deployment is more declarative than it is with the <code>fly.toml</code> file. You declare the exact state of everything down to replica counts, autoscaling rules, volume definitions, and more.
</li><li>When you deploy with Fly Kubernetes, Kubernetes will automatically make your definitions match the state of the world. Machines go down? Kubernetes will whack them back online.
</li></ul>

<p>This is a different way to do orchestration and scheduling on Fly.io. It’s not what everyone is going to want. But if you want it, you really want it, and we’re psyched to give it to you: Fly.io’s platform features, with Kubernetes handling configuration and driving your system to its desired state.</p>

<p>We’ve kept things simple to start with. There are K8s use cases we’re a strong fit for today, and others we’ll get better at in the near future, as K8s users drive the underlying platform (and particularly our proxy) forward.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-all-means"><a href="#what-it-all-means" aria-label="Anchor"></a>What It All Means</h2>
<p>One obvious thing it means is that you’ve got an investment in Kubernetes tooling, you can keep it while running things on top of Fly.io. So that’s pretty neat. Buy our cereal!</p>

<p>But the computer science story is interesting, too. We placed a bet on an idiosyncratic strategy for doing global orchestration. We replaced global consensus, which is how Borg, Kubernetes, and Nomad all work, with a market-based system. That system was faster and, importantly, dumber than the consensus system it replaced.</p>

<p>This had costs! Nomad’s global consensus would do truly heroic amounts of work to make sure Fly Apps got scheduled somewhere, anywhere. Like a good capitalist, Fly Machines will tell you in no uncertain terms how much work it’s willing to do for you (“less than a Nomad”).</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean you’re stuck with the answers Fly Machines gives by itself. Because Fly Machines is so simple, and tries so hard to be predictable, we hoped you’d be able to build more sophisticated scheduling and orchestration schemes on top of it. And here you go: Kubernetes scheduling, as a plugin to the platform.</p>

<p>More to come! We’re itching to see just how many different ways this bet might pay off. Or: we’ll perish in flames! Either way, it’ll be fun to watch.</p>

The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day and one CPU to derive high quality 300-dimensional vectors for one million vocabulary from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring various types of word similarities.

<p>In the photo, a man kneels in an outdoor sawmill next to his painstaking work: An intricate wooden carving of his bulldog, which he proudly gazes at. “Made it with my own hands,” the Facebook caption reads. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1035803147752348&amp;set=pb.100039680180374.-2207520000&amp;type=3" rel="noreferrer">The image has</a> 1,300 likes, 405 comments, and 47 shares. “Beautiful work of art,” one of the comments reads. “You have an AMAZING talent!,” another says. “Nice work, love it &lt;3!” “Awesome work keep it up.”&nbsp;  </p><p>This incredible work of art, a “wooden monument to my dog,” has been posted dozens of times across dozens of engagement bait Facebook pages. But every time, the man and the dog are different. Sometimes the dog is hyperrealistic. Sometimes the bulldog is a German Shepherd. Sometimes the man’s hair is slicked back, sometimes it stands up. Sometimes the man sits on the other side of the dog. Sometimes the man looks Latino, other times he looks white; clearly, it is a different man, and a different dog, in most of the images.&nbsp;</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.02-PM.png" width="1212" height="1598" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.02-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.02-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.02-PM.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.09-PM.png" width="1258" height="1592" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.09-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.09-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.09-PM.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.46-PM.png" width="1198" height="1572" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.46-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.46-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.46-PM.png 1198w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.55-PM.png" width="1212" height="1602" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.55-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.55-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.55-PM.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.07-PM.png" width="1204" height="1602" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.07-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.07-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.07-PM.png 1204w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.14-PM.png" width="1210" height="1602" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.14-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.14-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.14-PM.png 1210w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.08.08-PM.png" width="1512" height="1588" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.08.08-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.08.08-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.08.08-PM.png 1512w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption><p><span>All of these images are AI-generated, and stolen from an artist named Michael Jones.</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/w3sJofxBvHvAutTY7HpJM3-cplRD7pW70YmFrtRaAyZRHxKHjmmksQLwqoKi5QpvJvxCAP83N6CouI8BBIEx6eptOd79LvA-qAsLuY6yMlMHqzCA_KLvZcMWcote_Hhkj-32YVy8hDAHI7YSj6M8SLg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="359"><figcaption><span>One of the images has more than a million likes.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Depending on the image, it is obvious, to me, that the man and the dog are not real. The dog often looks weirdly polygonal, or like some wood carving filter has been applied to an image of a real dog. Sometimes the dog’s ear has obvious artifacts associated with AI-generated images. Other times, it’s the man who looks fake. Variations of this picture are being posted all over Facebook by a series of gigantic meme pages with names like “Go Story,” “Amazing World,” “Did you know?” “Follow me,” “Avokaddo,” and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Universally, the comment sections of these pages feature hundreds of people who have no idea that these are AI-generated and are truly inspired by the dog carving. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1035803147752348&amp;set=pb.100039680180374.-2207520000&amp;type=3" rel="noreferrer">A version of this image posted on Dogs 4 life has 1 million likes</a>, 39,000 comments, and 17,000 shares. The Dogs 4 life account has spammed links to buy cheap, dog-branded stuff to the top of the comments section.&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways, this is a tale as old as time: people lie and steal content online in exchange for likes, influence and money all the time. But the spread of this type of content on Facebook over the last several months has shown that the once-prophesized future where cheap, AI-generated trash content floods out the hard work of real humans is already here, and is already taking over Facebook. It also shows Facebook is doing essentially nothing to help its users decipher real content from AI-generated content masquerading as real content, and that huge masses of Facebook users are completely unprepared for our AI-generated future.&nbsp;</p><p>The dog and the carving were real, at one point. The real German Shepherd carving was made by a UK-based <a href="https://www.michaeljonescs.com/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">professional chainsaw sculptor</a> named Michael Jones, who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1011303903567784&amp;set=pb.100040645523359.-2207520000"><u>detailed his work</u></a> in a series of videos and photos posted over the course of the summer. Jones’ work has since been stolen and turned into endless variations. Those images are then turned into endless inspiration bait by spammy Facebook pages that are presumably looking to monetize the stolen work of artists like Jones.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/70hfTrA3I1ZBGEmSzOB7lStDrWzj86fgC564mNmbkMInm0zCFdZmG3MDJ85HvoSNFJimt_W3adI2rLUDnDLcT7DPo-cCuD09WOwbBi4PzpEsm602vHWm0MlLN2BzcV7-e84CvoU-VuEf36QboOfskLo" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="345"><figcaption><span>Jones' real carving</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.12.29-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1056" height="1344" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.12.29-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.12.29-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.12.29-PM.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Another of Jones' real carvings</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.13.34-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1326" height="1344" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.13.34-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.13.34-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.13.34-PM.png 1326w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Another of Jones' real carvings</span></figcaption></figure><p>“This is something that is a huge issue for us and other carvers all over the world who are sadly missing out on the rightful credit exposure to their work,” Jones told me, “as well as setting unrealistic expectations when it comes to creating chainsaw carving art or any art for that matter!”</p><p>The strategy relies on “image-to-image” generative AI, which takes an input image and generates a new one based on that input. “Every time you generate an image, you get something completely different because it’s randomly seeded, and [the model] is looking for semantic consistency,” Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in AI disinformation and deepfakes, told me. Different generators let a user select the “strength” of the new image, which is a number between zero and one “where zero essentially means ‘ignore this image,’ and one says ‘give me this image exactly back,’” Farid said.&nbsp;</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-18-at-6.16.27-AM.png" width="564" height="1236" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screen-Shot-2023-12-18-at-6.16.37-AM.png" width="554" height="1152" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></div><figcaption><p><span>A very standard comment section on one of these images.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>I learned about the dog carvings from Brian Penny, a freelance ghostwriter, who shared Jones’s original image and copies of it on Threads.&nbsp;</p><p>“All these people are engagement farming off really shitty versions of his work and it’s giving his art a bad name,” Penny told me. “He’s having to compete against these versions of his work and it could easily destroy his business.”&nbsp;</p><p>Penny told me that a group of AI enthusiasts, skeptics, researchers, and interested parties had been researching and documenting the fact that stolen, AI-generated clones of viral images are taking over Facebook with impunity, where unaware boomers click “like,” “share,” and say things like “wow, incredible,” all day every day.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="%E2%80%9Cstop-the-exploitation-of-ai-generated-children%E2%80%9D"><strong>“STOP THE EXPLOITATION OF AI-GENERATED CHILDREN”</strong></h3><p>Penny invited me to the Facebook group “Um, isn’t that AI?,” which has 2,700 members documenting Facebook posts containing obviously AI-generated content that is going viral on Facebook (and which are also designed to trick users into thinking they are real). The first thing I saw when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=306337185700005&amp;set=a.106940565639669"><u>I joined was this image</u></a>, posted on a page called “Happy day,” which has 261 likes and 71 comments like “This is really beautiful.

If you look slightly more closely, you will see two impossibly tiny fake children playing in the dirt.</p><p>The next image I saw was this meme, which made me laugh: “STOP THE EXPLOITATION OF A.I. GENERATED CHILDREN!,” it reads. “Little Juan is forced to carve wooden dogs for FACEBOOK SCAMMERS, and they won’t even share the ‘likes’ with him. By commenting on this page you are contributing to the ongoing abuse of millions of artificially generated children from all over the world, or you could just be a target for future scams. LEARN TO RECOGNIZE AI GENERATED IMAGERY.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.18.42-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="812" height="1652" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.18.42-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.18.42-PM.png 812w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Jason Weiesenbach, the creator of the meme, posted that commenters on AI-generated images “are literally praising—in a religious sense—non-reality … imagine if instead of trying to sell someone an adoption certificate for an AI generated monkey, they started feeding these folks fake news articles, complete with artificially generated photographic evidence, or go to their photos grab a random picture of their grandchild, put into an artificially generated hostage situation, and then uses that to scam them out of their life savings. These are not far-fetched ideas, that's literally the extreme side where this is headed. My point is these people are not ready for the world that is coming.”</p><p>Um, isn’t that AI? grew out of Facebook groups dedicated to Midjourney and other AI image generators. Penny and others in that group, including Um, isn’t that AI? founder Molly Huxley began to notice that images originally posted as AI-generated art were being posted elsewhere on Facebook as though they were real images.</p><p>“People would take the AI images and post them elsewhere as if they were real, and commenters thought they were real,” Penny told me. “Molly started the group and it was originally people from the AI art community who thought it was funny and weird that people were believing this shit, and it grew from there.”&nbsp;</p><p>The group has noticed that many of the “remixes” are posted by the same set of 10 or 15 engagement bait Facebook pages. They often repost the same images or versions of the same images and themes over and over again. There’s “Bread House Man,” “Victoria’s Art,” “Jesus in a Nut Tree, “Sand Castle Kid,” and dozens of other variations of images that get posted over and over again.

I discovered the majority of them were created from an actual artist’s original work, rather than a text based prompt so I became interested in finding the originals. It is frustrating me that so many mindless ‘wows!’ get spewed out over a fake copy of a real artist’s work,” Hall said. “Basically I will choose an image to research. Then hit up my list of fb pages and search through their back catalog to find all the renditions, I paste the information into a Google Sheet as I go then I can sort by date to see how the image has developed and morphed. Often they will have used a stolen original back at the start of things which can be searched back to find the source. I still am not sure why they do it.”</p><p>Hall has made similar spreadsheets for “<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o2VB8VKpwBl4o691UnpjD2tFW3Iv1a8xTi2-UkXlcN0/edit?fbclid=IwAR1Aij_oV8BKc1S3MhIwVnlJjBYCQUru18lOpFyiqE1OyQygqkKyOrfFAIg&amp;ref=404media.co#gid=0"><u>Leaping Horse</u></a>,” (stolen <a href="https://eqliving.com/the-carving-of-cowboy-casanova-the-work-of-sculptor-brandon-wilson/?ref=404media.co"><u>from an artist named Brandon Wilson</u></a>), “<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nptQ_3Or43_zBmyiYn8HyXhiP5fOog3_xJyBp-DcGks/edit?fbclid=IwAR2B7_WL4Nudbp-WcxdoYLYbnzW_ISJ2rJbizzYJM-9TL9IfZhXwSSkMaMM&amp;ref=404media.co#gid=0"><u>Man/boy with a wooden owl</u></a>,” (original unknown), “<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Jt4IzgEb-ybT537Ysib921EBCFQngguO2_x3Vohzj8/edit?fbclid=IwAR39_Ut3PhPxJ2zv8hFvdL0trfPaSlMKUA8AU-GW45YeHigxbSZdUCPJdpA&amp;ref=404media.co#gid=0"><u>sand sculpting masters</u></a>,” (stolen from an Indian teenager whose name on Facebook is <a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/sculpture-was-created-indian-artist-sand-not-clay?ref=404media.co"><u>Sn Art Sadananda</u></a>), and “<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Yvp2wIfbM7vYKQnPWI4H4XqUEaUPEuKd21bKnu7rik/edit?fbclid=IwAR3q0TBf24og6ElNFrpjyO6onRh40RHyN5lo3Th6yIh7Ga4ajiLLLKVo9AA&amp;ref=404media.co#gid=0"><u>Jesus in a Nut Tree</u></a>” (artist unknown).

Hall already had a few candidates. I did some additional reverse image searching and found a screenshot of a VKontakte post featuring the image, from 2021, with the caption “Я молодая художница Виктория. Написала свою первую картину,” which translates to “I am a young artist Victoria.

She sent me a series of real photographs of people that had been used as a “seed” image for future AI clones that she’s been tracking for months.</p><p>“I am finding the source image of so much of this stuff. I wonder if the owners of this page are the same group, but have moved on to generating the AI, or if the AI groups are just using this page as a source,” she said. “This page you found is pure gold.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What seems to be happening is that some of the new Facebook pages sharing these AI-generated clones are pulling from old meme pages, which themselves had previously just reposted stuff that went viral on Reddit, Tumblr, or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>We weren’t able to find the actual “Victoria,” or the Bread House Man, but we were at least able to peel back another layer of the onion. No one operating any of the Facebook pages responded to messages for comment. Hall’s theory, a common one in the Um, isn’t That AI? Group is that some of these larger groups will sell their accounts once they’ve amassed large numbers of followers, pivot to political disinformation, or try to monetize what they’re doing. A few of them have begun posting links to sites outside of Facebook, while others add links to online stores in the comment sections of their posts once an image has gone viral. The fact that all of these pages are stealing the work of artists upsets Hall: “Often I feel like I am just shouting my observations into a raging storm and no one hears,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="artificial-realities"><strong>ARTIFICIAL REALITIES</strong></h3><p>Of all of the awful things <a href="https://www.404media.co/a16z-funded-ai-platform-generated-images-that-could-be-categorized-as-child-pornography-leaked-documents-show/"><u>we’ve seen artificial intelligence used for</u></a>, engagement baiting with stolen content on Facebook is relatively tame. And yet, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of wonder and dread while reporting this story. Every time I started researching the origins of a new stolen image, I would click through dozens and dozens of stolen versions of it.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no polite way to say this, but the comments sections of each of these images are filled with unaware people posting inane encouragement about artwork stolen by robots, a completely constructed reality where thousands of talented AI woodcarvers constantly turn pixels into fucked up German Shepherds for their likes and faves. I tried to determine if the commenters, too, were bots. The vast majority of them clearly are not. Most commenters I looked into are people who have been judiciously posting family photos, political arguments, and status updates on Facebook for decades.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-7.17.48-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="918" height="1424" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-7.17.48-AM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-7.17.48-AM.png 918w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Both Penny and Farid made the same observation I did. Farid said that, currently, “when I look at the harms being perpetrated from generative AI from nonconsensual imagery, child sexual abuse, fraud, and disinformation, this isn’t even on the bottom of the list. Somebody’s posting a photo, real people like it—it’s Facebook, who cares, right?”&nbsp;</p><p>But he added that this AI dreck isn’t <em>good </em>and that in the long term we could see some bad consequences grow out of the rapid spamming of AI-generated crap. Farid published a study on “nepotistic” AI, where generative AI tools are trained on <em>other</em> AI-generated outputs, creating highly-distorted images: “Once poisoned, the models struggle to fully heal even after retraining on only real images,” his study found. “The slightly less kind word is inbreeding, which we didn’t feel we could use in a scientific paper,” Farid said.&nbsp;</p><p>The other big problem is that, while more digitally literate people can tell that these are AI-generated images <em>now</em>, the technology is advancing so quickly that the typical artifacting and deformities seen in AI-generated images today could be gone tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>“The images [being generated] are more and more photorealistic,” Farid said. “So we really are entering this era where you can just type and get a hyper photorealistic image. And if it's not true today will eventually be true that it will be devoid of obvious visual artifacts that the average person looking at would be able to discriminate.”</p><p>“There’s something to be said for the fact that our ability to discriminate reality from fiction is important for a functioning society and democracy,” he added. “If every time you see a photo, you think it’s real because it’s a photo, that has consequences beyond the silliness we’re seeing here.”</p><p>Penny said he thinks that studying these images might eventually give him the opposite problem: “20 years from now, I don’t know what it’s going to be like then, but I’m not going to believe a single thing anyone shows me on the internet ever again.”</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/">gccrs</a> project is an ambitious
effort started in 2014 to implement a Rust compiler within The GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC).  Even though the task is far from complete, progress has
been made since LWN's <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/909887/">previous coverage</a>,
according to reports from the project.  Meanwhile, another hybrid and more
mature approach to GCC Rust code generation is available in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc"><tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt></a>.

</p><p>
In 2022, the goal of gccrs was to be included in the GCC 13 release,
but <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/2023/04/24/gccrs-and-gcc13-release.html">this expectation has not been met</a>.
The team is currently aiming for inclusion in GCC&nbsp;14 (likely to be
released by mid-2024), judging from its
<a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/2023/12/05/2023-11-monthly-report.html">November
2023 monthly report</a>.

</p><p>
On October 13, Arthur Cohen gave a talk titled "The road to compiling the
standard library with gccrs" (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgqGahDl-sY">video</a> is available)
at EuroRust 2023.  In his talk, Cohen gave a little bit of general
background on gccrs but mainly focused on what work has recently gone into
compiling the Rust standard library, and why gccrs cannot do it yet.

</p><p>
Gccrs targets a specific Rust version, <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/12/31/Rust-1.49.0.html">1.49,
released at the end of 2020</a>, rather than trying to keep up with the
rapidly developing Rust language.  This version was chosen because it is
the latest version predating support for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/generics.html#const-generics">const
generics</a>, which were introduced in 1.50.  However, Cohen expressed
regret in his talk that the project has not been able to ignore const
generics after all, because they are in use in the standard library, even in
1.49.  They were "stabilized" for general availability in 1.50, but there
is internal standard library usage in earlier versions as well.  Const
generics have since been fully implemented, however, and this issue is no
longer a hindrance.

</p><p>
A lot of care is being put into gccrs not becoming a "superset" of Rust, as
Cohen put it.  The project wants to make sure that it does not create a
special "GNU Rust" language, but is trying instead to replicate the output of
rustc — bugs, quirks, and all.  Both the Rust and GCC test suites
are being used to accomplish this.

</p><p>
The Rust standard library consists of a number of "crates", which is what
software packages are called in Rust lingo.  Cohen explained that gccrs is
working on supporting compilation of the two most important ones: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/"><tt>core</tt></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/"><tt>alloc</tt></a>.  The
<tt>core</tt> crate is the foundation of the standard library, implementing
features such as primitive types and macros; <tt>alloc</tt> deals with
heap-memory allocation and various container types.

</p><p>
Currently gccrs is not able to compile these crates because of various
shortcomings, such as incorrect behavior in macro-name resolution and
incomplete support for decorator macros.  The lack of a borrow checker
(discussed more below), while not blocking compilation, means that the
compiler cannot properly check the safety of the code.  An additional
hurdle is formed by missing compiler intrinsics in GCC. Rustc uses some
intrinsics provided by LLVM that are not supported by GCC, which means the
gccrs team needs to spend time implementing them in GCC.

</p><p>
Another talk (<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2023talks?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=GCC+Rust+Update.pdf">slides
available</a>) was given by Pierre-Emmanuel Patry at the GNU Tools Cauldron
in September 2023.  He mainly focused on progress toward inclusion in GCC
14 as well as macros, which seem to be an interrelated issue because the
approach to implement procedural macros necessitates changes to the GCC
build system.  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">Procedural
macros</a> are function-like macros that emit token streams rather than
plain source code text like C or C++ macros.  They are implemented in a
built-in crate called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/"><tt>proc_macro</tt></a>.  Such
macros are notoriously tricky to implement but also powerful; they form the
core of features such as <tt>#[attribute]</tt> and <tt>#[derive()]</tt>
decorators, and can be used to create compile-time evaluated,
domain-specific languages.

</p><p>
In the GNU Cauldron talk, Patry also mentioned that gccrs had more than 800
commits waiting to be upstreamed to GCC.

</p><h4>Taking advantage of the GCC ecosystem</h4>

<p>
Cohen's EuroRust talk highlighted that one of the major reasons gccrs is
being developed is to be able to take advantage of GCC's security plugins.
There is a wide range of existing GCC plugins that can aid in debugging,
static analysis, or hardening; these work on the GCC intermediate
representation.  Gccrs intends to support workflows where developers could
reuse these plugins with Rust code.  As an example, Cohen mentioned that "C
programmers have been forgetting to close their file descriptors for 40
years, [so] there are a lot of plugins to catch that".  Gccrs intends to
enable Rust programmers to use existing GCC plugins and static analyzers to
catch bugs in <tt>unsafe</tt> code.

</p><p>
Cohen listed a few things that gccrs is already useful for.
According to him, the Sega Dreamcast homebrew community uses gccrs to
create new games for the Dreamcast gaming console, and GCC
plugins can already be used to perform static analysis on unsafe Rust code.
The Dreamcast community's interest stems from the fact that rustc's LLVM
backend does not support the Hitachi SH-4 architecture of the console,
whereas GCC does; even in its incomplete state, gccrs is helpful for this
embedded use case.


</p><p>
Additionally, he mentioned that the gccrs effort has revealed some
unspecified language features, such as <tt>Deref</tt> and macro name
resolution; in response, the project has been able to contribute additions
to the Rust specification.  Currently Rust does not have a formal
specification, but work is underway to create one, as proposed in <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3355-rust-spec.html">RFC 3355</a>.
"The gccrs people want to be a part" of that effort, Cohen
said.

</p><p>
One more reason for gccrs to exist is <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust for Linux</a>, the initiative to
add Rust support to the Linux kernel.  Cohen said the
Linux kernel is a key motivator for the project because there are a lot of
kernel people who would prefer the kernel to be compiled only by the GNU
toolchain.

</p><h4>Things under development</h4>

<p>
Gccrs is still missing a lot of core functionality.  Cohen listed several
important features, such as <tt>async</tt>/<tt>await</tt>, LLVM intrinsics
that are absent in GCC, and the <tt>format_args!()</tt> macro used by
output macros such as <tt>println!()</tt>.  The borrow checker, which is a
compiler subsystem that enforces the reference rules of the language, is a
key Rust feature that gccrs will need to provide.  Cohen briefly mentioned
that the likely solution is a separate borrow-checker project called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius">Polonius</a>, and said Gccrs
will most likely have it integrated a few months down the line.
Contributor Jakub Dupak has <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/2023/11/06/2023-10-monthly-report.html">made
progress</a> on this in the past few months.

</p><p>
Polonius is a library that implements a borrow checker that is semantically
equivalent to the (not quite flawlessly implemented) checker in rustc today,
by approaching the computation of reference lifetimes with <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/04/27/an-alias-based-formulation-of-the-borrow-checker/">a
radically different algorithm</a>.  Polonius aims to one day resolve the
shortcomings and corner cases of rustc's current borrow checker.  Once it
has matured, rustc itself will likely also adopt it in the future.

</p><p>
According to the gccrs monthly report for November 2023, work has begun on
the <tt>format_args!()</tt> macro.  This helper macro is responsible for
constructing parameters for other string-formatting macros.  It involves
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html"><tt>Display</tt></a>
and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html"><tt>Debug</tt></a>
traits, and is a necessity for preparing arguments that are later passed to
other macros such as <tt>format!()</tt> and <tt>println!()</tt>.  Without
<tt>format_args!()</tt>, a Rust program cannot create formatted output;
this feature is thus necessary before gccrs can compile a "Hello, World"
program.

</p><p>
For a deep dive on <tt>format_args!()</tt>, see Mara Bos's recent <a href="https://blog.m-ou.se/format-args/">blog post</a>.

</p><h4><tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt></h4>

<p>
There is another GCC-based Rust project, called <tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt>,
that is more mature and more limited in scope compared to gccrs.  It is not
a full implementation of a Rust compiler from the ground up; instead, it
uses the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/JIT">libgccjit</a> library to
hook into an API of the LLVM backend used by rustc.  This approach performs
much of the compilation with rustc and turns to GCC at a later stage.
Despite the "JIT" (just in time) in the name of the library,
<tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt> is intended for ahead-of-time compilation.  Its
stated primary goal is to enable Rust code generation on platforms
unsupported by LLVM.

</p><p>
<a href="https://blog.antoyo.xyz/rustc_codegen_gcc-progress-report-26">As
of October 2023</a>, <tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt> can now compile Rust for
Linux without any additional patches.  Over the past year, the project
seems to have made good progress on many fronts; for example, it has added
support for SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) operations and
link-time optimization, both of which were earlier identified as causes for
test failures.  Cohen deferred to <tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt> at several
points in his EuroRust talk, encouraging attendees to use it instead of
gccrs for now.  It is, in fact, already upstreamed into the Rust language
repository.

</p><h4>Rust for Linux</h4>

<p>
Currently, the Rust for Linux project provides documentation for using
either <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/rust/quick-start.html">rustc</a> or
<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/rustc_codegen_gcc"><tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt></a>
to build Rust code for the kernel.  The kernel also contains <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/changes.html">documentation</a> for
the minimal supported versions of various build tools, including compilers.
For rustc, the version is considered an exact match, rather than a minimum.
The currently stated supported rustc version is 1.73.0 (released in October
2023), much more recent than the 1.49 targeted by gccrs.  Rust for Linux
support is also a stated goal for gccrs, but because of this significant
discrepancy, it seems to be quite far off.

</p><p>
Gccrs has progressed nicely in the year since we last looked at it: the
repository has well over 3,000 commits since January&nbsp;1, 2023.
However, it is not yet in a usable state for almost any practical purpose,
since as a complete implementation from the ground up, gccrs is much more
ambitious in scope than <tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt>.  The latter is already
merged to the upstream Rust repository and sees real-world use with Rust
for Linux.  We are not yet in a world with multiple implementations of a
compiler for the Rust language, but it is getting closer.<br clear="all"></p><table>

      Earlier this summer the United Steelworkers union vowed to only support a proposed offer by another unionized American steel company, Cleveland Cliffs, to buy US Steel, in a cash and stock deal then valued at $32.53 a share, or 40% less than Nippon’s all cash offer. The US Steel board <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/14/investing/us-steel-cleveland-cliffs/index.html">rejected that offer</a> and started considering other bids.

      “To say we’re disappointed in the announced deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon is an understatement, as it demonstrates the same greedy, shortsighted attitude that has guided U.S. Steel for far too long,” said USW President David McCall. “We remained open throughout this process to working with U.S. Steel to keep this iconic American company domestically owned and operated, but instead it chose to push aside the concerns of its dedicated workforce and sell to a foreign-owned company.”

      US Steel was created in 1901 through a merger when a group led by J.P. Morgan and Charles Schwab, two of the world’s leading financiers of the time, bought the steel company owned by Andrew Carnegie and combined it with their holdings in its rival Federal Steel company.

      US Steel was so dominant, in fact, that its competitive prowess helped lead to the creation of the nation’s antitrust laws, passed in an attempt to keep the company’s strategic and financial might, and that of the Standard Oil’s, in check.

      “That company peaked out in 1916,” longtime steel industry analyst Charles Bradford told CNN in August when the bidding started for US Steel. “It’s been downhill ever sense. Peak output was in the 1970s. It’s done nothing for decades.”

      According to a story in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on its 100th anniversary in 2001, the company’s peak employment of 340,000 came in 1943, during World War II, when it played a critical role in the Allied forces’ war efforts.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqayerq7000b3b6h3nicgpn1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The same article said peak steel output came in 1953, when the company&nbsp;produced 35.8 million tons of steel while steelmakers in Europe and Japan were still struggling to recover from the war. Last year, US Steel shipped only 11.2 million tons of steel from its US operations and had just under 15,000 US employees.

      From its peak, the company began to fall behind upstart competitors — both foreign and domestic. First, it fell behind competitors in Japan and Germany, which were forced to rebuild from scratch after World War II and used new technologies that required far less labor and energy.

      US Steel and other steelmakers eventually followed those foreign competitors to upgrade factories and equipment, but they still largely used the older methods to make steel by melting raw materials such as iron ore in giant blast furnaces.

      Bradford said all along the way, US Steel and other US integrated steelmaking rivals with storied names such as Bethlehem Steel, Inland Steel and LTV Steel underestimated the competitive challenge that they faced from overseas and mini-mills at home. In more recent years, steelmakers from China, India and Korea have expanded capacity far beyond US Steel. Those three other integrated steelmakers have already been swallowed up in earlier mergers and are today part of US Steel rival Cleveland Cliffs.

<p>According to Svarovsky, the first demo of the game took place at a music festival in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo,_Norway" title="Oslo, Norway">Oslo, Norway</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-TimeWaxman_4-5"><a href="#cite_note-TimeWaxman-4">[4]</a></sup> Attendees were so enthusiastic with the idea that many began throwing their phones into the air without bothering to download the app.<sup id="cite_ref-WiredRigney_2-5"><a href="#cite_note-WiredRigney-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Apple rejected <i>Send Me To Heaven</i> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)" title="App Store (iOS/iPadOS)">App Store</a>, citing policies against encouraging the damage of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS" title="IOS">iOS</a> device.<sup id="cite_ref-NBCLeJacq_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-NBCLeJacq-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LATimesRodriguez_3-3"><a href="#cite_note-LATimesRodriguez-3">[3]</a></sup> The app was accepted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play" title="Google Play">Google Play</a> without comment.

</p><p>Due to the rejection of <i>Send Me To Heaven</i> from the App Store, the only iOS device currently running a copy of <i>Send Me To Heaven</i> is Petr Svarovsky's personal iPhone, which contains the app prototype. Svarovsky has attempted to sell the badly damaged iPhone multiple times as a "collectible" game item. Although badly damaged, the iPhone is still functional and is marketed as including the following bonus content: Svarovsky's ex-girlfriend's phone number, Svarovsky's dentist's phone number, some cat photographs, and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a> songs.

It’s not the outcome we had hoped for, but despite thousands of hours spent with regulators around the world detailing differences between our businesses, our products, and the markets we serve, we no longer see a path toward regulatory approval of&nbsp;the&nbsp;deal.</p><p>We entered into this agreement 15 months ago with the goal of accelerating what both Adobe and Figma could do for our respective communities. While we leave that future behind and continue on as an independent company, we are excited to find ways to partner for&nbsp;our&nbsp;users.</p><p>Amid the uncertainty of a pending acquisition, I am deeply proud of how the Figma team delivered for our community and feel we have only continued to accelerate our pace over the past 15 months. Our team built and shipped new products to make it easier to ideate, design and build software, including our first <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-ai-to-figjam/">native AI features</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-dev-mode/">Dev Mode</a>, Variables, and Advanced Prototyping. We also opened new hubs in the UK and Asia, hosted an epic <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2023-recap/">Config IRL in San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/ai-the-next-chapter-in-design/">acquired AI startup Diagram</a>, and added more than 500 new&nbsp;Figmates.</p><p>Figma’s founding vision was to “eliminate the gap between imagination and reality.” The shift from a physical economy to a digital economy and huge advances in AI have combined to make this aspiration feel even more urgent and within reach today than it did 11&nbsp;years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>This will be our focus moving forward. We want to make it easy for anyone to design and build digital products on a single multiplayer canvas—from start to finish, idea to production. I’m so excited for what the future holds and beyond grateful to our community for supporting us. Figma’s best, most innovative days are still ahead. See you all&nbsp;in&nbsp;2024!</p></div><div><p><img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,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" alt="" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" loading="eager" alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/672d9533efa16607fd9f84281a4d158c6a9fd048-400x400.jpg?w=400&amp;h=400&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/672d9533efa16607fd9f84281a4d158c6a9fd048-400x400.jpg?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 200w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/672d9533efa16607fd9f84281a4d158c6a9fd048-400x400.jpg?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 300w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/672d9533efa16607fd9f84281a4d158c6a9fd048-400x400.jpg?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 400w"></p><div><p>Dylan Field is the co-founder and CEO of Figma.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why use a "slow interpreter" versus a "fast JIT"?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">In many situations, speed is not the main concern. Runtime executable size, memory usage, startup latency can be improved with the interpreter approach. Portability and security are much easier to achieve and maintain. Additionally, development impedance is much lower. A simple library like Wasm3 is easy to compile and integrate into an existing project. (Wasm3 builds in a just few seconds). Finally, on some platforms (i.e. iOS and WebAssembly itself) you can't generate executable code pages in runtime, so JIT is unavailable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why would you want to run WASM on embedded devices?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Wasm3 started as a research project and remains so by any means. Evaluating the engine in different environments is part of the research. Given that we have <code>Lua</code>, <code>JS</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>Lisp</code>, <code>...</code> running on MCUs, <code>WebAssembly</code> is a promising alternative. It provides toolchain decoupling as well as a completely sandboxed, well-defined, predictable environment. Among practical use cases we can list <code>edge computing</code>, <code>scripting</code>, <code>plugin systems</code>, running <code>IoT rules</code>, <code>smart contracts</code>, etc.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><time datetime="2023-12-08T17:00:00.000Z">Last updated: 5pm on Friday, 8 December 2023.</time></p><div>
	<p>We're experiencing a major technology outage following a cyber-attack affecting our website, online systems and services, and some onsite services. However, our buildings are still open as usual. We anticipate restoring more services in the next few weeks, but disruption to certain services is now expected to persist for several months.</p>

	<p>Last week the attackers released some of our data onto the dark web including some personal user information. We've contacted our users to alert them to this incident and to offer advice from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on how to protect themselves, including updating their passwords on other systems.</p>

	<p>Because our systems are still unavailable, you can't change the password for our services. However, if you use the same password for non-British Library services, we recommend that you change it as a precaution.</p>
	
	<p>NCSC provides <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/information-for/individuals-families" target="_blank">guidance on staying secure online</a>, including how to create a strong password, and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/data-breaches" target="_blank">specific guidance for individuals who may have been impacted by a data breach</a>.</p>

	<p>Analysing the data is likely to take several months. Should we find specific information has been compromised, we will alert anyone affected as soon as we can. We are continuing to collaborate with the Metropolitan Police and professional cybersecurity advisors, and are receiving support from the NCSC.</p>

	<p>We're really sorry for the ongoing disruption to our systems and services and we'll provide further updates when we can.</p>
	
	<h3>What is currently available?</h3>
	
	<p>The Library's buildings are open, but some services are limited, including access to collection items. We're regularly updating <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2023/11/cyber-incident.html" target="_blank">our blog</a> with the latest information on what's currently available online and onsite so please check this before you visit.</p>
	
	<p>If you have purchased tickets for our exhibition, <strong>Fantasy: Realms of Imagination</strong>, you can still use them. Exhibition tickets can also be booked via <a href="https://fantasy.seetickets.com/timeslots/filter/fantasy-realms-of-imagination" target="_blank">See Tickets</a>. Our free exhibition, <strong>Malorie Blackman: The Power of Stories</strong>, is open and no booking is required.</p>
	
	<p>All upcoming <strong>public events</strong> are going ahead as planned and you can find more information on our <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2023/11/british-library-events-.html" target="_blank"> events blog
			update</a>. We're continuing to welcome <strong>schools</strong> and <strong>families</strong> too, as well as
		adult learners to our <strong>courses</strong>. </p>
	
	<p><strong>Business &amp; IP Centre</strong> (BIPC) in St Pancras is open to support businesses as usual but digital
		services onsite are unavailable. You can also join <strong>BIPC events and webinars</strong> and access one-to-one
		support. Read our <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2023/11/british-library-business-ip-centre-bipc-services.html" target="_blank">BIPC blog update</a> to find out what help and advice we can offer during this time.</p>
	
	<h3>Contacting us</h3>
	<p>While our systems are offline, you can contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:customer@bl.uk" target="_blank">customer@bl.uk</a> We'll do our best to answer your queries but please bear with us. This inbox is reviewed between 08.30 to 16.30 Monday to Friday. We're experiencing a high volume of enquiries so it may take us some time to respond. We'll get back to you as quickly as we can.</p>

  <p>Servo is well and truly back.</p>
<figure><a href="https://servo.org/img/blog/recap-2023-contributors.png"><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/recap-2023-contributors.png" alt="Bar chart: 453 (44%) by Igalia, 195 (19%) by non-Igalia, 389 (37%) by bots"></a>
<figcaption>Contributors to <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">servo/servo</a> in 2023.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span></span>
This year, to date, we’ve had <strong>53 unique contributors</strong> (+140% over 22 last year), landing <strong>1037 pull requests</strong> (+382% over 215) and 2485 commits (+375% over 523), and that’s just in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">our main repo</a>!</p>
<p>Individual contributors are especially important for the health of the project, and of the pull requests made by humans (rather than our <a href="https://github.com/servo-wpt-sync">friendly</a> <a href="https://github.com/dependabot">bots</a>), 30% were by people outside Igalia, and 18% were by non-reviewers.</p>
<p>Servo has been featured in <a href="https://servo.org/about/">six conference talks</a> this year, including at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdHvHoAO5oo">RustNL</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfk8s5OD99A">Web Engines Hackfest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qedc-0pjs&amp;t=2356s">LF Europe Member Summit</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/9lkIX5ryZZ4">Open Source Summit Europe</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/RugzThWcjn4">GOSIM Workshop</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx70W83Bxtc">GOSIM Conference</a>.</p>
<p>Servo now has a usable “minibrowser” UI, now supports offscreen rendering, its experimental WebGPU support (<code>--pref dom.webgpu.enabled</code>) has been updated, and Servo is now listed on <a href="https://wpt.fyi/">wpt.fyi</a> again (click <span>Edit</span> to add Servo).</p>
<p><a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/04/13/layout-2013-vs-2020/">Our new layout engine</a> is now proving its strengths, with support for iframes, floats, stacking context improvements, inline layout improvements, margin collapsing, ‘position: sticky’, ‘min-width’ and ‘min-height’, ‘max-width’ and ‘max-height’, ‘align-content’, ‘justify-content’, ‘white-space’, ‘text-indent’, ‘text-align: justify’, <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/05/31/adding-support-for-outline-properties/">‘outline’ and ‘outline-offset’</a>, and ‘filter: drop-shadow()’.</p>

<figcaption>Pass rates in parts of the <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">Web Platform Tests</a> with our new layout engine, showing the improvement we’ve made since the <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/07/20/servo-web-platform-tests/">start of our data</a> in April 2023.</figcaption></figure>

<a href="https://github.com/dbaron/inlines-and-floats">Floats are notoriously tricky</a>, to the point we found them <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Servo-Layout-Engines-Report">impossible to implement correctly</a> in our legacy layout engine, but thanks to the move from eager to opportunistic parallelism, they are now supported fairly well.
Whereas legacy layout was only ever able to reach 53.9% in the floats tests and 68.2% in floats-clear, we’re now at <strong>82.2% in floats</strong> (+28.3pp over legacy) and <strong>73.3% in floats-clear</strong> (+5.1pp over legacy).</p>
<p><a href="http://acid1.acidtests.org/">Acid1</a> now passes in the new layout engine, and we’ve also surpassed legacy layout in the <strong>CSS2 abspos (by 50.0pp)</strong>, CSS2 positioning (by 6.5pp), and CSS Position (by 4.4pp) test suites, while making big strides in others, like the <strong>CSSOM tests (+13.1pp)</strong> and key parts of the <strong>CSS2 test suite (+15.8pp)</strong>.</p>
<p><span></span>
<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap/106e95887c3d9768f791a4e0501ba5c89abe9636">Next year</a>, our funding will go towards maintaining Servo, releasing nightlies on Android, finishing our integration with Tauri (thanks to NLNet), and implementing tables and better support for floats and non-Latin text (thanks to NLNet).</p>
<p>Servo will also be at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/">FOSDEM 2024</a>, with Rakhi Sharma speaking about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2321-embedding-servo-in-rust-projects/">embedding Servo in Rust projects</a> on <strong>3 February</strong> at <strong>16:45 local time</strong> (15:45 UTC).
See you there!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more we would like to do, so if you or a company you know are interested in sponsoring the development of an embeddable, independent, memory-safe, modular, parallel web rendering engine, we want to hear from you!
Head over to <a href="https://servo.org/sponsorship/">our sponsorship page</a>, or email <a href="https://servo.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4923262027093a2c3b3f2667263b2e"><span data-cfemail="543e3b3d3a14273126223b7a3b2633">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> for enquiries.</p>
<p>In a decade that many people feared would become the nadir of browser engine diversity, we hope we can help change that with Servo.</p>

          <p>Making nice things is difficult and time-consuming.</p>
          <p>
            If we want people to make nice things for us, we have to pay for
            their rent and grocery bills and raw materials.
          </p>

            If you are spending less than

            your entertainment (podcasts, videos, articles, games, books, etc.),
            consider finding ways to support creators and the infrastructure

            Unfortunately, the HTML source for
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a> is not so "beautiful
            on the inside", but Apple engineers shouldn't be faulted for ugly
            HTML. Their only option was to wrap a sleek skin around shoddy
            materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML/CSS should evoke feelings of sculpting with digital concrete,
            but it feels more like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_bridge">building bridges with uncooked pasta</a>. The whole digital design landscape is begging for simple markup
            languages that can participate in honest architecture.

            Until we adopt simple and stable building materials,
            <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90501691/science-confirms-it-web-sites-really-do-all-look-the-same">all websites will continue to look the same</a>. Software has become too complicated to stay honest. Corporations
            can't expose their brick-and-wood architecture because it's actually
            Megablocks and sawdust underneath all that paint.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law">Wirth's Law</a>

            multinationals may become the only players capable of making
            websites.

            But people like Bartosz Ciechanowski are forging paths to elegant

            <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch">mechanical watch demo</a>
            is proof that honest software is viable. Each guide is erected as a
            giant wall of WebGL. It's beautiful, but definitely not sleek.
          </p>
          <p>
            The World Wide Web needn't be all 3D WebGL wizardry. The websites of

            <a href="https://astronaut.io/">The humans are still out there.</a>
            We can speak sincerely with honest tools and materials. We can
            <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/tadi-web">stay slippy</a>
            and celebrate our warts and imperfections together.

          <p>
            Computers are really good at finding and storing things, so why is
            much of the internet broken and/or missing?

              <strong>Spam:</strong> Corporations and computers manufacture crap

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">exploit</a>
              (and often pay) Google to overwhelm independent search results.

              <strong>Javascript:</strong> Modern websites are built with more
              JS (dynamic) than HTML (static), and dynamic content is difficult
              for computers to read. Imagine ordering <em>The Hobbit</em> and
              unexpectedly receiving a N64 cartridge with an e-book on it. A
              book is simple and unchanging. A N64 cartridge requires (1) a
              working N64, (2) a compatible television, (3) knowledge of how to
              use/repair the equipment, (4) knowledge of how to use the
              cartridge, and (5) time/energy to load the cartridge and navigate
              menus. Hodgepodge cartridges do not scale. To keep HTML
              competitive with JS, we need better tooling. Some HTML resources
              are listed on the side of this webpage. To supplant JS, the HTML
              development experience must become 10x easier/faster/cheaper/etc
              than the current JS experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Images:</strong> HTML is more sustainable than JS, but
              HTML remains hostile to beginners. Without an easy markup
              language, people use Powerpoint/Photoshop to share documents. It's
              hard for computers to decipher/archive images, and it only becomes
              harder as fewer photocopies-of-photocopies survive. We need
              something powerful like HTML/CSS, yet simple like Markdown.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> HTML is generally unkind to people
              of limited hearing, vision, etc. By default, stuff on the cheap
              web should work flexibly with many interfaces.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut_effect">Everybody benefits from curb cuts.</a>

              wallets to manage subscriptions and one-click payments, but
              consumers had to wait for Amazon and Apple to launch proprietary
              solutions to public platform problems. Payments were difficult, so
              nobody paid for things. Advertising became the default way to
              sustainably make money; piracy became the default way to guard
              one's attention/privacy. To escape from this advertising
              hellscape, we must make online payments better for developers and
              consumers, especially for digital goods.

            <li>
              <strong>Arbitrary Addresses:</strong> The modern internet works
              much like Amazon's delivery network. Amazon can deliver stuff in
              its warehouses quickly, but one must wait longer to get products
              directly from suppliers. But digital goods needn't come from a
              supplier nor the closest distribution center. All internet data
              can be sent and received faster by copying data from neighbors!
              Cryptographers
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">invented magic</a>
              to do exactly this, but it's not being used at all layers of our
              digital infrastructure. To get mainstream adoption at the www.*
              level, we need
              <a href="https://brave.com/ipfs-support/">more browser support</a>
              and killer apps (an
              <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a> alternative seems like a
              good candidate).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platforms:</strong> Nobody owns email or podcasts (RSS),
              and everybody benefits tremendously from that freedom and
              flexibility. Corporations like Slack, Twitter, Visa, Zoom, Google,
              Amazon, Instagram, Unity, YouTube, and GoDaddy retain control over
              infrastructure that needn't be controlled at all. To escape
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>
              cycles, we need open protocols and designers to make nice
              interfaces for those protocols. Federated services like Mastadon
              are promising.

              <strong>Ad-Hoc Archival:</strong> If the internet were built on
              something like BitTorrent, archiving and indexing everything would
              be trivial and automatic. Instead,
              <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> remains perpetually
              underfunded in its futile battle against

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g">NFTs were probably always a bad idea</a>, yet much of the cryptocurrency community espouses admirable aims.
            Kudos to the crypto folks -- they are actually trying to fix/replace
            the world's crumbling central infrastructure.

            The maintainers of the global financial system have repeatedly
            failed us. All the games seem rigged and global inequality seems
            inescapable. Governments and corporations continue to trample our
            privacy. Banks are slow; credit card fees feel like theft. And so
            on.
          </p>

            But cryptocurrency zealots also try to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">set our oil reserves ablaze</a>
            so that they can hoard Dogecoin in virtual caves.

            It remains unclear what role blockchains will play in a sustainable
            technological future, but surely we needn't squander so much energy
            to obtain the convenience we desire and the privacy we deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if we receive privacy, let's use it responsibly -- let's leave

Suppose we want to <code>describe</code> the table schema:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>\d employees;
</code></pre><codapi-snippet sandbox="postgres" editor="basic" template="#select.tpl" depends-on="create.sql"></codapi-snippet><p>The <code>describe</code> snippet does not need table data, so it can depend directly on the <code>create</code> snippet:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>create ← insert ← select
   ↖
  describe
</code></pre><p>More complex dependency graphs are also possible, as long as there are no cycles:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>create ← insert-1 ← select
       ↖ insert-2 ↙
</code></pre><p>You probably get the idea.</p><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2><p>Back to our example. Suppose we started with two static code examples — <code>create</code> and <code>insert</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>employees</span> (
</span></span><span><span>  <span>id</span> <span>integer</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span>,
</span></span><span><span>  <span>name</span> <span>varchar</span>(<span>50</span>),
</span></span><span><span>  <span>department</span> <span>varchar</span>(<span>10</span>),
</span></span><span><span>  <span>salary</span> <span>integer</span>
</span></span><span><span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>employees</span>
</span></span><span><span>(<span>id</span>, <span>name</span>, <span>department</span>, <span>salary</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>values</span>
</span></span><span><span>(<span>11</span>, <span>'Diane'</span>, <span>'hr'</span>, <span>70</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>12</span>, <span>'Bob'</span>, <span>'hr'</span>, <span>78</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>21</span>, <span>'Emma'</span>, <span>'it'</span>, <span>84</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, we make them interactive by adding <code>codapi-snippet</code>s.</p><p>➀ Create:</p><pre><code>```sql
create table employees (
  id integer primary key,
  name varchar(50),
  department varchar(10),
  salary integer
);
```

&lt;codapi-snippet id="create.sql" sandbox="postgres" editor="basic"&gt;
&lt;/codapi-snippet&gt;
</code></pre><p>➁ Insert:</p><pre><code>```sql
insert into employees
(id, name, department, salary)
values
(11, 'Diane', 'hr', 70),
(12, 'Bob', 'hr', 78),
(21, 'Emma', 'it', 84);
```

&lt;codapi-snippet id="insert.sql" sandbox="postgres" editor="basic"&gt;
&lt;/codapi-snippet&gt;
</code></pre><p>Then we make <code>insert</code> dependent on <code>create</code> by adding a <code>depends-on</code> attribute:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>codapi-snippet</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"insert.sql"</span> <span>sandbox</span><span>=</span><span>"postgres"</span> <span>editor</span><span>=</span><span>"basic"</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>depends-on</span><span>=</span><span>"create.sql"</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>codapi-snippet</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The rest is automatic!</p><p>Behind the scenes, <code>codapi-snippet</code> calls a <a href="https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi">codapi</a> server (either a cloud or self-hosted instance) so it can run any programming language, database or software you've configured.</p><p>As you know, Jupyter notebooks are stateful — that is, they store the state of variables between cell invocations.

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does it work?</h3>
<p dir="auto">This experiment explores self-evolving agents that automatically generate and improve themselves. No specific agent design or prompting is required from the user. Simply pose a question, and the system initiates and evolves agents tailored to provide answers. The process starts with a user query, activating a basic "bootstrap" agent, which doesn't execute Python code but plans and delegates to specialized agents capable of running Python for broader functions. An Agent Manager oversees them, selecting or creating agents via vector similarity for specific tasks. Agents have evolving system prompts that improve through learning. For coding tasks, agents include Python in prompts, refining their approach through an "evolution step" if unsuccessful. Upon completing a task, an agent's status updates, and the bootstrap agent evaluates the result, engaging other agents for further steps in larger processes.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current Challenges and Potential Improvements</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Path Optimization</strong>: The system sometimes fails to effectively discard non-functional agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Performance and Parallelization</strong>: Currently, parallel processing is not implemented. Enabling the testing of multiple prompt evolutions simultaneously could significantly enhance performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Strategy for Prompt Evolution</strong>: The approach to prompt evolution is quite basic at the moment. Developing a method to quantify the success ratio would refine this strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Persistent Agent Prompts</strong>: There is significant potential in integrating persistent agent prompts with vector databases. Additionally, sharing successful agents across various runtime environments could improve overall efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hierarchical Agent Structure</strong>: Most requests are presently processed directly by an agent designated by the bootstrap agent. Implementing a more intricate hierarchical structure for managing requests could lead to major improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Context Size Limitation</strong>: Not yet considered.</p>

<p>Neither AMD nor Nvidia intends to back out of this argument involving the performance difference between the Instinct MI300X and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-hopper-h100-gpu-revealed-gtc-2022" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-hopper-h100-gpu-revealed-gtc-2022">H100</a> (Hopper) GPUs.

It further identified that Nvidia benchmarked these using its in-house TensorRT-LLM on H100 rather than vLLM, an open-source and widely used method. Furthermore, Nvidia used the vLLM FP16 performance datatype on AMD while comparing its results with DGX-H100, which used the TensorRT-LLM with FP8 datatype to display these alleged misconstrued results. AMD stressed that in its test, it used vLLM with the FP16 dataset due to its widespread use, and vLLM does not support FP8.</p><p>There's also the point that servers will have latency, but instead of accounting for that, Nvidia showed its throughput performance, not emulating the real-world situation, according to AMD.</p><h2 id="amd-apos-s-updated-test-results-with-more-optimizations-and-accounting-for-latency-with-nvidia-apos-s-testing-method-3">AMD's Updated Test Results with More Optimizations and Accounting for Latency with Nvidia's Testing Method</h2><p>AMD made three performance runs using Nvidia's TensorRT-LLM, the last notable one having measured latency results between MI300X and vLLM using the FP16 dataset against H100 with TensorRT-LLM.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="homenews"><p id="top">by Jennifer Jenkins, Director, Duke Center for the Study of the Public Domain</p>
<p>CC BY 4.0&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/buttons/88x31/png/by.png" width="59px"></a></p>
<p><img alt="Image of Steamboat Willie Entering the Public Domain by Doo Lee" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Steamboat-WIllie-Enters-Public-Domain.jpeg"></p>
<p>On January 1, 2024, after almost a century of copyright protection, Mickey Mouse, or at least a <em>version</em> of Mickey Mouse, will enter the public domain. The first movies in which the iconic mouse appeared – most famously, <em>Steamboat Willie­</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> – were made in 1928 and works from that year go into the public domain in the United States on New Year’s Day 2024.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>The public domain has had some famous recent arrivals, but this is the most anticipated entry yet. Why? It is not simply that Mickey is a famous copyrighted character. So are Sherlock Holmes and Winnie the Pooh, and while they entered the public domain with some fanfare, it paled in comparison to this event. I’d like to offer a tentative answer. The reason that this event gathers so much attention is that it is the story of a 95-year-old love triangle, a tangled drama that rivals any Disney movie for twists and turns. The protagonists are Mickey, Disney and the Public Domain, and their relationship positively exemplifies the social media weasel-words “it’s complicated.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, Disney pushed for the law that extended the copyright term to 95 years, which became referred to derisively as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act.”&nbsp; This extension has been criticized by scholars as being economically regressive and having a devastating effect on our ability to digitize, archive, and gain access to our cultural heritage. It locked up not just famous works, but a vast swath of our culture, including material that is commercially unavailable. Even though calling it the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” may overstate Disney’s actual role in the legislative process – the measure passed because of a much broader lobbying effort – Disney was certainly a prominent supporter, and the Mouse was sometimes a figurehead.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Disney itself is a talented and successful practitioner of <em>building upon</em> the public domain. In fact, the public domain is Disney’s bread and butter. <em>Frozen</em> was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s <em>The Snow Queen</em>. <em>The Lion King </em>draws from Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em>, Biblical stories, and possibly an epic poem about the founder of the Mali Empire.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> <em>Fantasia </em>showcases public domain classical music, and “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” segment comes from a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, <em>Snow White</em>, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pinocchio</em> came from stories by Lewis Carroll, The Brothers Grimm, Victor Hugo, Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Anderson, and Carlo Collodi.</p>
<p>The public domain includes not only works over which copyright has expired or never existed, but also uncopyrightable aspects of contemporary works—such as ideas, stock elements, and unoriginal material. The Mickey character itself is based on such public domain fodder. His personality and antics drew from silent film stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks. Walt Disney told <em>The American Magazine</em>: “I think we were rather indebted to Charlie Chaplin …We wanted something appealing and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin…a little fellow trying to do the best he could.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Ub Iwerks, who animated most of <em>Steamboat Willie</em>, wrote that Douglas Fairbanks “was the super-hero of his day, always winning, gallant and swashbuckling. Mickey’s action was in that vein…I thought of him in that respect, and I had him do naturally the sort of thing Doug Fairbanks would do.” Titles are also not copyrightable, and the name “Steamboat Willie” was a nod to the title of Buster Keaton’s film from earlier the same year, <em>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</em><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p>
<p>Hence the triangle. Disney is both an emblem of term extension and its erosion of the public domain, and one of the strongest use-cases in <em>favor</em> of the maintenance of a rich public domain. Mickey is the symbol of both tendencies. Ironies abound. It may not be <em>exactly </em>the same as an oil company relying on solar power to run its rigs, but it is definitely in the same “massive irony” zip code. All of this makes the year when copyright finally expires over Mickey Mouse highly symbolic. The love triangle between Mickey, Disney, and the public domain is about to evolve, and perhaps even <em>resolve</em>, in real time.</p>
<p>But what does public domain status actually <em>mean</em> for the <em>Steamboat Willie</em> version of Mickey?<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> There is a vast amount of misinformation about these issues online. In what follows, I will try to offer a straightforward explainer. What <em>can </em>and <em>can’t </em>you do with the Mickey Mouse character as of January 1, 2024? How will Disney be affected? Does Disney still hold copyrights over later versions of Mickey? Does trademark law play a role? Keep reading for details.</p>

	<em>What can I do with Mickey Mouse as of January 1, 2024? </em></h3>

<p>The answer, ironically, is distinctly mouse-shaped! Here is a diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="A green circle with black text and words" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Mickey_Mouse_Trademark_and_Copyright_Do_and_Dont_v4.png"></p>
<p>As explained by <a href="https://youtu.be/nAp7fhUd7u0?t=607" target="_blank">Karyn A. Temple</a>, former United States Register of Copyrights, the public domain “is part of copyright’s lifecycle, the next stage of life for that creative work. The public domain is an inherent and integral part of the copyright system…It provides authors the inspiration and raw material to create something new.”</p>
<p><em>Steamboat Willie </em>and the characters it depicts – which include both Mickey and Minnie Mouse – will be in the public domain. As indicated in the green circle, this means that anyone can share, adapt, or remix that material. You can start your creative engines too—<em>full steam ahead</em>! You could take a page out of the <a href="https://winniethepooh.whogivesacrap.org/" target="_blank"><em>Winnie-the-Pooh: the Deforested Edition</em></a> playbook and create “Steamboat Willie: the Climate Change Edition,” in which Mickey’s boat is grounded in a dry riverbed. You could create a feminist remake with Minnie Mouse as the central figure. You could reimagine Mickey and Minnie dedicating themselves to animal welfare. (The animals in <em>Steamboat Willie </em>are contorted rather uncomfortably into musical instruments. PETA would not approve.)</p>
<p>You can do all of this and more, <em>so long as </em>you steer clear of the subsisting rights indicated by the orange circles, namely:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Use the original versions of Mickey and Minnie Mouse from 1928, without copyrightable elements of later iterations (though not every later iteration will be copyrightable, as I explain below) and</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Do not confuse consumers into thinking that your creation is produced or sponsored by Disney as a matter of trademark law. One way to help ensure that your audience is not confused is to make the actual source of the work – you or your company – clear on the title screen or cover, along with a prominent disclaimer indicating that your work was not produced, endorsed, licensed, or approved by Disney.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>So, is January 1, 2024 doomsday for Disney? No. Disney still retains copyright over newer iterations of Mickey such as the “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” Mickey from <em>Fantasia</em> (1940) as well as trademarks over Mickey as a brand identifier. People will still go to its theme parks, pay to see its movies, buy its merchandise. Its brand identity will remain intact.</p>
<p>In sum, yes, you can use Mickey in new creative works. There are some more complex peripheral legal issues, but here is your guide through them.</p>

	<em>What about more recent versions of Mickey?</em></h3>

<div>
	<p><img alt="Mickey Glove Pointing for directional sign to the clubhouse ..." src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Pointing-glove-copy.jpg"></p>
	<div>
		<p><strong>Copyright expiration allows you to use the original Mickey and Minnie Mouse in new creative works, even though those characters also appear in more recent works that are still under copyright.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>With newer iterations of those characters, Disney only owns <em>original, creative expression</em> that qualifies for copyright, not mere ideas, unoriginal or stock character features, or “merely trivial” variations to the original characters.</strong></p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>In 2024 Mickey Mouse joins a host of other familiar public domain characters—Winnie the Pooh, Sherlock Holmes, Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, Robin Hood, Snow White, Cinderella, and Alice in Wonderland. You can use Mickey and Minnie 1.0, as they appeared in <em>Steamboat Willie </em>and<em> Plane Crazy</em>, even though these characters also appear in later, still-copyrighted works. Under copyright law, Disney only owns the <em>newly added</em> material in subsequent works, not underlying material from 1928—that content remains freely available.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
<p>“It is a bedrock principle of copyright that once work enters the public domain it cannot be appropriated as private (intellectual) property, and even the most creative of legal theories cannot trump this tenet.” –<em>Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate</em> (N.D. Ill. 2013) aff’d (7th Cir. 2014)</p>
<p>This point was illustrated by the Conan Doyle Estate Ltd.’s unsuccessful attempts to artificially extend the expired copyright over the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2023/#sherlockholmes" target="_blank">covered</a> on last year’s Public Domain Day site. A court <a href="https://freesherlock.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/klinger-order-on-motion-for-summary-judgment-c.pdf" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that all of the story elements in public domain works are “free for public use”: “Where an author has used the same character in a series of works, some of which are in the public domain, the public is free to copy story elements from the public domain works.”</p>
<p>Mickey’s appearance has changed over time, going from a vaguely rat-like to a more neotenous appearance. He eyes varied over time and began as large white ovals with pupils in <em>Plane Crazy</em> and smaller black dots in <em>Steamboat Willie</em> – both of those versions of Mickey are public domain in 2024. In 1929 he quickly donned gloves (apparently so that his hands were more visible against his body) and later he was colorized.”. The overall appearance of <em>Fantasia </em>Mickey and other later Mickeys is still under copyright.</p>
<p><img alt="A cartoon of a mouse" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/mickey_timeline_v2.jpg" width="85%"></p>
<p>That said, not every feature of Mickey’s later iterations is individually copyrightable. Copyright only extends to “original, creative expression.” Mere ideas are not eligible, nor are unoriginal features or stock elements. When copyright is claimed over additions to preexisting content – such as changes to the 1928 Mickey character – those changes have to be more than a “merely trivial” or “miniscule” variation on what came before.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> It is not enough for the new material just to be <em>different</em>; it has to meet copyright’s threshold requirements for protectability.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the safest approach may be to stick to Mickey circa 1928 in new creations, copyright law also lets you use later material that does not qualify for copyright. Your mouse can speak intelligibly in a high voice even though Mickey 1.0 does not do so; giving a talking mouse a squeaky voice is not copyrightable. Generic character traits such as being adorable and having less jaunty dance moves are fair game. What’s more, anything you “independently create” – or come up with yourself – is legal. Choosing your own color scheme is fine; you do not have to stick to black and white.</p>
<p>Can Disney claim copyright over the color red – standing alone – for Mickey’s shorts? On the one hand, when talking about copyright’s “originality” requirement, the Supreme Court said that “the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice. The vast majority of works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark, ‘no matter how crude, humble or obvious’ it might be.” But the law is also clear that adding something to a prior work must be more than a “merely trivial” variation. To us, the argument seems stronger that choosing a single, bright, primary color for an article of clothing does not meet the copyrightability threshold. That said, you may be more comfortable selecting your own color scheme.</p>

	<em>What about Disney’s trademark over Mickey?</em></h3>

<p>The plot thickens when you add Disney’s <em>trademark</em> rights to the picture. Many sources claim that even though Mickey is copyright-free in 2024, you still cannot use the character because it is trademarked by Disney. But this is not what the law actually says. Trademark law only prohibits the use of a trademarked character if doing so “is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive” consumers about the source or sponsorship of the new product.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></p>

<div>
	<p><img alt="Mickey Glove Pointing for directional sign" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Pointing-glove-copy.jpg"></p>
	<p><strong>Trademark law does not prevent you from using the 1928 Mickey character unless consumers will be misled into thinking your work is produced or sponsored by Disney.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>First, some background. <strong>Copyrights and trademarks are different.</strong> <strong><em>Copyrights</em></strong> cover creative works and prevent people from copying and adapting them without permission, with the goal of providing economic incentives to create and distribute cultural material. The US Constitution requires that these rights expire after a “limited time,” so that the public and future creators can have unfettered access to creative works.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trademarks</em></strong> cover words, logos, images, and other signifiers that serve as <em>brands</em> identifying the source of a product. The goal is to minimize consumer confusion in the marketplace. Nike can prevent other producers of athletic apparel from putting “Nike” or a swoosh on their merchandise so that when purchasers see those indicators, they know they are getting a Nike product. But it does not own the word “Nike” outright; there are lots of uses of “Nike” that do not violate trademark, whether referring to the Greek goddess of victory or to the brand in a non-confusing way.</p>
<p>Unlike copyrights, trademarks do not automatically expire. They can last as long as a mark is still being “used in commerce.” If Amazon goes on using the “Amazon” brand for 500 years, the trademark stays alive. While trademarks can outlast copyrights, however, the rights themselves are more circumscribed. For most marks, trademark law only prevents the use of a mark on similar products when it is likely to create consumer confusion about the product’s origin or sponsorship.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> Non-confusing uses are not prohibited, and there are a variety of legal safeguards for uses of trademarks in connection with expressive works such as films, books, and songs.</p>
<p>Sometimes copyrights and trademarks overlap.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> A character such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh might be covered both by copyright law (as a creative work) and trademark law (as a logo if, when people see the character on a backpack or pajamas, they think it must be official Disney merchandise). While the copyright is active, Disney can keep people from making unauthorized uses of Mickey in new works (unless those uses qualify for “fair use” protection, as with a parody). While the trademark is in effect, Disney can keep people from slapping Mickey on luggage or apparel.</p>
<p>“We have been careful to caution against misuse or overextension of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by . . . copyright.” <em>Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox</em> (Supreme Court 2003)</p>
<p>But what happens when the copyright <em>expires</em> and the trademark is ongoing? In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court made clear that trademarks cannot be used to make an end run around copyright law because this would “create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public’s federal right to copy and to use expired copyrights.”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> In other words, <strong>trademark rights cannot be used to block the freedoms that the expiration of copyright allows</strong>, such as using a public domain character in a new creative work. Along the same lines, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explained that when a work enters the public domain “[w]e all own it now” and trademark law “cannot be used to circumvent copyright law. If material covered by copyright law has passed into the public domain, it cannot then be protected by the Lanham Act [the federal trademark statute] without rendering the Copyright Act a nullity.”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> Those who tell you otherwise are mistaken.</p>
<p>This brings us to Mickey Mouse. The <em>Steamboat Willie </em>copyright expires in 2024. But Disney still retains trademark rights to use images of Mickey as well as the words “Mickey Mouse” in connection with a variety of products. Here are some of its federally registered Mickey images for merchandise such as clothing, backpacks, watches, linens, toys, blankets, lunch boxes, and water bottles.</p>
<p><img alt="Trademark image" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Mickey-logos1.png" width="45%"></p>
<p>Disney has also started using this logo before some of its films.</p>
<p><img alt="A logo for a movie" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Mickey-logo2.jpg" width="45%"></p>
<p>If you make your own Mickey cartoon, can Disney use trademark law to interfere? Trademark law is all about preventing consumer confusion – and not about getting in the way of creativity – so it depends on whether people are likely to be misled about the source of your cartoon. As long as no one thinks it is a Disney joint, there should not be a trademark problem.</p>
<p>When might consumers think you are offering a Disney-sponsored product? Here it is important to distinguish between different uses of the Mickey character. Certainly, there might be a risk of confusion if you use Mickey as a brand identifier on the kind of <em>merchandise</em> Disney sells. Trademark law does protect Disney against that risk. Consumers may also be confused if Mickey is used in an artistic work in a way that suggests it is a Disney production, for example by appearing as a logo at the beginning of an animation.</p>
<p>Contrast these uses with putting the Mickey character in a new cartoon or book. The latter is not the kind of use that misleads as to the <em>source</em> of a product. It is exactly what copyright expiration is intended to allow.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> Were trademark law to prevent this, then trademark rights would be leveraged to obtain the effective equivalent of a perpetual copyright—precisely what the Supreme Court said we cannot do. As mentioned earlier, one way to dispel potential confusion is to make it clear that you – and not Disney – are responsible for the new work, and to add a disclaimer making it clear that your work is <em>not</em> produced or sponsored by Disney.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the Mickey character, what about Disney’s trademark over the “Mickey Mouse” name? &nbsp;Here too putting the words “Mickey Mouse” on toys or onesies is different from using “Mickey Mouse” to describe the content of a new creative work. With the latter, a disclaimer is also helpful. One court explained: “When a public domain work is copied, along with its title, there is little likelihood of confusion when even the most minimal steps are taken to distinguish the publisher of the original from that of the copy. The public is receiving just what it believes it is receiving—the work with which the title has become associated. The public is not only unharmed, it is unconfused.”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a></p>
<p>With artistic uses of trademarked material, the First Amendment’s protection for freedom of expression also comes into play. Trademark law has a number of speech-protecting limitations that safeguard expressive uses. This is why when Mattel sues people for using “Barbie” in the titles of songs and photographs, they lose in court. Mattel also lost when it objected to the use of the doll’s trademarked <em>appearance </em>in a series of photographs criticizing its role in our culture.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a></p>
<p>One defense allows “nominative use” of a trademark as a point of reference – for example, using “Mickey Mouse” accurately to refer to the public domain character in your work. Another comes from a case called <em>Rogers v. Grimaldi</em>, which privileged the use of trademarks in titles of expressive works as long as the term has some artistic relevance to the new work and does not explicitly mislead as to the source of the work.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> The policy underlying this rule is that trademark law should only apply to artistic works when the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression. While a disclaimer is not required to benefit from these limitations, it can nevertheless be useful to make abundantly clear that you are not providing an official Disney production.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a small subset of extremely “famous” marks – essentially, superbrands – that receive extra “anti-dilution” protection against unauthorized uses that impair the distinctiveness or harm the reputation of the famous mark, even when there is no consumer confusion. While the mouse-ears silhouette or current iteration of the Mickey logo <em>might</em> fall into this category of famous marks, the Mickey character from <em>Steamboat Willie</em> does not.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a> (Just because a brand is “famous” for trademark purposes does not mean that all of its trademarks are considered famous; “Nike” is famous but many of its product names are not.) And even if Mickey 1.0 does eventually qualify, anti-dilution protection is subject to important First-Amendment exceptions that allow for the kinds of expressive uses discussed earlier.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a></p>
<p>Bottom line: trademark law has a number of rules designed to safeguard expressive uses and prevent trademark law from overriding copyright law. Nonetheless, people sometimes still try to use trademark law to interfere with legal reuses of public domain material, leading to unnecessary litigation and chilling effects. Zorro Productions, Inc. and Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. did this with the Zorro works and the Tarzan and John Carter works. Zorro lost in court—because the Zorro story was in the public domain, a new “Queen of Swords” TV series about Zorro’s sword-wielding daughter could proceed.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a> Burroughs was able to extract a joint licensing deal from the publisher of new “Lord of the Jungle” and “Warlord of Mars” comic books; even the threat of lawsuits can chill creative reuse. Going forward, will Disney’s legal actions reflect the relevant law, enforcing only the rights it still owns, or will it try to stop what copyright expiration allows?</p>

	<em>The Public Domain: A Wellspring of Creativity</em></h3>

<p>Think of all of the works spawned by public domain stories and characters, whether it is Shakespeare’s plays, Jane Austen’s novels, Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>, or Bram Stoker’s <em>Dracula</em>. Shakespeare alone has inspired hundreds of new creations. <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em> and <em>Kiss Me Kate</em>&nbsp;come from <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>, <em>West Side Story</em> from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>Forbidden Planet</em> from <em>The Tempest. </em>Shakespeare himself drew on his public domain predecessors. As a federal judge observed, if the underlying works were copyrighted, “<em>Measure for Measure</em> would infringe <em>Promos and Cassandra</em>, <em>Ragtime</em> would infringe <em>Michael Kohlhaas</em>, and <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> itself would have infringed Arthur Brooke’s <em>The Tragicall Historye of Romeo and Juliet</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which in turn would have infringed several earlier <em>Romeo and Juliets</em>, all of which probably would have infringed Ovid’s story of <em>Pyramus and Thisbe</em>.”</p>
<p>Disney and Mickey are part of this rich tradition, and in the end, Disney can continue to enjoy a plentiful intellectual property portfolio while also enriching the public domain. As mentioned earlier, Disney’s wonderful works exemplify just how valuable the public domain is. It has borrowed prolifically and brilliantly from the public domain, Disney-fying older works to make its beloved films: <em>The Three Muskateers</em> came from Alexandre Dumas, <em>A Christmas Carol</em> from Charles Dickens, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> from Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve, <em>Around the World in 80 Days</em> from Jules Verne, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> from Lewis Carroll, <em>Snow White</em> from The Brothers Grimm, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> from Victor Hugo, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> and <em>Cinderella</em> from Charles Perrault, <em>The Little Mermaid</em> from Hans Christian Anderson, <em>Pinocchio</em> from Carlo Collodi, <em>Huck Finn</em> from Mark Twain, <em>Robin Hood</em> from English folklore, and <em>Aladdin</em> from <em>The Book of One Thousand and One Nights</em>.</p>
<p>Let us hope that Disney remembers its own debt to the public domain as Mickey Mouse enters the realm from which it has drawn so heavily!</p>

	<hr size="1">
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <em>Steamboat Willie</em> was a technological marvel – one of the first cartoons featuring fully synchronized sound. After seeing the 1927 film <em>The Jazz Singer</em> (the first feature-length film with synchronized dialogue, <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2023/"> highlighted</a> on last year’s Public Domain Day page) Walt Disney realized that sound films were “here to stay.” See Dave Smith, Chief Archivist Emeritus, The Walt Disney Company, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/steamboat_willie.pdf"><em>Steamboat Willie</em></a>. With animator Ub Iwerks, he created <em>Steamboat Willie</em>. Disney himself performed the (mostly unintelligible) dialogue. The cartoon was a hit with audiences and lauded by critics for its ingenuity. It was initially set to enter the public domain in 1984, after a 56-year term. An expansion in 1978 pushed the date forward to 2004. Then in 1998 it was delayed until 2024 by the Copyright Term Extension Act (this is what some people call the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act”). There is even a possibility that <em>Steamboat Willie</em> might technically have gone into the public domain on release because of defects in its original copyright notice, cite, but in 2024 we know for sure that it is free of copyright.</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Mickey’s first appearances were actually in earlier cartoons from 1928, <em>Plane Crazy</em> and <em>The Gallopin’ Gaucho</em>. Both were silent films and neither attracted a distributor. It was Steamboat Willie – which had synchronized sound – that put Mickey on the map. The silent version of <em>Plane Crazy</em> is also entering the public domain 2024, with the sound version going into the public domain in 2025. We could not find a 1928 registration or timely renewal for <em>The Gallopin’ Gaucho</em>, but the copyright notice on the sound version says 1929, putting it in the public domain in 2025.</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Many have observed that “The Lion King” tracks an epic poem about Sundiata Keitam – whose name means “Lion Prince” – the founder of the Mali Empire. <em>See </em>Kellie Carter Jackson, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/17/true-story-behind-lion-king/" target="_blank">The true story behind “The Lion King.”</a> This article also tells the story of the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” which originated with South African Zulu singer Solomon Ntsele Linda; it is the subject of the Netflix documentary “ReMastered: The Lion’s Share.”</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> As described by Alva Johnston, Mickey and Chaplin “have the same blend of hero and coward, nit-wit and genius, mug and gentleman.” Walt Disney also studied other great silent film actors whose films we have celebrated on this site, including Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Laurel and Hardy.</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> <em>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</em> went into the public domain decades ago because its copyright was not renewed. The earlier Mickey cartoon from 1928, <em>The Gallopin’ Gaucho</em>, drew on the silent film <em>The Gaucho</em>, with Mickey echoing some of the titular character’s actions.</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a> We actually had a dress rehearsal on these questions in 2022 with Winnie-the-Pooh – who was then another newly public domain Disney character that reappeared in later, copyrighted works and was also covered by trademark rights – went into the public domain.

Dastar had repackaged parts of a public domain documentary, removing the original credits and presenting it as a Dastar production. Twentieth Century Fox owned the copyrights to the documentary before they expired and claimed that Dastar violated trademark law by passing off Fox’s work as its own and failing to attribute it to Fox.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>So let’s see how NMT data is reported via JFR.
Here’s a simple example program which allocates some off heap memory,
once using a good old <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html#direct-vs-non-direct-buffers-heading">direct byte buffer</a>,
and once using the new <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/454">Foreign Memory API</a>,
finalized in Java 22 with JEP 454
(it feels <em>so</em> nice to be able to allocate 4GB at once, something you couldn’t do before):</p><div>

</div><p>JFR records NMT events every second by default,
so I’ve sprinkled in some <code>sleep()</code> calls to make sure the program runs long enough and the different allocations are spread out a bit.
Just for the fun of it, I’m also using a top-level main method—as supported by <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/463">JEP 463</a>—and string templates for the log messages (<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/459">JEP 459</a>).</p><p>Let’s run this and see how those off-heap allocations are tracked by JFR.
Somewhat surprisingly, NMT in JFR is controlled via the <code>gc</code> setting, which must be set to a value of "normal", "detailed", "high", or "all" for recording NMT data.
This is the case for the <em>default</em> and <em>profile</em> JFR configurations which ship with the SDK,
so using either configuration will give you the NMT data.
Note though that in addition, NMT itself must be enabled using the <code>-XX:NativeMemoryTracking</code> JVM option:</p><div>

</div><p>Let’s open the recording in JDK Mission Control and see what we find.
As of version 8.3, JMC doesn’t have a bespoke view for displaying NMT data,
but the NMT events show up in the generic event browser view.
There are two event types, the first one being <a href="https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/jfrevents/#nativememoryusagetotal">"Total Native Memory Usage"</a>:</p><p>The two off-heap allocations of 1 GB (direct byte buffer) and 4 GB (Foreign Memory API) show up as expected as increases to the reserved and committed memory of the program.
We also see one of the advantages of the new Foreign Memory API:
the memory is deallocated as soon as the <code>Arena</code> object is closed,
whereas the JVM holds on to the memory of the byte buffer also after discarding the reference.
There’s no control over when this memory will be released exactly,
it will be done via a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36077641/java-when-does-direct-buffer-released">phantom-reference-based cleaner</a> some time after the GC has removed the associated buffer object.</p><p>The second new event type, <a href="https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/jfrevents/#nativememoryusage">"Native Memory Usage Per Type"</a>, provides a more fine grained view (when setting <code>-XX:NativeMemoryTracking</code> to <code>detail</code> rather than <code>summary</code>).
The off-heap allocations show up under the "Other" category there:</p><p><em>Update Dec 18:</em> As OpenJDK developer Eric Gahlin <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikGahlin/status/1736530559231201484">pointed out</a>,
you also can take a high-level view at the NMT events of a recording using the JDK’s <em>jfr</em> tool,
which provides two <a href="https://egahlin.github.io/2023/05/30/views.html">built-in views</a> for committed and reserved memory:</p><div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Qatar Airways has reportedly banned a YouTuber after he posted a negative review of a flight, and also fired the crew. The carrier’s approach here simply defies logic…</p>
<div id="ez-toc-container">

<h2 id="h-qatar-airways-bans-josh-cahill-over-unfavorable-review"><span id="qatar_airways_bans_josh_cahill_over_unfavorable_review"></span>Qatar Airways bans Josh Cahill over unfavorable review<span></span></h2>
<p>Josh Cahill is a popular YouTuber who reviews flights, and on Saturday he published a roughly 20-minute video about how he was “banned and bribed” by Qatar Airways. This followed an August 2023 video review he published, entitled “the shocking decline of Qatar Airways,” about an economy class flight that he took from Colombo to Doha.</p>
<p>Let me try to summarize what happened as briefly but accurately as possible, according to Josh:</p>
<ul>
<li>Days after he published the video review, Qatar Airways reached out to ask him to hop on a call, which he agreed to, and that included the company’s VP of corporate communications</li>
<li>Once on the call, the Qatar Airways representatives immediately said that whatever is talked about is off the record, which Josh didn’t agree to; he was then asked what his motive was for such a negative review</li>
<li>They said the video reflects negatively on the airline, and they offered Josh a free flight if he’s willing to delete the video, which he rejected</li>
<li>They then asked Josh to delete the negative comments on the video from Qatar Airways employees complaining about poor working conditions at the airline, which he also refused to do</li>
<li>A week later, he received an email informing him that an upcoming booking on Qatar Airways had been canceled, and that the airline can no longer permit additional bookings from him</li>
<li>The email references <a href="https://www.qatarairways.com/en-us/legal/conditions-of-carriage.html">articles 8 &amp; 12 of the contract of carriage</a>, which require permission in order to film on an aircraft, though that was never otherwise enforced for him or any other YouTubers publishing positive reviews</li>
<li>A short time later, Josh received an email from one of the flight attendants who was working his flight, acknowledging that “I know I gave you permission to film the interaction, but I must ask you to remove me from the video,” because “I was pressured to write a statement that I didn’t give you permission to be filmed,” and “if I don’t write it, I will most likely be dismissed”</li>
<li>Since Josh wasn’t willing to voluntarily take down the video, Qatar Airways took all of these statements from crew and sent them to YouTube, demanding that the video be removed for privacy reasons </li>
<li>For those with an IP address in Qatar, Josh’s initial flight review has apparently been blocked, so that you can no longer watch it</li>
<li>While Josh can’t personally vouch for this, he claims that many sources have told him that the entire crew was terminated after the airline wasn’t able to remove the video</li>
</ul>
<p>You can watch the video for yourself below…</p>

<h2 id="h-my-take-on-this-qatar-airways-situation"><span id="my_take_on_this_qatar_airways_situation"></span>My take on this Qatar Airways situation<span></span></h2>
<p>It’s kind of unbelievable how much an airline can get in its own way. I mean, my gosh, how much more poorly could Qatar Airways have handled this? The unprofessionalism and short-sightedness here is astounding. </p>
<p>The best thing Qatar Airways could have done is to either issue an apology for the poor experience or to just ignore the video. Frankly, the video wasn’t even that negative, though Josh does tend to have rather dramatic video titles.</p>
<p>All Qatar Airways has done with its response is to draw way more attention to what happened, which seems to be the opposite of what the goal was. I mean, when he rejected the free flight and said he wasn’t willing to speak off the record, didn’t they get a sense that he would make a video about it? And did they think they would look good in it?</p>

<p>And let’s not even talk about the concept of forcing an employee to email Josh to literally admit that they were being told to lie in order to save their jobs. Some people should be fired here for incompetence, but it shouldn’t be the crew of the flight…</p>
<p>I understand in a country like Qatar, it’s easy enough to control the narrative of things, and force people to do what you’d like, if you have enough money or power. However, that approach doesn’t work when you’re trying to run a global airline. And while it’s absolutely within the carrier’s rights to ban passengers for whatever reason, it’s not a great look if you’re trying to make the airline or country have wide appeal.</p>
<p>Now, I think there’s one very important point to acknowledge, and it kind of sheds some light on how this all played out. This happened while Akbar Al Baker was still CEO of Qatar Airways, as he <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/qatar-airways-ceo-akbar-al-baker-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suddenly resigned several weeks ago</a>. He was known for creating a culture of fear, and where so many decisions were driven by what “the chief” wanted, rather than actually using logic.</p>
<p>So it’s easy enough to figure out exactly how this happened. Al Baker was somehow made aware of this video, and told his minions to have the video removed. Then everyone did everything they could to get that result, rather than pointing out to him that this might not be a good idea.</p>
<p>But there’s some good news. Qatar Airways’ new CEO,&nbsp;Badr Mohammed Al Meer, has <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/new-qatar-airways-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared some refreshing new priorities</a> for the airline, including stating that creating “a culture of trust and empowerment will be the building blocks of our shared success.” </p>
<p>So far there’s actually some substance to this, as he has <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/qatar-airways-ends-employee-curfew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended the controversial employee curfew</a> that existed for years within weeks of starting his job. Hopefully this is the first of many changes. I think it would be really smart of him to undo this and apologize for the way that Qatar Airways handled this.</p>

<h2 id="h-bottom-line"><span id="bottom_line"></span>Bottom line<span></span></h2>
<p>Qatar Airways has banned a popular YouTuber after he posted a negative review of a flight back in August. The airline first tried to get him to remove the video by offering him a free flight, then had the crew email him to revoke permission to appear in the video, and then approached YouTube directly. </p>
<p>This happened under the Al Baker “regime,” so here’s to hoping under Qatar Airways’ new CEO, things change a bit… </p>
<p><strong>What do you make of this Qatar Airways and Josh Cahill situation?</strong></p>

Your seat at the pantheon of famed tech bros like Adam Neumann, Elizabeth Holmes, and Sam Bankman-Fried. </p><p>VCs can be a curious bunch, however. They have a special secret language — a dialect that’s borderline incomprehensible to the uninitiated.</p><p>For instance, much like the Inuit people, who have many words for snow, were you aware that venture capitalists have more than 400 words for “no”?</p><p><span>Language betrays purpose.

None were brave enough to rip off the poisoned shirt we had woven for ourselves:</p><p><em>“Talk to us again when you have traction.”</em></p><p><span>In our first-time founder naïveté, we took this to heart. Our startup lived or died on whether we had </span><em>traction</em><span>.</span></p><p>Screw talking to users. Screw validation. We needed to get our product out of stealth mode and into the open. First, we’d take the market by storm. Then, we’d hoover up those promised VC dollars.</p><p><span>For our two-sided marketplace startup, this meant Android and iOS apps for customers, and </span><em>another pair of apps</em><span> for mechanics. 6 months later, we released our fully-fledged MVP to a deafening silence from customers, mechanics, and investors.</span></p><p>The junior VCs didn’t speak to us again.</p><p>My second startup fared far better.</p><p>Carbn was an app to help people develop green habits. It was a marked improvement — we were only building the iOS app and barrelled from customer validation to MVP in our first 4 months!</p><p>From here, we had a few months of bootstrapping left in us and were desperate for our first capital injection. Unfortunately, we heard another classic refrain from the venture capitalists:</p><p><em>“We think you’re too early for us, speak to us when you raise your next round.”</em></p><p>Admittedly, that was fair when we had zero revenue and low-thousands of users. We weren’t fazed — we approached various angel syndicates, accelerators and exhausted all the goodwill we could muster via our networks.</p><p><span>Through the complementary magic of a </span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/carbn-cut-carbon-footprint/id1533681322" rel="">strong early app store rating</a><span> and my socially hypercompetent cofounder, we landed </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/carbn" rel="">a cool £200k in angel funding</a><span>.</span></p><p>With a business bank account brimming with angel funding, we went on a hiring spree and maintained a consistent 10% week-on-week DAU growth — nothing to sniff at. But was it enough?</p><p>We were wrestling with a critical strategic issue: Should we remain a B2C consumer habits app or position ourselves in the B2B space as a climate-conscious employee perk? Having dipped our toes into both approaches, we’d hit our pre-seed growth targets and began to reach out to VCs for our next round.</p><p><span>We encountered the customary mix of ghosting, half-arsed lukewarm interest and genuine leads. This time, as well as the classic </span><em>“come to us with more traction”</em><span> and </span><em>“talk to us in your next round,”</em><span> we had some bigger fish biting for a second meeting.</span></p><p><span>We’d been speaking with a partner at a top-tier Silicon Valley VC. He was enthusiastic about Carbn, and asked us to present at their Monday Partner Meeting. Our presentation and subsequent conversation lasted over 2 hours. They told us they saw us becoming </span><em>the</em><span> climate B2C play. We felt it went well.</span></p><p>February 2022.</p><p>I was suffering the worst norovirus of my life. I’d been playing Elden Ring for 10 hours straight. I couldn’t tell whether I was dying more in-game or in real life.</p><p>We got the call from the VC.</p><p><em>“We like you, we want to invest, you should start hiring now.”</em></p><p>I was in too much pain to feel any satisfaction. Surely this was the VC funding I’d been waiting for my whole life? Through my fever delirium, I saw myself on the cover of Forbes, high-fiving the Fyre Festival guy.</p><p><span>My cofounder and I switched gears </span><em>hard</em><span> to focus on landing top-tier talent for our nascent engineering, product, and growth departments. In the meantime, we sent draft terms to our VC and… crickets.</span></p><p><span>The markets were spooked by some </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60454795" rel="">geopolitical shenanigans</a><span>, and VCs were suddenly hesitant to dole out cash at 2021 valuations. As our other leads ran cold, we held onto the hope that our deal was still in the bag.</span></p><p>Cue months of umming and ahhing from our friend in Silicon Valley. After their white-hot conviction about the B2C opportunity for a climate action app, our VC developed a newfound passion for the comfortable cashflow prospects of a B2B proposition.</p><p>Which we would have been fine with had the markets not been deteriorating further, and our borderline deal was consequently losing its lustre.</p><p>It eventually became clear that our seed round wasn’t happening. My cofounder and I agreed to call it a day.</p><p><span>Let’s delve deeper into </span><em>VCspeak</em><span>. We’ll analyze the VC rejections I’ve encountered and try to find the true meaning behind the words.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>When they say:</strong><em><strong> </strong><span>“Talk to us again when you have traction.”</span></em></p><p><strong>They really mean: </strong><em>“If you prove there is a market opportunity and that you can execute as a management team, then we might consider you. But because I don’t believe either of those things will happen, I will not be taking a risk on you”.</em></p></blockquote><p>Passing on Fixr was the correct choice. In retrospect, there was no chance our management team was capable of successfully creating a two-sided marketplace, which is widely regarded as the hardest kind of startup to build. Don’t get me started on the abysmal decision to build 4 native apps on 2 platforms before we had a single  transaction.</p><blockquote><p><strong>When they say: </strong><em>“We think you’re too early for us, speak to us when you raise your next round.”</em></p><p><strong>They really mean: </strong><em>“We’re an early-stage fund, but generally speaking, we only invest pre-seed in second-time founders and people with executive-level industry experience in this sector. We like the opportunity but don’t believe your management team is the right one in which to invest.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Again, this is a pretty reasonable stance. While VC is inherently risky, these risks can be mitigated by backing management teams with a proven track record. Naturally, the riskiest pre-seed dollars are allocated accordingly to increase the chances of achieving a 3x ‘venture rate of return’ for a given VC fund.</p><blockquote><p><strong>When they say: </strong><em>“We like you, we want to invest, you should start hiring now.”</em></p><p><strong>They really mean: </strong><em>“We do really like your vibe as a founding team. We see your potential. We do genuinely want to invest, and want to set you up to move quickly once the deal closes. Please note however that this is neither a term sheet or a wire transfer. Perhaps we want more time to evaluate other options in the space. We lack conviction.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Venture capitalists are a famously fickle bunch. One day, they can be keen as a bean on your lean, mean, consumer business. The next day, Putin invades Ukraine and you’re a borderline B2B prospect that needs to show unit economics.</p><p>My story is typical of my fellow failed founders — some gaffes in our early ventures as we learn the ropes, a few promising steps as we gain entrepreneurial experience, and a veritable funding brick wall in 2022.</p><p>Here are some quick and dirty thoughts to keep your head screwed on right as you look for startup funding:</p><ol><li><p>If a VC gives a reason for turning you down, don’t necessarily take it at face value.</p></li><li><p>Be self-critical about your management and the market. Your team or the opportunity might just not be right.</p></li><li><p><span>For your first round, it’s </span><em>much</em><span> easier to convince a single angel investor than a roomful of VC partners.</span></p></li><li><p>When you land a lead angel investor, the rest become easier to find.</p></li><li><p>If you aren’t a big dog in your industry or haven’t had a startup exit before, the bar for pre-seed VC investment is pretty high.</p></li><li><p>In a VC firm, you need an influential internal champion who will fight hard for your startup.</p></li><li><p>Don’t play coy with VCs. Don’t stop talking to them, and don’t let a term sheet get away before the market turns.</p></li><li><p>“Yes” doesn’t always mean “yes”. Your raise isn’t over until a wire transfer hits your account.</p></li><li><p>VC funding is cool and all, but essentially, it is a waste of time if you haven’t validated your market: bootstrapping to get paying customers quickly is the most effective tactic available.</p></li><li><p><span>In all honesty, you don’t </span><em>want </em><span>to take external funding unless you have intensely strong user growth; and being unable to hire becomes your bottleneck.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Have you encountered any rejections we could add to our </span><em>VCspeak</em><span> phrasebook? Do you have any hard-earned wisdom to append to the survival guide? Let us know in the comments!</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">And of course: Thank you for taking the time to translate FSearch!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current Limitations</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Sorting lots of results by <em>Type</em> can be very slow, since gathering that information is expensive, and the data isn't
indexed. This also means that when the view is sorted by <em>Type</em>, searching will reset the sort order to <em>Name</em>.</li>
<li>Using the <em>Move to Trash</em> option doesn't update the database index, so trashed files/folders show up in the result
list as if nothing happened to them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why yet another search utility?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Performance. On Windows I really like to use Everything Search Engine. It provides instant results as you type for all
your files and lots of useful features (regex, filters, bookmarks, ...). On Linux I couldn't find anything that's even
remotely as fast and powerful.</p>
<p dir="auto">Before I started working on FSearch, I took a look at existing solutions. I tried MATE Search Tool (formerly GNOME
Search Tool), Recoll, Krusader (locate based search), SpaceFM File Search, Nautilus, ANGRYsearch and Catfish, to find
out whether it makes sense to improve those. However, they're not exactly what I was looking for:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>standalone application (not part of a file manager)</li>
<li>written in a language with C like performance</li>
<li>no dependencies to any specific desktop environment</li>
<li>Qt5 or GTK3 based</li>
<li>small memory usage (both hard drive and RAM)</li>
<li>target audience: advanced users</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Looking for a command line interface?</h2>
<p dir="auto">I highly recommend <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> or the obvious tools: find and (m)locate</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why GTK3 and not Qt5?</h2>
<p dir="auto">I like both of them, and my long term goal is to provide console, GTK3 and Qt5 interfaces, or at least make it easy for
others to build those. However, for the time being it's only GTK3 because I like C more than C++, and I'm more familiar
with GTK development.</p>
