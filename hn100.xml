<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>LOS ANGELES</i> – A YouTuber pilot was sentenced today to six months in federal prison for obstructing a federal investigation by deliberately destroying the wreckage of an airplane that he intentionally crashed in Santa Barbara County to gain online views.</p>

<p>Trevor Daniel Jacob, 30, of Lompoc, was sentenced by United States District Judge John F. Walter.</p>

<p>Jacob pleaded guilty on June 30 to one count of destruction and concealment with the intent to obstruct a federal investigation.</p>

<p>Jacob is an experienced pilot, skydiver and former Olympic athlete who had secured a sponsorship from a company that sold various products, including a wallet. Pursuant to the sponsorship deal, Jacob agreed to promote the company’s wallet in a YouTube video that he would post.</p>

<p>On November 24, 2021, Jacob took off in his airplane from Lompoc City Airport on a solo flight purportedly destined for Mammoth Lakes. Jacob did not intend to reach his destination, but instead planned to eject from his aircraft during the flight and video himself parachuting to the ground and his airplane as it descended and crashed.</p>

<p>Prior to taking off, Jacob mounted several video cameras on different parts of the airplane and equipped himself with a parachute, video camera and selfie stick. Approximately 35 minutes after taking off, while flying above the Los Padres National Forest near Santa Maria, Jacob ejected from the airplane and videoed himself parachuting to the ground.</p>

<p>Using the video camera mounted on the selfie stick and the video cameras he mounted on the airplane, Jacob was able to record the airplane as it descended and crashed into a dry brush area in Los Padres National Forest. After parachuting to the ground, Jacob hiked to the location of the wreck and recovered the data containing the video recording of his flight and the crash of the airplane.</p>

<p>On November 26, 2021, Jacob informed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) about the plane crash. The NTSB, which launched an investigation into the crash on or about that same day, told Jacob that he was responsible for preserving the wreckage so the agency could examine it. Jacob agreed to determine the crash location and provide both the coordinates of the downed plane and videos of the crash to NTSB investigators. Three days later, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched its own investigation into the plane crash.</p>

<p>In the weeks following the plane crash, Jacob lied to investigators that he did not know the wreckage’s location. In fact, on December 10, 2021, Jacob and a friend flew by helicopter to the wreckage site. There, Jacob used straps to secure the wreckage, which the helicopter lifted and carried to Rancho Sisquoc in Santa Barbara County, where it was loaded onto a trailer attached to Jacob’s pickup truck.</p>

<p>Jacob drove the wreckage to Lompoc City Airport and unloaded it in a hangar. He then cut up and destroyed the airplane wreckage and, over the course of a few days, deposited the detached parts of the wrecked airplane into trash bins at the airport and elsewhere, which was done with the intent to obstruct federal authorities from investigating the November 24 plane crash.</p>

<p>On December 23, 2021, Jacob uploaded a YouTube video titled, “I Crashed My Airplane,” that contained a promotion of the wallet and depicted him parachuting from the plane and the aircraft’s subsequent crash. Jacob intended to make money through the video.</p>

<p>Jacob lied to federal investigators when he submitted an aircraft accident incident report that falsely indicated that the aircraft experienced a full loss of power approximately 35 minutes after takeoff. Jacob also lied to an FAA aviation safety inspector when he said the airplane’s engine had quit and, because he could not identify any safe landing options, he had parachuted out of the plane.</p>

<p>“It appears that [Jacob] exercised exceptionally poor judgment in committing this offense,” prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum. “[Jacob] most likely committed this offense to generate social media and news coverage for himself and to obtain financial gain. Nevertheless, this type of ‘daredevil’ conduct cannot be tolerated.”</p>

<p>The United States Department of Transportation – Office of Inspector General investigated this matter. The NTSB and FAA provided substantial assistance.</p>

<p>Assistant United States Attorneys Dominique Caamano and Dennis Mitchell of the Environmental Crimes and Consumer Protection Section prosecuted this case.</p>

<!-- cache hit 332:single/related:333258fb8504cef9cf2c84ed2dd9e317 --><!-- empty -->
<p>After a spy camera designed to look like a towel hook was purchased on Amazon and illegally used for months to capture photos of a minor in her private bathroom, Amazon was sued.</p>
<p>The plaintiff—a former Brazilian foreign exchange student then living in West Virginia—argued that Amazon had inspected the camera three times and its safety team had failed to prevent allegedly severe, foreseeable harms still affecting her today.</p>
<p>Amazon hoped the court would dismiss the suit, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/west-virginia/wvsdce/3:2023cv00046/235914/24/">arguing</a> that the platform wasn't responsible for the alleged criminal conduct harming the minor. But after nearly eight months deliberating, a judge recently largely denied the tech giant's motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>Amazon's biggest problem persuading the judge was seemingly the product descriptions that the platform approved. An <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-amended-complaint-3-31-2023.pdf">amended complaint</a> included a photo from Amazon's product listing that showed bathroom towels hanging on hooks that disguised the hidden camera. Text on that product image promoted the spycams, boasting that they "won't attract attention" because each hook appears to be "a very ordinary hook."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad.png" data-height="1152" data-width="1940" alt="Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint."><img alt="Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad-640x380.png" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad-1280x760.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad.png" data-height="1152" data-width="1940">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because "Amazon approved product descriptions suggesting consumers use" the spycam "to record private moments in a bathroom," US district judge Robert Chambers wrote, "Amazon cannot claim shock when a consumer does just that."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"These allegations raise a reasonable inference Amazon sold a camera knowing it would be used to record a third party in a bathroom without their consent," Chambers wrote.</p>
<p>Perhaps most alarming to the plaintiff, Amazon's Product Safety Team specifically inspected the camera to "ensure" that Amazon wasn't platforming a product being used to “infringe privacy,” “surreptitiously record others for sexual purposes,” or “create and store child sex abuse material.” That review allegedly did not prevent the spy cam from being used to do just that, the lawsuit alleged, putting consumers at risk of alleged harms suffered by the plaintiff, including "chronic tremors, insomnia, headaches, nausea, hypotension with associated blurred vision, dizziness, compulsive overeating, avoidance behavior, and paranoia."</p>
<p>In addition to refusing blame, Amazon unsuccessfully argued that none of those harms could be considered physical injury. To the contrary, Chambers wrote that "if proven," the plaintiff's physical harms are considered "severe" because "emotional trauma inflicted during a child’s 'tender years' has an 'indelible effect' from which 'they may never recover.'"</p>
<p>A lawyer for the plaintiff, Lee Javins, told Ars that he thinks this is an important issue for the court to explore. He commended the court for making the right decision after taking its time "to provide a thorough legal analysis" on legal theories that he said "haven't come up a lot with today's technology."</p>
<h2>A potentially “dangerous ruling” for spycam industry</h2>
<p>The plaintiff hopes a jury will decide that Amazon "had wanton, conscious, reckless, and outrageous indifference to the health, safety, and welfare of children."</p>
<p>She has also alleged that Amazon "conspired" with the spycam seller to "market and distribute a defective product both knew was intended and used for illegal and criminal purposes." Not only did Amazon allegedly "shape" the "marketing and promotion of the camera" by controlling "how products are depicted and the content of product listings and descriptions," but Amazon also "boosted the camera’s sales" with its "specialized algorithms," the lawsuit alleged.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>A loss for Amazon could put the online retailer on the hook for punitive damages. Amazon could also be ordered to stop selling the spycam used to harm the plaintiff and any products considered "identical" to that spycam. Chambers wrote that proving "foreseeability" of harms "is key" to defeating Amazon's defense.</p>
<p>Tech legal expert Eric Goldman <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/12/amazon-may-be-liable-for-merchants-spycam-m-s-v-amazon.htm">wrote</a> that a victory for the plaintiff could be considered "a dangerous ruling for the spy cam industry and for Amazon," because "the court’s analysis could indicate that all surreptitious hook cameras are categorically illegal to sell." That could prevent completely legal uses of cameras designed to look like clothes hooks, Goldman wrote, such as hypothetical in-home surveillance uses.</p>
<p>Now, discovery will proceed as the plaintiff can argue her case at trial. The trial could shed more light on "what Amazon’s Product Safety team thought when it evaluated this item," Goldman wrote.</p>
<p>Currently, Amazon advertises several "clothes hook hidden camera" products when users search for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22bathroom+spy+camera%22&amp;crid=WK1AEHNZLNQE&amp;sprefix=bathroom+spy+camera+%2Caps%2C96&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">"bathroom spy camera,"</a> an Ars search found, but it's unclear if the spy cam at the center of this lawsuit is still available on Amazon.</p>
<p>In his blog, Goldman pointed to an Amazon <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJDK7VLM/?tag=arstech20-20">online listing</a> that appeared to be the spycam in question. However, Javins told Ars that while that particular listing looked like the "same type of camera," it had a different product description from the spycam sold in the case, where "the whole vibe" of the listing "was just kind of creepy."</p>
<p>Ars unsuccessfully attempted to contact Amazon for comment on the judge's order and the online listing Goldman found. Shortly after submitting that request, Amazon appears to have removed the online listing but has not yet offered Ars any explanation.</p>

This rate excludes tips and is just a minimum, so Dashers still have the opportunity to earn more than the minimum. Dasher earnings will be reviewed weekly to see if their DoorDash pay meets the earnings minimum, and any Dashers who earn below the required minimum will receive a pay adjustment. </p><h2>Moving tipping to after checkout in preparation for increased fees </h2><p>These new regulations will force us to raise fees for orders in New York City. In order to better balance the impact of these new costs, we’re moving the option to tip in the DoorDash app to <a href="https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/Can-I-adjust-the-tip-I-provide-to-my-Dasher" rel="noopener">after checkout</a>. This change comes as a <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/workers/Delivery-Worker-Study-November-2022.pdf" rel="noopener">recommendation</a> by the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, and has been done to help ensure our platform remains affordable for all New Yorkers. </p><p>However, we know tips are still an important way for consumers to show Dashers their appreciation, so consumers will still be able to tip after checkout and for up to 30 days after they order. As always, 100% of a consumer’s tip goes to the Dasher.</p><h2>Pausing our Dasher Priority Access program</h2><p>With the changes required by NYC and the impact it will have on our system, we are pausing our Priority Access program, which gives Dashers who have high ratings priority on higher-paying offers. Since Dashers will earn a guaranteed minimum rate, the benefits offered by this program will not apply in NYC. The Top Dasher program is still available for qualified NYC Dashers.</p><p>We know that these are significant changes for the way Dashers will use the platform, and we always seek feedback from them on important topics like app functionality, new features, and public policy. We sent early communications to some Dashers making them aware of changes that would be coming to the platform and provided an opportunity to offer feedback so that we could most effectively implement these changes. </p><p>We anticipate needing to make other operational changes in response to these new regulations that will further impact the experience of consumers, Dashers, and merchants on DoorDash in New York City. In the meantime, we will continue to engage with policymakers and focus on what matters most: continuing to serve communities across New York City.</p></article></div>]]></description>

    <h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, is a practical, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">turing-complete</a><a href="#turning-complete">[1]</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming">stack-based</a> programming language based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>,
        the markup language. It uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">elements
        defined in HTML</a>, the markup language, in order to do computations.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give you a sense of what HTML, the programming langauge, looks like, below is a sample program that prints
        the values from 1 to 10 to standard out (<code>console.log</code>)
    </p>

    <figure>
        <figcaption>A Sample HTML Program</figcaption>
        <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;      &lt;!-- push 1 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;output id="loop"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;  &lt;!-- print the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;      &lt;!-- push 1 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;                    &lt;!-- add 1 --&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;                    &lt;!-- dup new value --&gt;
&lt;data value="11"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;     &lt;!-- push 11 to compare --&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;                  &lt;!-- test new value is smaller than 11 --&gt;
&lt;i&gt;                          &lt;!-- if bigger than zero pushed true --&gt;
    &lt;a href="#loop"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;!-- then jump back to the loop --&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    </pre>
    </figure>

    <p>
        HTML programs are specified in HTML, the markup language. Elements from HTML, the markup language, (informally
        referred to as "tags") are interpreted as <i>commands</i> by the HTML interpreter. Note that HTML programs
        are <em>not</em> required to be legal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>, the markup
        language, documents.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML is a <a href="#extending">fully customizable</a> programming language and you may add new
        commands or alter existing commands by mutating the <code>html.meta.commands</code> object.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="installation"><a href="#installation">Installation</a></h2>
    <p>
        To install HTML, the programming language, <a href="https://html-lang.org/html.js" download="">download</a> and include the
        <code>html.js</code> file via a script tag:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;script src="html.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        You may now begin programming in HTML.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="getting-started"><a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
    <p>
        To get started with HTML, the programming language, you must first understand how a
        <i>stack-oriented</i> programming language works. In a stack-oriented programming language, most operations are
        done with reference to a <i>stack</i> of values.
    </p>

        In HTML, this is referred to as <i>the value stack</i> or, informally, as "the stack".  In HTML, the stack is
        maintained in the current <em>execution frame</em> (either the main HTML program or within a function defined in HTML),
        rather than as a global stack, as in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">forth-like</a> languages. (In this regard,
        HTML, the programming language, is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6">similar to the JVM</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Stack-oriented programming can seem strange to developers who have not worked with it before, so let's begin
        with a simple "Hello World" program in HTML:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;main&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;Hello World!&lt;/s&gt;     &lt;!-- push 'Hello World!' onto the stack --&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;       &lt;!-- print the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
 </pre>
    <p>
        The first thing to note is that in HTML a program is defined in a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next thing to notice is that the program consists of a series of HTML tags within the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag.
        For the "Hello World" program, the first command is a <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> tag.  This will <a href="#strings">"push"
        the string value <code>"Hello World!"</code></a> onto the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next command is the <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag.  This will <a href="#output">output the top of the
       value stack to standard out</a>, which is <code>console.log</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Note that the <code>output</code> tag <b>does not</b> consume the top of the value stack.)
    </p>
    <p>
        A more elaborate example of using the value stack would be adding 2 and 3, like so:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;main&gt;
  &lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;     &lt;!-- push 2 onto the stack --&gt;
  &lt;data value="3"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;     &lt;!-- push 3 onto the stack --&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;                   &lt;!-- add the top two values on the stack --&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;           &lt;!-- print the sum now on the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this HTML program, we push the values 2 and 3 onto the value stack <a href="#numbers">using <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> tags</a>, and
        then invoke the <code>dd</code> command to <a href="#addition">"a(dd)" the top two values on the stack</a> .
        The <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> command will "pop", or remove, the top two values of the value stack, add
        them together, and then "push" the result onto the top of the value stack. Next, we print the result out
        using the <code>output</code> tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a stack-oriented language like HTML, this is how things are done: pushing and popping values on the
        stack in order to do computations.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that brief introduction out of the way, let's go over the entire language so you can add HTML, the
        programming language, to your resume.

<section>
    <h2 id="literals"><a href="#literals">Literal Values</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML supports many different literals that can be used to push values onto the value stack.
    </p>

    <h3 id="numbers"><a href="#numbers">Numbers</a></h3>
    <p>
        Numbers can be pushed onto  the value stack using the <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> tag:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the numeric value 1 onto the value stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="strings"><a href="#strings">Strings</a></h3>
    <p>
        Strings can be pushed onto  the value stack using the <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> tag.  The inner content
        of the tag will be treated as a string.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the string "Hello Strings!" onto the value stack --&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Hello Strings!&lt;/s&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="arrays"><a href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h3>
    <p>
        Arrays can be pushed onto  the value stack using the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag, containing <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
        elements.  The child elements of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> will be executed and the top value of the stack
        after they are evaluated will be inserted into the array.  If there are excess values on the value stack
        after an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> has executed its children, they will be removed.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the array [1, 2] onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="objects"><a href="#objects">Objects</a></h3>
    <p>
        Objects can be pushed onto  the value stack using the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag, containing <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>
        and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>elements.  <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> elements will be used as property names, using the
        innerText of the elements.  The child elements of the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> will be executed and the top value of
        the stack after they are evaluated will be used as the value for the corresponding <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> .  If
        there are excess values on the value stack after a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> has executed its children, they will be
        removed.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the object {foo:"Foo", bar:10} onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;
          foo
        &lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;
          bar
        &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
          &lt;s&gt;Foo&lt;/s&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;data value="10"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="true"><a href="#true">true, false &amp; null</a></h3>
    <p>
        The values <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>null</code> can all be accessed with the
        <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> command.  These are defined as <a href="#variables">variables</a> at the start of every
        new activation frame (aka scope).  Note that it is possible to override these variables with different values,
        such as setting <code>null</code> to <code>"lmao"</code>, but that we do not recommend doing so in most cases.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes true onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;true&lt;/cite&gt;

    <p>
        HTML offers support for common mathematical operators, utilizing the value stack.
    </p>

    <h3 id="addition"><a href="#addition">Addition</a></h3>
    <p>
        Addition can be performed with the <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> (a<b>dd</b>) tag.  This tag will pop the top
        two values off the value stack, add the top value to the second to the top value, and
        then push the result back onto the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this dd tag will add 1 to 2 and push the result onto
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        Note that addition can also be used for string concatenation, as in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h3 id="subtraction"><a href="#subtraction">Subtraction</a></h3>
    <p>
        Subtraction can be performed with the <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> tag.  This tag will pop the top
        two values off the value stack, subtracting the top value from the second to the top value, and
        then push the result back onto the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this sub tag will subtract 1 from 2 and push the result onto
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="multiplication"><a href="#multiplication">Multiplication</a></h3>
    <p>
        Multiplication can be performed with the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> (m<b>ul</b>) tag.  This tag will pop the top
        two values off the value stack, multiply the top value by the second to the top value, and
        then push the product back onto the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="3"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this ul tag will multiply 2 to 3 and push the result onto
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="division"><a href="#division">Division</a></h3>
    <p>
        Division can be performed with the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag.  This tag will pop the top
        two values off the value stack, divide the second to the top value by the top value, and
        then push the result back onto the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="6"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="3"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this div tag will divide 6 by 3 and push the result onto
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>

<section>
    <h2 id="stack"><a href="#stack">Stack Operations</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML offers commands for direct manipulation the stack.
    </p>

    <h3 id="duplicate"><a href="#duplicate">Duplicate</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can duplicate the value on the top of the stack using the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> (duplicate top) tag.  This
        is useful in cases where you want to use a value more than once for operations that would consume the value, such
        as <a href="#if">an if/else</a> situation.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push a second 1 onto the top of
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="delete"><a href="#delete">Delete</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can delete/pop the value on the top of the stack using the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> tag.

    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will remove the 1 on the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt;
    </pre>

</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="comparison"><a href="#comparison">Comparison Operations</a></h2>
    <p>
        In HTML, comparisons such as less than, equal, etc. are done on the value stack.  Comparison
        commands compare two values and leave a boolean on the top of the value stack, which can then
        be used with the <a href="#if">"if" command</a> to do conditional execution.
    </p>

    <h3 id="smaller"><a href="#smaller">Less Than</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can test if a value is smaller than another value by using the <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>
        tag.  This will pop the top two values off the value stack and push true second to top value
        is smaller (&lt;) than the top value, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since 1 is smaller than 2 --&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="big"><a href="#big">Greater Than</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can test if a value is smaller than another value by using the <code>&lt;big&gt;</code>
        tag.  This will pop the top two values off the value stack and push true second to top value
        is larger (&gt;) than the top value, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push false onto the stack, since 1 is not bigger than 2 --&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="eq"><a href="#eq">Equal (Mostly)</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can test if a value is equal (mostly) than another value by using the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
        tag.  This will pop the top two values off the value stack and push true second to top value
        is equal (==) than the top value, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that we say "equal (mostly)" because the equality operator in JavaScript (which HTML, the programming language,
        is implemented in) has
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality">interesting</a>
        semantics.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;s&gt;1&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since "1" is equal to 1 --&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    </pre>

</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="logical"><a href="#logical">Logical Operations</a></h2>
    <p>
        As with comparisons in HTML, logical operations such as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, etc. are done on the value stack.
        Logical operations apply to values on the value stack and will leave a boolean on the top of the value stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        All logical operators start with a "b" for "boolean", to make things easier to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that HTML, the programming language, follows JavaScript, the programming language's (sic)
        semantics regarding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy"> "truthiness"</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="and"><a href="#and">And</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can logically "and" the top two values on the value stack using the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>
        command.  This will pop the top two values off the stack and push the result of them being "anded"
        together.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;cite&gt;true&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since true &amp;&amp; 1 is true --&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="or"><a href="#or">Or</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can logically "or" the top two values on the value stack using the <code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code>
        command.  This will pop the top two values off the stack and push the result of them being "anded"
        together.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;cite&gt;true&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;false&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since true || false is true --&gt;
&lt;bdo&gt;&lt;/bdo&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="invert"><a href="#invert">Invert/Not</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can invert the top value on the value stack using the <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code>
        command.  This will pop the top value off the stack and push the result of it being inverted (<code>true</code>
        becomes <code>false</code>, <code>false</code> becomes <code>true</code>).
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;cite&gt;false&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since !false is true --&gt;
&lt;bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
    </pre>

<section>
    <h2 id="control-flow"><a href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, provides three mechanisms for control flow.  While these mechanisms may seem primitive,
        the can be used to implement any sort of arbitrary control flow pattern you would like.
    </p>

    <h3 id="if"><a href="#if">If (Conditional Execution)</a></h3>
    <p>
        Conditional execution can be achieved by using the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (if) tag/command.
        This command will pop the top value off the value stack, and, if it is "truthy", will execute
        all children commands/tags defined inside of it.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- test if 1 is equal to 1 --&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!-- Since true is on the stack, the child tags/commands will execute here --&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;Yep, 1 == 1&lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        If you wish to achieve and if/else like flow, you can conveniently <a href="#duplicate">duplicate</a> the boolean
        on the top of the stack, use an <code>&lt;i/&gt;</code> to test the first case (which will consume the top boolean)
        and then invert the boolean using <a href="#invert"><code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> </a> and test again using <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This gives you a clean and easy to use "if/else" style statement:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- test if 1 is equal to 1 --&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!-- duplicate the result (false) --&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;!-- Since false is on the stack, the child tags/commands will not execute here --&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;Yep, 1 == 2&lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;.output&gt;
  &lt;!-- remove the string from the top of the stack to be clean --&gt;
  &lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;!-- The second copy of false is at the top of the stack, so invert it to true --&gt;
&lt;bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;Nope, 1 == 2 isn't true, even in JavaScript&lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;.output&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="return"><a href="#return">Returning</a></h3>
    <p>
        If you wish to return from <a href="#functions">a function</a> (discussed below) or simply terminate the execution of
        a program, you may use the <code>&lt;rt&gt;</code> tag.  This will immediately stop execution in the
        current context and either return from a function or halt the execution of a program.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;s&gt;This will print...&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
&lt;rt&gt;&lt;/rt&gt;
&lt;s&gt;This will not print...&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="branching"><a href="#branching">Branching</a></h3>
    <p>
        To execute arbitrary jumps in an HTML, the programming language, you use the anchor tag: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>,
        by setting the <code>href</code> attribute to the id of the command you wish to jump to.  This allows you
        to implement things like loops, and can be coupled with conditional execution via the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>
        tag to implement powerful control flow patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a loop that will print from 1 to 10:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;      &lt;!-- push 1 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;output id="loop"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;  &lt;!-- print the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;      &lt;!-- push 1 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;                    &lt;!-- add 1 to the original value --&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;                    &lt;!-- dup new value --&gt;
&lt;data value="11"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;     &lt;!-- push 11 to compare --&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;              &lt;!-- test new value is smaller than 11 --&gt;
&lt;i&gt;                          &lt;!-- if smaller than 11 pushed true --&gt;
    &lt;a href="#loop"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;!-- then jump back to the loop --&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        The crux here is the anchor tag that references the <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag with the id
        <code>loop</code>.  When this anchor tag is executed it will send control back to that element
        to continue in the next iteration of the loop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that this jump back to the beginning of the loop is conditional on the top of the stack being
        less than 11.  Thus you can see that powerful control flow patterns can be created out of these primitive
        branching mechanisms.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2 id="variables"><a href="#variables">Variables</a></h2>
    <p>
        Variables in HTML, the programming language, are always "local" to the current context.  Global variables,
        defined in <code>window</code> can be resolved by name, but cannot be written to.  (You must use a property
        access on the <code>window</code> object to do that).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the values <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>null</code> are defined as variables
        and can be overwritten.  Again, we do not recommend this practice, but we are not judgy about it either.
    </p>

    <h3 id="cite"><a href="#cite">Referencing Variables</a></h3>
    <p>
        You push a variable onto the top of the value stack by using the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tag.  This will resolve
        the variable against the local scope first, and then against <code>window</code>, allowing you to load globally
        scoped variables.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since
        true is a variable with the value true --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;true&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="var"><a href="#var">Declaring &amp; Setting a Variable</a></h3>
    <p>
        You declare or set (same thing) a variable using the <code>&lt;var&gt;</code>
        tag.  This will pop the top value off the stack and save it into the variable slot with the
        name taken from the <code>title</code> attribute of the variable.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- push 1 onto the value stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this creates a locally scoped variable
        named 'x' with the value 1 in it --&gt;
&lt;var title="x"&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        Again, declaring and assigning variables in HTML, the programming language, is the same thing, so you may
        have multiple <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> tags that refer to the same variable name.

    <h2 id="io"><a href="#io">I/O</a></h2>
    <p>
        It's a little late in the game, since we've been using <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> a bunch already, but HTML, the programming language,
        supports simple I/O operations.  Of course, HTML, the programming language, can interact with the DOM using
        <a href="#functions">functions</a> in order to do I/O as well, but simple I/O can be accomplished directly in
        the language itself.
    </p>

    <h3 id="output"><a href="#output">Outputting Values</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can output the top of the stack by using the <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag.  This will <em>not</em> consume
        the value.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default the value will be printed to standard out (<code>console.log</code>).  You may change this by
        setting the <code>html.meta.out</code> configuration variable to another value.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this will print "Hello World!" to standard out --&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Hello World!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="input"><a href="#input">Getting User Input</a></h3>
    <p>
        Of course you can use the DOM to get user input if you would like.  But you can also use the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
        tag to get user input.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tag will prompt the user for input using the <code>prompt()</code> method in JavaScript.  The message
        shown to the user will be taken from the <code>placeholder</code> attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to ask for a number, rather than a string, from the user, you can set the <code>type</code> attribute
        of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> to <code>number</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result of the prompt will be pushed onto the top of the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this will ask the user for their name, then say hello in the console --&gt;
&lt;input placeholder="What is your name?"/&gt;
&lt;var title="name"&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Nice to meet you,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;name&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

        You can both read and write the properties of objects in HTML, the programming language.
    </p>

    <h3 id="reading-props"><a href="#reading-props">Reading Properties</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can read a property of the value on the top of the stack by using the <code>&lt;rp&gt;</code> (read property)
        tag.  The name of the property read will be the inner text of the tag.  This will consume the element the property is being
        read on, so duplicate the top of the stack if you wish to preserve it.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- load the document onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;document&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- load the body property onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;rp&gt;body&lt;/rp&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="setting-props"><a href="#setting-props">Setting Properties</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can set a property of an object using the <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> (set am property)
        tag.  The name of the property to set will be the inner text of the tag.  The value to set into the property
        must be on the top of the stack, and the object to set the property of must be second from the top of the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both the value being set into the object and the object will be consumed from the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- load the document onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;document&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- load the body property onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;body&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- push "Hello World!" onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Hello World!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;!-- set the innerHTML property of the body to "Hello World!" --&gt;
&lt;samp&gt;innerHTML&lt;/samp&gt;

    <h2 id="array-access"><a href="#array-access">Working With Arrays</a></h2>

    </p>

    <h3 id="reading-arrays"><a href="#reading-arrays">Reading An Array Value</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can read the value at an index in an array <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>tag.  This command will
        consume the top value of the value stack as the index to read from, and the second value from the
        top of the stack as the array to read the index from.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that this tag can also be used to reflectively access properties, by putting a string on the
        top of the stack rather than an integer.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the array [42, 33] onto the stack --&gt;

&lt;!-- push the value 0 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="0"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- consumes the 0 and the array, indexes into the array at position 0,

    <h3 id="writing-arrays"><a href="#writing-arrays">Writing An Array Value</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can write the value at an index in an array <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code>tag.  This command will

    <h2 id="functions"><a href="#functions">Functions</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, supports the declaration and invocation of functions.
    </p>

    <h3 id="defining-functions"><a href="#defining-functions">Defining Functions</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can define functions using the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag.  The name of the function will be
        taken from the <code>id</code> property of the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag.  The body of the function are the
        commands/tags within the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arguments passed to the function will be pushed onto the value stack.  So, if a function is invoked
        with the values (1, 2, 3), the initial value stack will be 3 on top, then 2, then 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is common for HTML, the programming language, programmers to save the arguments to a function int variables
        using the <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> command at the beginning of complex functions, in order to make it easier to
        refer to them.  (Note that this must be done in reverse order to the order that the parameters are received.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The return value of a function defined in HTML, the programming language, is the top value
        left on the value stack at the end of the function's execution.  There is no need to explicitly return this value
        with syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you can terminate a functions execution early by using the <a href="#return"><code>&lt;rt&gt;</code></a> command.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this defines a simple function that squares the argument --&gt;
&lt;def id="square"&gt;
    &lt;!-- duplicate the argument to the function, implicitly on the top of the stack --&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;!-- multiply it and return (leaving it on the top of the stack --&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/def&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="invoking-functions"><a href="#invoking-functions">Invoking Functions</a></h3>
    <p>
        To invoke functions, HTML, the programming language, reuses the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.
        If the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>'s <code>href</code> attribute begins with <code>javascript:</code>,
        it will invoke a function rather than jump to an element.
    </p>
    <p>
        The function that will be invoked is resolved by the name after the <code>javascript:</code>, but
        before the first open-parenthesis, <code>(</code>.  Note that arguments to the function defined
        in the <code>href</code> attribute are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, arguments are passed by executing <em>child</em> elements within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
        tag.  All elements within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag will be executed and then the <em>new</em> values
        that are pushed onto the value stack by the children will be removed from the stack and used as the arguments to the
        function.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a function is invoked, it's return value (if any), will be pushed onto the stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- invoke the square() function defined above, with the argument 12 --&gt;
&lt;a href="javascript:square()"&gt;
  &lt;data value="12"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!-- output the result (144) --&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>
    <h4 id="invoking-functions-objects"><a href="#invoking-functions-objects">Invoking Functions On Objects</a></h4>
    <p>
        If you wish to invoke a function on an object (rather than on the global <code>window</code> object), you
        can set the <code>target</code> attribute of the anchor tag to <code>_top</code>.  This will make it consume
        the top of the value stack and invoke the method on that object.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- load the document --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;document&lt;cite&gt;
&lt;!-- load all elements with the class .highlighted onto the stack
        by invoking the querySelectorAll() method on the docuemtn--&gt;
&lt;a href="javascript:querySelectorAll()"
      target="_top"&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;.highlighted&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!-- output the result --&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2 id="js"><a href="#js">JavaScript Integration</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, integrates cleanly with JavaScript. You can invoke JavaScript
        functions just like normal functions, and JavaScript functions can invoke HTML, The Programming
        Language as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript developers should be able to get comfortable with HTML, the programming language,
        very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also execute HTML, the programming language, "scriptlets" as strings in JavaScript,
        using the <code>html.exec()</code> utility function.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="config"><a href="#config">Configuring/Extending</a></h2>
    <p>
        You can configure the standard out and standard error of HTML, The Programming Langauge bu
        setting the <code>html.meta.out</code> and <code>html.meta.err</code> values to functions
        of your design.
    </p>

    <h3 id="extending"><a href="#extending">Extending</a></h3>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, can be extended or modified by adding or modifying the entries
        found in <code>html.meta.commands</code>, which map a tag name to a function that takes an element
        and context, and implements some sort of behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, if we wanted to make the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag print the entire value stack
        we could write something like this in JavaScript:
    </p>
    <pre>html.meta.commands["pre"] = function(elt, env) {
    console.log(env.stack);
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        With this definition you could then write the following code:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="3"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- will print the stack [1, 2, 3] to console.out --&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        You can also implement arbitrary control flow by returning the next element in the DOM to execute
        from this function.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="debugging"><a href="#debugging">Debugging</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, includes an integrated debugger, HDB, the HTML Debugger, to assist in debugging
        HTML programs. To access the debugger, insert a function callback into the <code>html.meta.debugger</code> field.
    </p>
    <pre>html.meta.debug = function(hdb, elt, env, cmd)
{
    // you can set a JavaScript breakpoint here
    hdb.break();
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        You can then add a breakpoint to an HTML element by adding the <code>data-hdb-breakpoint</code> attribute to it.
        This will cause the runtime to invoke the HDB debugger <em>before</em> the element is executed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The callback can have up to four parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>hdb</code> - The debugger</li>
        <li><code>elt</code> - The element to be executed</li>
        <li><code>env</code> - The current environment (including vars and the value stack)</li>
        <li><code>cmd</code> - The implementation of the command</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By setting a JavaScript breakpoint in the callback, you can inspect the current environment and command.  You
        can also invoke one of the following methods on the <code>hdb</code> object:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>step()</code> - Execute the current instruction and stop before the next one.</li>
        <li><code>continue()</code> - Stop debugging and continue until the next breakpoint (or the program finishes)</li>
        <li><code>jumpTo(elt)</code> - Don't execute the current element, instead jump to the given HTML element</li>
    </ul>

		<p>Richard Rosenfeld in the most recent <a href="https://asc41.org/wp-content/uploads/ASC-Criminologist-2023-11.pdf">Criminologist</a> published a piece about forecasting national level crime rates. People complain about the FBI releasing crime stats a year late, academics are worse; Richard provided “forecasts” for 2021 through 2025 for an article published in late 2023.</p>
<p>Even ignoring the stalecasts that Richard provided – these forecasts had/have no chance of being correct. Point forecasts will always be wrong – a more reasonable approach is to provide the prediction intervals for the forecasts. Showing error intervals around the forecasts will show how Richard interpreting minor trends is likely to be misleading.</p>
<p>Here I provide some analysis using ARIMA models (in python), to illustrate what reasonable forecast error looks like in this scenario, <a href="https://github.com/apwheele/Blog_Code/tree/master/Python/UCR_ARIMA">code and data on github</a>.</p>
<p>You can get the dataset on github, but just some upfront with loading the libraries I need and getting the data in the right format:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# via https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm
ucr = pd.read_csv('UCR_1960_2019.csv')
ucr['VRate'] = (ucr['Violent']/ucr['Population'])*100000
ucr['PRate'] = (ucr['Property']/ucr['Population'])*100000
ucr = ucr[['Year','VRate','PRate']]

# adding in more recent years via https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/docApi
# I should use original from counts/pop, I don't know where to find those though
y = [2020,2021,2022]
v = [398.5,387,380.7]
p = [1958.2,1832.3,1954.4]
ucr_new = pd.DataFrame(zip(y,v,p),columns = list(ucr))
ucr = pd.concat([ucr,ucr_new],axis=0)
ucr.index = pd.period_range(start='1960',end='2022',freq='A')

# Richard fits the model for 1960 through 2015
train = ucr.loc[ucr['Year'] &lt;= 2015,'VRate']</code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to fit our models. To make it as close to apples-to-apples as Richard’s paper, I just fit an ARIMA(1,1,2) model – I do not do a grid search for the best fitting model (also Richard states he has exogenous factors for inflation in the model, which I do not here). Note Richard says he fits an ARIMA(1,0,2) for the violent crime rates in the paper, but he also says he differenced the data, which is an ARIMA(1,1,2) model:</p>
<pre><code># Not sure if Richard's model had a trend term, here no trend
violent = ARIMA(train,order=(1,1,2),trend='n').fit()
violent.summary()</code></pre>
<p>This produces the output:</p>

<p>So some potential evidence of over-differencing (with the negative AR(1) coefficient). Looking at <code>violent.test_serial_correlation('ljungbox')</code> there is no significant serial auto-correlation in the residuals. One could use some sort of auto-arima approach to pick a “better” model (it clearly needs to be differenced at least once, also maybe should also be modeling the logged rate). But there is not much to squeeze out of this – pretty much all of the ARIMA models will produce very similar forecasts (and error intervals).</p>
<p>So in the statsmodels package, you can append new data and do one step ahead forecasts, so this is comparable to Richard’s out of sample one step ahead forecasts in the paper for 2016 through 2020:</p>
<pre><code># To make it apples to apples, only appending through 2020
av = (ucr['Year'] &gt; 2015) &amp; (ucr['Year'] &lt;= 2020)
violent = violent.append(ucr.loc[av,'VRate'], refit=False)

# Now can show insample predictions and forecasts
forecast = violent.get_prediction('2016','2025').summary_frame(alpha=0.05)</code></pre>
<p>If you <code>print(forecast)</code> below are the results. One of the things I want to note is that if you do one-step-ahead forecasts, here the years 2016 through 2020, the standad error is under 20 (this is well within Richard’s guesstimate to be useful it needs to be under 10% absolute error). When you start forecasting <em>multiple</em> years ahead though, the error compounds over time. So to forecast 2022, you need a forecast of 2021. To forecast 2023, you need to forecast 21,22 and then 23, etc.</p>

<p>The standard error scales pretty much like <code>sqrt(steps*se^2)</code> (it is additive in the variance). Richard’s forecasts do better than mine for some of the point estimates, but they are similar overall:</p>
<pre><code># Richard's estimates
forecast['Rosenfeld'] = [399.0,406.8,388.0,377.0,394.9] + [404.1,409.3,410.2,411.0,412.4]
forecast['Observed'] = ucr['VRate']

forecast['MAPE_Rick'] = 100*(forecast['Rosenfeld'] - forecast['Observed'])/forecast['Observed']</code></pre>

<p>So MAPE in the held out sample does worse than Rick’s models for the point estimates, but look at my prediction intervals – the observed values are still totally consistent with the model I have estimated here. Since this is a blog and I don’t need to wait for peer review, I can however update my forecasts given more recent data.</p>
<pre><code># Given updated data until end of series, lets do 23/24/25
violent = violent.append(ucr.loc[ucr['Year'] &gt; 2020,'VRate'], refit=False)
updated_forecast = violent.get_forecast(3).summary_frame(alpha=0.05)</code></pre>
<p>And here are my predictions:</p>
<pre><code>VRate        mean    mean_se  mean_ci_lower  mean_ci_upper
2023   371.977798  19.813228     333.144584     410.811012

<p>You really need to graph these out to get a sense of the magnitude of the errors:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apwheele/Blog_Code/master/Python/UCR_ARIMA/ForecastViolent.png"></p>
<p>Note how Richard’s 2021 and 2022 forecasts and general increasing trend have already been proven to be wrong. But it really doesn’t matter – any reasonable model that admitted uncertainty would never let one reasonably interpret minor trends over time in the way Richard did in the criminologist article to begin with (forecasts for ARIMA models are essentially mean-reverting, they will just trend to a mean term in a short number of steps). Richard including exogenous factors actually makes this worse – as you need to forecast inflation and take that forecast error into account for any multiple year out forecast.</p>
<p>Richard has consistently in his career overfit models and subsequently interpreted the tea leaves in various macro level correlations (Rosenfeld, 2018). His current theory of inflation and crime is no different. I agree that forecasting is <em>the</em> way to validate criminological theories – picking up a new pet theory every time you are proven wrong though I don’t believe will result in any substantive progress in criminology. Most of the short term trends criminologists interpret are simply due to normal volatility in the models over time (Yim et al., 2020). David McDowall has a recent article that is much more measured about our cumulative knowledge of macro level crime rate trends – and how they can be potentially related to different criminological theories (McDowall, 2023). Matt Ashby has a paper that compares typical errors for city level forecasts – forecasting several years out tends to product quite inaccurate estimates, quite a bit larger than Richard’s 10% is useful threshold (Ashby, 2023).</p>
<p>Final point that I want to make is that honestly it doesn’t even matter. Richard can continue to keep making dramatic errors in macro level forecasts – it doesn’t matter if he publishes estimates that are two+ years old and already wrong before they go into print. Because unlike what Richard says – national, macro level violent crime forecasts <em>do not</em> help policy response – why would Pittsburgh care about the national level crime forecast? They should not. It does not matter if we fit models that are more accurate than 5% (or 1%, or whatever), they are not helpful to folks on the hill. No one is sitting in the COPS office and is like “hmm, two years from now violent crime rates are going up by 10, lets fund 1342 more officers to help with that”.</p>
<p>Richard can’t have skin the game for his perpetual wrong macro level crime forecasts – there is no skin to have. I am a nerd so I like looking at numbers and fitting models (or here it is more like that XKCD comic of yelling at people on the internet). I don’t need to make up fairy tale hypothetical “policy” applications for the forecasts though.</p>
<p>If you want a real application of crime forecasts, I have estimated for cities that adding an additional home or apartment unit increases the number of calls per service by about 1 per year. So for growing cities that are increasing in size, that is the way I suggest to make longer term allocation plans to increase police staffing to increase demand.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>A decade ago to the day, I published a tweet launching what would surely become yet another pet project that scratched an itch, was kinda useful to a few people but other than that, would shortly fade away into the same obscurity as all the other ones I'd launched over the previous couple of decades:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's alive! "Have I been pwned?" by <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@troyhunt</a> is now up and running. Search for your account across multiple breaches <a href="http://t.co/U0QyHZxP6k?ref=troyhunt.com">http://t.co/U0QyHZxP6k</a></p>— Have I Been Pwned (@haveibeenpwned) <a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/408153032698785792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">December 4, 2013</a></blockquote> 

<p>And then, as they say, things kinda escalated quickly. The very next day <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/working-with-154-million-records-on/" rel="noreferrer">I published a blog post about how I made it so fast to search through 154M records</a> and thus began <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/" rel="noreferrer">a now 185-post epic</a> where I began detailing the minutiae of how I built this thing, the decisions I made about how to run it and commentary on all sorts of different breaches. And now, a 10th birthday blog post about what really sticks out a decade later. And that's precisely what this 185th blog post tagging HIBP is - the noteworthy things of the years past, including a few things I've never discussed publicly before.</p><h3 id="pwned">Pwned?</h3><p>You know why it's called "Have I Been Pwned"? Try coming up with almost any conceivable <em>normal </em>sounding English name and getting a .com domain for it. <em>Good luck!</em> That was certainly part of it, but another part of the name choice was simply that I honestly didn't expect this thing to go anywhere. It's like I said in the intro of this post where I fully expected this to be another failed project, so why does the name matter?</p><p>But it's weird how "pwned" has stuck and increasingly, become synonymous with HIBP. For many people, the first time they ever hear the word is in the context of "Have I Been..." with an ensuing discussion often explaining the origins of the term as it relates to gaming culture. And if you do go and look for a definition of the term online, you'll come across resources such as <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/pwned-meaning-definition-origins-video-games-internet-hackers?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">How “PWNED” went from hacker slang to the internet’s favourite taunt</a>:</p><blockquote>Then in 2013, when various web services and sites saw an uptick in personal data breaches, security expert Troy Hunt created the website “Have I Been Pwned?” Anyone can type in an email address into the site to check if their personal data has been compromised in a security breach.</blockquote><p>And somehow, this little project is now referenced in the definition of the name it emerged from. Weird.</p><p>But, because it's such an odd name that has so frequently been mispronounced or mistyped, I've ended up with a whole raft of bizarre domain names including <a href="http://haveibeenpaened.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenpaened.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenpwnded.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenpwnded.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenporned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenporned.com</a> and my personal favourite, <a href="http://haveibeenprawned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenprawned.com</a> (because a journo literally pronounced it that way in a major news segment 🤦‍♂️). Not to mention all the other weird variations including <a href="http://haveibeenburned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenburned.com</a>, <a href="http://haveigotpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveigotpwned.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenrekt.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenrekt.com</a> and after someone made the suggestion following the revelation that PornHub follows me, <a href="http://haveibeenfucked.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenfucked.com</a> 🤷‍♂️</p><h3 id="press">Press</h3><p>It's difficult to even know where to start here. How does the little site with the weird name end up in the press? Inevitably, "because data breaches", and it's <em>nuts</em> just how much exposure this project has had because of them. These are often mainstream news events and what reporters often want to impart to people is along the lines of "Here's what you should do if you've been impacted", which often boils down to checking HIBP.</p><p>Press is great for raising awareness of the project, but it has also quite literally DDoS'd the service with <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/brief-lessons-on-handling-huge-traffic-spikes/" rel="noreferrer">the Martin Lewis Money Show in the UK knocking it offline in 2016</a>. Cool! No, for real, I learned some really valuable lessons from that experience which, of course, I shared in a blog post. And then ensured could never happen again.</p><p>Back in 2018, Gizmodo reckoned HIBP was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/100-websites-that-shaped-the-internet-as-we-know-it-1829634771?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">one of the top 100 websites that shaped the internet as we knew it</a>, alongside the likes of Wikipedia, Google, Amazon and Goatse (don't Google it). Only the year after it launched, <a href="https://time.com/3054279/50-best-websites-2014/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">TIME magazine reckon'd it was one of the 50 best websites of the year</a>.

"You know they're just trying to get you to DC so they can arrest you for all that stolen data you have, right?! 🤣", the internet quipped. But instead, I had one of the most memorable moments of my career as <a href="https://youtu.be/A0HPTrBiU5g?t=1359&amp;ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">I read my testimony</a> (these are public hearings so it's all recorded and available to watch), responded to questions from congressmen and congresswomen and rounded out the trip staring down at where they inaugurate presidents:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Today, that photo adorns the wall outside my office and dozens of times a day I look at it and ask the same question - <em>how did it all lead to this?!</em></p><h3 id="svalbard">Svalbard</h3><p>The potential sale of HIBP was a very painful, very expensive chapter of life, announced in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/project-svalbard-the-future-of-have-i-been-pwned/" rel="noreferrer">a blog post from June 2019</a>. For the most part, I was as transparent and honest as I could be about the reasons behind the decision, including the stress:</p><blockquote>To be completely honest, it's been an enormously stressful year dealing with it all.</blockquote><p>More than one year later, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/sustaining-performance-under-extreme-stress/" rel="noreferrer">I finally wrote about the source of so much of that stress</a>: divorce. Relationship circumstances had put a huge amount of pressure on me and I needed a relief valve which at the time, I thought would be the sale of the project I loved so much but was becoming increasingly demanding. Ultimately, Project Svalbard (the code name for the sale of HIBP), had the opposite effect as years of bitter legal battles with my ex ensued, in part due to the perceived value that would have been realised had it been sold and some big tech company owned my arse for years to come. The project I built out of a passion to do community good was now being used as a tool to extract as much money out of me as possible. There's a wild story to be told there one day but whilst that saga is now well and truly behind me, the scars are still raw.</p><p>There were many times throughout Project Svalbard where I felt like I was living out an episode of Silicon Valley, especially as I hopped between interviews at the who's-who of tech firms in San Francisco to meet potential acquirers. But there was one moment in particular that I knew at the time would form an indelible memory, so I took a photo of it:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I'm sitting in a rental car in Yosemite whilst driving from the aforementioned meetings in SF and onto Vegas for the annual big cyber-events. I had a scheduled call with a big tech firm who was a potential acquirer and should that deal go through, the guy I was speaking to would be my new boss. I'd done that dozens of times by now and I don't know if it was because I was especially tired or emotional or if there was something in the way he phrased the question, but this triggered something deep inside me:</p><blockquote>So Troy, what would your perfect day in the office look like?</blockquote><p>I didn't say it this directly, but I kid you not this is exactly what popped into my mind:</p><blockquote>I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want</blockquote><p>My potential new overlord had somehow managed to find exactly the raw nerve to touch that made me realise how valuable independence had become to me. 6 months later, Project Svalbard was dead after a deal I'd struck fell through. I still can't talk about the precise circumstances due to being NDA'd up to wazoo, but the term we chose to use was "a change of business circumstances on behalf of the purchaser". With the benefit of hindsight, I've never been so happy to have lost so much 😊</p><h3 id="the-fbi">The FBI</h3><p>10 years ago, I certainly didn't see this on the cards:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so cool, thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/FBI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@FBI</a> 😊 <a href="https://t.co/aqMi3as91O?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/aqMi3as91O</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1674132801837477888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote> 

<p>Nor did I expect them to be <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/open-source-pwned-passwords-with-fbi-feed-and-225m-new-nca-passwords-is-now-live/" rel="noreferrer">actively feeding data into HIBP</a>. Or the UK's NCA to be feeding data in. Or various other law enforcement agencies the world over. And I never envisioned a time where dozens of national governments would be happy to talk about using the service.</p><p>A couple of months ago, the ABC wrote a long piece on how this whole thing is, to use their term, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-23/cybersecurity-troy-hunt-have-i-been-pwned-fighting-data-breaches/102803748?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">a strange sign of the times</a>.</p><blockquote>He’s just “a dude on the web”, but Troy Hunt&nbsp;has ended up playing&nbsp;an oddly central role in&nbsp;global&nbsp;cybersecurity.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1126" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 2150w"></figure><p>It's strange until you look at through the lens of aligned objectives: the whole idea of HIBP was "to do good things after bad things happen" which is well aligned with the mandates of law enforcement agencies. You could call it... common ground:</p>



<p>This is something I suspect a lot of people don't understand - that law enforcement agencies often work in conjunction with private enterprise to further their goals of protecting people just like you and me. It's something I certainly didn't understand 10 years ago, and I still remember the initial surprise when agencies started reaching out. Many years on, these have become really productive relationships with a bunch of top notch people, a number of whom I now count as friends and make an effort to spend time with on my travels.</p><h3 id="passwords">Passwords</h3><p>This was never on the cards originally. In fact, I'd always been adamant that there should never be passwords in HIBP although in my defence, the sentiment was that they should never appear <em>next to the username</em> to which they originally accompanied. But looking at passwords through the lens of how breach data can be used to do good things, a list of known compromised passwords disassociated from any form of PII made a lot of sense. So, in 2017, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/" rel="noreferrer">Pwned Passwords was born</a>. You know what I was saying earlier about things escalating quickly? Yeah:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Setting all new records for Pwned Passwords this week: biggest day ever yesterday at 282M requests and biggest rolling 30 days ever, now passing the 6 *billion* requests mark! <a href="https://t.co/dQiuQim3da?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/dQiuQim3da</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1701473422335692997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">September 12, 2023</a></blockquote> 

<p>As if to make the point, I just checked the latest stats and last week we did 301.6M requests in a single day. 100% of those requests - and that's not a rounded number either, it's 100.0000000000% - were served from Cloudflare's cache 🤯</p><p>There's so much I love about this service. I love that it's free, there's no auth, it's entirely open source (both code and data), the FBI feeds data into it and perhaps most importantly, it has <em>real</em> impact on security. It's such a simple thing, but every time you see a headline such as "Big online website hit with credential stuffing attack", a significant portion of the accounts being taken over have passwords that could easily have been blocked.</p><h3 id="the-paradox-of-handling-data-breaches">The Paradox of Handling Data Breaches</h3><p>On multiple occasions now, I've had conversations that can best be paraphrased as follows:</p><p><strong>Random Internet Person:</strong> I'm going to report you to the FBI for having all that stolen data</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Maybe you should start by Googling "troy hunt fbi" first...</p><p>But I understand where they're coming from and the paradox I refer to is the perceived conflict between handling what is usually the output of a crime whilst simultaneously trying to perform a community good. It's the same discussion I've often had with people citing privacy laws in their corner of the world (often the EU and GDPR) as the reason why HIBP shouldn't exist: "but you're processing data without informed consent!", they'll claim. The issue of there being other legal bases for processing aside, <em>nobody</em> consents to being in a data breach! The natural progression of that conversation is that being in a data breach is a parallel discussion to HIBP then indexing it and making it searchable, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ethics-of-running-a-data-breach-search-service/" rel="noreferrer">which is something I've devoted many words to addressing in the past</a>.</p><p>But for all the bluster the occasional random internet person can have (and honestly, I could count the number of annual instances of this on one hand), nothing has come of any complaints. And when I say "complaints", it's often nothing more than a polite conversation which may simply conclude with an acknowledgment of opposing views and that's it. There has been <em>one</em> exception in the entire decade of running this service where a complaint did come via a government privacy regulator, I responded to all the questions that were asked and that was the end of it.</p><h3 id="people">People</h3><p>When you have a pet project like HIBP was in the beginning, it's usually just you putting in the hours. That's fine, it's a hobby and you're scratching an itch, so what does it matter that there's nobody else involved? Like many similar passion projects, HIBP consumed a lot of hours from early on, everything from obviously building the service then sourcing data breaches, verifying and disclosing them, writing up descriptions and even editing every single one of those 700+ logos by hand to be just the right dimensions and file size. But in the beginning, if I'd just stopped one day, what would happen? Nothing. But today, a genuinely important part of the internet that a huge number of individuals, corporations and governments have built dependencies on would stop working if I lost interest.</p><p>The dependency on just me was partly behind the possible sale in 2019, but clearly that didn't eventuate. There was always the option to employ people and build it out like most people would a normal company, but every time I gave that consideration it just didn't stack up for a whole bunch of reasons. It was certainly feasible from the perspective of building some sort of valuable commercial entity, but in just the same way as that question about my perfect day in the office sucked the soul from my body, so did the prospect of being responsible for other people. Employment contracts. Salary negotiations. Performance reviews. Sick leave and annual leave and all sorts of other people issues from strangers I'd need to entrust with "my baby". So, bringing in more people was a really unattractive idea, with 2 exceptions:</p><p>In early 2021, my (soon to be at the time) wife Charlotte started working for HIBP.</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/CharlotteHunt.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="284"></figure><p>Charlotte had spent the last 8 years working with people just like me; software nerds. As a project manager for the NDC conferences based out of Norway, she'd dealt with hundreds of speakers (including me on many occasions), and thousands of attendees at the best conference I've ever been a part of. Plus, she spent a great deal of time coordinating sponsors, corporate attendees and all sorts of other folks that live in the tech world HIBP inhabited. For Charlotte, even though she's not a technical person (her qualifications are in PR and entrepreneurial studies), this was very familiar territory.</p><p>So, for the last few years, Charlotte has done absolutely everything that she can to ensure that I can focus on the things that need my attention. She onboards new corporate subscribers, handles masses of tickets for API and domain subscribers and does all the accounting and tax work. And she does this tirelessly every single day at all sorts of hours whether we're at home or travelling. She is... amazing 🤩</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://stebet.net/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Stefán Jökull Sigurðarson</a> started working for us part time writing code, cleaning up code, migrating code and, well, doing lots of different code things.</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/Stef-nJ-kullSigur-arson.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="276"></figure><p>Just today I asked Stefán&nbsp;what I should write about him, thinking he'd give me some bullet points I'd massage and then incorporate into this blog post. Instead, I reckon what he wrote was so spot on that I'm just going to quote the entire thing here:</p><blockquote>"Just" that having had my eye on the service since it was released and then developing one of the first big integrations with the PwnedPasswords v2 API in EVE, coinciding with us meeting for the first time at NDC Oslo in 2018 shortly after,&nbsp; HIBP has managed to take me on this awesome journey where it has been a part of launching my public speaking career, contributing to OSS with Pwned Passwords, becoming an MVP and helped me meet a bunch of awesome people and allowed me to contribute to a better and hopefully safer internet. I'm very happy and honoured to a be a part of this project which is full of awesome challenges and interesting problems to deal with. Having meeting invites from the FBI in my inbox a few years after doing a few experimental rest calls to the Pwned Passwords API in early 2018 was definitely not something I was expecting 😅</blockquote><p>What really resonated with me in Stefán's message is that for him, this isn't just a job, it's a passion. His journey is my journey in that we freely devoted our time to do something we love and it led to many wonderful things, including MVP roles and speaking at "Charlotte's" conference, NDC. Stefán&nbsp;is based in Iceland, but we've still had many opportunities to share beers together and establish a relationship that transcends merely writing code. I can't think of anyone better to do what he does today.</p><h2 id="breaches">Breaches</h2><p>731 breaches later, here we are. So, what stands out? Just going off the top of my head here:</p><p><strong>Ashley Madison.</strong> Every knows the name so it needs no introduction, but that incident in 2015 had a major impact on HIBP in terms of use of the service, and also a major impact on me in terms of the engagements I had with impacted parties. My blog post on <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-ashley-madison-members-have/" rel="noreferrer">Here’s what Ashley Madison members have told me</a> still feels harrowing to read.</p><p><strong>Collection #1.</strong> This is the one that really contributed to my stress levels in early 2019 and had a profound impact on my decision to look at selling the service. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/" rel="noreferrer">Read about where those 773M records came from</a> (still the largest breach in HIBP to date).</p><p><strong>Rosebutt.</strong> Don't make a joke about it, don't make a joke about it, don't... aw man, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512105342/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/11/embarassing_data_breach/" rel="noreferrer">thanks The Register!</a> (link to an archive.org version as they seem to have thought better of their image choice later on...) The point is that even serious data breaches can have their moments of levity.</p><p><strong>Shit Express.</strong> Sometimes, you just need a bit of hilarity in your data breach. Shit Express is literally a site to send other people pieces of that - <em>anonymously </em>- <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/anonymous-poop-gifting-site-hacked-customers-exposed/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">and they got breached</a>, thus somewhat affecting their anonymity. The more serious point is that as I later wrote, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/safe-secure-anonymous-and-other-misleading-claims/" rel="noreferrer">claims of anonymity are often highly misleading</a>.</p><h2 id="future">Future</h2><p>I often joke about my life being very much about getting up each morning, reading my emails and events from overnight and then just winging it from there. Of course there are the occasional scheduled things not to mention travel commitments, but for the most part it's very much just rolling with whatever is demanding attention on the day. This is also probably a significant part of why I don't really want to see this thing grow into a larger concern with more responsibilities, I just don't want to lose that freedom. Yet...</p><p>We're gradually moving in a direction where things become more formalised. 3 years ago, I did 100% of everything myself. 1 year ago, I did everything technical myself. 6 months ago, we had no ticketing system for support. But these are small, incremental steps forward and that's what I'd like to see continuing. I want HIBP to outlive me, I just don't want it to become a burden I'm beholden to in the process. I'd like to have more people involved but as you can see from above, that's been a very slow process with only those very close to me playing a role.</p><p>The only thing I have real certainty on at the moment is that there will be more breaches. I've commented many times recently that the scourge that is ransomware feels like it's really accelerated lately, I wonder how many of the people in the emails and documents and all sorts of other data that get dumped there ever learn of their exposure? It's a non-trivial exercise to index that (for all sorts of reasons), but it also seems like an increasingly worthy exercise. Who knows, let's see how I feel when I get up tomorrow morning 🙂</p><p>Finally, for this week's regular video, I'm going to make a birthday special and do it live with Charlotte. Please come and join us, I'm not entirely sure what we'll cover (I'll work it out on the morning!) but let's make a virtual 10th birthday party out of it 🎂</p>

<p><strong>Harvard Gutted Initial Team Examining Facebook Files Following $500 Million Donation from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Whistleblower Aid Client Reveals</strong></p>



<p><em>University’s Former Disinformation Expert Joan Donovan Calls for Investigation</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> – Harvard University dismantled its prestigious team of online disinformation experts after a foundation run by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $500 million to the university, a <a href="http://whistlebloweraid.org/joan-donovan-disclosure-harvard-betrayed-academic-freedom-and-the-public-interest-to-protect-meta/">whistleblower disclosure</a> filed by Whistleblower Aid reveals.</p>



<p>Dr. Joan Donovan, one of the world’s leading experts on social media disinformation, says she ran into a wall of institutional resistance and eventual termination after she and her team at Harvard’s Technology and Social Change Research Project (TASC) began analyzing thousands of documents exposing Facebook’s knowledge of how the platform has caused significant public harm..</p>



<p>In her <a href="http://whistlebloweraid.org/joan-donovan-declaration-detailed-account-of-how-harvard-protected-meta-from-research-scrutiny">whistleblower declaration</a>, Donovan lays out in detail how she and her research team at Harvard’s Kennedy School (HKS) came under sudden scrutiny from the school’s dean, Douglas Elmendorf, and other Kennedy School leaders,<strong> </strong>after they started working on Haugen’s Facebook Files – a cache Donovan describes as “the most important documents in the history of the internet.”</p>



<p>TASC rose in size, prominence, and resources under Dr. Donovan’s leadership – and Dr. Donovan was elevated to Research Director of the Shorenstein Center for her success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance and prestige of TASC’s work became irrelevant to Dean Elmendorf when in October 2021 Dr. Donovan announced she had lawfully received the Facebook Files at a HKS Dean’s Council meeting, which was attended by a Facebook PR executive who became irate when she discussed it. She intended to create a public archive with a collaborative platform, where participants could publish research and her team would host workshops for researchers and journalists on how to analyze the extensive trove of internal documents. Following the meeting, Dean Elmendorf began a two year campaign to purge Dr. Donovan, silence her voice, decrease her public profile, and stifle her team’s impactful research.</p>



<p>Suddenly her work became a threat to some of HKS’s most treasured donor relationships – just as Harvard was finalizing the largest donation the school had ever received, $500 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in December 2021.</p>



<p>HKS leadership systematically rendered TASC mute with an escalating series of restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles designed to stop their work and the power of Dr. Donovan’s research findings to challenge Meta’s false public narratives. Harvard’s own code of conduct and commitment to academic freedom was trampled in the campaign to silence Dr. Donovan – culminating in the dissolution of TASC and her termination this past summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta could not use any of its previously reported tactics to silence other researchers as Dr. Donovan’s research neither relies on access to their data nor would she accept any grants affiliated with any company she researches.</p>



<p>“The mood changed overnight. The work we were doing turned from a source of pride for Harvard into a source of shame,” wrote Dr. Donovan. “Instead of seizing on an extraordinary opportunity to further our knowledge of social media platforms and how they work hidden from public scrutiny, the university subjected my team and our projects to death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In sending the lawful whistleblower disclosure to the President and General Counsel of Harvard University, the U.S. Department of Education, and subsequently to the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, Dr. Donovan and Whistleblower Aid are calling for an urgent and impartial investigation into inappropriate influence at the Harvard Kennedy School.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a shocking betrayal of Harvard’s academic integrity and the public interest,” said Libby Liu, CEO of Whistleblower Aid. “We’ve seen in the past how Big Tobacco, Big Energy and Big Pharma have succeeded in influencing, undermining, and co-opting research to protect their lies, their profits and evade accountability. Now Meta, with the complicity of a powerful ally, is following the same playbook. Whether Harvard acted at the company’s direction or took the initiative on their own to protect Meta’s interests, the outcome is the same: corporate interests are undermining research and academic freedom to the detriment of the public.”</p>



<p>Dr. Donovan, now an Assistant Professor at Boston University, was hired by the Kennedy School in 2018 and served as the Director of TASC and was promoted to Research Director of the Shorenstein Center in early 2020. She lectured for several years on media manipulation and disinformation at HKS.</p>



<p>Alongside her team, Dr. Donovan set out to make sure the public, lawmakers, regulators, and academics could all analyze the Facebook Files, opening the doors to unprecedented and transparent public collaboration allowing for public accountability. Her team’s vision of a global research collaborative that openly analyzes the Facebook Files remains, to this day, largely unrealized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a time of unprecedented legal scrutiny of Meta by both <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/24/meta-lawsuit-facebook-instagram-children-mental-health/">states</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/28/ftc-notches-legal-win-privacy-fight-with-meta/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, Meta has benefited tremendously from the curtailing, delaying, and undermining of this research by the Kennedy School leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This case represents a watershed opportunity for lawmakers, regulators, and academia to address the pervasive and detrimental tactics deployed by powerful and wealthy interests like Big Tech to influence vital public interest research. The inadequate safeguards that exist in law, regulation, practice, and academic integrity by universities require meaningful reform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the most powerful university in the world cannot safeguard the integrity of public interest research in the face of corporate influence-buying, what hope is there for any other research institution?” Libby Liu said. “What hope is there for rank and file academics seeking to pursue the truth and hold power to account?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>###</p>



<p>Whistleblower Aid is a non-profit legal organization in Washington, D.C. supporting individuals who lawfully report government and corporate law breaking. It provides assistance to individuals in the United States and abroad seeking to disclose illegal conduct, including misconduct relating to government officials, securities fraud, sexual violence, and violations of tax, labor or environmental laws. In recent years Whistleblower Aid lawyers have represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen and the intelligence community whistleblower whose disclosures led to the first impeachment of President Trump.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I agree. The hon. Gentleman is anticipating my moving on to new clause 20, which talks to some of those issues in great detail, and a very good amendment it is, too. We have talked about whether the fee of £100 is arbitrary, a finger in the wind. But it is a figure that we can put in the Bill to say, “Let’s start here”. It gives Companies House the resource with which it can do work.</p><p>It was pointed out by some of those who gave evidence to the Bill Committee that, if we are seeking to clamp down on those hundreds of companies being set up every day at £12 a pop, we need to replace that money with legitimate money; £100 would go some way to dealing with that gap and that discrepancy. We need to ensure that that money goes to increasing the staff at Companies House, and the capacity, ability and expertise of the people Companies House hires, because much of this is becoming incredibly technical. It is important that it has the resource to do that. All the agencies involved need that money, but Companies House, as the front door to a lot of this stuff, needs to be properly resourced to be able to do that.</p><p>I note that the Minister talked about not wanting to put in legislation the sum of money that that fee would require, but that is not quite how other parts of the system work. I have sat on Statutory Instrument Committees that set the value of passport fees. I understand that the House sets the value of visa fees. Therefore, within the immigration system, the House decides what that fee is and sets that fee. Yet it is not deciding to do so for companies.</p><p>I do not know whether the Minister intends the matter of setting a fee —at £100, or whatever it might be—to come before an SI Committee at some point, but that is not what the Bill says he is going to do. It is important to recognise that, in one area of government, the Government are setting a fee and deciding how much people should pay for things and that other parts of the system should have cost recovery. The visa fee goes way above cost recovery; the passport fee perhaps less so. We are talking about £75.50 for a passport, compared with £12 to register a company and £1,538 for a visa. Those things are not quite the same. The company fee could bear being significantly higher than the £12 it is at the moment, and there is a place in legislation where we could set that because that is what the Government do in other areas of legislation.</p><p>New clause 22 tabled by the Official Opposition—entitled “Person convicted under the Minimum Wage Act not to be appointed as director”—is laudable in its aims because the people flouting the rules should not get to be company directors. Being a company director is a privilege, not a right. For those people who have been convicted of not complying with the legislation, it is perfectly reasonable that they could be disqualified for a serious breach of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. It is reasonable to disqualify them.</p><p>On the issue of trust and company service providers, there is more that the Bill should and must do. It is unfortunate that the consultation on the Office for Professional Body AML Supervision is still ongoing, I understand, or certainly not concluded, because that should form part of this Bill. It has been widely acknowledged that OPBAS is not effective and is not working as the Government intended, but the Government do not yet know what they are going to do, how they <span id="928" data-column-number="928"></span>will fix OPBAS, whether it will require further legislation in this House, whether it will involve stripping OPBAS of its AML supervision responsibilities and duties and, if it does, where those responsibilities will lie.</p><p>Our suggestion in new clause 35 is to make Companies House the AML supervisor in its own right. I have asked various questions on why the Government do not believe that Companies House should be an anti-money laundering supervisor. It seems to us on the SNP Benches that, if Companies House is the front door for every company registered in the United Kingdom, it should be liable for anti-money laundering regulations. If we are asking banks and other institutions to look at that, why not the Government agency responsible for the registration of every company on these islands?</p><p>That would give Companies House more duties and stop the flow of guff companies, terrible information and people who seek to defraud our constituents at the front door. It seems bizarre to me that the Government would not want to shut the front door firmly in the face of the crooks and the people who want to do that. There is also more that could be done, as mentioned in some of the Labour amendments, on the duty and powers of Companies House. We think Companies House should have powers, and not only powers, but duties—it should have to do those things.</p><p>I do not see why there is ambiguity in this legislation. If the Government are saying Companies House should do it, they should make Companies House do it, rather than leaving it up to interpretation or somebody’s decision further down the line. They should make Companies House do it. We all know that, if we are not forced to do a thing, we might not do a thing. We might not do the dishes, or the laundry, but if we are forced to, we certainly will. There is more that can be done to shut the door and tighten the regulations.</p><p>Through our amendments, we also seek to tighten the integrity of the register. That includes new clause 36 and our amendment 109. They reflect Labour’s amendment 103 and some of the other amendments that speak to the importance of identification numbers and the integrity of the register itself.</p><p>Much of the evidence we heard in the Bill Committee, as well as at various APPG events and other online events, indicates that the register as it stands is full of absolute guff. It has had—<em>[</em><em>Interruption.</em><em>]</em> The Minister waves the legislation, but the difficulty is that he is not intending to fix all that guff. He is allowing that guff to live on the register forever, because there is not enough in the Bill about the retrospective action Companies House has to take, looking through all the hundreds and thousands of companies that, over many years, have been allowed to filter on to the register unheeded.</p><p>Graham Barrow’s Twitter account is full every single day of companies being registered with information that is absolute rubbish. We must have a means of putting a duty and an obligation on Companies House to go back through the register, to clear it out and to say, “There’s no point having that stuff on there, because it is in effect meaningless and it’s gumming up the system for those who want to use the register in legitimate ways.”</p><p>We must be able to keep a check on Companies House: that is why new clause 36 says that it should seek to ensure that registrations contain accurate, up-to-date information and that it comes back to update Parliament <span id="929" data-column-number="929"></span>on its progress updating that register. We cannot expect these things to happen overnight, because it is a big register and there is an awful lot on it, but we must ensure that it is accurate. If it is not, there are very real consequences for our constituents, as Graham Barrow pointed out. People have found themselves being defrauded when their names, their addresses or both have been used inaccurately. Those people have been chased or pursued by criminals and all kinds of things have happened to them because of fraudulent information on the Companies House register.</p><p>Someone may not even find out that their name has been used fraudulently. If they have a name such as James Smith, they may never find out. There are only three Alison Thewlisses on the register, but they are all me. There should be one identification—I should not be on the register as three people—and that is why we seek a unique identifier to track people throughout their lives. If someone’s name has been registered and used without their knowledge, with an address that is not theirs—a mailbox perhaps—they may not find out about it but may end up being liable for the actions of the fraudsters, so a lot more can be done on that.</p><p>We are also seeking through amendment 111 to limit the number of directorships that people can have. People may have multiple directorships, but is the director of 300 companies really able to do that job properly? Probably not. Those are probably not real companies and that person is probably not acting as a proper director. Again, on the Companies House register, many people are registered for hundreds of companies. As a red flag in the system, that should stand out to Companies House, which should be able to ask, “Is this person a real director?” and do more investigation. Our amendment would encourage that.</p><p>I am quite pleased to see that Government amendments 30 and 32 would give Scottish Ministers the power to present a petition to wind up Scottish limited partnerships, which have been comprehensively abused for several years now. That has been a real problem, and giving Scottish Ministers the power to do something about it is important. Although they are called “Scottish limited partnerships”, they have in practice very little to do with the Scottish Government, who can do little about them at the moment, so that is an important power. I am grateful to Michael Clancy of the Law Society of Scotland, who I hope is correct in his belief that that is a practical and useful measure. Will the Minister outline whether he has had any further discussions with Scottish Ministers, and how he thinks the power would work in practice?</p><p>I am prepared to leave my remarks at that—I appreciate that other Members want to get in and discuss other things—but I will leave the Minister with a quote from a Bill Committee evidence session on 25 October. Bill Browder, who has been a great champion of corporate transparency and standing against corruption internationally, told the Committee:</p><p>“You can write as many great laws as you want—there is some good stuff in this law, and good stuff in the previous laws—but if no one is going to enforce it, then you are never going to change the risk-reward and people are going to carry on doing stuff. All this will continue, and I will sit here 10 years from now making the same allegations about how this is a centre of money <span id="930" data-column-number="930"></span>laundering.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Public Bill Committee, </em>25 October 2022; c. 69, Q144.]</p><p>Nobody wants to be sitting here in 10 years—well, certainly not those of us on the SNP Benches—seeing money laundering going on unabated. We want the Government to take the opportunity that the Bill presents to close loopholes. To get that right, and get it right now, they should take the advice and knowledge that Members from across the House, and external organisations, have brought to the Bill. If the Government make the amendments and fix the Bill, they will have cross-party support for it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-68156">

		<p>I trusted a lot today. I trusted my phone to wake me on time. I trusted Uber to arrange a taxi for me, and the driver to get me to the airport safely. I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply chain—any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning.</p>
<p>Trust is essential to society. Humans as a species are trusting. We are all sitting here, mostly strangers, confident that nobody will attack us. If we were a roomful of chimpanzees, this would be impossible. We trust many thousands of times a day. Society can’t function without it. And that we don’t even think about it is a measure of how well it all works.</p>
<p>In this talk, I am going to make several arguments. One, that there are two different kinds of trust—interpersonal trust and social trust—and that we regularly confuse them. Two, that the confusion will increase with artificial intelligence. We will make a fundamental category error. We will think of AIs as friends when they’re really just services. Three, that the corporations controlling AI systems will take advantage of our confusion to take advantage of us. They will not be trustworthy. And four, that it is the role of government to create trust in society. And therefore, it is their role to create an environment for trustworthy AI. And that means regulation. Not regulating AI, but regulating the organizations that control and use AI.</p>
<p>Okay, so let’s back up and take that all a lot slower. Trust is a complicated concept, and the word is overloaded with many meanings. There’s personal and intimate trust. When we say that we trust a friend, it is less about their specific actions and more about them as a person. It’s a general reliance that they will behave in a trustworthy manner. We trust their intentions, and know that those intentions will inform their actions. Let’s call this “interpersonal trust.”</p>
<p>There’s also the less intimate, less personal trust. We might not know someone personally, or know their motivations—but we can trust their behavior. We don’t know whether or not someone wants to steal, but maybe we can trust that they won’t. It’s really more about reliability and predictability. We’ll call this “social trust.” It’s the ability to trust strangers.</p>
<p>Interpersonal trust and social trust are both essential in society today. This is how it works. We have mechanisms that induce people to behave in a trustworthy manner, both interpersonally and socially. This, in turn, allows others to be trusting. Which enables trust in society. And that keeps society functioning. The system isn’t perfect—there are always going to be untrustworthy people—but most of us being trustworthy most of the time is good enough.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in 2012 in a book called <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/liars-and-outliers/"><em>Liars and Outliers</em></a>. I wrote about four systems for enabling trust: our innate morals, concern about our reputations, the laws we live under, and security technologies that constrain our behavior. I wrote about how the first two are more informal than the last two. And how the last two scale better, and allow for larger and more complex societies. They enable cooperation amongst strangers.</p>
<p>What I didn’t appreciate is how different the first and last two are. Morals and reputation are person to person, based on human connection, mutual vulnerability, respect, integrity, generosity, and a lot of other things besides. These underpin interpersonal trust. Laws and security technologies are systems of trust that force us to act trustworthy. And they’re the basis of social trust.</p>
<p>Taxi driver used to be one of the country’s most dangerous professions. Uber changed that. I don’t know my Uber driver, but the rules and the technology lets us both be confident that neither of us will cheat or attack each other. We are both under constant surveillance and are competing for star rankings.</p>
<p>Lots of people write about the difference between living in a high-trust and a low-trust society. How reliability and predictability make everything easier. And what is lost when society doesn’t have those characteristics. Also, how societies move from high-trust to low-trust and vice versa. This is all about social trust.</p>
<p>That literature is important, but for this talk the critical point is that social trust scales better. You used to need a personal relationship with a banker to get a loan. Now it’s all done algorithmically, and you have many more options to choose from.</p>
<p>Social trust scales better, but embeds all sorts of bias and prejudice. That’s because, in order to scale, social trust has to be structured, system- and rule-oriented, and that’s where the bias gets embedded. And the system has to be mostly blinded to context, which removes flexibility.</p>
<p>But that scale is vital. In today’s society we regularly trust—or not—governments, corporations, brands, organizations, groups. It’s not so much that I trusted the particular pilot that flew my airplane, but instead the airline that puts well-trained and well-rested pilots in cockpits on schedule. I don’t trust the cooks and waitstaff at a restaurant, but the system of health codes they work under. I can’t even describe the banking system I trusted when I used an ATM this morning. Again, this confidence is no more than reliability and predictability.</p>
<p>Think of that restaurant again. Imagine that it’s a fast food restaurant, employing teenagers. The food is almost certainly safe—probably safer than in high-end restaurants—because of the corporate systems or reliability and predictability that is guiding their every behavior.</p>
<p>That’s the difference. You can ask a friend to deliver a package across town. Or you can pay the Post Office to do the same thing. The former is interpersonal trust, based on morals and reputation. You know your friend and how reliable they are. The second is a service, made possible by social trust. And to the extent that is a reliable and predictable service, it’s primarily based on laws and technologies. Both can get your package delivered, but only the second can become the global package delivery systems that is FedEx.</p>
<p>Because of how large and complex society has become, we have replaced many of the rituals and behaviors of interpersonal trust with security mechanisms that enforce reliability and predictability—social trust.</p>
<p>But because we use the same word for both, we regularly confuse them. And when we do that, we are making a category error.</p>
<p>And we do it all the time. With governments. With organizations. With systems of all kinds. And especially with corporations.</p>
<p>We might think of them as friends, when they are actually services. Corporations are not moral; they are precisely as immoral as the law and their reputations let them get away with.</p>
<p>So corporations regularly take advantage of their customers, mistreat their workers, pollute the environment, and lobby for changes in law so they can do even more of these things.</p>
<p>Both language and the laws make this an easy category error to make. We use the same grammar for people and corporations. We imagine that we have personal relationships with brands. We give corporations some of the same rights as people.</p>
<p>Corporations like that we make this category error—see, I just made it myself—because they profit when we think of them as friends. They use mascots and spokesmodels. They have social media accounts with personalities. They refer to themselves like they are people.</p>
<p>But they are not our friends. Corporations are not capable of having that kind of relationship.</p>
<p>We are about to make the same category error with AI. We’re going to think of them as our friends when they’re not.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about AIs as existential risk. The worry is that they will have a goal, and they will work to achieve it even if it harms humans in the process. You may have read about the “<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858">paperclip maximizer</a>“: an AI that has been programmed to make as many paper clips as possible, and ends up destroying the earth to achieve those ends. It’s a weird fear. Science fiction author Ted Chiang writes about it. Instead of solving all of humanity’s problems, or wandering off proving mathematical theorems that no one understands, the AI single-mindedly pursues the goal of maximizing production. Chiang’s point is that this is every corporation’s business plan. And that our fears of AI are basically fears of capitalism. Science fiction writer Charlie Stross takes this one step further, and calls corporations “<a href="https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html">slow AI</a>.” They are profit maximizing machines. And the most successful ones do whatever they can to achieve that singular goal.</p>
<p>And near-term AIs will be controlled by corporations. Which will use them towards that profit-maximizing goal. They won’t be our friends. At best, they’ll be useful services. More likely, they’ll spy on us and try to manipulate us.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Surveillance is the business model of the Internet. Manipulation is the other business model of the Internet.</p>
<p>Your Google search results lead with URLs that someone paid to show to you. Your Facebook and Instagram feeds are filled with sponsored posts. Amazon searches return pages of products whose sellers paid for placement.</p>
<p>This is how the Internet works. Companies spy on us as we use their products and services. Data brokers buy that surveillance data from the smaller companies, and assemble detailed dossiers on us. Then they sell that information back to those and other companies, who combine it with data they collect in order to manipulate our behavior to serve their interests. At the expense of our own.</p>
<p>We use all of these services as if they are our agents, working on our behalf. In fact, they are double agents, also secretly working for their corporate owners. We trust them, but they are not trustworthy. They’re not friends; they’re services.</p>
<p>It’s going to be no different with AI. And the result will be much worse, for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that these AI systems will be more relational. We will be conversing with them, using natural language. As such, we will naturally ascribe human-like characteristics to them.</p>
<p>This relational nature will make it easier for those double agents to do their work. Did your chatbot recommend a particular airline or hotel because it’s truly the best deal, given your particular set of needs? Or because the AI company got a kickback from those providers? When you asked it to explain a political issue, did it bias that explanation towards the company’s position? Or towards the position of whichever political party gave it the most money? The conversational interface will help hide their agenda.</p>
<p>The second reason to be concerned is that these AIs will be more intimate. One of the promises of generative AI is a personal digital assistant. Acting as your advocate with others, and as a butler with you. This requires an intimacy greater than your search engine, email provider, cloud storage system, or phone. You’re going to want it with you 24/7, constantly training on everything you do. You will want it to know everything about you, so it can most effectively work on your behalf.</p>
<p>And it will help you in many ways. It will notice your moods and know what to suggest. It will anticipate your needs and work to satisfy them. It will be your therapist, life coach, and relationship counselor.</p>
<p>You will default to thinking of it as a friend. You will speak to it in natural language, and it will respond in kind. If it is a robot, it will look humanoid—or at least like an animal. It will interact with the whole of your existence, just like another person would.</p>
<p>The natural language interface is critical here. We are primed to think of others who speak our language as people. And we sometimes have trouble thinking of others who speak a different language that way. We make that category error with obvious non-people, like cartoon characters. We will naturally have a “theory of mind” about any AI we talk with.</p>
<p>More specifically, we tend to assume that something’s implementation is the same as its interface. That is, we assume that things are the same on the inside as they are on the surface. Humans are like that: we’re people through and through. A government is systemic and bureaucratic on the inside. You’re not going to mistake it for a person when you interact with it. But this is the category error we make with corporations. We sometimes mistake the organization for its spokesperson. AI has a fully relational interface—it talks like a person—but it has an equally fully systemic implementation. Like a corporation, but much more so. The implementation and interface are more divergent of anything we have encountered to dateby a lot.</p>
<p>And you will want to trust it. It will use your mannerisms and cultural references. It will have a convincing voice, a confident tone, and an authoritative manner. Its personality will be optimized to exactly what you like and respond to.</p>
<p>It will act trustworthy, but it will not be trustworthy. We won’t know how they are trained. We won’t know their secret instructions. We won’t know their biases, either accidental or deliberate.</p>
<p>We do know that they are built at enormous expense, mostly in secret, by profit-maximizing corporations for their own benefit.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that these corporate AIs have a human-like interface. There’s nothing inevitable about that. It’s a design choice. It could be designed to be less personal, less human-like, more obviously a service—like a search engine . The companies behind those AIs want you to make the friend/service category error. It will exploit your mistaking it for a friend. And you might not have any choice but to use it.</p>
<p>There is something we haven’t discussed when it comes to trust: power. Sometimes we have no choice but to trust someone or something because they are powerful. We are forced to trust the local police, because they’re the only law enforcement authority in town. We are forced to trust some corporations, because there aren’t viable alternatives. To be more precise, we have no choice but to entrust ourselves to them. We will be in this same position with AI. We will have no choice but to entrust ourselves to their decision-making.</p>
<p>The friend/service confusion will help mask this power differential. We will forget how powerful the corporation behind the AI is, because we will be fixated on the person we think the AI is.</p>
<p>So far, we have been talking about one particular failure that results from overly trusting AI. We can call it something like “hidden exploitation.” There are others. There’s outright fraud, where the AI is actually trying to steal stuff from you. There’s the more prosaic mistaken expertise, where you think the AI is more knowledgeable than it is because it acts confidently. There’s incompetency, where you believe that the AI can do something it can’t. There’s inconsistency, where you mistakenly expect the AI to be able to repeat its behaviors. And there’s illegality, where you mistakenly trust the AI to obey the law. There are probably more ways trusting an AI can fail.</p>
<p>All of this is a long-winded way of saying that we need trustworthy AI. AI whose behavior, limitations, and training are understood. AI whose biases are understood, and corrected for. AI whose goals are understood. That won’t secretly betray your trust to someone else.</p>
<p>The market will not provide this on its own. Corporations are profit maximizers, at the expense of society. And the incentives of surveillance capitalism are just too much to resist.</p>
<p>It’s government that provides the underlying mechanisms for the social trust essential to society. Think about contract law. Or laws about property, or laws protecting your personal safety. Or any of the health and safety codes that let you board a plane, eat at a restaurant, or buy a pharmaceutical without worry.</p>
<p>The more you can trust that your societal interactions are reliable and predictable, the more you can ignore their details. Places where governments don’t provide these things are not good places to live.</p>
<p>Government can do this with AI. We need AI transparency laws. When it is used. How it is trained. What biases and tendencies it has. We need laws regulating AI—and robotic—safety. When it is permitted to affect the world. We need laws that enforce the trustworthiness of AI. Which means the ability to recognize when those laws are being broken. And penalties sufficiently large to incent trustworthy behavior.</p>
<p>Many countries are contemplating AI safety and security laws—the EU is the furthest along—but I think they are making a critical mistake. They try to regulate the AIs and not the humans behind them.</p>
<p>AIs are not people; they don’t have agency. They are built by, trained by, and controlled by people. Mostly for-profit corporations. Any AI regulations should place restrictions on those people and corporations. Otherwise the regulations are making the same category error I’ve been talking about. At the end of the day, there is always a human responsible for whatever the AI’s behavior is. And it’s the human who needs to be responsible for what they do—and what their companies do. Regardless of whether it was due to humans, or AI, or a combination of both. Maybe that won’t be true forever, but it will be true in the near future. If we want trustworthy AI, we need to require trustworthy AI controllers.</p>
<p>We already have a system for this: fiduciaries. There are areas in society where trustworthiness is of paramount importance, even more than usual. Doctors, lawyers, accountants…these are all trusted agents. They need extraordinary access to our information and ourselves to do their jobs, and so they have additional legal responsibilities to act in our best interests. They have fiduciary responsibility to their clients.</p>
<p>We need the same sort of thing for our data. The idea of a data fiduciary is not new. But it’s even more vital in a world of generative AI assistants.</p>
<p>And we need one final thing: public AI models. These are systems built by academia, or non-profit groups, or government itself, that can be owned and run by individuals.</p>
<p>The term “public model” has been thrown around a lot in the AI world, so it’s worth detailing what this means. It’s not a corporate AI model that the public is free to use. It’s not a corporate AI model that the government has licensed. It’s not even an open-source model that the public is free to examine and modify.</p>
<p>A public model is a model built by the public for the public. It requires political accountability, not just market accountability. This means openness and transparency paired with a responsiveness to public demands. It should also be available for anyone to build on top of. This means universal access. And a foundation for a free market in AI innovations. This would be a counter-balance to corporate-owned AI.</p>
<p>We can never make AI into our friends. But we can make them into trustworthy services—agents and not double agents. But only if government mandates it. We can put limits on surveillance capitalism. But only if government mandates it.</p>
<p>Because the point of government is to create social trust. I started this talk by explaining the importance of trust in society, and how interpersonal trust doesn’t scale to larger groups. That other, impersonal kind of trust—social trust, reliability and predictability—is what governments create.</p>
<p>To the extent a government improves the overall trust in society, it succeeds. And to the extent a government doesn’t, it fails.</p>
<p>But they have to. We need government to constrain the behavior of corporations and the AIs they build, deploy, and control. Government needs to enforce both predictability and reliability.</p>
<p>That’s how we can create the social trust that society needs to thrive.</p>

The tooling you're quoting specifically, wiz.io and ermetic.com do an incredible amount more than just "scan for IAM misconfigurations". In fact, I understand that to be one of their most insignificant features. Yet it sounds, from the numbers being quoted (I saw the "millions" figure being thrown around), that you are equating a company purchasing wiz.io as them purchasing "tooling to scan for IAM misconfigurations" exclusively. How much does the IAM scanning tooling actually cost, and what is the material cost of delayed remediation of over-permissioned entities?</p><p>2. Were a company to introduce Slauth into their stack, are you under the impression that they would then not need to scan their IAM for misconfigurations and would therefore be able to save "millions"? Would it not be fair to say that the presence of Slauth would not remove the need for IAM scanning tools, since IAM deployments could happen out of bounds, which is not something that Slauth removes from a companies threat model?

Because micromanaging permissions is hard, and the application needs to access so much content in S3, spin up/down instances, etc. it has ec2:* and s3:<i>. Unless the organization has created a separate AWS account for this platform specifically, it's probably game over at that point.</i></p><p> An internet-facing MDM solution has a code execution vulnerability. Because the vendor didn't want to document all of the individual permissions it needs, the installation instructions specify that it should run as an account with Domain Admin permissions in AD. That is definitely game over for most organizations, because even systems that don't authenticate against AD are almost always accessed from systems that do.</p><p>Micromanaging permissions is hard in a big organization. I saw it done well, years ago, in Active Directory, but it took several FTEs who were personally interested in the topic to set up and manage, and that was a traditional big business IT environment. In a startup-style free-for-all, good luck. I don't have an opinion either way on Slauth specifically, but something that generates IAM policies procedurally seems like a step in the right direction.

It would be really great to automatically align the security policy for each component with the intent of the component's author. Tightening an overly permissive policy is an awful job. I think that it often has to be done through a long trial-and-error process; remove all the permissions, and add back permissions one by one in response to observed program failures. So it's great to see another way to avoid that tedious chore.<p>A challenge with Slauth will be to organize the generated policies in a way that makes them legible. I would like the IAM policy to help clarify its intent. Allowing each in-use API endpoint is technically required to let the service work. It might be technically following the principal of least privilege. But the endpoint-by-endpoint rules do a poor job of summarizing the purpose of the policy or how it relates to the service. One way that we do this is by having resource providers declare managed policies that allow use of the resource. So the "encabulator" provider also defines a "mutate encabulator" managed policy. Then services that need to invoke "mutate encabulator" can reference the managed policy. They don't need to compute the ARN of every endpoint. The dependent service doesn't end up with an inline policy that has detailed dependencies on the implementation details of each target resource.

Proper IAM also takes dev cycles, and may not be top priority to get a policy correct.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>There is no denying that containers have taken over the mindset of most modern teams. With containers, comes the need to have orchestration to run those containers and currently there is no real alternative to Kubernetes. Love it or hate it, it has become the standard platform we have largely adopted as an industry. If you exceed the size of docker-compose, k8s is the next step in that journey.</p><p>Despite the complexity and some of the hiccups around deploying, most organizations that use k8s that I've worked with seem to have positive feelings about it. It is reliable and the depth and width of the community support means you are never the first to encounter a problem. However Kubernetes is not a slow-moving target by infrastructure standards. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="742" height="470" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image.png 742w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Kubernetes follows an N-2 support policy (meaning that the 3 most recent minor versions receive security and bug fixes) along with a <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-release/2572-release-cadence">15-week release cycle</a>. This results in a release being supported for 14 months (12 months of support and 2 months of upgrade period). If we compare that to Debian, the OS project a lot of organizations base their support cycles on, we can see the immediate difference. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="751" height="474" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-1.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png 751w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Red Hat, whose entire existence is based on organizations not being able to upgrade often, shows you at what cadence some orgs can roll out large changes. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="736" height="742" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-2.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-2.png 736w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now if Kubernetes adopted this cycle across OSS and cloud providers, I would say "there is solid evidence that it can be done and these clusters can be kept up to date". However cloud providers don't hold their customers to these extremely tight time windows. GCP, who has access to many of the Kubernetes maintainers and works extremely closely with the project, doesn't hold customers to anywhere near these timelines. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="795" height="358" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-3.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-3.png 795w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Neither does AWS or Azure. The reality is that nobody expects companies to keep pace with that cadence of releases because the tooling to do so doesn't really exist. Validating that a cluster can be upgraded and that it is safe to do so requires the use of third-party tooling or to have a pretty good understanding of what APIs are getting deprecated when. Add in time for validating in staging environments along with the sheer time involved in babysitting a Kubernetes cluster upgrade and a clear problem emerges. </p><h3 id="what-does-upgrading-a-k8s-cluster-even-look-like">What does upgrading a k8s cluster even look like?</h3><p>For those unaware of what a manual upgrade looks like, this is the rough checklist.</p><ul><li>Check all third-party extensions such as network and storage plugins</li><li>Update etcd (all instances)</li><li>Update kube-apiserver (all control plane hosts)</li><li>Update kube-controller-manager</li><li>Update kube-scheduler</li><li>Update the cloud controller manager, if you use one</li><li>Update kubectl </li><li>Drain every node and either replace the node or upgrade the node and then readd and monitor to ensure it continues to work</li><li>Run <code>kubectl convert</code> as required on manifests</li></ul><p>None of this is rocket science and all of it can be automated, but it still requires someone to effectively be super on top of these releases. Most importantly <strong>it is not substantially easier than making a new cluster. </strong>If upgrading is, at best, slightly easier than making a new cluster and often quite a bit harder, teams can get stuck unsure what is the correct course of action. However given the aggressive pace of releases, spinning up a new cluster for every new version and migrating services over to it can be really logistically challenging. </p><p>Consider that you don't want to be on the .0 of a k8s release, typically .2. You lose a fair amount of your 14 month window waiting for that criteria. Then you spin up the new cluster and start migrating services over to it. For most teams this involves a fair amount of duplication and wasted resources, since you will likely have double the number of nodes running for at least some period in there. CI/CD pipelines need to get modified, docs need to get changed, DNS entries have to get swapped. </p><p>None of this is impossible stuff, or even terribly difficult stuff, but it is critical and even with automation the risk of one of these steps failing silently is high risk enough that few folks I know would fire and forget. Instead clusters seem to be in a state of constant falling behind unless the teams are empowered to make keeping up with upgrades a key value they bring to the org. </p><p>My experience with this has been extremely bad, often joining teams where a cluster has been left to languish for too long and now we're running into concerns over whether it can be safely upgraded at all. Typically my first three months running an old cluster is telling leadership I need to blow our budget out a bit to spin up a new cluster and cut over to it namespace by namespace. It's not the most gentle onboarding process. </p><h3 id="proposed-lts">Proposed LTS</h3><p>I'm not suggesting that the k8s maintainers attempt to keep versions around forever. Their pace of innovation and adding new features is a key reason the platform has thrived. What I'm suggesting is a dead-end LTS with no upgrade path out of it. GKE allowed customers to be on 1.24 for 584 days and 1.26 for 572 days. Azure has a more generous LTS date of 2 years from the GA date and EKS from AWS is sitting at around 800 days that a version is supported from launch to end of LTS. </p><p>These are more in line with the pace of upgrades that organizations can safely plan for. I would propose an LTS release with a 24 months of support from GA and an understanding that the Kubernetes team can't offer an upgrade to the next LTS. The proposed workflow for operations teams would be clusters that live for 24 months and then organizations need to migrate off of them and create a new cluster. </p><p>This workflow makes sense for a lot of reasons. First creating fresh new nodes at regular intervals is best practice, allowing organizations to upgrade the underlying linux OS and hypervisor upgrades. While you should obviously be upgrading more often than every 2 years, this would be a good check-in point. It also means teams take a look at the entire stack, starting with a fresh ETCD, new versions of Ingress controllers, all the critical parts that organizations might be loathe to poke unless absolutely necessary. </p><p>I also suspect that the community would come in and offer a ton of guidance on how to upgrade from LTS to LTS, since this is a good injection point for either a commercial product or an OSS tool to assist with the process. But this wouldn't bind the maintainers to such a project, which I think is critical both for pace of innovation and just complexity. K8s is a complicated collection of software with a lot of moving pieces and testing it as-is already reaches a scale most people won't need to think about in their entire careers. I don't think its fair to put this on that same group of maintainers. </p><h3 id="lts-wg">LTS WG</h3><p>The k8s team is reviving the LTS workgroup, which was disbanded previously. I'm cautiously optimistic that this group will have more success and I hope that they can do something to make a happier middle ground between hosted platform and OSS stack. I haven't seen much from that group yet (the mailing list is empty: <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/wg-lts">https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/wg-lts</a>) and the Slack seems pretty dead as well. However I'll attempt to follow along with them as they discuss the suggestion and update if there is any movement. </p><p>I really hope the team seriously considers something like this. It would be a massive benefit to operators of k8s around the world to not have to be in a state of constantly upgrading existing clusters. It would simplify the third-party ecosystem as well, allowing for easier validation against a known-stable target that will be around for a little while. It also encourages better workflows from cluster operators, pushing them towards the correct answer of getting in the habit of making new clusters at regular intervals vs keeping clusters around forever. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>For some readers, when we talk today about ‘8-bit’ then it probably evokes a certain aesthetic : simple, blocky, colourful design. I think for anyone who was around at the time, though, it also generates a lot of nostalgia.</p><p>A whole generation, including I’m sure many Chip Letter readers, wrote their first programs on 8-bit systems. Those systems of the 1970s and the early 1980s made computing available, for the first time, to almost everyone. It was a formative time for many people who went on to build their careers in computing, and many who would play a key role in the development of modern computing.</p><p>This nostalgia explains a lot of the enduring enthusiasm for ‘8-bit’.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/the-virtues-of-the-8-bit-era-eight?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/the-virtues-of-the-8-bit-era-eight?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>On top of simple nostalgia, I think that there are lots of other reasons why there is so much affection for ‘8-bit’. Today’s systems are much, much more powerful and capable, but in adding that power, we’ve also lost something too. From the perspective of someone interested in how their computer worked at a ‘low-level’ and who wanted to program it at that level, then these systems had several attractions.</p><p>With some practice, you could keep the whole of an 8-bit processor’s instruction set in your head. Doing some of the things that we take for granted from hardware today (e.g. floating-point arithmetic) was difficult, but on the whole the low-level operation of these systems was much more approachable.</p><p>One side effect of simplicity, was that documenting every aspect of a computer in a single, readable, document was possible. 8-bit systems often came with great, both thorough and readable, documentation. If you wanted more then there was probably a comprehensive book covering assembly language for your processor of choice, available at your local bookstore.</p><p>Graphics and sound weren’t hidden behind ‘APIs’. There might be a rudimentary operating system but for the best performance, then you probably had to write code that interacted with the hardware directly.</p><p>High level languages were often too slow and commercial software had to be written in assembly language to get the required performance. And the simplicity of the processor design meant that it was usually possible and relatively straightforward to reason about the performance of assembly language code.</p><p>I’ve deliberately put Open Source here in inverted commas. Software of the era wasn’t open source in the modern sense. It was sometimes ‘source available’ though in the sense that software writers published their source code. I still have a copy of the book ‘Sargon : A Computer Chess Program’ which listed a chess program, written in 8080 assembly, in full.</p><p>And if the software writers didn't publish their own source then sometimes it would be disassembled and made widely available.</p><p>Perhaps most of all though, it was an era that saw a flourishing of hardware and software innovation and entrepreneurship : in microprocessors, in other semiconductors, in the computers that used them and the software that ran on those computers.</p><p>Many famous names started or flourished in this era: Intel, Apple, Microsoft, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo and others. Plus numerous less familiar names that nonetheless had a huge impact: Mostek, MOS Technology, Zilog, Acorn, and lots more. Not forgetting innovative software like VisiCalc.</p><p>And 8-bit processors never went away. They became the basis for billions of microcontrollers, hidden away in devices in homes, offices and factories.</p><p>I’m not completely overcome by nostalgia. 8-bit was the era of 64k memory, floppy disks, monochrome screens and so on. I wouldn't want any of these back.</p><p>There is an enduring appeal to the simplicity and accessibility of ‘8-bit’ though.</p><p>In the rest of this post, we’ll have a brief look at eight iconic microprocessors of the 8-bit era.</p><p>First though, paying subscribers can vote to select one of these designs for a more detailed history. I’ve omitted the 6502 as we’ve covered it in some detail already. Do please vote and let me know which you’d like covered next.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="content"><div><p>by <a href="https://dnikub.dev/">Daniela Kubesch</a> published on <time datetime="2023-12-04">Dec 04, 2023</time></p><p>In the fast-paced world of web development, it's easy to get caught up in the latest frameworks, libraries and cutting-edge technologies. But sometimes, the most impactful improvements come from revisiting the fundamentals.</p><p>In this blog post, I'll guide you through five HTML attributes that not only improve accessibility but also enhance the overall user experience. Whether you are an experienced developer or just starting, let's explore the potential of these elements to create a more inclusive web experience.</p><h2 id="1-hreflang">1. hreflang</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/links.html#attr-hyperlink-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code> attribute</a> <strong>specifies the language of a linked resource</strong> on an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element. It works like the <code>lang</code> attribute but is specifically used for links.</p><h3 id="why-use-hreflang?">Why use <code>hreflang</code>?</h3><p>You can improve the user experience and SEO by using <code>hreflang</code> for both internal and external site links.<br>Using <code>hreflang</code> on internal website links provides a way to tell search engines about different variations of a page for other languages or regions. This means that English speakers would receive the English version of the site, while Swedish speakers would receive the Swedish version. There is no need for manual switching on the user's end, resulting in a smoother experience.</p><h3 id="how-to-use-hreflang">How to use <code>hreflang</code></h3><p>Add the <code>hreflang</code> attribute with the needed <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">ISO language code</a> to your <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. For an English website, this would be <code>en</code>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English Website<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>You can also be more specific with the language code and use regional variations. For example, we can add <code>en-GB</code> for British English.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.at<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en-GB<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English Website<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>If your website is available in multiple languages, you can use <code>hreflang</code> to specify the language and region of a document associated with a specific URL. Adding the attribute will help search engines understand the language and regional targeting of different web page versions.</p><p>Add <code>hreflang</code> with the required language code to each link. One link should act as the default fallback version, identifiable by adding <code>hreflang="x-default"</code> instead of the language code. Lastly, set the value of the <code>rel</code> attribute to <code>"alternate"</code> for each link in the language switcher to indicate that the linked pages are alternatives to the present page.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>x-default<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/de<span>"</span></span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>You can also use <code>hreflang</code> in your language switcher.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>x-default<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/de<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>German<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>Sometimes, language switchers use link text in the language they are switching to. You can indicate this by additionally using the <code>lang</code> attribute.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>x-default<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/de<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Deutsch<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding the <code>lang</code> attribute is particularly important for assistive technology users. For instance, screen readers alter their voice and pronunciation based on the language attribute.</p><p>An additional way to enhance accessibility is to include <code>aria-current="true"</code> to the presently active link.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>x-default<span>"</span></span> <span>aria-current</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>true<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/de<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Deutsch<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><h2 id="2-translate">2. translate</h2><p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#attr-translate"><code>translate</code> attribute</a> is used to <strong>indicate whether an element should be translated</strong> or not.</p><h3 id="why-use-translate?">Why use <code>translate</code>?</h3><p>Most website text is translatable by default (with some exceptions such as text on images or within SVGs). Translation tools, such as Google Translate, may suggest translation of page contents if the site's defined language differs from the browser's default language.

                                                            <p><i><span>Earlier today, CEO <strong>Daniel Ek</strong> shared the following note about the company’s organizational changes with all Spotify employees.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Team,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Over the last two years, we’ve put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business – one designed to achieve our goal of being the world’s </span><span>leading audio company</span> <span>and</span><span> one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future. While we’ve made worthy strides, as I’ve shared many times, we still have work to do. </span><span>Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities.</span></p>
<p><span>This brings me to a decision that will mean a significant step change for our company. To align Spotify with our future goals and ensure we are right-sized for the challenges ahead, I have made the difficult decision to reduce our total headcount by approximately 17% across the company. I recognize this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions. To be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us.</span></p>
<p><span>For those leaving, we’re a better company because of your dedication and hard work. Thank you for sharing your talents with us. I hope you know that your contributions have impacted more than half a billion people and millions of artists, creators, and authors around the world in profound ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I realize that for many, a reduction of this size will feel surprisingly large given the recent positive earnings report and our performance. We debated making smaller reductions throughout 2024 and 2025. Yet, considering the gap between our financial goal state and our current operational costs, I decided that a substantial action to rightsize our costs was the best option to accomplish our objectives. While I am convinced this is the right action for our company, I also understand it will be incredibly painful for our team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To understand this decision, I think it is important to assess Spotify with a clear, objective lens. In 2020 and 2021, we took advantage of the opportunity presented by lower-cost capital and invested significantly in team expansion, content enhancement, marketing, and new verticals. These investments generally worked, contributing to Spotify’s increased output and the platform’s robust growth this past year. However, we now find ourselves in a very different environment. And despite </span><span>our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is still too big.</span></p>
<p><span>When we look back on 2022 and 2023, it has truly been impressive what we have accomplished. But, at the same time, the reality is much of this output was linked to having more resources. By most metrics, we were more productive but less efficient. We need to be both. While we have done some work to mitigate this challenge and become more efficient in 2023, we still have a ways to go before we are both productive and efficient. Today, we still have too many people dedicated to supporting work and even doing work around the work rather than contributing to opportunities with real impact. More people need to be focused on delivering for our key stakeholders – creators and consumers. In two words, we have to become </span><span>relentlessly resourceful</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>I know you will all be anxious to hear the next steps about how this process will work. If you are an impacted employee, you will receive a calendar invite within the next two hours from HR for a one-on-one conversation. These meetings will take place before the end of the day on Tuesday, and while <strong>Katarina</strong> will provide more detail on all of the specifics, please know the following will apply to all of these bandmates:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>Severance pay: </span></i><span>We will start with a baseline for all employees, with the average employee receiving approximately five months of severance. This will be calculated based on local notice period requirements and employee tenure.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>PTO:</span></i><span> All accrued and unused vacation will be paid out to any departing employee.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>Healthcare:</span></i><span> We will continue to cover healthcare for employees during their severance period.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>Immigration support:</span></i><span> For employees whose immigration status is connected with their employment, HRBPs are working with each impacted individual in concert with our mobility team.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>Career Support:</span></i> <i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>All employees will be eligible for outplacement services for two months.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For the team that will remain at Spotify, I know this decision will be difficult for many. Please know we are focused on treating our impacted colleagues with the respect and compassion they deserve.</span></p>
<h2><b>Looking Ahead</b></h2>
<p><span>The decision to reduce our team size is a hard but crucial step towards forging a stronger, more efficient Spotify for the future. But it also highlights that we need to change how we work. In Spotify’s early days, our success was hard won. We had limited resources and had to make the most of every asset. Our ingenuity and creativity were what set us apart. As we’ve grown, we’ve moved too far away from this core principle of resourcefulness.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Spotify of tomorrow must be defined by being relentlessly resourceful in the ways we operate, innovate, and tackle problems. This kind of resourcefulness transcends the basic definition – it’s about preparing for our next phase, where being lean is not just an option but a necessity.</span></p>
<p><span>Embracing this leaner structure will also allow us to invest our profits more strategically back into the business. With a more targeted approach, every investment and initiative becomes more impactful, offering greater opportunities for success. This is not a step back; it’s a strategic reorientation. We’re still committed to investing and making bold bets, but now, with a more focused approach, ensuring Spotify’s continued profitability and ability to innovate. Lean doesn’t mean small ambitions; it means smarter, more impactful paths to achieve them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today is a difficult but important day for the company. To be very clear, my commitment to our mission and belief in our ability to achieve it has never been stronger. I hope you will join me on Wednesday for Unplugged to discuss how we move forward together. A reduction of this size will make it necessary to change the way we work, and we will share much more about what this will mean in the days and weeks ahead. Just as 2023 marked a new chapter for us, so will 2024 as we build an even stronger Spotify.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>– Daniel</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>The Earth had been spinning on its axis for a billion years when the first living beings appeared. Since then, we have adapted to alternate between light and darkness. Geneticist and chronobiologist Michael Rosbash, 79, a professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts and a researcher at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland, reminded us of that fact in his acceptance speech for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X2jY8isna8" target="_blank">the 2017 Nobel Prize in Medicine</a>. The award, which he shares with his friend and collaborator Jeffrey C. Hall and Michael W. Young, recognized their contribution to deciphering the molecular gears of the biological clock that controls our circadian rhythms. From the Latin circa, “around” and dies, “day,” circadian rhythms are the 24-hour changes in our physiology that synchronize with the day-night cycle and modulate when we are hungry, sleepy, want sex and have asthma attacks or a fever in the afternoon.</p><p>Bacteria, plants and biomedical research’s most popular insect, the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> or fruit fly—the basis of Rosbash’s findings—also have biological clocks. On November 13, wearing a tie with Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s neuronal designs, the chronobiologist gave a lecture for young researchers, at the Madrid hospital named for the Spanish Nobel Prize winner, now celebrating two decades of its research foundation (FIBioHRC). The event took place within the framework of the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel-prize-inspiration-initiative/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize Inspiration</a> Initiative and in collaboration with the AstraZeneca Foundation, which arranged this interview with EL PAÍS in a nearby hotel.</p><p><b>Question</b>. During your Nobel Prize acceptance speech, you mentioned that 50% of our genes were regulated by circadian rhythms, but in your talk you said that it is at least 70%?</p><p><b>Answer</b>. I have updated the figure due to new research done over the past six years. The 50% figure came from research in rodents, but in 2019 there was a large study done on baboons, the first in primates, and [the figure] went to 70%.</p><p><b>Q</b>. How did you become interested in <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-14/why-do-we-often-wake-up-just-before-the-alarm-goes-off.html">chronobiology</a>?</p><p><b>A</b>. [It began] almost 50 years ago, through my friend Jeffrey C. Hall, who also started as a professor at my university. He was already working on fly neurogenetics and knew about circadian rhythms. I had laboratory expertise that could be useful for his research. I suggested that we collaborate and see if that would go anywhere.</p><p><b>Q</b>. And you two have made it this far.</p><p><b>A</b>. To my surprise [smiles].</p><p><b>Q</b>. You have forged your career with basic research, which is sometimes undervalued. How would you encourage young researchers to explore it and institutions or companies to fund it?</p><p><b>A</b>. I tell young researchers that I hope they do something interesting and that they like it. Public funding agencies face the biggest challenge, because basic research is the foundation for applied research; it is very short-sighted to try to short-circuit the process by going directly to something translational. It is politically convenient because the public understands if you say you are going to cure <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-07-07/azheimers-drug-leqembi-granted-full-fda-approval-paving-the-way-for-medicare-coverage.html">Alzheimer’s</a>, but if the foundations do not exist, it is money wasted. On the other hand, the pharmaceutical and biotech industries are very good at applied science. They make money and, when they see an opportunity, they go for it. I think public research organizations should focus on basic science, and industry should focus on applied science.</p><p><b>Q</b>. What links the circadian rhythms of flies, which have 100,000 neurons, and those of people, who have 86 billion?</p><p><b>A</b>. The basic process of keeping time. What happens in neurons is the same, although mammals have a larger number. From there, we try to use these neurons as a window into more general questions about brain science and behavior.</p><p><b>Q</b>. For example?</p><p><b>A</b>. Wiring. The general question is how animal brains carry out behavioral programs, how behavior works. Of course, a fruit fly performs simpler behaviors than we do and [is] simpler to investigate. So what is the program that enables complex behavior? We are making progress in appreciating how complex the circuits are at the anatomical level, even in the fly brain. It all has to do with the wiring, how the circuitry is designed to carry out a behavioral program.</p><figure><span><img alt="Michael Rosbash" decoding="auto" height="291" srcset="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KEIB7gzSA0Z8VMQcncJT-GLvFgc=/414x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg 414w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/w5kfpCLOZCxwttmkkR6ZrxJvt1E=/828x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg 640w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/riaEPf0kAuE0wUP8-zZeM8KqpQg=/980x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg 1000w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/wjwAC9RjP3x23Nu09QZltFiSmiI=/1960x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg 1960w" width="414" loading="lazy" src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KEIB7gzSA0Z8VMQcncJT-GLvFgc=/414x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw"><svg viewBox="0 0 40 40"><use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"></use></svg></span><figcaption><span>Nobel Laureate in Medicine Michael Rosbash, wearing a tie with Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s neuronal designs. </span><span>Jaime Villanueva</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>Q</b>. One of the things that flies and privileged people have in common is napping and sleeping at night. What is the biological purpose of sleep and of these intermediate pauses during the day?</p><p><b>A</b>. We do not know. Memories are consolidated <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-11-30/why-do-sleep-attacks-occur-during-the-day.html">during sleep</a> and neuronal morphology is modified during sleep. All that happens, but I do not think that is the major purpose of sleep. We do not know what fly and human sleep, for example, have in common. My guess is that it is related to metabolism, such as recharging ATP [adenosine triphosphate, a key energy molecule in cells]. The brain is the largest consumer of ATP; perhaps there is a metabolic need for recharging.</p><p><b>Q</b>. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.284.5423.2177" target="_blank">Our internal clock has a natural 24-and-a-quarter-hour cycle</a>. After millions of years here, why is it not set to 24 hours, and we have to synchronize daily?</p><p><b>A</b>. For humans, we don’t know, but there is information from other animals. Some, like sheep and rodents, are seasonal in terms of reproduction. Their physiology changes with the season, and the seasons are determined by the length of the day. To control their reproductive physiology, they compare the offset of their clocks with the length of the photoperiod, the amount of daylight, which varies throughout the year. That is, they use it as a measuring device, although this [explanation] is partly speculative.</p><p><b>Q</b>. How does electric light, which we even take to bed with us with our screens, contribute to chronodisruption?</p><p><b>A</b>. It is a problem, but it is difficult to estimate its severity. We are exposed to too much light at night and not enough during the day because indoor electric lighting is far inferior to sunlight. In fact, according to recent research, a lack of sunlight during the day is even worse than the presence of light at night. Many cases of sleep problems are cured by addressing these environmental factors.</p><p>On the other hand, research conducted in Colorado on people who camp out in nature for a couple of weeks found that they sleep better, go to bed when it gets dark and wake up earlier. There are also studies in Brazil comparing those who stayed in the jungle with those who moved to the city. They are like us, they sleep worse, they go to bed later; you can immediately see the change in pattern. All of them, like you and me, are slightly sleep deprived. If the lights go out in a seminar room at 4 p.m., half the audience is snoring right away. That does not happen with well-rested individuals. It’s a totally sleep-deprived culture.</p><p><b>Q</b>. You said you take your statins at night, when they are most effective. The time of day also influences the efficacy or adverse effects of antihypertensives, corticosteroids and <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-10-25/andres-cervantes-oncologist-innovative-cancer-drugs-have-similar-costs-regardless-of-their-benefit.html">chemotherapy</a>. Should we change the way they are prescribed?</p><p><b>A</b>. The short answer is yes. The more important question—as with almost everything in pharmacology and in life—is what is the cost-benefit analysis? For society, physicians and the pharmaceutical industry, what is gained versus what is lost by taking this into account? Giving chemotherapy for some cancers at 3 a.m. has worked better, but people don’t want to work at that hour. Until very convincing research is published, there is not going to be a significant change because there is so much inertia in everything we do.</p><p><b>Q</b>. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30455-3/fulltext" target="_blank">According to the WHO cancer agency (IARC), shift work or night work is potentially carcinogenic.</a> What would you advise people with those jobs?</p><p><b>A</b>. The trick is to pretend that night is day and vice versa. If you do this very rigorously, you can avoid most problems because your body doesn’t know what is day and what is night. What matters is how much light comes in and when you eat. If there is no light and you keep the room dark for eight hours of sleep, you are not interrupted and you don’t eat during that period, your body doesn’t know the difference. The problem is interacting with your family, with the rest of the world.</p><p><b>Q</b>. Why does snacking at night <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288903/" target="_blank">increase the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome</a>?</p><p><b>A</b>. We don’t really understand why. One hypothesis has to do with our DNA damage repair systems, which are regulated by the circadian clock. Food contains a mixture of nutrients and toxins. Plants produce toxins to avoid being eaten, such as psoralen, which is abundant in celery. Snacking at night introduces toxins that, at that hour, our repair systems are not ready to eliminate. There is also speculation that the major epidemic of epithelial cancers, such as colon cancer, in the U.S. is because of this.</p><p><b>Q</b>. Is this related to time-restricted feeding, which follows the pattern of light and dark?</p><p><b>A</b>. That diet is not much different from avoiding snacking at night. No one knows why these patterns are beneficial, but metabolism changes depending on the time of day, so eating food in sync with circadian metabolic processes makes sense. If something is not too difficult or painful and it makes sense, why not do it?</p><p><b>Q</b>. Juan Antonio Madrid, one of the pioneers of chronobiology in Spain, poses this question to you: Would it be possible to address the chronodisruption that comes with aging by manipulating the molecular clock with drugs?</p><p><b>A</b>. I think so. Older flies have the same sleep pattern as older people, fragmented sleep: in the first four hours, sleep is solid and then they start waking up frequently. In young people, sleep also becomes lighter after a few hours, but not so much that they wake up. Why this happens is not well understood. To some extent, this goes back to the previous question, what is sleep for? The two things are almost certainly related.</p><p><i>Sign up for&nbsp;</i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>our weekly newsletter</i></a><i>&nbsp;to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The properties of human memory have been investigated with several approaches, including clinical, psychological, and neuroimaging studies (<a href="#B34">Tulving, 2002</a>; <a href="#B33">Schacter et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#B21">Miyashita, 2019</a>). It remains to be elucidated how brain activations during retrieval processes are modulated by different encoding procedures, because it has been reported that retrieval performances on paired words became worse when the categorically similar target words were simultaneously encoded, suggesting the importance of the context-dependent encoding (<a href="#B26">Nairne, 2002</a>; <a href="#B12">Goh and Lu, 2012</a>). It is also possible that the manner with which specific information is encoded—e.g., whether by using a paper notebook, computer, or mobile device—may affect retrieval processes. A recent behavioral study showed that students who took longhand notes performed better on conceptual questions than those who took notes on laptop computers (<a href="#B25">Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014</a>). A reasonable explanation for this interesting finding would be that the use of a paper notebook enables users to summarize and reframe information in their own words for encoding, while the use of a laptop tends to encourage them to write down information more passively (i.e., more nearly verbatim). The former processes thus naturally ensure deeper and more solid encoding <i>via</i> the active process of making notes. Moreover, it has been reported that longhand note-taking enhanced the performance of students on recognition of memorized words, even though typing on a computer keyboard allowed greater speed (<a href="#B1">Aragón-Mendizábal et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the superiority of longhand note-taking for conceptual understanding is related to the use of paper for writing/reading since a behavioral study reported the superiority of paper to computer screens in terms of reading comprehension (<a href="#B36">Wästlund et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#B20">Mangen et al., 2013</a>). These studies indicated the importance of visual and tactile cues for perceiving <i>constant</i> physical sizes and spatial locations, because “the material substrate of paper provides physical, tactile, spatiotemporally fixed cues to the length of the text” (<a href="#B20">Mangen et al., 2013</a>). We hypothesized that the use of a paper notebook, together with longhand note-taking, would enhance both memory encoding and later retrieval processes that could then be investigated at the brain level. More specifically, the utilization of the paper likely enhances the processes of associating episodic (<i>what</i>) and spatial (<i>where</i>) information, especially in the hippocampus, given its well-established role in the integration of what/where/when information (<a href="#B4">Broadbent et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#B7">Eichenbaum, 2004</a>; <a href="#B5">Chadwick et al., 2010</a>).</p>
<p>To address this issue, we compared three groups of participants who used a paper notebook (Note), electronic tablet (Tablet), or smartphone (Phone) during the encoding phase. Participants in the Tablet group used a stylus pen, thereby controlling for the effects of longhand writing with a pen in the Note group. It should be noted that physical sizes and spatial locations of a document remain constant for a paper notebook, whereas they become variable on the display of a tablet or smartphone. Moreover, not only the physical interaction of the hand with the pen/paper during note-taking but the actual writing of notes relative to each page of the real paper provides more concrete encoding information, because that information can be easily erased and updated by new information on the physically same screen of a tablet or smartphone.</p>
<p>We asked participants to write down scheduled appointments, and then, after one hour during which they performed an interference task, we conducted a retrieval task in which we tested participants’ recognition memory of those appointments (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). We further hypothesized that the interaction with physical paper, rather than the mental editing/preparation of the notes or the physical act of handwriting, provides episodic and spatial information of notes relative to each page of real paper, together with visual/tactile information from the paper. These properties and cues of papers could help to retrieve specific information, and thus lead to increased activations in specified brain regions for the Note group, compared with the other groups using mobile devices lacking such processes.</p>

Recording and retrieval of schedule information. Participants first read dialogues (in Japanese), then extracted scheduled appointments contained in the dialogues, and wrote them down with a paper notebook (<i>Note</i> group), electronic tablet (<i>Tablet</i> group), or smartphone (<i>Phone</i> group). This procedure reproduces the daily making of to-do lists and naturally involves encoding processes. The upper panel shows a typical example (English translation) written by a participant. After an hour including an interference task, the participants were asked to answer questions about the appointments and reported their level of confidence in their answer to each question. The lower panel shows a typical trial in this retrieval task.</p>
</div> 


<p>It has been proposed that the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex support complementary functions in episodic memory and that the bidirectional information flow between these regions may play a crucial role in integrating and consolidating individual information (<a href="#B23">Moscovitch et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#B8">Eichenbaum, 2017</a>). A previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study reported that episodic memory of a word or picture is related to a functional network that includes the left posterior precuneus and the left lateral prefrontal cortex (<a href="#B19">Lundstrom et al., 2003</a>). On the other hand, language function is critically involved in human episodic memory, and some language-related regions would be recruited during both memory encoding and retrieval. The left lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) and left opercular/triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus (F3op/F3t) are suggested to have central roles in syntactic processing, whereas the left angular/supramarginal gyri (AG/SMG) make a major contribution to lexical processing (<a href="#B31">Sakai, 2005</a>). Moreover, the right frontal cortex was identified as a supportive region for syntactic processing (<a href="#B17">Kinno et al., 2014</a>). Activations in these regions would be observed during memory retrieval because fMRI studies showed that the hippocampus and language-related regions involved in the encoding phase were also activated during the retrieval phase (<a href="#B30">Rugg et al., 2008</a>). The retrieval task we used critically involved episodic memory of scheduled appointments, and thus activations in these regions would be increased more for the Note group than the other groups.</p>
<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>University student volunteers (48 native Japanese speakers, 18 females) aged 18–29 years were openly recruited from multiple sources, including the University of Tokyo and Sophia University, as well as the participant pool of the NTT Data Institute of Management Consulting. The laterality quotient (LQ) was measured according to the Edinburgh inventory (<a href="#B27">Oldfield, 1971</a>); all participants but one were right-handed, and the exception was both-handed (LQ: −14). As stated above, the participants were divided into three groups: Note, Tablet, and Phone groups (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>). These three groups were age- and LQ-matched (Kruskal–Wallis test, <i>p</i> &gt; 0.1), as well as gender-matched (Fisher’s exact test for count data, <i>p</i> = 0.17). Each participant first answered a questionnaire on their daily use of paper notebooks, electronic tablets, and smartphones for scheduling in an academic or personal context (seven-point scale for each). Based on this result, electronic tablet users were assigned to the Tablet group, and smartphone users (those on the highest scale for smartphone use) were assigned to either the Tablet or Phone group. To estimate short-term memory ability, we used the number-letter sequencing in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Fourth Edition (<a href="#B6">Drozdick et al., 2012</a>), and the maximum length of memorized sequences was not significantly different among the three groups (<i>p</i> = 0.4). All participants in the Note group used paper notebooks for daily schedule management, whereas eight and seven participants in the Tablet and Phone groups, respectively, also used paper notebooks for that purpose. To control the experience and accustomedness of using paper notebooks for daily schedule management, these 15 participants (with eight females) were separately designated the <i>Device</i> group, which was used in behavioral and activation analyses.</p>

Basic data on participants.</p></div> 


<p>Before they participated in the study, the nature and possible consequences of the studies were explained to each participant and written informed consent was obtained afterward. None of the participants had a history of neurological or psychological disorders. Approval for the experiments was obtained from the institutional review board of the University of Tokyo, Komaba.</p>
<h3>Stimuli and Tasks</h3>
<p>Two sets of written dialogues between two or three persons (a set of dialogues on academic matters and a set on personal matters) were presented to the participants, who were asked to imagine that they were participating in those dialogues. There were seven daily scheduled appointments for the academic context and seven for the personal context (in February and March, respectively). While silently reading the dialogues, participants were asked to enter each of these appointments into a monthly calendar (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>, upper panel). The participants used either a paper notebook [Noritsu NOLTY Notebook (2017), size 20.6 × 17.6 cm<sup>2</sup> when opened], an electronic tablet [iPad Pro 10.5 inch (2017), screen size 21.4 × 16.1 cm<sup>2</sup> in landscape orientation], or a smartphone (Google Nexus 5 LG-D821, screen size 6.2 × 10.9 cm<sup>2</sup> in portrait orientation), where the paper notebook and electronic tablet were similar in physical layout (size and orientation). All three types of calendars had a day, week, and month view, but we used only the month view. In the case of the paper notebook and electronic tablet, appointments could only be viewed and edited individually in the relevant month (i.e., discrete views). In the smartphone, individual weeks could be viewed and edited by swiping continuously (i.e., continuous views). This difference was notable, in that schedule information would be encoded relative to the <i>spatial configuration</i> of one month (see <a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) for the paper notebook and electronic tablet.</p>
<p>Regarding input methods, a four-color pen was used to write in the paper notebook [the use of color(s) was up to each participant], and a stylus pen was used to write on the electronic tablet with a free choice of multiple colors (without using a virtual keyboard). In the case of the smartphone, the text was written by either flick input with the finger(s) or by using a virtual keyboard. In Japanese, there are three types of characters (<i>hiragana</i>, <i>katakana</i>, and <i>kanji</i>; kanji basically consists of Chinese characters), and kana-kanji transformation is usually used for inputs in mobile devices and computers (kana-kanji transformation converts a limited number of hiragana to vast numbers of kanji by requiring users to select appropriate kanji from multiple candidates). The flick input utilizes a telephone keypad with a three by four layout, and one hiragana character can be selected by either tapping a keypad or flicking from a keypad to one of four directions (up, down, left, or right) to enter one of five hiragana characters sharing the same initial consonant.</p>
<p>We measured the time required by participants to write down the appointments, but we set no time limit. When the participants finished writing down, they were instructed to review the calendar for 30 s. Then, after the retention period for an hour including an interference task, participants were asked to recall those appointments in a retrieval task; the experimental purpose of writing down the appointments was not disclosed to them. The interference task involved listening comprehension; participants were informed that they would hear a story, and then be asked about its contents while lying in an MRI scanner. We used the first 6 min of a narrated version of a Japanese classic short story called “<i>Ma-jutsu</i> (<i>Magic</i>)” (written by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, narrated by Takeshi Sasaki, and published by Pan Rolling, Japan). This story was unfamiliar to all participants. The auditory stimuli were presented through a headphone and participants were not permitted to take notes while listening. Sixteen questions about the detailed contents of the story were displayed inside the scanner (two questions per run), and the participants pressed one of four buttons to select the right answer.</p>
<p>After a short break outside the scanner to adjust the time between the encoding and retrieval phases to 1 h, participants performed a retrieval task inside the scanner (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>, lower panel), in which 16 questions about detailed contents of the appointments were displayed (two questions per run). Out of the 16 questions, seven required recalling of the relationships between multiple appointments, one required the conversion from the date to the day of the week (using the spatial information of the calendar), and three required recalling from similar or confusing appointments. The remaining five questions were more straightforward and thus considered as the <i>easier</i> questions. In each trial, a question was presented with four choices, and the participants pressed a button to select the right answer within 10 s. After an interval of 1 s, participants reported their level of confidence (1–4 scale, 4 = very confident) for that answer by pressing one of four buttons within 2 s. These responses were used to assess the correctness of each participant’s self-evaluation, where the true positive rate vs. the false positive rate was plotted for each of the four levels of confidence. By connecting these plots, we obtained a receiver operating characteristics curve (<a href="#B9">Fawcett, 2006</a>), and we used the area under the curve (AUC) for this assessment (0 = perfectly wrong; 0.5 = no distinction; 1 = perfectly correct).</p>
<p>As a control condition, we added a 2-back task into the run with the retrieval task. In each trial of the 2-back task, two different non-words, each with three Japanese characters, were sequentially displayed (each for 2 s). These characters were randomly selected from those used in the retrieval tasks, where the same type of characters (either hiragana, katakana, or kanji) was presented in a block of trials. Then four choices were shown for 5 s with a new non-word to be remembered. The correct answer was the non-word that appeared 2-back before but in a different order of three characters. There were two to four continuous trials with button pressings in each block.</p>
<p>Each run consisted of three 2-back blocks and two retrieval task trials, in which a 2-back block always started first, and the 2-back blocks and retrieval task trials were alternated. As fMRI events, we estimated the 6-s memory retrieval phase [determined by response times (RTs)] and the subsequent 4-s <i>post hoc</i> period from each 10-s period of the retrieval task, as well as a 5-s event for the 2-back task. With regards to contrasts between events, we always applied an exclusive mask of negative activations for the control conditions (one-sample <i>t-test</i>, uncorrected <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). During the scans, the participants wore earplugs and an eyeglass-like MRI-compatible display (resolution = 800 × 600 pixels, framerate = 60 fps; VisuaStim Digital, Resonance Technology Inc., Northridge, CA, USA). The stimuli were all presented in yellow letters on a black background. For fixation, a small red cross was shown at the center of the screen when a stimulus was not shown. The stimulus presentation and collection of behavioral data (accuracy and RTs) were controlled using the Presentation software package (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA).</p>
<h3>MRI Data Acquisition</h3>
<p>The MRI scans were conducted in a 3.0 T scanner (Signa HDxt; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a bird-cage head coil. Each participant was in a supine position, and his or her head was immobilized inside the coil. As regards the structural images, high-resolution T1-weighted images of the whole brain (136 axial slices, 1 × 1 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup>) were acquired with a three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo (3D FSPGR) acquisition [repetition time (TR) = 8.6 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.6 ms, flip angle (FA) = 25°, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256 mm<sup>2</sup>]. With respect to the time-series data of fMRI, we used a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, FA = 78°, FOV = 192 × 192 mm<sup>2</sup>, resolution = 3 × 3 mm<sup>2</sup>). We scanned a set of 30 axial slices that were 3-mm thick with a 0.5-mm gap, covering the range of −38.5 to 66 mm from the line of the anterior commissure to the posterior commissure (AC-PC). In a single scanning run, we obtained 45 volumes and dropped the initial four volumes from analyses due to MR signal increases.</p>
<h3>fMRI Data Analyses</h3>
<p>The fMRI data were analyzed in a standard manner using SPM12 statistical parametric mapping software (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging<sup id="footnotesuper1"><a id="note1a"></a><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>; <a href="#B10">Friston et al., 1994</a>) implemented on MATLAB (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA). The acquisition timing of each slice was corrected using the middle slice (the 15th slice chronologically) as a reference for the functional images. We spatially realigned each volume to the first volume of consecutive runs, and a mean volume was obtained. We set the threshold of head movement during a single run as follows: within a displacement of 2 mm in any of the three directions, and a rotation of 1.4° around any of the three axes. These thresholds were empirically determined in our previous studies (<a href="#B16">Kinno et al., 2008</a>). If a run included one or several images over this threshold, we replaced the outlying image with an interpolated image, which was the average of the chronologically former and latter ones, and conducted the realignment procedure again. The realigned data were resliced every 3 mm using seventh-degree B-spline interpolation.</p>
<p>Each individual’s structural image was matched with the mean functional image generated during realignment. The resultant structural image was spatially normalized to the standard brain space as defined by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) using the extended version of the unified segmentation algorithm with light regularization; this is a generative model that combines tissue segmentation, bias correction, and spatial normalization in a single model (<a href="#B2">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</a>). The resultant deformation field was applied to each realigned functional image to be spatially normalized with non-linear transformation. All normalized functional images were then smoothed by using an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 9 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM). Low-frequency noise was removed by high-pass filtering at 1/128 Hz.</p>
<p>In the first-level analysis (i.e., the fixed-effects analysis within a participant), each participant’s hemodynamic responses were modeled for the following types of events: initial 2-back trials with encoding alone, other 2-back trials, 6-s memory retrieval phase of retrieval trials, and 4-s <i>post hoc</i> period of retrieval trials. These event types were separately set for each group. Each event was modeled with the boxcar function overlaid with a hemodynamic response function. To minimize the effects of head movement, the six realignment parameters obtained from preprocessing were included as a nuisance factor in a general linear model.</p>
<p>These modeled responses were then generated in a general linear model for each participant and used for the inter-subject comparison in a second-level analysis (i.e., the random-effects analysis for a group). To examine the activation of the regions in an unbiased manner, we adopted whole-brain analyses. For statistical analyses, a two-way ANOVA (group × event type) with <i>t</i>-tests was performed with three nuisance factors (age, gender, and laterality quotient), where the statistical threshold was set to family-wise error (FWE) corrected <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for the voxel level. For the anatomical identification of activated regions, essentially we used the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) method<sup id="footnotesuper2"><a id="note2a"></a><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> (<a href="#B35">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>) and the labeled data as provided by Neuromorphometrics Inc.<sup id="footnotesuper3"><a id="note3a"></a><a href="#note3">3</a></sup>, under academic subscription. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we adopted analyses of each region of interest (ROI) by using the MarsBaR-toolbox<sup id="footnotesuper4"><a id="note4a"></a><a href="#note4">4</a></sup>, in which an ROI was taken from a cluster identified by the “retrieval—2-back” contrast for all participants, which were further extracted with an AAL mask of each region.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Behavioral Results</h3>
<p>We first compared the amounts of time required to write down the scheduled appointments (i.e., the duration of schedule recording) among the Note, Tablet, and Phone groups, and we observed a significant difference by a one-way ANOVA (<i>F</i><sub>(2,45)</sub> = 6.5, <i>p</i> = 0.003; <a href="#F2">Figure 2A</a>). The duration was significantly shorter for the Note group compared to the Tablet and Phone groups combined (<i>t-test</i>, <i>t</i><sub>(46)</sub> = 3.2, <i>p</i> = 0.002). We also confirmed a significant difference between the Note and Device groups (<i>t</i><sub>(29)</sub> = 3.0, <i>p</i> = 0.003).</p>
<p>Relative to the chance level of 25% accuracy, the accuracy for the retrieval task was reliable and well below the ceiling level (<a href="#F2">Figure 2B</a>). The participants’ self-evaluation on confidence was also correct, because the AUC for the Note, Tablet, and Phone groups were 0.77 ± 0.14, 0.77 ± 0.12, and 0.74 ± 0.11, respectively, where group differences were not significant (<i>F</i><sub>(2,45)</sub> = 0.2, <i>p</i> = 0.8). The accuracy or RTs in the retrieval was not significantly different among the three groups (accuracy: <i>F</i><sub>(2,45)</sub> = 0.5, <i>p</i> = 0.6; RTs: <i>F</i><sub>(2,45)</sub> = 0.8, <i>p</i> = 0.5; <a href="#F2">Figure 2C</a>); the accuracy and RTs in the interference and 2-back tasks were also comparable among the three groups (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.4). However, we observed significant group differences when we focused on the easier questions of scheduled appointments (see “Materials and Methods” section; <a href="#F2">Figure 2B</a>). According to non-parametric tests for the data showing ceiling effects, the accuracy of the easier questions was significantly higher for the Note group than the Tablet group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <i>W</i> = 179, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and the difference between the Note and Device groups was marginally significant (<i>W</i> = 164, <i>p</i> = 0.06).</p>

</div> 


<p>The Tablet and Phone groups (or Device group) took more time for writing down (<a href="#F2">Figure 2A</a>), and this might be due to slower input of characters with such mobile devices (no typing on the computer keyboard). However, at least between the Note and Tablet groups, the use of a stylus pen was just similar to writing with a four-color pen, and the physical layout of a notebook or tablet was equated as much as possible (see “Materials and Methods” section). Moreover, there was ample time for every group to write down all appointments into a monthly calendar. Therefore, <i>shorter</i> amounts of time for writing down and <i>higher</i> accuracy in easier questions for the Note group suggest that those cognitive processes for the Note group were actually deeper and more solid.</p>
<p>When all participants in the three groups were combined, the accuracy in the retrieval and 2-back tasks were significantly correlated (Pearson’s correlation, <i>r</i> = 0.31, <i>t</i><sub>(46)</sub> = 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.03). RTs showed a significant correlation as well (<i>r</i> = 0.33, <i>t</i><sub>(46)</sub> = 2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02). These results confirm consistent immediate- and short-term memory capacities for every participant.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Activations in Bilateral Regions for the Note Group</h3>
<p>To identify brain regions specifically involved in the memory retrieval process, we directly compared activations between the 6-s memory retrieval phase and the 4-s <i>post hoc</i> period from each 10-s period of the retrieval task, denoted as “First 6 s—Last 4 s” contrast. This was because the mean RTs were less than 6 s for all but two participants (see <a href="#F2">Figure 2C</a>). With this stringent contrast during the same stimulus presentation and task, dynamic signal changes induced by such active retrieval processes should be revealed. As shown in <a href="#F3">Figure 3A</a>, localized activations were found bilaterally in the middle frontal gyrus, F3op/F3t, fusiform gyrus, AG/SMG, middle/inferior occipital gyrus (MOG/IOG), pallidum, and hippocampus; we also observed left-lateralized activation in the LPMC and precuneus.</p>

Activated regions for the retrieval task. <strong>(A)</strong> Results of the “First 6 s—Last 4 s” contrast within the retrieval task period are shown for all participants. <strong>(B)</strong> Results of the “retrieval—2-back” contrast are shown for all participants. The lines indicate the locations of the sections. Localized activations were observed bilaterally in the lateral premotor cortex/opercular/triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus (LPMC/F3op/F3t), angular/supramarginal gyri (AG/SMG), hippocampus, precuneus, and lingual gyrus/calcarine/inferior occipital gyrus (LG/calcarine/IOG; see <a href="#T2">Table 2</a> for the list of local maxima).</p>
</div> 


<p>It is still possible that these activations reflect immediate memory processes that were necessary to solve the retrieval task; note the above-mentioned correlation between performances of the two tasks. Thus, we further compared activations in the retrieval task (10-s period) against those in the 2-back task with more demanding immediate memory, which successfully removed common factors in both tasks (<a href="#F3">Figure 3B</a>). The result of activations replicated the above-mentioned regions (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>), providing appropriate ROIs for further analyses. Additional activations were found bilaterally in the lingual gyrus (LG) and calcarine sulcus; we also observed left-lateralized activation in the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (F3O).</p>

<p>We assessed percent signal changes for these ROIs, and found significant intergroup differences in the posterior hippocampus, precuneus, LG/calcarine/IOG, LPMC/F3op/F3t, and AG/SMG (<a href="#F4">Figures 4A–E</a>). Activations in the first four regions were significantly different between the Note group and the combined Tablet and Phone groups (hippocampus: <i>t</i><sub>(94)</sub> = 2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02; precuneus: <i>t</i><sub>(94)</sub> = 2.3, <i>p</i> = 0.03; LG/calcarine/IOG: <i>t</i><sub>(94)</sub> = 2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.008; LPMC/F3op/F3t: <i>t</i><sub>(94)</sub> = 2.0, <i>p</i> = 0.05), whereas those in the last region were significantly different between the Note and Phone groups (<i>t</i><sub>(62)</sub> = 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Activations in the LG/calcarine/IOG and LPMC/F3op/F3t were also significantly different between the Note and Device groups (LG/calcarine/IOG: <i>t</i><sub>(60)</sub> = 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.03; LPMC/F3op/F3t: <i>t</i><sub>(60)</sub> = 2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02), even when the experience/accustomedness of using paper notebooks was equated. Moreover, we observed a significant positive correlation between the RTs in the retrieval task and the averaged signal changes in the ROIs of LPMC/F3op/F3t and AG/SMG for all participants (<i>r</i> = 0.31, <i>t</i><sub>(46)</sub> = 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.03; <a href="#F4">Figure 4F</a>). This link between behavioral results and brain activations indicates that inner language processes were indeed involved in during memory retrieval <i>via</i> the function of the language-related regions.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Using three groups of participants who performed a schedule-recording task using a paper notebook, electronic tablet, or smartphone, followed by a retrieval task (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>), we obtained three major results. First, the duration of schedule recording was significantly shorter for the Note group than the Tablet and Phone groups, and accuracy was much higher for the Note group in easier (i.e., more straightforward) questions (<a href="#F2">Figure 2</a>). Because the input methods were equated as much as possible between the Note and Tablet groups, these results indicate that the cognitive processes for the Note group were actually deeper and more solid. Second, brain activations for all groups during the retrieval phase were localized in the bilateral hippocampus, precuneus, LG/calcarine/IOG, and LPMC/F3op/F3t (<a href="#F3">Figure 3</a>), confirming the involvement of verbalized memory retrieval processes for appointments. Third, activations in these regions were significantly higher for the Note group than those for the Tablet and Phone groups (<a href="#F4">Figure 4</a>). These enhanced activations for the Note group could not be explained by general cognitive loads or task difficulty, because overall task performances were similar among the groups. Brain activations for the Tablet and Phone groups were similar, where the difference in input methods did not affect the results. On the other hand, the Note and Tablet groups showed a clear difference in brain activations even if the physical layout and input methods were controlled. Brain activations were significantly different also between the Note and Device groups, even when accustomedness to paper notebooks or mobile devices was equated for daily usage. The significant superiority in both accuracy and activations for the Note group suggested that the use of a paper notebook promoted the acquisition of rich encoding information and/or spatial information of real papers (see the “Introduction” section) and that this information could be utilized as effective retrieval clues, leading to higher activations in these specific regions.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is crucially involved not only in memory encoding and retrieval processes but also in spatial memory itself. The hippocampal-entorhinal cortex provides spatial representations, as demonstrated by grid cells (<a href="#B13">Hartley et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#B24">Moser et al., 2015</a>). It has also been suggested that activations in the human hippocampus encode distances between locations in the real world (<a href="#B22">Morgan et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#B15">Howard et al., 2014</a>). In a recent fMRI study using a graph structure of pictures, the adaptation signals in the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex were suppressed for shorter distances on the graph, indicating that non-spatial relationships were also encoded in these regions (<a href="#B11">Garvert et al., 2017</a>). Other neuroimaging studies have shown that activations in the left posterior hippocampus were enhanced during retrieval compared with the encoding of word pairs (<a href="#B29">Prince et al., 2005</a>) and that better recollection of proverbs was associated with a larger volume of the bilateral posterior hippocampus (<a href="#B28">Poppenk and Moscovitch, 2011</a>). The results of the present study are consistent with these previous findings, in that the scheduled appointments included various cues of spatial and structural information in the calendar, which were especially abundant when participants used paper notebooks. Moreover, the retrieval of such encoded information was explicitly required by our retrieval task and was shown to elicit activations in the bilateral posterior hippocampus.</p>
<p>Concerning activation in the visual cortex, a previous study reported that the visual cortex was activated during the retrieval of pictorial visual information without actual visual stimulation (<a href="#B37">Wheeler et al., 2000</a>). The visual areas play a key role in visual imagery as well, and activations in those regions could be affected by focal attention during imagery (<a href="#B32">Sakai and Miyashita, 1994</a>). Indeed, a study with fMRI decoding revealed activation in the V1–V3 when participants reported visual imagery of an object during dreaming, about which was inquired afterward (<a href="#B14">Horikawa et al., 2013</a>). Another study reported that retrieval of visual information was related to activation patterns in the V1–V3, and further showed that the activation patterns in the hippocampus predicted the mnemonic strength (<a href="#B3">Bosch et al., 2014</a>). As regards the precuneus, a positron emission tomography (PET) study with a paired-word retrieval task showed memory-related activation for both visual and auditory stimuli, indicating a modality-general role of the precuneus (<a href="#B18">Krause et al., 1999</a>). The internal representation for visual imagery of the encoded calendar provides a plausible account for our results, in which the paper notebook provides richer information than mobile devices.</p>
<p>According to our previous study, the left F3op/F3t, right LPMC, and right F3op/F3t are included in the network for syntax and its supportive system (Network I; <a href="#B17">Kinno et al., 2014</a>), whereas the left LPMC is critical to the network for syntax and input/output interface (Network II). In the present study, we observed activation in the left F3t/F3O, which is an essential part of the network for syntax and semantics (Network III). Thus all three networks that are crucial for syntactic processing were involved in the retrieval of scheduled appointments. The enhanced activations for the Note group suggest that the use of paper notebooks even influenced natural language processes, possibly reflecting the encoding of specific episodes.</p>
<p>Our present experiments demonstrated that brain activations related to memory, visual imagery, and language during the retrieval of specific information, as well as the deeper encoding of that information, were stronger in participants using a paper notebook than in those using electronic devices. Our results suggest that the use of a paper notebook affects these higher-order brain functions, and this could have important implications for education, particularly in terms of the pros and cons of e-learning. The expanded use of mobile devices or computers could undercut the use of traditional textbooks and paper notebooks, which may in fact provide richer information from the perspective of memory encoding. Further research is needed to elucidate the actual changes in brain activation due to the long-term exposure to mobile devices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>I will describe Linux ext4 file system as simple and as comprehensive as possible with examples.</p><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: I am not an expert on ext4. Although I aim to make this article comprehensive enough to understand how ext4 works, I have omitted many features, so it is not a full description.</p></blockquote><p>I named this post a “Minimum Complete Tutorial”, because I will try to keep the content minimal by omitting the optional parts and extra features while completely describing everything in a fully functional ext4 file system. ext4 is not very simple, you probably need a few hours to go over everything written in this post.</p><p>I did not execute the examples in this Tutorial in order, and because the file system is very dynamic, there can be inconsistencies between sections or if you try to do it yourself and compare your results to the one I show in this post. However, this does not affect anything in terms of understanding how it works.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>While writing this post, I have used the <a href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout">Ext4 Disk Layout documentation</a>, the source of ext4 file system (in Linux Kernel), the source of e2fsprogs package (includes debugfs and dumpe2fs) and the source of coreutils package (includes ls).</p><h2 id="history">History</h2><p>ext4 is the default Linux filesystem since 2010. It is the successor of ext3 which is the successor of ext2. ext means extended filesystem and if you wonder, yes, there is also ext (v1, without any number in the name) but it was used for a very short time (around 1992) and ext2 replaced it very quickly. ext3 is introduced around 2000 with journaling support.</p><h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2><h3 id="creating-the-ext4-file-system">Creating the ext4 file system</h3><p>If you are using Linux, you are probably already using ext4 as your main file system. However, it is the best to have a play area, so I will create an ext4 file system on a USB memory stick, attached to <code>/dev/sda</code>.</p><p>First, I have created a GUID Partition Table (GPT) with a single Linux partition on it.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are plenty of information here and I will explain most of it.</p><p>The most basic storage layout concept of ext4 is Block. ext4 allocates storage in a series of blocks, just like LBA. However the ext4 Block size can be different. Block size in Superblock is 4096B = 4KB. There are Block count, 3908091, number of blocks in this filesystem.</p><p>The second basic storage layout concept of ext4 is Block Group. Blocks per group number of contiguous Blocks are organized into Block Groups, and in our file system it is 32768 = 32K.</p><p>Since we have 3908091 blocks, dividing this to 32K:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>3908091 / 32768 = 119, and since it is not a multiple of 32K,
</span></span><span><span>there is one more with less than 32K blocks.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So we have 120 Block Groups each containing 32K Blocks (except the last one), and each block is 4KB, and since each logical block is 512B, this means each block contains 8 logical blocks. This is the basic organization of ext4 on the storage, and see the figure below for a visual summary.</p><figure><img src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/ext4-block-group-blocks-logical-blocks.png" alt="1 Block Group = 32768 File System Blocks = 32768 * 8 Logical (Storage) Blocks"><figcaption><p>1 Block Group = 32768 File System Blocks = 32768 * 8 Logical (Storage) Blocks</p></figcaption></figure><p>Each block group contains:</p><ul><li>Superblock, contains information about the file system. It is one block and the first block.</li><li>Group Descriptors (or Group Descriptors Table or Block Group Descriptors or Block Group Descriptors Table), contains the location of where the Data Block Bitmap, inode Bitmap and inode Table are in a Block Group. So there are as many Group Descriptors as number of Block Groups. Depending on the number of Block Groups, it is one or more blocks. It always follows the Superblock.</li><li>Reserved Group Descriptor Table (GDT) Blocks. When you first create the file system, these blocks are reserved for future expansion of the file system, since ext4 file system can be enlarged later. Future expansion means more Blocks and Block Groups, so there will be a need for more Group Descriptors. It is zero or more blocks and always follows the Group Descriptors. resize_inode filesystem feature indicates there are reserved blocks for filesystem expansion.</li><li>Data Block Bitmap, indicates which data blocks are in use. It is one block. Its location is not fixed, it is indicated in the Group Descriptor.</li><li>inode Bitmap, indicates which entries in inode table are in use. It is one block. Its location is not fixed, it is indicated in the Group Descriptor.</li><li>inode Table, contains inodes (inode structures). Inode is basically a data structure for every file and directory. It is one or typically more blocks. Its location is not fixed, it is indicated in the Group Descriptor.</li><li>Data blocks, keep the actual contents of the files. It is one or typically more blocks. It is basically all other blocks in a Block Group.</li></ul><p>As expected, each bit in (Data Block and inode) Bitmap, indicates the usage of one data block or one entry in inode Table. Since a Bitmap is one block and one block is 4KB so 32Kbits, there can be maximum 32K blocks in a Block Group — which is already the case. Also, there can be a maximum of 32K inodes in a Block Group, but we have only 8144, Inodes per group, now.</p><p>Looking at the Superblock again:</p><ul><li>Reserved GDT blocks: 954, number of blocks reserved for future expansion of the filesystem.</li><li>Inode blocks per group: 509, size of inode Table in each block group. This number is connected to two other numbers. Inode Size, 256B , and there are, Inodes per group, 8144 of them, so 256B * 8144 / 4096B = 509 blocks per group for inodes.</li></ul><p>You may think now we know all about the layout of the ext4 file system, but we still do not. It is important we look into two Filesystem features (see Superblock), sparse_super and flex_bg which affects the layout.</p><h3 id="superblock-backups">Superblock Backups</h3><p>Since the Superblock contains important information, and losing it results in a complete failure of the file system (you cannot read the filesystem if you do not know the parameters I mentioned above), it has backups (or in other words there are redundant copies of it) in every Block Group. However, this can be too much. In our example, which is a small file system, do we need 120 backups ? So sparse_super feature indicates the redundant copies of the Superblock are only kept in a few block groups, specifically with block group number 0 (which is the primary copy) and if block group number is a power of 3, 5 or 7.</p><p>Calculating this for our case, from block numbers 0 to 119 (inclusive), we expect the following block groups to contain redundant copies:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>1 3 5 7 9 25 27 49 81
</code></pre><p>If we multiply each with 32768 (blocks per group), we can find the block numbers as shown in the mkfs output:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>32768 98304 163840 229376 294912 819200 884736 1605632 2654208
</code></pre><p>sparse_super also affects the Group Descriptors . By default, Group Descriptors is present in every Block Groups like the Superblock. If sparse_super is present, it is only present in the Block Groups containing the redundant copies of the Superblock as calculated above. We can assume the Superblock and Group Descriptors stay always together.</p><h3 id="block-groups-and-flex-block-groups">Block Groups and Flex Block Groups</h3><p>The other filesystem feature we will look is flex_bg which means Flexible Block Groups. This feature is added with ext4. Flexible Block Groups are basically another level of organization over the Block Group, where a Flexible Block Group contains a group of contiguous Block Groups, basically aggregating the data block bitmaps, inode bitmaps and inode tables of all block groups in a flexible block group into the first block group.</p><p>If we look at the Superblock, Flex block group size is 16. So 16 contiguous Block Groups are packed into a Flex group, and the first Block Group in each Flex Group will contain the data block bitmaps, inode bitmaps and inode tables of all Block Groups (0..15).</p><p>We have:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>119 / 16 = 7, and again 119 is not a multiple of 16,
</span></span><span><span>so there is one more with less than 16 Block Groups.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>8 Flexible Block Groups. The last Flexible Block Group contains only 8 Block Groups (112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119).</p><blockquote><p>Note: There is also a meta_bg file system feature which we do not have here. Meta Block Groups can organize Block Groups differently.</p></blockquote><p>In order to understand Block Group contents, I think it is easier to think there are 3 types of Block Groups (Please be aware this is how I describe, it is not an official categorization):</p><ul><li>Type 1a (Block Group 0, if Block Size = 1024B): Block 0 is marked as used and not used (so first 1024B are not used). Block 1 contains the primary Superblock, then many blocks of Group Descriptors and Reserved GDT Blocks follows; then same as Type 3.</li><li>Type 1b (Block Group 0, if Block Size &gt; 1024B): First 1024B of Block 0 is padding and not used. Block 0 contains primary Superblock (after offset 1024), then many blocks of Group Descriptors and Reserved GDT Blocks follows; then same as Type 3.</li><li>Type 2: Block Groups containing backup copies of Superblock and Group Descriptors. Block 0 is Superblock, then many blocks of Group Descriptors and Reserved GDT Blocks follows; then same as Type 3.</li><li>Type 3: Block Groups not containing backup copies of Superblock and Group Descriptors. They may contain Data Bitmap(s), inode Bitmap(s), inode Table(s) and Data Blocks. The location of Bitmaps and inode Table is indicated in the Group Descriptor, so the order may not be like this.</li></ul><p>The first 1024 bytes in Block 0 can be used for boot code, that is why it is not used in ext4.</p><p>The First block value, 0, in Superblock is used for this purpose and when Block Size is 1024. If you create the ext4 file system with:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>$ mkfs -t ext4 -b 1024 /dev/sda
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>it uses 1K blocks. If you dump the Superblock of it and look at the First Block:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>$ sudo dumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1 | grep "First block"
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>First block:              1
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>we can see the Block 0 is completely discarded.</p><p>As far as I understand, there is no other use of this value, it is either 1 or most of the time it is 0.</p><p>In our example:</p><ul><li>number of Type 1b Block Groups: 1 (only Block Group 0)</li><li>number of Type 2 Block Groups: 9 (ones containing the Superblock backups</li><li>number of Type 3 Block Groups: 110 (all others)</li></ul><p>When we have Flexible Block Groups, we can have sub groups of each types since only the the first block of Flex Group contains the Bitmaps and inode Table. So I will name them like Type 2-head and Type 2-rest. Type 1 is always head since it is always Block Group 0.</p><p>Also, Type 2-head Block Group is impossible. Because the number of a Block Group with a backup should be a power of 3, 5 or 7 (so an odd number) and it has to be divisible by the number of Block Groups in a Flexible Block Group, which in turn can only be a power of 2 (so an even number), and a number cannot be both odd and even, so there is no such number and Type 2-head is not possible.</p><p>Now we know all about the layout of Block Groups and Blocks of our ext4 file system. We can actually dump information about all of the Block Groups with <code>dumpe2fs</code>.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>$ sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 &gt; dump
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The dump file is long since it contains information for every Block Group (120 of them). I will show you only a few, one from each type.</p><p>First Block Group (Block Group 0):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Group 0: (Blocks 0-32767) [ITABLE_ZEROED]

It is 60 bytes.</p><p>There are four possibilities:</p><ol><li>For Symbolic Links, if the name of the target fits to 60 bytes, it is stored here. If not, other methods below are used.</li><li>If Inline Data feature is enabled, and if the contents of a file is less than 60 bytes, it can be directly stored, not our case.</li><li>In Direct/Indirect Block Addressing, there are 11 direct, 1 indirect, 1 double indirect, 1 triple indirect (total 15, since 60 bytes / 4 = 15) maps. Indirect means the block at that address is not a data block but another block listing addresses of another address blocks, and it is possible to have one 1, one 2 (double), one 3 (triple) indirections. So with 4K blocks, it is possible to address <code>11 + 1024 + 1024*1024 + 1024*1024*1024</code> blocks. However, no address can be 64-bits (since each address is 4 bytes). My understanding is Direct/Indirect Block Addressing was used in ext2 and ext3, but not in ext4 anymore.</li><li>Extent Tree is used in ext4 and inode has a flag for it (EXT4_EXTENTS_FL, see above). Extent Tree is a tree with a maximum depth 5 and with a maximum branching factor of 2¹⁶ = 64K. It is more efficient than Direct/Indirect Block Addressing, and can address 64-bit block addresses.</li></ol><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Extent Tree is used because of the filesystem feature extent is enabled, see Superblock.

As I mentioned above, we have only allocated space, the blocks are uninitialized (Uninit flag). Also, note that 10GB file is addressed with only 2 levels, there can be up to 5 levels.</p><h3 id="revisiting-links">Revisiting Links</h3><p>For the symbolic link, I said the name of the target is kept at data blocks. This is the main difference between a hard link and a symbolic link. Hard link is a direct pointer to an inode — just a different name in directory entries — , whereas Symbolic link is an indirect pointer through the name of the file / directory.</p><p>Lets make an example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>$ touch t
</span></span><span><span>$ ln t hl
</span></span><span><span>$ ln -s t sl
</span></span><span><span>$ ls -ila

</span></span><span><span>13 -rw-rw-r — 2 mete mete 0 Aug 25 12:18 t
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you see, actual file is at inode 13. Symbolic link is at a new inode 14. However, hard link is pointing to same inode 13. So it is just a directory entry, it does not have its own inode or data blocks. If you check debugfs stat /t and /hl output, they are same.</p><p>This is the reason you cannot have an hard link pointing something that does not exists, whereas it is possible to do this with a symbolic link, since it is just a name/path, it can be anything. Hard link has to point an existing inode.</p><p>What happens if I delete the file or hard link ? Nothing, because there is still another name pointing to the inode. The # of links number in inode is updated accordingly, so until there is no hard link left, the inode is not deleted.</p><p>Another way of thinking about these are:</p><ul><li>File is an inode, at least one hard link and data.</li><li>Directory is an inode, at least two hard links (one from itself, one from parent), and its directory entries data.</li><li>Symbolic link is an inode, at least one hard link and a path.</li></ul><p>Mind bending, but yes, you can have a hard link for a symbolic link pointing to a hard link for file.</p><h3 id="other-file-system-features">Other File System Features</h3><p>For the sake of completeness, I would like to tell you about:</p><ul><li>dir_index: Basically it enables the use of Hash Tree Directory entries. However, the corresponding inode of directory should also have the flag EXT4_INDEX_FL set if it is in use.</li><li>dir_nlink: Normally the number of hardlinks to an inode is kept in the inode structure, as an 16-bit number. That means there can be maximum 64K hard links to an inode. On the other hand, since all subdirectories of a directory contain the entry “..” for the parent directory as a hard link, it means there can be only 64K subdirectories of a directory. When dir_nlinks feature is present, ext4 does not keep track of this counter for directories, if more than 64K subdirectories is used, when it is the case, it is set to 1.</li></ul><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Actually a directory can have a maximum 64K - 2 subdirectories. Since there is always a reference to it from the parent directory, and there is a reference to itself.

However, for performance reasons, we do not want to write or sync every change to ext4. If the system crashes meanwhile, the changes that are not written to ext4 will be lost. That is where Journal is needed. Every such operation is written to Journal first (not to ext4 first) and it is finalized later (written to ext4 later). If the system crashes, during recovery, probably on the next boot, Journal is replied back to ext4 so changes are applied and not lost.</p><p>Journal can be used in three different modes. This can be set with the mount option data.</p><ul><li>journal: All data (both metadata and actual data) is written to Journal first, so the safest.</li><li>ordered: This is the default mode. All data is sent to ext4, metadata is sent to Journal also. No protection for data but metadata is protected for crash.</li><li>writeback: Data can be written to ext4 before or after being written to Journal. On a crash, new data may get lost.</li></ul><p>The information / blocks is written to Journal like this:</p><ul><li>First, a Descriptor Block is written, containing the information about the final locations of this operation.</li><li>Second, a Data Block is written. It can be actual data or meta data.</li><li>Third, a Commit Block is written. After this, the data can be sent to ext4.</li></ul><p>Other than Commit Block, ongoing operation can be cancelled with a Revocation Block. Also, if a Commit Block is not found, when a replay happens (e.g. crash then recovery), it is not written to ext4.</p><p>Another device can be used as a Journal, but usually Journal is a file inside ext4. Looking back to Superblock, we can see:</p><ul><li>has_journal feature is set, so we are using a Journal.</li><li>Journal inode is 8</li><li>Journal size is 128M</li><li>Journal length is 32K (of Journal blocks)</li></ul><p>The Journal is kept in ext4, but, I think, because inode 8 is not listed in any directory entries, it is hidden.

<p>D allows writing large code fragments without redundantly specifying types,
like dynamic languages do. On the other hand, static inference deduces types and other
code properties, giving the best of both the static and the

<p>D compiles naturally to efficient native code.</p>

<p>D is designed such that most "obvious" code is fast <i>and</i>
safe. On occasion a function might need to escape the confines of type
safety for ultimate speed and control. For such rare cases D offers
native pointers, type casts, access to any C function without any
intervening translation, manual memory management, custom allocators
and even inline assembly code. <a id="a5-control"></a></p><div id="a5">

Then the recipe to make it was lost. By piecing together ancient clues, could one man bring it back?</p><div><p>A</p><div><p>At first, they just looked like stains. It was 2002 at the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/high-prestige-royal-purple-dyed-textiles-from-the-bronze-age-royal-tomb-at-qatna-syria/69EC1A74600EC74AAAC26D2F585ACF5A">site of Qatna</a> – a ruined palace at the edge of the Syrian desert, on the shores of a <a href="https://www.torrossa.com/en/resources/an/2422040">long-vanished lake</a>. Over three millennia after it was abandoned, a team of archaeologists had been granted permission to investigate – and they were on the hunt for the royal tomb.</p>
<p>After navigating through large hallways and narrow corridors, down crumbling steps, they came across a deep shaft. On one side were two identical statues guarding a sealed door: they had found it. Inside was a hoard of ancient wonders – 2,000 objects, including jewellery and a large golden hand. But there were also some intriguing dark patches on the ground. They sent a sample for testing – eventually separating out a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/high-prestige-royal-purple-dyed-textiles-from-the-bronze-age-royal-tomb-at-qatna-syria/69EC1A74600EC74AAAC26D2F585ACF5A">vivid purple layer</a> from the dust and muck.</p>
<p>The researchers had uncovered one of the most legendary commodities in the ancient world. This precious product forged empires, <a href="https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2032421/1/A%20Zadorojnyi%20Colour%20in%20Suetonius.pdf">felled kings</a>, and cemented the power of generations of global rulers. The Egyptian Queen Cleopatra was so obsessed with it, she even used it for the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=86MaBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=cleopatra+tyrian+purple+sails+barge&amp;ots=LNomeumMkA&amp;sig=GWkGxXgykg_LQrTI3158PpF_Dc4">sails of her boat</a>, while some Roman emperors decreed that anyone caught wearing it – other than them – would be sentenced to death. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That invention was Tyrian purple, otherwise known as shellfish purple. But though this noble pigment was the most expensive product in antiquity – worth more than <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138614251930071X">three times</a> its weight in gold, according to a Roman edict issued in 301 AD – no one living today knows how to make it. By the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">15th Century</a>, the elaborate recipes to extract and process the dye had been lost.</p>
<p>But why did this alluring colour disappear? And can it be resurrected?</p>
<p>In a small garden hut in north-eastern Tunisia, just a short distance from what was once the Phoenician city of Carthage, one man has spent most of the last 16 years smashing up sea snails – attempting to coax their entrails into something resembling Tyrian purple.</p></div></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpdcg"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpdcg.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpdcg.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpdcg.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpdcg.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdcg.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdcg.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpdcg.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpdcg.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="After more than three thousand years of mingling with sediment, the Tyrian purple found in Qatna’s royal tomb was still intensely colourful (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdcg.jpg" alt="After more than three thousand years of mingling with sediment, the Tyrian purple found in Qatna’s royal tomb was still intensely colourful (Credit: Alamy)" id=""></picture><div><p>After more than three thousand years of mingling with sediment, the Tyrian purple found in Qatna’s royal tomb was still intensely colourful (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>A fishy empire</strong></p>
<p>Tyrian purple was paraded by the most privileged in society for millennia – a symbol of strength, sovereignty and money. Ancient authors are particular about the precise hue that was worthy of the name: a <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=5750d98181fd002503d2b147235bf6fa75ad334c">deep reddish-purple</a>, like that of coagulated blood, tinged with black. Pliny the Elder described it as having a "<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D9&amp;force=y">shining appearance</a> when held up to the light". &nbsp;</p>
<p>With its uniquely intense colour and resistance to fading, Tyrian purple was adored by ancient civilisations across Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. It was so central to the success of the Phoenicians it was named after their city-state Tyre, and they became known as the "purple people". The shade could be found on everything from cloaks to sails, paintings, furniture, plaster, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/4/1/10">wall paintings</a>, jewellery and even burial shrouds.</p>
<p>In 40 AD, the king of Mauretania was killed in a surprise assassination in Rome, ordered by the emperor. Despite being a friend to the Romans, the unfortunate royal had caused grave offence when he <a href="https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2032421/1/A%20Zadorojnyi%20Colour%20in%20Suetonius.pdf">strode into an amphitheatre</a> to watch a gladiatorial match… wearing a purple robe. The jealous, insatiable lust that the colour ignited was sometimes <a href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL353.249.xml?readMode=recto">compared to a kind of madness</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A slimy mystery</strong></p>
<p>Oddly, the most celebrated pigment the world has known did not start life as a beautiful ultramarine gemstone, like its contemporary <a href="https://exhibitions.kelsey.lsa.umich.edu/ancient-color/blue.php">lapis lazuli</a> – or a vibrant <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/rubia-tinctorum">tangle of coral-pink roots</a>, like the red dye madder. Instead, it began as a clear fluid produced by sea snails in the Murex family. More specifically, it was mucous.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpb1s"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpb1s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpb1s.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpb1s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpb1s.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpb1s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpb1s.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpb1s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpb1s.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Tyrian purple has been found in paintings dating back to the Bronze Age (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpb1s.jpg" alt="Tyrian purple has been found in paintings dating back to the Bronze Age (Credit: Alamy)" id=""></picture><div><p>Tyrian purple has been found in paintings dating back to the Bronze Age (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p>Tyrian purple could be produced from the secretions of three species of sea snail, each of which made a different colour: <em>Hexaplex trunculus </em>(bluish purple), <em>Bolinus brandaris</em> (reddish purple), and <em>Stramonita haemastoma </em>(red).</p>
<p>Once snails had been collected, either by hand along rocky coastlines or with traps baited with other snails – Murex sea snails are predators – it was time to harvest the slime. In some places, the mucous gland was sliced it out using a specialised knife. One Roman author explained how <a href="https://digitalvirgil.co.uk/pvs/2013/part9.pdf">the snail's gore would then ooze out of its wounds</a>, "flowing out like tears", before being collected into mortars for grinding. Alternatively, smaller species could be crushed whole.</p>
<p>But this is the end of the certainty. Accounts of how colourless snail slime was transformed into the dye of legends are vague, contradictory and sometimes obviously mistaken – Aristotle said the mucous glands came from the throat of a "<a href="https://www.academia.edu/7606396/Dying_in_Purple_Life_Death_and_Tyrian_Dye_in_the_Aeneid">purple fish</a>". To complicate matters further, the dyeing industry was highly secretive – each manufacturer had their own recipe, and these complex, multi-step formulas were closely guarded.</p>
<p>"The problem is that people did not write down the important tricks," says Maria Melo, a professor of conservation science at NOVA University of Lisbon, Portugal.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvnqdq"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvnqdq.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvnqdq.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvnqdq.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvnqdq.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvnqdq.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvnqdq.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvnqdq.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvnqdq.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Murex snails may also have been the historic source of “tekhelet” – a sacred colour in the Jewish tradition mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvnqdq.jpg" alt="Murex snails may also have been the historic source of “tekhelet” – a sacred colour in the Jewish tradition mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" id=""></picture><div><p>Murex snails may also have been the historic source of “tekhelet” – a sacred colour in the Jewish tradition mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><h3>A purple pong</h3><div><p>In antiquity, Tyrian purple was not just renowned for its colour. Dyeworks were hotbeds of rotting fishy flesh with the added <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=5750d98181fd002503d2b147235bf6fa75ad334c">piquancy of urine</a> – often used to help <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/from-gunpowder-to-teeth-whitener-the-science-behind-historic-uses-of-urine-442390/">pigments stick</a>. Whole neighbourhoods could become enveloped in this putrid aroma, and cities where it was manufactured were considered <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">unpleasant places to live</a>. The smell would permeate deep into the fibres of stained cloth, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6236399/">lingering</a> long after it was purchased. Since the wealthy had exclusive access to this shade, it may have been advisable to stay upwind of them. <strong><em>(Read more from the BBC about the </em></strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180801-tyrian-purple-the-regal-colour-taken-from-mollusc-mucus"><strong><em>disgusting origins of the colour purple</em></strong></a><strong><em>.)</em></strong></p></div></div><div><p>The most detailed record comes from Pliny, who explained the process in the 1st Century AD. It went something like this: after isolating the mucous glands, they were salted and left to ferment for three days. Next came the cooking, which was done in tin or possibly lead pots on a "moderate" heat. This continued until the whole mixture had been boiled down to a fraction of its original volume. On the tenth day, the dye was tested by dipping in some fabric – if it emerged stained with the desired shade, it was ready.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that each snail only contained the tiniest amount of mucous, it could take some 10,000 to make just a <a href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/255412">single gram of dye</a>. Mounds of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/371717?journalCode=jnes">billions of discarded sea snail shells</a> have been reported in areas where it was once manufactured. In fact, the production of Tyrian purple has been described as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6236399/">first chemical industry</a> – and this not only applies to the scale of the operations, but their exacting nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is not really easy to obtain the colour," says Ioannis&nbsp;Karapanagiotis, a professor of conservation chemistry at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. He explains that Tyrian purple is totally unlike other dyes, where the raw material – such as leaves – contains the pigment already. Instead, the sea snail mucous contains chemicals which can be <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/13/3595">turned into a dye</a>, but only under the right conditions. "It is quite amazing," he says. And yet, many crucial details of the process are long forgotten.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpd89"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpd89.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpd89.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpd89.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpd89.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpd89.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpd89.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpd89.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpd89.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="In ancient and medieval times, Tyrian purple was so valuable, it was often faked – usually with a combination of blue dye from indigo plants and red madder (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpd89.jpg" alt="In ancient and medieval times, Tyrian purple was so valuable, it was often faked – usually with a combination of blue dye from indigo plants and red madder (Credit: Alamy)" id=""></picture><div><p>In ancient and medieval times, Tyrian purple was so valuable, it was often faked – usually with a combination of blue dye from indigo plants and red madder (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>An abrupt decline </strong></p>
<p>In the early hours of 29 May 1453, the Byzantine city of Constantinople was captured by the Ottomans. This was the end of the Eastern Roman Empire – and it <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">took Tyrian purple with it</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, the city's dyeworks were at the centre of the industry. The colour had become deeply bound to Catholicism – worn by cardinals and used to dye the pages of religious manuscripts. But it had already been suffering, after a succession of excessive <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">taxes</a>. Now the church had lost control of the pigment's production altogether. So, the pope soon decided that red would become the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">new symbol of Christian power</a>. This could be made easily and cheaply by crushing scale insects.</p>
<p>However, there may also have been another factor in the demise of Tyrian purple. In 2003, scientists stumbled upon a pile of sea snail shells at the site of the ancient port of Andriake in southern Turkey. In all, they estimated that this garbage heap, dating to the 6th Century AD, contained around 300 cubic metres (10,594 cubic ft) of their remains – corresponding to up to 60 million individuals.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, though the bottom of the pile – where the snails were discarded first – contained some plump, older specimens, those discarded more recently were <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0092.2007.00281.x">significantly smaller and younger</a>. One explanation is that the sea snails had been overexploited and eventually, there just weren't any mature snails left. This may have led to the extinction of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0092.2007.00281.x">dye production in the area</a>, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>But just a few years after this discovery, another would raise hopes of reviving this ancient colour.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpdlm"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpdlm.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpdlm.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpdlm.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpdlm.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdlm.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdlm.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpdlm.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpdlm.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="In Mexico and Central America, indigenous people have a very different method for dyeing with Murex – they rub live snails onto fabric directly (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdlm.jpg" alt="In Mexico and Central America, indigenous people have a very different method for dyeing with Murex – they rub live snails onto fabric directly (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" id=""></picture><div><p>In Mexico and Central America, indigenous people have a very different method for dyeing with Murex – they rub live snails onto fabric directly (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>A determined revival </strong></p>
<p>One day in September 2007, Mohammed Ghassen Nouira was taking his usual lunchtime walk on a beach on the outskirts of the city of Tunis, Tunisia. "There had been a horrible storm the previous night, so there were a lot of dead creatures on the sand, like jellyfish, seaweeds, small crabs, molluscs," he says. Then he noticed a smear of colour – an intensely reddish-purple liquid was oozing out of a cracked sea snail.</p>
<p>Nouira, who works as a consulting manager, was immediately reminded of a story he had learned at school – the legend of Tyrian purple. He raced to the local harbour, where he found many more snails, exactly like the one on the beach. Their little spiral bodies are covered in spikes, so they often become trapped in fishermen's nets. "They hate them," he says. One man was plucking them out of his net and putting them in an old tomato can – which Nouira later took back to his apartment.</p>
<p>To begin with, Nouira's experiment was extremely disappointing. That night, he cracked the snails open and looked for the vivid purple entrails he had seen on the beach. But there was nothing there except pale flesh. He put it all in a bag to throw away, and went to bed. The next day, the bag's contents had undergone a transformation. "At that time, I had no clue that the purple was initially transparent – it's like water," he says.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpbk4"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpbk4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpbk4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpbk4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpbk4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpbk4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpbk4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpbk4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpbk4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="For dyes to stick to fabric, their molecules need to be converted to a water-soluble form.

It’s not clear how this was achieved in antiquity (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><h3>A modern application</h3><div><p>Today scientists have been investigating a possible new use for Tyrian purple – or at least, one of the most important molecules involved. In its pure form, 6,6'-dibromoindigo is a deep purple powder, and it just so happens that it makes an&nbsp;<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c05186" target="_blank">excellent semiconductor</a>&nbsp;– the basis of modern electronics. As an organic material it's&nbsp;biodegradable and&nbsp;less alien to the human body than silicon, so as well as making electronics more ecofriendly, it could potentially be used in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/tc/d1tc04997f" target="_blank">wearable technologies</a>. The best part? It can be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/SCC-100107023" target="_blank">made in a laboratory</a>&nbsp;– with no sea snails involved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div><p>Scientists now know that to jolt the chemicals in Murex snails out of their colourless state, they need to be <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11224-017-0932-0">exposed to visible light</a>. Initially their secretions will turn yellow, then green, turquoise, blue and eventually a shade of purple, depending on the snail species. "If you do this process on a sunny day, it takes something like less than five minutes to have this transformation," says Karapanagiotis.</p>
<p>But this isn't instant Tyrian purple. The shade is actually made up of many different pigment molecules, all working together. Melo explains that there's indigo, which is blue, "brominated" indigo, which is purple, and indirubin, which is red. "Depending on the treatment of your extract, and on the dying, you can have very different colours," she says. Even once the desired colour has been achieved, there is still yet more processing to do to turn the pigments into a dye, such as converting them into forms that will stick to fabric.</p>
<p>For Nouira, this was the beginning of a 16-year obsession with uncovering the lost method for making Tyrian purple. Though others have <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">investigated the secretions of sea snails</a> before – including a scientist who processed 12,000 individuals into 1.4g of pure powdered pigment using industrial techniques – Nouira wanted to make it the old way, and rediscover the authentic shade that was venerated for millennia.</p>
<p>When he took those first sea snails in his apartment back in 2007, it was just a week after his honeymoon. "My wife was horrified by the by the smell; she almost kicked me out of the house… But I had to carry on," he says.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvp9p3"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvp9p3.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvp9p3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvp9p3.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvp9p3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvp9p3.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvp9p3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvp9p3.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvp9p3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Ancient Roman authors compared Tyrian purple to the colour of clotted blood (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvp9p3.jpg" alt="Ancient Roman authors compared Tyrian purple to the colour of clotted blood (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" id=""></picture><div><p>Ancient Roman authors compared Tyrian purple to the colour of clotted blood (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><p>It took years for Nouira to make his first powdered dye, and when he did, it was a pale indigo colour, nothing like Tyrian purple and extremely dusty. Through years of trial and error, Nouira gradually discovered tricks that he suspects may have been used in antiquity – blending secretions from all three sea snail species mentioned in Pliny's account, adjusting the acidity of the mixture, alternating exposure to sunlight with darkness during preparation, and cooking his mixtures for different lengths of time.</p>
<p>For references, Nouira mostly used Byzantine mosaics depicting Justinian I and his wife Theodora – though he also later compared his results with surviving fragments of fabric. Eventually he ended up with pure pigments and dyes that he thinks are uncannily close to true Tyrian purple – and live up to the ancient hype. "It [the colour] is very alive, very dynamic," he says. "Depending on the light, it shifts and shimmers… it keeps changing and playing tricks on your eyes."</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpcvz"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpcvz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpcvz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpcvz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpcvz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpcvz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpcvz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpcvz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpcvz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="It’s not known why Murex snails produce the chemical precursors to Tyrian purple, but one idea is that they are used to paralyse prey (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpcvz.jpg" alt="It’s not known why Murex snails produce the chemical precursors to Tyrian purple, but one idea is that they are used to paralyse prey (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" id=""></picture><div><p>It’s not known why Murex snails produce the chemical precursors to Tyrian purple, but one idea is that they are used to paralyse prey (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><p>After decades of pungent experiments in his shed, Nouira has been invited to display his pigments and dyed products at exhibitions all over the world, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bRO9P56WHE">the British Museum in London</a> and the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. He has also become something of a culinary expert on sea snail recipes; he recommends spicy Tunisian Murex pasta, or fried Murex. "It's crunchy, it's delicious, it's incredible," he says.</p>
<p>But Tyrian purple is again under threat. Today the challenge is not invasion, or secrecy surrounding how it's made – though like his ancient counterparts, Nouira is furtive about the exact details of his methods – but extinction. Murex sea snails are under threat from a barrage of human influences, including <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/13/3595">pollution</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36897">climate change</a>. <em>Stramonita haemastoma, </em>which lends the colour a reddish tint, has already <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36897">vanished from the eastern</a> Mediterranean. So, whether or not Tyrian purple has finally been revived, one thing is certain: it could easily be lost all over again.</p>

            <p>In a world where more and more of our life, photos, and documents drift in the digital ether, it's time to reflect on the popular cloud trend and explore <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/18/the-rise-of-cloud-repatriation-why-companies-are-bringing-data-in-house/?sh=2b3cdf1b58f7&amp;ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">the cloud repatriation movement</a> of bringing data in-house.</p><p>Storing files in the cloud has been a great way of saving space on a computer for a while now, but as storage providers get bigger and bigger, they may not be as secure, cost effective, and reliable. Just last month, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/google_drive_files_disappearing/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">reports emerged</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-drive-is-investigating-sync-issues-as-users-complain-of-lost-files/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google Drive users are complaining of lost files</a>. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245861992?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google acknowledged that files for some users are not available</a> at the moment. What do you when your files are basically owned by someone else? Is it time to reconsider how we store our files? Should we go back to good old fashioned files sitting right in our computers? Why moving away from cloud storage could be worth it:</p><p><strong>1. Security</strong><br>The cloud may be a seemingly secure space, but storing your photos and documents on your computer provides an extra layer of control and security. There is less concern for unauthorized access or data breaches because your files are physically with you. With cloud storage providers, it's important to take into account what features are available for detecting unauthorized access to your files, as some providers, like <a href="https://www.mitiga.io/blog/mitiga-security-advisory-lack-of-forensic-visibility-with-the-basic-license-in-google-drive?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google Drive, only provide a record of access logs to your drive when using a paid license</a>. In theory, <a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/google-drive-security-flaw/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">someone could infiltrate your drive, download your files, and there would be no record of this access if you're using a free license on Google Drive</a>. </p><p><strong>2. Cost</strong><br>To guarantee access to your files, cloud providers charge monthly subscriptions that may increase as your storage needs increase. <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google One plans</a> store up to 2TB of files, while <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Apple iCloud plans</a> offer up to 12TB of storage. Instead of paying a monthly subscription to store and access your files, a one-time payment for an external hard drive may be a more economical alternative over time.</p><p><strong>3. Reliable Access</strong><br>With files stored directly on your computer, you're not at risk of losing access to your files when service outages happen. A service outage could become a huge interruption to your day if you depend on a cloud service for work. Back in 2020, on the first day of remote school for many students and teachers, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/08/tech/google-drive-outage/index.html?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">several teachers reported not being able to access their Google drives</a> they relied on as a virtual classroom tool. Teachers couldn't resume classes until Google resolved the outage several hours later. There are also <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/bitten-by-the-black-box-of-icloud/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">iCloud users who have reported losing access to their files during unannounced maintenance windows</a>. When your files are stored locally on your computer, a single provider's service outage or maintenance down time won't be a cause for concern.</p><p>Here's to safeguarding your digital world 🌐💾.
