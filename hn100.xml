<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>We recently gave Claude Opus 4 and 4.1 the ability to end conversations in our consumer chat interfaces. This ability is intended for use in rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions. This feature was developed primarily as part of our exploratory work on potential AI welfare, though it has broader relevance to model alignment and safeguards.</p><p>We remain highly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future. However, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare">we take the issue seriously</a>, and alongside our research program we’re working to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible. Allowing models to end or exit potentially distressing interactions is one such intervention.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-4-model-card">pre-deployment testing of Claude Opus 4</a>, we included a preliminary model welfare assessment. As part of that assessment, we investigated Claude’s self-reported and behavioral preferences, and found a robust and consistent aversion to harm. This included, for example, requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror. Claude Opus 4 showed:</p><ul><li>A strong preference against engaging with harmful tasks;</li><li>A pattern of apparent distress when engaging with real-world users seeking harmful content; and</li><li>A tendency to end harmful conversations when given the ability to do so in simulated user interactions.</li></ul><p>These behaviors primarily arose in cases where users <em>persisted</em> with harmful requests and/or abuse despite Claude repeatedly refusing to comply and attempting to productively redirect the interactions.</p><p>Our implementation of Claude’s ability to end chats reflects these findings while continuing to prioritize user wellbeing. Claude is directed not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.</p><p>In all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat (the latter scenario is illustrated in the figure below). The scenarios where this will occur are extreme edge cases—the vast majority of users will not notice or be affected by this feature in any normal product use, even when discussing highly controversial issues with Claude.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1940" height="1304" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F77f187335e1266bffc59353c064f1d9c6de51cfa-1940x1304.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F77f187335e1266bffc59353c064f1d9c6de51cfa-1940x1304.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F77f187335e1266bffc59353c064f1d9c6de51cfa-1940x1304.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Claude demonstrating the ending of a conversation in response to a user’s request. When Claude ends a conversation, the user can start a new chat, give feedback, or edit and retry previous messages.</figcaption></figure></div><p>When Claude chooses to end a conversation, the user will no longer be able to send new messages in that conversation. However, this will not affect other conversations on their account, and they will be able to start a new chat immediately. To address the potential loss of important long-running conversations, users will still be able to edit and retry previous messages to create new branches of ended conversations.</p><p>We’re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach. If users encounter a surprising use of the conversation-ending ability, we encourage them to submit feedback by reacting to Claude’s message with Thumbs or using the dedicated “Give feedback” button.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

It's not a temporary bug, but another consequence of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/visa-mastercard-steam-censorship-valve-itchio-gta/?" target="_blank">Steam's ongoing battle</a> with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/615910/itchio-steam-sex-adult-games-delisting-pulled-vice-controversy/" target="_blank">payment processors like Visa and Mastercard</a>.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In a quote provided to Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Valve clarified that the disappearance of PayPal is related to offering specific types of "content on Steam," much like the issue "surrounding Mastercard."</p>    <p>"In this case, one of PayPal’s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies," a rep said.</p>    <p>PayPal isn't gone for everyone; I just tried checking out a game, and could log into PayPal just fine. As of early July, the currencies that can still use PayPal on Steam include EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD. While this means many major currencies still have the option, this change will likely affect a lot of people around the world.</p>    <p>PayPal has also pulled out of some parts of Steam despite the platform's decision to delist a wide swath of adult-oriented games. That crackdown was due to pressure from payment processors and an anti-violence against women group called Collective Shout, which has organized campaigns to limit the sales of series like Grand Theft Auto. Amid all of these actions, payment processors insist that if the product is legal, they do not tell vendors what they can or cannot sell. Valve, however, has said that the encouragement to reconsider what types of games it sells has come from intermediaries like banks, seemingly speaking on behalf of payment processors. Whatever the case, Valve's rules for platforming a game now vaguely state that the content must follow rules set forth by payment processors. The snafu has also affected other platforms like Itchio, as well as games that merely include mature themes. Steam's acquiescence to these external pressures has also led to<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games/" target="_blank"> a gamer-led movement to harass payment processors</a>, if not a widespread sense of unease over the wider ramifications of the censorship.</p>    <p>The increased scrutiny around adult games also coincides with a wider push for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youtubes-new-ai-age-verification-system-goes-into-effect-today-in-the-united-states" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">age verification measures on websites like YouTube</a> and Pornhub. If the internet at large continues to tamp down on the full spectrum of "adult content" and a person's actual identity becomes fully tied to your online presence, the possibilities for complications could become exponential.</p>    <p>Valve's hoping to restore PayPal for everyone, but cannot say when it might be back. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this," the Valve rep said. "In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."</p>    </div>

<p>In 2018 we brought you some <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/12/3500-occult-manuscripts-will-be-digitized-made-freely-available-online.html">excit­ing news</a>. Thanks to a gen­er­ous dona­tion from <em>Da Vin­ci Code</em> author Dan Brown, Amsterdam’s Rit­man Library—a siz­able col­lec­tion of pre-1900 books on alche­my, astrol­o­gy, mag­ic, and oth­er occult subjects—has been dig­i­tiz­ing thou­sands of its rare texts under a dig­i­tal edu­ca­tion project cheek­i­ly called “Her­met­i­cal­ly Open.” We are now pleased to report that <a href="http://embassyofthefreemind.com/en/library/online-catalogue/?mode=gallery&amp;view=horizontal&amp;sort=random%7B1517048201764%7D%20asc&amp;page=1&amp;fq%5B%5D=search_s_digitized_publication:%22Ja%22&amp;reverse=0&amp;filterAction">the first 2,178 books from the Rit­man project have come avail­able in their online read­ing room</a>.</p>

<p>Vis­i­tors should be aware that these books are writ­ten in sev­er­al dif­fer­ent Euro­pean lan­guages. Latin, the schol­ar­ly lan­guage of Europe through­out the Medieval and Ear­ly Mod­ern peri­ods, pre­dom­i­nates, and it’s a pecu­liar Latin at that, laden with jar­gon and alchem­i­cal ter­mi­nol­o­gy. Oth­er books appear in Ger­man, Dutch, and French. Read­ers of some or all of these lan­guages will of course have an eas­i­er time than mono­lin­gual Eng­lish speak­ers, but there is still much to offer those vis­i­tors as well.</p>


<p>In addi­tion to the plea­sure of pag­ing through an old rare book, even vir­tu­al­ly, Eng­lish speak­ers can quick­ly find a col­lec­tion of read­able books by click­ing on the “Place of Pub­li­ca­tion” search fil­ter and select­ing Cam­bridge or Lon­don, from which come such notable works as <em>The Man-Mouse Takin in a Trap, and tortur’d to death for gnaw­ing the Mar­gins of Euge­nius Phi­lalethes</em>, by Thomas Vaugh­an, pub­lished in 1650.</p>

<p>The lan­guage is archaic—full of quirky spellings and uses of the “long s”—and the con­tent is bizarre. Those famil­iar with this type of writ­ing, whether through his­tor­i­cal study or the work of more recent inter­preters like <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/07/an-introduction-to-aleister-crowley-historys-most-infamous-occultist.html">Aleis­ter Crow­ley</a> or Madame Blavatsky, will rec­og­nize the many for­mu­las: The trac­ing of mag­i­cal cor­re­spon­dences between flo­ra, fau­na, and astro­nom­i­cal phe­nom­e­na; the care­ful pars­ing of names; astrol­o­gy and lengthy lin­guis­tic ety­molo­gies; numero­log­i­cal dis­cours­es and philo­soph­i­cal poet­ry; ear­ly psy­chol­o­gy and per­son­al­i­ty typ­ing; cryp­tic, cod­ed mythol­o­gy and med­ical pro­ce­dures. Although we’ve grown accus­tomed through pop­u­lar media to think­ing of mag­i­cal books as cook­books, full of recipes and incan­ta­tions, the real­i­ty is far dif­fer­ent.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p data-block-key="ojykg">We were walking to watch the sunset when a dog started barking at us from a porch. From inside, a voice called out: "Don't worry, he won't leave the porch. The electric fence hasn't worked in years, but he still won't go past it."</p><p data-block-key="ern7i">I stopped mid-step.</p><p data-block-key="6h3kl">A dog, imprisoned by a fence that only exists in his memory.</p><p data-block-key="5tkfb">The next question changed how I see everything: <b><i>What electric fences do we have in our lives?</i></b></p><h2 data-block-key="buf82">The Invisible Barrier</h2><p data-block-key="5chlk">Electric fences train dogs through graduated discomfort, first a warning beep, then a shock. Eventually, the dog learns the boundaries so well that even when the fence stops working, the memory of pain keeps them trapped. Most dogs stay placidly within their invisible prison for life.</p><p data-block-key="5gqre">But some dogs discover the secret: three seconds of discomfort leads to lasting freedom. Once they realize the fence is just an illusion maintained by memory, they never go back.</p><h2 data-block-key="26vlu">The Fences Between Us</h2><p data-block-key="1cn28">Here's what I've realized: Some of our strongest electric fences aren't keeping us from freedom, they're keeping us from each other.</p><p data-block-key="4lnf2">That voice in your head saying "Don't text them, you'll seem needy." The one whispering "They haven't reached out, so they must not care." The fear that being the one who always initiates makes you weak.</p><p data-block-key="3jsvj">These are electric fences that stopped working years ago, but we still won't cross them. Think about it, when was the last time you were annoyed that someone reached out to check in? When did you ever think less of someone for being the one to text you? Never. Because connection isn't about scorekeeping. It's about courage.</p><h2 data-block-key="2grgo">Twenty Seconds of Courage</h2><p data-block-key="6bdl0">Sometimes all you need is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndp-_cWdxYU">twenty seconds of embarrassing bravery</a>. Twenty seconds to write "Hey, was just thinking of you, how are you?" and hit send. Twenty seconds to make the call. Twenty seconds to be the one who cares out loud.</p><p data-block-key="7a40v">The fence isn't there. It never was. It's just the memory of some childhood rejection, some social rule someone made up, some fear that caring more makes you matter less.</p><h2 data-block-key="eas2p">The Truth Nobody Talks About</h2><p data-block-key="ak6v9">Here's the truth: The person who reaches out first isn't the weak one. They're the one who discovered the fence is broken. They're the one running free while everyone else stands on their safe little porches, barking at the world but never joining it.</p><p data-block-key="7qsl4">Your breakthrough isn't on the other side of productivity or success or self-improvement. It's on the other side of that text you're not sending. That call you're not making. That "I miss you" stuck in your throat.</p><p data-block-key="8m3g1">The electric fence between you and the people you care about? It hasn't worked in years.</p><p data-block-key="e5636">But you're still standing on the porch.</p>
