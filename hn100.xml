<span># What=tmpfs</span>
<span># Where=/tmp</span>
<span># Type=tmpfs</span>
<span># Options=mode=1777,strictatime,nosuid,nodev,size=50%%,nr_inodes=1m</span>
</pre><p>Go back up to the part before the line “<span>Edits below this comment will be discarded” and paste in something like this:</span></p><pre>[Mount]
<span>What=tmpfs
Where=/tmp
Type=tmpfs

<p>After more than two years of development, the Debian Project has <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2025/20250809">released</a> its new stable version, Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie"). The release comes with the usual bounty of
upgraded packages and more than 14,000 new packages; it also debuts <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1017315/">Advanced Package Tool
(APT)&nbsp;3.0</a> as the default package manager and makes 64-bit
<span>RISC-V</span> a supported architecture. There are few surprises with trixie,
which is exactly what many Linux users are hoping for—a free
operating system that just works as expected.</p>

<p>Debian's <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/">stable</a>
releases are aptly named; the project prioritizes stability over
shipping the latest software. The <a href="https://release.debian.org/trixie/freeze_policy.html">freeze
schedule for trixie</a> called for a soft freeze in April, which meant
that (for example) the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.4.0/">KDE&nbsp;Plasma&nbsp;6.4</a>
release in June was too late to make the cut—even though trixie
was not released until August. Users who prefer to live on the edge
will want to run another distribution or follow Debian development by
running the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/">testing</a> release
that previews the next stable <span>version—<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianForky">Debian&nbsp;14&nbsp;("forky")</a></span>. Truly
adventurous users may take their chances with the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/">unstable ("sid")
release</a>.</p>

<p>That said, trixie is up-to-date enough for many folks; it includes
GNOME&nbsp;48, KDE&nbsp;Plasma&nbsp;6.3, Xfce&nbsp;4.20, GNU
Emacs&nbsp;30.1, GnuPG&nbsp;2.4.7, LibreOffice&nbsp;25.2, and
more. Under the hood, it includes the most recent Linux LTS kernel
(6.12.41), GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 14.2, GNU C Library (glibc)
2.41, LLVM/Clang 19, Python&nbsp;3.13, Rust&nbsp;1.85, and
systemd&nbsp;257. The release notes have a <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/whats-new.en.html#desktops-and-well-known-packages">section
for well-known software</a> that compares the version in Debian 12
against Debian 13. While some of the versions lag a bit behind the
upstream, they are not woefully outdated.</p>

<p>The project now <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/armhf/ch02s01.en.html">supports
six major hardware architectures</a>: x86-64/amd64, 32-bit Arm with a
hardware FPU (armhf), 64-bit Arm (arm64), IBM POWER8 or newer
(ppc64el), IBM S/390 (s390x), and 64-bit RISC-V. The i386 architecture
is not supported for trixie, though the project continues to
build some i386 packages to run on 64-bit systems; users with i386 systems cannot upgrade to
trixie. The <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.en.html#mips-architectures-removed">MIPS</a>
architectures (mipsel and mis64el) have also been removed in trixie.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort">Arm EABI</a>
(armel) port that targets older 32-bit Arm devices prior to Arm v7 is
still supported with trixie, but this release is the end of the
line. There is no installation media for armel systems, but users who
have bookworm installed can upgrade to trixie if they have supported
hardware: the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi&nbsp;1, Zero, and Zero&nbsp;W are the
only devices mentioned <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#last-release-for-armel">in
the release notes</a>.</p>

<p>Upgrades from bookworm are supported, of course. The release
notes <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.en.html#preparing-apt-sources-files">suggest</a> that users convert APT source files to the <a href="https://repolib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deb822-format.html">DEB822&nbsp;format</a>
before the upgrade. APT&nbsp;3.0
includes an "<tt>apt&nbsp;modernize-sources</tt>" command to convert APT data
source files to DEB822, but that is not available in bookworm. Users are
also expected to <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.en.html#start-from-pure-debian">remove
all third-party packages</a> prior to running the upgrade. I tested
the upgrade on one of my servers, after taking a snapshot to roll back
to if needed, and all went smoothly. Users who are considering an
upgrade should read the release notes carefully before forging ahead;
in particular, users should be aware that it's possible (but not
certain) for <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#network-interface-names-may-change">network interface names to change</a> on upgrade.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>For users who want to start fresh, Debian offers <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/debian-installer/">a
variety of installer images</a> and download methods; users can choose
a 64MB minimal ISO image with the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Netboot">netboot</a>
installer, all the way up to a set of Blu-ray images. The project
recommends using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://www.einval.com/~steve/software/jigdo/">Jigsaw
Download</a> (jigdo) for the largest images. BitTorrent probably needs
no introduction, but jigdo is not as well-known. Jigdo is a method of
downloading all of the individual packages for an image from multiple
mirrors and then assembling them into an ISO image on the user's
machine. It was a bit fiddly to use jigdo to download an image, but
not overly so—and the speed of the whole process was comparable
to simply downloading an ISO of the same size.</p>

<p>Debian's <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">network
install</a> ("netinst") image is probably the best option for server
installations and for experienced Linux users; it includes the
packages required for a base install and then fetches the remaining
software from Debian mirrors. Unlike the tiny netboot image, it
includes the option of using either the graphical installer or the
text-based installer.</p>

<p>The installer is a bit of a throwback to an earlier era when users
were expected to know a lot more about the workings of a Linux system. 
Users who have only worked with distributions like Fedora and Ubuntu
will notice that installing Debian requires many more steps than other
popular distributions. For example, many desktop distributions have
eliminated the step of setting a password for the root
user—instead, it is generally assumed that the primary user will
also be the system administrator, so the default is to give the
primary user sudo privileges instead. Debian does not take that
approach; <del>in fact, there is no way to give a user sudo privileges
during installation. Setting up sudo has to be done manually after
the installation is completed</del> <strong>Update:</strong> Users can skip creation of a root account and the installer will then set up the regular user as an administrator with sudo permissions. Apologies for the error.</p>

<p>For some folks, installing Debian will be a bit of a chore and may
even be confusing for users who are new to Linux. For example, the
text-mode installer requires users to specify the device for GRUB boot
loader installation, without providing a default. If one chooses an
invalid partition, the installer tells the user that the operation has
failed and drops back to a menu listing all the installation
steps. Presumably if one picks the <em>wrong</em> partition it will
happily install GRUB to that and render the system unbootable. This is
not insurmountable for experienced Linux users, but it would no doubt
be a hurdle for many users.</p>

<p>More experienced Linux users are likely to appreciate the
amount of control offered by the installer. For example, Fedora's
recent web-based installer makes it difficult to even find the option to
perform custom partitioning. Debian has a guided partitioning option
for those who do not want to fuss with it, but the option to create
custom partitions is not hidden from the user.</p>

<p>Debian has a better installation option for newer Linux users,
though it is easy to miss: the <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/live/">live install images</a>, which
use the <a href="https://calamares.io/">Calamares</a> installer. Its
workflow is more akin to the installation process one finds with
Fedora and Ubuntu; it also sets up the primary user with sudo
privileges rather than creating a root password. Unfortunately,
the live images are not listed on the main page for installer
images—though they are mentioned, briefly, in the release
notes.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1034312/#id">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/calamares-sm.png" alt="[Debian Calamares installer]" title="Debian Calamares installer">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The Debian installer also has the option of using a Braille display
and/or speech synthesizer voice for the installation. I have not tried
these options, but they are available for users who need them.</p>

<h4>X.org</h4>

<p>Many distributions are in the process of phasing out X.org support
for GNOME and KDE as the upstream projects have started doing so.
For example, Fedora <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/3408">will remove X.org session support
for GNOME in Fedora&nbsp;43</a>, and the plan is for <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1024758/">Ubuntu to do the same</a>
in its upcoming 25.10 release. GNOME will be completely removing X.org
support in GNOME&nbsp;49, which is planned for September.</p>

<p>Much has already been said about this, of course, and there is
likely little new left to be said or that <em>needs</em> to be
said. However, for users who still need or want X.org support,
Debian&nbsp;13 includes X.org sessions for GNOME and KDE. In testing
trixie, I've spent some time in the GNOME and KDE X.org sessions as
well as the Wayland sessions; if there are any gotchas or horrible
bugs, I haven't encountered them (yet). This might be a compelling
reason for some folks to switch to (or stick with) Debian.</p>

<h4>Trying trixie</h4>

<p>I use Debian for my personal web site and blogs, but it has been
quite some time since I used it as my primary desktop operating
system. Debian (and Ubuntu) derivatives, such as <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux&nbsp;Mint</a> and <a href="https://system76.com/pop/">Pop!_OS</a>, yes—but it's been
several years since I've used vanilla Debian on the desktop for
more than casual tinkering.</p>

<p>The Debian release announcement boasts about the number of packages
included in trixie: 64,419 packages total, with 14,100 added and more
than 6,000 removed as <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.en.html#obsolete">obsolete</a>
since bookworm. That is quite a few packages, but falls short of some
other distributions. For example, "<tt>dnf repoquery --repo=fedora
--available</tt>" shows more than 76,000 packages available for
Fedora&nbsp;42.</p>

<p>After installing Debian, I went to install some of my preferred
software, such as <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/993498/">aerc</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1004377/">Ghostty</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1025866/">niri</a>, and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/987315/">Speech Note</a>. The aerc
packages in trixie are current, but Ghostty and niri are not packaged
for Debian at all. Ghostty is written in Zig, which is also not
available, so users who want to build it from source will need to
install Zig separately and then build Ghostty. Speech Note is packaged
as a Flatpak, but Debian does not enable Flatpaks or Flathub in the
GNOME Software Store by default. Users who want Flatpaks on Debian via
Flathub will need to install the <tt>flatpak</tt> package and manually
add the Flathub repo:</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
</pre>

<p>Users will need to add the <tt>gnome-software-plugin-flatpak</tt>
package for Flatpak support in GNOME&nbsp;Software, and
<tt>plasma-discover-backend-flatpak</tt> to add it to
KDE&nbsp;Discover.</p>

<p>Trixie ships with the Firefox extended-support release (ESR) by
default: <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/128.0esr/releasenotes/">Firefox
128</a>, which was released in July 2024. Happily,
Mozilla offers a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux">Debian
repository</a> for those who want to run more current versions. Even
better, there is a little-advertised utility called <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/extrepo">extrepo</a> that
has a curated list of external repositories users might want to enable
for Debian. To enable the Mozilla repository, for example, a user only
needs to install extrepo, run
"<tt>extrepo&nbsp;enable&nbsp;mozilla</tt>" as root (or with
sudo), update the package cache, and look for the regular
Firefox package. In all, extrepo includes more than 160 external
repositories for applications like <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker&nbsp;CE</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/download/">Signal</a>, and <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. Unfortunately, the
extrepo utility does not have a separate "list" command to show the
available repositories, though running "<tt>extrepo&nbsp;search</tt>"
with no search parameter will return all of its DEB822-formatted
repository entries. Some of the software is
in an external repository due to a non-free license, other software (like
Firefox) just has a development cycle that outpaces Debian's.</p>

<p>As one might expect, the Debian desktop experience is not
dramatically different from other distributions; GNOME&nbsp;48 on
Debian is little different than GNOME&nbsp;48 on Fedora, and the same
is true for KDE, Xfce, etc. The primary difference is that users can
expect more or less the same desktop experience running Debian stable
in two years that they have today, which is not necessarily true for
other distributions.</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<p>One of the features in Debian&nbsp;13 is something that most users
won't notice or appreciate at all: a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/64bit-time">transition to
64-bit <tt>time_t</tt></a> on 32-bit architectures, to avoid the <a href="https://theyear2038problem.com/">Year 2038</a> problem. The
short version is that 32-bit integers cannot hold a Unix epoch
timestamp for dates after January&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2038. That <em>may</em> seem
like a distant concern, even irrelevant for Debian trixie; after all,
Debian&nbsp;13 is only supported by the project until 2030. However,
the project expects that some 32-bit embedded systems will still be running
trixie in 2038, so Debian developers did the heavy lifting to complete
the transition to 64-bit <tt>time_t</tt> now. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/938149/">covered</a> the early planning
for this in 2023.</p>

<p>By now, most users have retired their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm">DSA</a>
SSH keys; if not, now is the time to do so. DSA keys were disabled by
default with OpenSSH in 2015, and they are entirely disabled now with
the <tt>openssh-client</tt> and <tt>openssh-server</tt> packages in
trixie. If there is a device that can, for some reason, only be
connected to with DSA, users can install the
<tt>openssh-client-ssh1</tt> package and use <tt>ssh1</tt> to make the
connection.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/975565/">covered</a> in
June&nbsp;2024, Debian&nbsp;13 has switched to using a tmpfs
filesystem for the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory. By default, Debian
allocates up to 50% of memory to <tt>/tmp</tt>, but this can be
changed by following the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.en.html#the-temporary-files-directory-tmp-is-now-stored-in-a-tmpfs">instructions
in the release notes</a>. Note that this also applies to systems that
are upgraded to trixie from bookworm.</p>

<h4>Forward to forky</h4>

<p>Debian Project Leader (DPL) Andreas Tille <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/aKAHHO30ZhM7zz4v@an3as.eu/">recently
announced</a> "<q>Debian's 100000th birthday</q>", so clearly the project has a
bit of experience with putting out solid releases. Granted, he was
reporting the number in binary, but even when converted to decimal 
numbers (32 years), it's an impressive track record.</p>

<p>While testing, I installed trixie on a couple of systems, including
a new <a href="https://frame.work/laptop12">Framework&nbsp;12-inch laptop</a>. My original intent was to just see
whether Debian had any problems with the new hardware (it didn't), but
now I'm leaning toward sticking with Debian on this system for a while
to see if stability suits me.</p>

<p>With trixie out the door, the Debian Project has already turned its
attention to working on forky, which has no release date set. Debian has
stuck to a loose schedule of a new stable release roughly every two
years. Most likely we will see Debian&nbsp;14 sometime in 2027. After
the forky release, trixie will still receive updates from Debian's
security team through 2028, and then from its <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">LTS team</a> through 2030.</p>

<p>As of yet, there are no major new features or changes announced for
forky; it seems likely that those will be coming to light in the
coming months now that the project has trixie out the door. LWN will,
of course, be reporting on those developments as they happen.</p>

<p>Attendees at EuroPython had the chance to preview part of
<em>Python: The Documentary</em> during <a href="https://programme.europython.eu/europython-2025/talk/JKZDUY/">a
keynote panel</a>. The full film, created by <a href="https://www.cultrepo.com/">CultRepo</a>, is now available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH4QL4VqJ0">on YouTube</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the story of the world's most beloved programming language:
Python. What began as a side project in Amsterdam during the 1990s
became the software powering artificial intelligence, data science and
some of the world's biggest companies. But Python's future wasn't
certain; at one point it almost disappeared.</p>

<p>This 90-minute documentary features Guido van Rossum, Travis
Oliphant, Barry Warsaw, and many more, and they tell the story of
Python's rise, its community-driven evolution, the conflicts that
almost tore it apart, and the language's impact on... well...
everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf2AqQ5a38Y">video</a>
of the keynote is also available.</p>

       is my latest most-used iPhone app. It is a simple, free RSS reader. 
    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span>
      RSS is an old technology that it seems most people have forgotten about. Here's how it works: you enter a link to an RSS "feed", and your app pulls data from this feed every few minutes or so. When there is a new post from your feed, that post is pulled directly to your app. 
    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span>
      RSS is really simple, so it is still very well supported. Notably, all substack publications automatically have an RSS feed included at 
    </span>
  <code>https://{{substack-domain}}/feed</code>
    <span>
      . 
    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span>
      Blogs are great but I don't enjoy reading posts in my email, having to remember the websites each one is hosted at, or reading from each publications' different typesetting opinions with varying pop-ups and advertisements. An RSS reader centralizes all content from your blogs into a single place for reading. 
    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span>
      Since I started using this app I spend much more of my "mindless phone time" reading blog posts, which I think is somewhere between marginally good and good.

  <p>We’ve all sat in those presentations.  A speaker with a stream of slides full of text, monotonously reading them off as we read along.  We’re so used to it we expect it.  We accept it.  We even consider it ‘learning’. As an educator I push against ‘death by PowerPoint’ and I'm fascinated with how we can improve the way we present and teach.  The fact is we know that PowerPoint kills.  Most often the only victims are our audience’s inspiration and interest.  This, however, is the story of a PowerPoint slide that actually helped kill seven people.</p><p>January 16th 2003.  NASA Mission STS-107 is underway. The Space Shuttle Columbia launches carrying its crew of seven to low orbit.  Their objective was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and on ants and spiders they had with them.  Columbia had been the first Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981 and had been on 27 missions prior to this one.  Whereas other shuttle crews had focused on work to the Hubble Space Telescope or to the International Space Station this mission was one of pure scientific research.  </p><p>The launch proceeded as normal.  The crew settled into their mission.  They would spend 16 days in orbit, completing 80 experiments.  One day into their mission it was clear to those back on Earth that something had gone wrong.  </p><p>As a matter of protocol NASA staff reviewed footage from an external camera mounted to the fuel tank.  At eighty-two seconds into the launch a piece of spray on foam insulation (SOFI) fell from one of the ramps that attached the shuttle to its external fuel tank.  As the crew rose at 28,968 kilometres per hour the piece of foam collided with one of the tiles on the outer edge of the shuttle’s left wing.  </p>

  <p>It was impossible to tell from Earth how much damage this foam, falling nine times faster than a fired bullet, would have caused when it collided with the wing.   Foam falling during launch was nothing new.  It had happened on four previous missions and was one of the reasons why the camera was there in the first place.  But the tile the foam had struck was on the edge of the wing designed to protect the shuttle from the heat of Earth’s atmosphere during launch and re-entry.  In space the shuttle was safe but NASA didn’t know how it would respond to re-entry.  There were a number of options.  The astronauts could perform a spacewalk and visually inspect the hull.  NASA could launch another Space Shuttle to pick the crew up.  Or they could risk re-entry.  </p><p>NASA officials sat down with Boeing Corporation engineers who took them through three reports; a total of 28 slides.    The salient point was whilst there was data showing that the tiles on the shuttle wing could tolerate being hit by the foam this was based on test conditions using foam more than 600 times smaller than that that had struck Columbia.  This is the slide the engineers chose to illustrate this point:</p>
</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_26426">
  <p>NASA managers listened to the engineers and their PowerPoint.  The engineers felt they had communicated the potential risks.  NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.  They rejected the other options and pushed ahead with Columbia re-entering Earth’s atmosphere as normal.  Columbia was scheduled to land at 0916 (EST) on February 1st 2003.  Just before 0900, 61,170 metres above Dallas at 18 times the speed of sound, temperature readings on the shuttle’s left wing were abnormally high and then were lost.  Tyre pressures on the left side were soon lost as was communication with the crew.  At 0912, as Columbia should have been approaching the runway, ground control heard reports from residents near Dallas that the shuttle had been seen disintegrating.  Columbia was lost and with it her crew of seven.  The oldest crew member was 48.  </p><p>The shuttle programme was on lock down, grounded for two years as the investigation began.  The cause of the accident became clear: <em>a hole in a tile on the left wing caused by the foam let the wing dangerously overheat until the shuttle disintegrated</em>.  </p><p>The questions to answer included a very simple one: <strong>Why, given that the foam strike had occurred at a force massively out of test conditions had NASA proceeded with re-entry? </strong> </p><p>Edward Tufte, a Professor at Yale University and expert in communication reviewed the slideshow the Boeing engineers had given NASA, in particular the above slide.  His findings were tragically profound.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_66458">

<p> Firstly, the slide had a misleadingly reassuring title claiming that test data pointed to the tile being able to withstand the foam strike.  This was not the case but the presence of the title, centred in the largest font makes this seem the salient, summary point of this slide.  This helped Boeing’s message be lost almost immediately.</p>






















</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_70933">
  <p>Secondly, the slide contains four different bullet points with no explanation of what they mean.  This means that interpretation is left up to the reader.  Is number 1 the main bullet point?  Do the bullet points become less important or more?  It’s not helped that there’s a change in font sizes as well.  In all with bullet points and indents six levels of hierarchy were created.  This allowed NASA managers to imply a hierarchy of importance in their head: the writing lower down and in smaller font was ignored.  Actually, this had been where the contradictory (and most important) information was placed.  </p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_26463">

<p>Thirdly, there is a huge amount of text, more than 100 words or figures on one screen.   Two words, ‘SOFI’ and ‘ramp’ both mean the same thing: the foam.  Vague terms are used.  <em>Sufficient</em> is used once, <em>significant </em>or <em>significantly</em>, five times with little or no quantifiable data.  As a result this left a lot open to audience interpretation.  How much is significant?  Is it statistical significance you mean or something else?  </p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_75625">

<p>Finally the single most important fact, that the foam strike had occurred at forces massively out of test conditions, is hidden at the very bottom.  Twelve little words which the audience would have had to wade through more than 100 to get to.  If they even managed to keep reading to that point.  In the middle it does say that it is possible for the foam to damage the tile.  This is in the smallest font, lost. </p>






















</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_55842">
  <p>NASA’s subsequent report criticised technical aspects along with human factors.  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_full.pdf" target="_blank">Their report</a> mentioned an over-reliance on PowerPoint:</p><p><em> “The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA.” </em></p><p> Edward Tufte’s full report makes for<a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB" target="_blank"> fascinating reading</a>. Since being released in 1987 PowerPoint has grown exponentially to the point where <a href="https://www.thinkoutsidetheslide.com/are-we-wasting-250-million-per-day-due-to-bad-powerpoint/" target="_blank">it is now estimated</a> than thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day.  Yet, PowerPoint is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/powerpoint-thought-students-bullet-points-information" target="_blank">blamed</a> by academics for killing critical thought.  Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/08/22/jeff-bezos-banned-powerpoint-presentations-at-amazon-meetings-heres-what-replaced-them/#4578b4773b5f" target="_blank">banned it from meetings</a>.   Typing text on a screen and reading it out loud does not count as teaching.  An audience reading text off the screen does not count as learning.  Imagine if the engineers had put up a slide with just: “<strong>foam strike more than 600 times bigger than test data</strong>.”  Maybe NASA would have listened.  Maybe they wouldn’t have attempted re-entry.  Next time you’re asked to give a talk remember Columbia. Don’t just jump to your laptop and write out slides of text.  Think about your message.  Don’t let that message be lost amongst text.  Death by PowerPoint is a real thing.  Sometimes literally.</p><p>Thanks for reading</p><p> - Jamie </p>

<p>One of the biggest lessons that I've learned in my career is that all software has bugs, and the more complicated your software gets the more complicated your bugs get. A lot of the time those bugs will be fairly obvious and easy to spot, validate, and replicate. Sometimes, the process of fixing it will uncover your core assumptions about how things work in ways that will leave you feeling like you just got trolled.</p>
<p>Today I'm going to talk about a single line fix that prevents people on a large number of devices from having weird irreproducible issues with Anubis rejecting people when it frankly shouldn't. Stick around, it's gonna be a wild ride.</p>

<p>In order to make sure the proof of work challenge screen <em>goes away as fast as possible</em>, the <a href="https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/tree/main/web/js/worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worker code</a> is optimized within an inch of its digital life. One of the main ways that this code is optimized is with how it's run. Over the last 10-20 years, the main way that CPUs have gotten fast is via increasing multicore performance. Anubis tries to make sure that it can use as many cores as possible in order to take advantage of your device's CPU as much as it can.</p>
<p>This strategy sometimes has some issues though, for one Firefox seems to get <em>much slower</em> if you have Anubis try to absolutely saturate all of the cores on the system. It also has a fairly high overhead between JavaScript JIT code and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebCrypto</a>. I did some testing and found out that Firefox's point of diminishing returns was about half of the CPU cores.</p>
<h2 id="another-invalid-response-bug">Another "invalid response" bug<a href="#another-invalid-response-bug" aria-label="Direct link to Another &quot;invalid response&quot; bug" title="Direct link to Another &quot;invalid response&quot; bug">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the complaints I've been getting from users and administrators using Anubis is that they've been running into issues where users get randomly rejected with an error message only saying "invalid response". This happens when the challenge validating process fails. This issue has been blocking the release of the next version of Anubis.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate this better, I've made a little interactive diagram for the proof of work process:</p>
<div><div><div><h2>1. Challenge</h2><p>3e2c67c9ef91d81fff589db473a2f996</p></div><div><h2>3. Combined Data</h2><p>3e2c67c9ef91d81fff589db473a2f9960</p></div></div><div><h2>4. Resulting Hash (SHA-256)</h2><p><span>...</span></p></div></div>
<p>I've fixed a lot of the easy bugs in Anubis by this point. A lot of what's left is the hard bugs, but also specifically the kinds of hard bugs that involve weird hardware configurations. In order to try and catch these issues before software hits prod, I test Anubis against a bunch of hardware I have locally. Any issues I find and fix before software ships are issues that you don't hit in production.</p>
<p>Let's consider <a href="https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/blob/main/web/js/algorithms/fast.mjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the line of code</a> that was causing this issue:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>threads </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>hardwareConcurrency</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is intended to make your browser spawn a proof of work worker for <em>half</em> of your available CPU cores. If you only have one CPU core, you should only have one worker. Each thread is given this number of threads and uses that to increment the nonce so that each thread doesn't try to find a solution that another worker has already performed.</p>
<p>One of the subtle problems here is that all of the parts of this assume that the thread ID and nonce are integers without a decimal portion. Famously, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all JavaScript numbers are IEEE 754 floating point numbers</a>. Surely there wouldn't be a case where the thread count could be a <em>decimal</em> number, right?</p>
<p>Here's all the devices I use to test Anubis <em>and their core counts</em>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Device Name</th><th>Core Count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MacBook Pro M3 Max</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>MacBook Pro M4 Max</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen 9 7950x3D</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Google Pixel 9a (GrapheneOS)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 15 Pro Max</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Pro (M1)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>iPad mini</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Deck</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Core i5 10600 (homelab)</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>ROG Ally</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Notice something? All of those devices have an <em>even</em> number of cores. Some devices such as the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_8_pro-12545.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixel 8 Pro</a> have an <em>odd</em> number of cores. So what happens with that line of code as the JavaScript engine evaluates it?</p>
<p>Let's replace the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/hardwareConcurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>navigator.hardwareConcurrency</code></a> with the Pixel 8 Pro's 9 cores:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>threads </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>9</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then divide it by two:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>threads </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>4.5</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Oops, that's not ideal. However <code>4.5</code> is bigger than <code>1</code>, so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Math.max</code></a> returns that:</p>

<p>This means that each time the proof of work equation is calculated, there is a 50% chance that a valid solution would include a nonce with a decimal portion in it. If the client finds a solution with such a nonce, then it would think the client was successful and submit the solution to the server, but the server only expects whole numbers back so it rejects that as an invalid response.</p>
<p>I keep telling more junior people that when you have the weirdest, most inconsistent bugs in software that it's going to boil down to the dumbest possible thing you can possibly imagine. People don't believe me, then they encounter bugs like this. Then they suddenly believe me.</p>
<p>Here is the fix:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>threads </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>trunc</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>hardwareConcurrency</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/trunc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Math.trunc</code></a> to truncate away the decimal portion so that the Pixel 8 Pro has <code>4</code> workers instead of <code>4.5</code> workers.</p>
<h2 id="today-i-learned-this-was-possible">Today I learned this was possible<a href="#today-i-learned-this-was-possible" aria-label="Direct link to Today I learned this was possible" title="Direct link to Today I learned this was possible">​</a></h2>
<p>This was a total "today I learned" moment. I didn't actually think that hardware vendors shipped processors with an odd number of cores, however if you look at the core geometry of the Pixel 8 Pro, it has <em>three</em> tiers of processor cores:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Core type</th><th>Core model</th><th>Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>High performance</td><td>3 Ghz Cortex X3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium performance</td><td>2.45 Ghz Cortex A715</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>High efficiency</td><td>2.15 Cortex A510</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>9</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>I guess every assumption that developers have about CPU design is probably wrong.</p>
<p>This probably isn't helped by the fact that for most of my career, the core count in phones has been largely irrelevant and most of the desktop / laptop CPUs I've had (where core count does matter) uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simultaneous multithreading</a> to "multiply" the core count by two.</p>
<p>The client side fix is a bit of an "emergency stop" button to try and mitigate the badness as early as possible. In general I'm quite aware of the terrible UX involved with this flow failing and I'm still noodling through ways to make that UX better and easier for users / administrators to debug.</p>
<p>I'm looking into the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>This could have been prevented on the server side by doing less strict input validation in compliance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postel's Law</a>. I feel nervous about making such a security-sensitive endpoint <em>more liberal</em> with the inputs it can accept, but it may be fine? I need to consult with a security expert.</li>
<li>Showing an encrypted error message on the "invalid response" page so that the user and administrator can work together to fix or report the issue. I remember Google doing this at least once, but I can't recall where I've seen it in the past. Either way, this is probably the most robust method even though it would require developing some additional tooling. I think it would be worth it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm likely going to go with the second option. I will need to figure out a good flow for this. It's likely going to involve <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age</a>. I'll say more about this when I have more to say.</p>
<p>In the meantime though, looks like I need to expense a used Pixel 8 Pro to add to the testing jungle for Anubis. If anyone has a deal out there, please let me know!</p>
<p>Thank you to the people that have been polite and helpful when trying to root cause and fix this issue.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>So much of the web these days is ruined by the bloat that is modern JavaScript frameworks. React apps that take several seconds to load. NextJS sites that throw random hydration errors. The <em>node_modules</em> folder that takes up gigabytes on your hard drive.</p>
<p>It’s awful. And you don’t need it.</p>

<p>The intro paragraph of this post is tongue-in-cheek. It’s there to get you to read the rest of the post. I suspect the megabytes of tracking scripts intertwined with bad code is far more likely to be the real culprit behind all the terrible sites out there. Web frameworks have their time and place. And despite my personal distaste for them, I know they are used by many teams to build awesome well-optimized apps.</p>
<p>Despite that, I think there’s some beauty in leaving it all behind. Not just the frameworks, but JavaScript altogether.<!-- [Figmas](https://www.figma.com/) and [Photopeas](https://www.photopea.com/) need their JavaScript. [Interactive](https://x3c.tf/archive/) [experiences](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) do[^interactive]. But does your homepage or blog need it?--> Not every site needs JavaScript. Perhaps your <a href="https://justfuckingusereact.com/">e-commerce site needs it for its complex carts and data visualization dashboards</a>, but is it really a necessity for most of what’s out there?</p>
<p>It’s actually <a href="https://lyra.horse/css-clicker/">pretty incredible</a> what HTML and CSS alone can achieve.</p>
<!--I don't think that everyone should switch to a strict CSS-only diet, but I do believe that the average web developer could benefit from knowing just a little more about our cascading little friend.-->
<h2 id="so-what-do-you-say">So, what do you say?</h2>
<p>My goal with this article is to share my perspectives on the web, as well as introduce many aspects of modern HTML/CSS you may not be familiar with. I’m not trying to make you give up JavaScript, I’m just trying to show you everything that’s possible, leaving it up to you to pick what works best for whatever you’re working on.</p>
<p>I think there’s a lot most web developers don’t know about CSS.</p>
<p>And I think JS is often used where better alternatives exist.</p>
<p>So, let me show you what’s out there.</p>

<h2 id="but-css-sucks">“But CSS sucks”</h2>
<p>I believe a lot of the negativity towards CSS stems from not really knowing how to use it. Many developers kind of just skip learning the CSS fundamentals in favor of the more interesting Java- and TypeScript, and then go on to complain about a styling language they don’t understand.</p>
<p>I suspect this is due to many treating CSS as this silly third wheel for adding borders and box-shadows to a webapp. <!--rephrase-->It’s undervalued and often compared to glorified crayons, rather than what it really is - a powerful domain-specific programming language.</p>
<p>It’s telling when to this day the only CSS joke in the webdev circles is centering a div.</p>
<!-- it was fun recreating all of the flexbox icons in css haha -->
<code-compare id="center-gadget" aria-label="a centered div and its code" role="figure"><fake-frame id="demo-center-gadget">
<p>i am a div</p>
</fake-frame>

</code-compare>



<p>Yes, the syntax isn’t the prettiest, but is it <em>really</em> that hard?</p>
<p>Besides, your devtools probably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> come with a fun little gadget that lets you fiddle with the flexbox by just clicking around. You don’t even need to remember the syntax.</p>
<!--i wanted to write about: maybe something about box-model and clock directions-->
<p>I don’t think CSS is fundamentally any more difficult than JS, but if you skip the basics on one and only focus on the other, it’s no surprise it feels that way.</p>
<h2 id="but-its-painful-to-write">“But it’s painful to write”</h2>
<p>Another source of disdain for CSS is how awful it has been to write in the past. This is very much true, and is probably why things like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> exist.</p>
<p>But that’s the thing, it <em>used</em> to be bad.</p>
<twoot-embed aria-label="a twoot from rebane2001" role="figure">

<p><em>(yes! the code above is standards compliant<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>In the past few years, CSS has received a ton of awesome quality-of-life additions, making it nice to do stuff that has historically required preprocessors or JavaScript.</p>
<p>Nesting is definitely one of my favorite additions!</p>
<p>In the past, you’ve had to write code that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>:<sx-l>root</sx-l> {
  <sx-e>--like-color</sx-e>: <sx-n>#24A4F3</sx-n>;
  <sx-e>--like-color-hover</sx-e>: <sx-n>#54B8F5</sx-n>;
  <sx-e>--like-color-active</sx-e>: <sx-n>#0A6BA8</sx-n>;
}

.<sx-y>post</sx-y> {
  <sx-p>display</sx-p>: <sx-a>block</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>background</sx-p>: <sx-n>#EEE</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-n>#111</sx-n>;
}

.<sx-y>post</sx-y> .<sx-y>avatar</sx-y> {
  <sx-p>width</sx-p>: <sx-n>48px</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>height</sx-p>: <sx-n>48px</sx-n>;
}

.<sx-y>post</sx-y> &gt; .<sx-y>buttons</sx-y> {

  <sx-p>font-size</sx-p>: <sx-n>24px</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>8px</sx-n>;
}

.<sx-y>post</sx-y> &gt; .<sx-y>buttons</sx-y> .<sx-y>like</sx-y> {

<p>And yeah, that’s pretty awful to work with. For anything that involves multiple chained selectors, you kind of have to keep a mental map of how every parent selector relates to its children, and the more CSS you add the harder it gets.</p>
<p>But let’s try it with nesting:</p>
<pre><code>:<sx-l>root</sx-l> {
  <sx-e>--like-color</sx-e>: <sx-n>#24A4F3</sx-n>;
  <sx-e>--like-color-hover</sx-e>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-a>from</sx-a> <sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--like-color</sx-e>) <sx-a>h</sx-a> <sx-a>s</sx-a> <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-a>l</sx-a> + <sx-n>10</sx-n>));
  <sx-e>--like-color-active</sx-e>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-a>from</sx-a> <sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--like-color</sx-e>) <sx-a>h</sx-a> <sx-a>s</sx-a> <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-a>l</sx-a> - <sx-n>20</sx-n>));
}

.<sx-y>post</sx-y> {
  <sx-p>display</sx-p>: <sx-a>block</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>background</sx-p>: <sx-n>#EEE</sx-n>;

  <sx-z>@media</sx-z> (<sx-x>prefers-color-scheme</sx-x>: <sx-a>dark</sx-a>) {

  .<sx-y>avatar</sx-y> {

      &amp;:<sx-l>hover</sx-l> { <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--like-color-hover</sx-e>); }

<p>That is way nicer to read<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>! All the relevant parts are right next to each other, so it’s a lot easier to understand what’s going on. Seeing the <code>&amp;:hover</code> and <code>&amp;:active</code> right next to the <code>.like</code> button is especially nice imo.</p>
<p>And since you can sort of see the structure - the parent selectors “guarding” the child ones - it also makes it a lot easier to get away with short and simple class names (or even referring to elements themselves).</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I’m also making use of relative colors in the second example. I think the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Relative_colors">MDN article</a> has a lot of awesome examples, but the jist of it is that you can take an existing color, modify it in many different ways across multiple color spaces, and mix it with other colors using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix">color-mix()</a>.</p>
<pre><code><sx-c>/* remove blue from a color */</sx-c>

<p>These snippets are really useful for when you want something to be just ever so slightly darker or brighter, such as a button hover effect or a matching border color, and they’re way nicer to use than doing all those color conversions in JavaScript. If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, you could even go ahead and generate your entire color scheme in just CSS.</p>

<p>Safari is currently broken when handling of cqw/cqh units, therefore the demo above may not work correctly. If this happens, try using Firefox or Chrome instead.</p>
<p>There are so many cool new CSS features that make writing it just that little bit nicer. Things like letting you use <code>(width &lt;= 768px)</code> instead of <code>(max-width: 768px)</code> in your <a href="https://web.dev/articles/media-query-range-syntax"><em>@media</em> query</a>, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#lh">lh unit</a> that matches the line-height, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter">scrollbar-gutter</a> property that solves the little scrollbar-related layout shifts, or the ability to finally <a href="https://web.dev/blog/align-content-block">center stuff vertically</a> without flex/grid.</p>
<art-frame aria-label="Baseline logo" role="img" flex="">

Baseline</art-frame>
<p>And all of this is brought together by the cherry on top that is <a href="https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/">Baseline</a>. It’s a guarantee that a specific feature works in every major browser<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, and it also lets you know since when - <strong>newly available</strong> features work in all the latest browsers, and <strong>widely available</strong> ones work in browsers up to 2.5 years old. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector">Nesting</a>, for example, has been fully supported in all browsers since December 2023, and thus will become <em>widely available</em> in June 2026. You can find the Baseline symbols in various places, such as the MDN docs<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of what makes modern CSS so much nicer to write than what we had even just 5 years ago. It almost feels like comparing ES3<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> to ECMAScript 2025 - and I wouldn’t blame your grudge if the former is what you’re used to.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2>
<p>Okay, so CSS has more quality-of-life stuff than before. Still, why would one choose to use it over something else? Doesn’t JavaScript already let us do everything just fine?</p>
<art-frame aria-label="You need to disable JavaScript to run this app" role="img" center=""><fake-frame>You need to <span>disable</span> JavaScript to run this app.</fake-frame></art-frame>
<p>I think my reasons for using CSS fall into two main categories - because some users don’t want to use JavaScript, and because doing things in CSS can be genuinely better.</p>
<p>My blog, for example, focuses on infosec topics. Many security researchers (myself included) use a hardened browser configuration to protect themselves, which often means disabling JavaScript by default. I think it’s nice that they can fully experience my blog without changing their security settings or running a separate, sandboxed browser.</p>
<p>The same goes for privacy-conscious users, and it makes sense! As an experiment, I opened up a local Estonian news site in a web browser with JavaScript enabled. Can you guess how many js files it fetched? <em>(answer in footnote<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>)</em> That’s crazy! You do not want that running on your computer.</p>
<p>But surely, you are not <em>one of the evil devs</em> who loads a double-digit number of analytics scripts on your site - is there still any reason to reach for CSS?</p>
<p>Well, I think a lot of things are just plain nicer to make in HTML/CSS, both from the developer and end-user perspectives, be it for ease of use, accessibility, or performance.</p>
<p>Hover effects for your buttons? Toast animations? Input validation? All of these things <em>just work</em> in CSS, and you won’t have to reinvent the wheel, or throw kilobytes of someone else’s code at it. There will always be some cases where you do need that extra flexibility JavaScript often provides, but if you don’t need that, and doing it in CSS is easier, then why not save yourself the trouble?</p>

<p>And the performance of CSS is so much better! Every JavaScript interaction has to go through an event loop that wastes CPU cycles, eats some battery, and adds that tiny bit of stutter to everything.</p>
<p>Sure, in the grand scale of things it isn’t <em>that</em> bad, APIs like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame</a> are really good at keeping things smooth. But CSS animations run in the separate compositor thread, and <a href="https://web.dev/articles/animations-and-performance#css_vs_javascript_performance">aren’t affected</a> by stutters and blocking in the event loop.</p>
<p>It makes quite a difference on low-end devices, but feels nice even on high-end ones. CSS animations on my 240hz monitor look amazing<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> - JS can look pretty good too, but it has that tiny bit of stutter to it that keeps it from being perfect, especially if you plan on running other heavy code at the same time.</p>
<p>It also means you won’t have to worry as much about optimization, as the browser takes care of a lot more of the rendering side of things, and often runs your stuff on the GPU if possible.</p>
<p><em>Pro tip! Wanna trigger animations from JS anyways? Use the modern <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API">Web Animations API</a> to easily play the smooth CSS animations from JS.</em></p>
<h2 id="transitioning">Transitioning</h2>
<!--Speaking of which, let's get to the first show & tell section of the post, where I show you something cool and tell you how it's made.-->
<p>Speaking of which, I think it’s time I start showing you practical examples, and a good place to <em>start</em> showing the <em>styles</em> is well, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style"><em>@starting-style</em></a>.</p>
<p>In the past it has been pretty annoying to add start animations (such as fade-ins) to elements. You’ve had to either set up an entire CSS animation with a separate <em>@keyframes</em> block to go with it, or do a transition using JavaScript where you first add an element to the page, then wait a frame, and then add a class to the element.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: A toast message fading in from bottom" role="figure" id="starting-style-toast"><code-frame role="code">.<sx-y>toast</sx-y> {
  <sx-p>transition</sx-p>: <sx-a>opacity</sx-a> <sx-n>1s</sx-n>, <sx-a>translate</sx-a> <sx-n>1s</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>opacity</sx-p>: <sx-n>1</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>translate</sx-p>: <sx-n>0</sx-n> <sx-n>0</sx-n>;
  <sx-z>@starting-style</sx-z> {
    <sx-p>opacity</sx-p>: <sx-n>0</sx-n>;
    <sx-p>translate</sx-p>: <sx-n>0</sx-n> <sx-n>10px</sx-n>;
  }
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame><span></span><p>Success!</p></fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>But this has all changed thanks to the new <em>@starting-style</em> at-rule!</p>
<p>Pretty much all you have to do is set your properties as usual, add the initial transition states to <em>@starting-style</em>, and add those properties to a transition. It’s pretty simple and it kind of <em>just works</em> without having to trigger the animation in any way.</p>
<h2 id="lunalover">Lunalover</h2>
<p>Another good example of where CSS shines is theming. Many sites <em>need</em> separate light and dark modes, and modern CSS makes dealing with that pretty easy.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: Various elements affected by theme setting" role="figure" id="dark-example-1"><code-frame role="code">:<sx-l>root</sx-l> {
  <sx-p>color-scheme</sx-p>: <sx-a>light</sx-a> <sx-a>dark</sx-a>;
  <sx-e>--text</sx-e>: <sx-k>light-dark</sx-k>(<sx-n>#000</sx-n>, <sx-n>#FFF</sx-n>);
  <sx-e>--bg</sx-e>: <sx-k>light-dark</sx-k>(<sx-n>#EEE</sx-n>, <sx-n>#242936</sx-n>);
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame><p>hi there!</p><a href="https://karnaboy.bandcamp.com/track/lunalover" target="_blank"></a><p>you are awesome!<br><label>i am!</label></p></fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>By setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme">color-scheme</a> property to <code>light dark</code>, you are telling the browser to automatically pick the theme according to the user preference, and you can then make use of that by setting color values with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark">light-dark()</a> function.</p>
<p>Not only does it set your own colors, but also those of the native components, such as the default buttons, form elements, and scrollbars. It kind of just <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@rebane2001/115060623979682479">makes stuff work</a> by default, and that’s nice!</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: Buttons to change theme between auto, light, and dark" role="figure" id="dark-example-2"><code-frame role="code">:<sx-l>root</sx-l> {
  <sx-p>color-scheme</sx-p>: <sx-a>light</sx-a> <sx-a>dark</sx-a>;
  &amp;:<sx-l>has</sx-l>(#<sx-a>theme-light</sx-a>:<sx-l>checked</sx-l>) {
    <sx-p>color-scheme</sx-p>: <sx-a>light</sx-a>;
  }
  &amp;:<sx-l>has</sx-l>(#<sx-a>theme-dark</sx-a>:<sx-l>checked</sx-l>) {
    <sx-p>color-scheme</sx-p>: <sx-a>dark</sx-a>;
  }
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame><theme-picker aria-label="Theme picker" role="radiogroup">
    <label>Auto</label>
    <label>Light</label>
    <label>Dark</label>
  </theme-picker></fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>You can then add some way of overriding the <em>color-scheme</em> property to let the user pick a theme different from their system setting. Here I am using radio buttons to accomplish that.</p>
<p><em>Pro tip! CSS can’t save the theme preference, but you can still do progressive enhancement. Make the themes work CSS-only, and then add the saving/loading of preference as an optional extra in JavaScript or server-side code.</em></p>
<h2 id="lyres-and-accordions">Lyres and accordions</h2>
<p><em>“But those don’t look like radio buttons”</em> I hear you cry.</p>
<p>Input elements such as radio buttons and checkboxes are a great foundation to build other stuff on top of - the example above consists of labels for the buttons and invisible radio buttons that can be checked for with the <em>:checked</em> pseudo-class.</p>

<fake-frame><radio-picker aria-label="Radio buttons example" role="radiogroup">

<p>This is how I made the theme selector from the previous example. I’ve made the radio buttons half-visible in the demo for clarity, but with the <code>opacity: 0</code> they would not actually be visible.</p>
<p>There’s a whole lot going on here, so let’s break it down.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>&lt;radio-picker</sx-t> <sx-r>aria-label</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"Radio buttons example"</sx-v> <sx-r>role</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"radiogroup"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>
</code></pre>
<p>We start off with the <em>radio-picker</em> element - I just made it up, you can use a div instead if you’d prefer. We give it an aria-label to give the group an accessible name, and the aria role of <em>radiogroup</em> to make it work as a group for the radio buttons.</p>
<p>You could also use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/fieldset"><em>fieldset</em></a> element instead of doing the aria roles if that’d fit your use case better.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</sx-t> <sx-r>type</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"radio"</sx-v> <sx-r>name</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"demo"</sx-v> <sx-r>id</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"veni"</sx-v> <sx-r>checked</sx-r><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>veni<sx-t>&lt;/label&gt;</sx-t>
<sx-t>&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</sx-t> <sx-r>type</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"radio"</sx-v> <sx-r>name</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"demo"</sx-v> <sx-r>id</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"vidi"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>vidi<sx-t>&lt;/label&gt;</sx-t>
<sx-t>&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</sx-t> <sx-r>type</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"radio"</sx-v> <sx-r>name</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"demo"</sx-v> <sx-r>id</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"vici"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>vici<sx-t>&lt;/label&gt;</sx-t>
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we add the radio buttons with their respective labels - usually you’d have to use the <em>for</em> attribute on labels to define which element they’re referring to, but since we have the <em>input</em> inside the <em>label</em> we don’t have to do that.</p>
<p>All the <code>type="radio"</code> inputs should also have a <em>name</em> value set to the same thing so that they are grouped together (you still need<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> the radiogroup though). And then you can give them values or ids however you want.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>label</sx-t> {
  &amp;:<sx-l>has</sx-l>(<sx-t>input</sx-t>:<sx-l>checked</sx-l>) {
    <sx-p>box-shadow</sx-p>: <sx-a>inset</sx-a> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>8px</sx-n> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>#888</sx-n>;
  }
  &amp;:<sx-l>has</sx-l>(<sx-t>input</sx-t>:<sx-l>focus-visible</sx-l>) {
    <sx-p>outline</sx-p>: <sx-n>2px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a> <sx-n>#000</sx-n>;
  }
  <sx-p>box-shadow</sx-p>: <sx-a>inset</sx-a> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>1.2px</sx-n> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>#000</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>10px</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>cursor</sx-p>: <sx-a>pointer</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>background</sx-p>: <sx-n>#0002</sx-n>;
  &amp;:<sx-l>hover</sx-l> { <sx-p>background</sx-p>: <sx-n>#0004</sx-n>; }
  &amp;:<sx-l>active</sx-l> { <sx-p>background</sx-p>: <sx-n>#0006</sx-n>; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We then style the labels as we wish - the <em>:hover</em> and <em>:active</em> pseudo-classes can be used to make the buttons more fun to click, the <em>:has(input:checked)</em> selector can be used to define the style of the selected button, and the <em>:has(input:focus-visible)</em> selector can be used to add an outline when someone tabs over to the button.</p>
<p>The difference between <em>:focus</em> and <em>:focus-visible</em> is that the former shows up even if you use your mouse, while the latter only shows up when you use keyboard navigation, so it’s often visually more clean to use the latter.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>input</sx-t> {
  <sx-p>opacity</sx-p>: <sx-n>0</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>position</sx-p>: <sx-a>absolute</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>pointer-events</sx-p>: <sx-a>none</sx-a>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And last, we make the radio button input <em>exist</em> while not being visible. This is a bit hacky, but it’s how you can keep this control accessible to keyboard navigation and screen readers.</p>
<p>And that’s how we get the cool-looking radio buttons!</p>

<p>We can now use them in the CSS however we want by just seeing if they’re <em>:checked</em>. Here I made tabs with separate divs for the content by using a <em>:has</em> selector on a parent element to find out which radio button is currently selected.</p>
<p>The <em>:has</em> selector has to be on a parent element that contains both the radio button and the target element - you can simply use <em>html</em> or <em>body</em> if you want it to work across the entire page. You should <strong>never</strong> use something like <code>:has(…)</code> by itself as it’ll run the selector for every element of the page, which can cause performance issues (<code>body:has(…)</code> is okay).</p>

<p>Finally, before we move on, I want to give you a quick introduction to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/details">details</a> element. It’s great for if you want an accordion-style menu, such as for a FAQ section. The details open and close independently of each other, but you can set their name attribute to the same value to have only one open at a time.</p>
<p>Using them is pretty easy, put your content and a <em>summary</em> tag inside a <em>details</em> tag, and put the title inside the <em>summary</em> tag. The example above is a bit more convoluted for the visual flair, but all you <em>really</em> need is the html part of it.</p>
<p>The details elements are pretty stylable! You can add animations depending on the <em>[open]</em> state, and you can also get rid of the arrow by setting <code>list-style: none</code> on the <em>summary</em>.</p>
<p>Also, ctrl+f works with it, which is a big win in my book!</p>
<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<p>And lastly, I want to show you the power of input validation in HTML and CSS.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: Input validation" role="figure" vertical="" id="validation-example-1"><code-frame role="code"><sx-t>&lt;label</sx-t> <sx-r>for</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"usrname"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>Username<sx-t>&lt;/label&gt;</sx-t>

<sx-t>&lt;small&gt;</sx-t>3-16 letters, only alphanum and _.<sx-t>&lt;/small&gt;</sx-t>
<sx-t>&lt;style&gt;</sx-t>
 <sx-t>input</sx-t>:<sx-l>valid</sx-l> {
   <sx-p>border</sx-p>: <sx-n>1px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a> <sx-a>green</sx-a>;
 }
 <sx-t>input</sx-t>:<sx-l>invalid</sx-l> {
   <sx-p>border</sx-p>: <sx-n>1px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a> <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
 }
<sx-t>&lt;/style&gt;</sx-t></code-frame>
<fake-frame>
  <p><label for="usrname">Username</label>
    
    <small>3-16 letters, only alphanum and _.</small>
  </p>
</fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>This is a simple example of how you can validate an input field with a regex pattern. If you set a <em>pattern</em> attribute like above, a form that contains the input cannot be submitted unless the field matches the pattern. If you’re submitting something like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/email">an e-mail address</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/tel">a phone number</a>, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/url">a url</a>, it might make sense to use the respective input types instead of writing your own regex.</p>
<p>Now, where CSS comes in is styling the input to show whether its value is valid. In the example above, I’m using <em>:valid</em> and <em>:invalid</em> to set a border color, but that comes with the downside of <em>always</em> having your input marked, even if the user hasn’t entered anything yet.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: Input validation" role="figure" id="validation-example-2"><code-frame role="code"><sx-t>input</sx-t> {
  <sx-p>border</sx-p>: <sx-a>none</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>border-radius</sx-p>: <sx-n>2px</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>outline</sx-p>: <sx-n>1px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a> <sx-n>#000</sx-n>;
  &amp;:<sx-l>focus</sx-l> { <sx-p>outline-width</sx-p>: <sx-n>2px</sx-n>; }
  &amp;:<sx-l>user-valid</sx-l> { <sx-p>outline-color</sx-p>: <sx-a>green</sx-a>; }
  &amp;:<sx-l>user-invalid</sx-l> { <sx-p>outline-color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>; }
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame>
  <p><label for="usrname2">Username</label>
    
    <small>3-16 letters, only alphanum and _.</small>
  </p>
</fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>An easy win here is to instead use <em>:user-valid</em> and <em>:user-invalid</em> - these pseudo-classes only become active once you’ve interacted with input field. I also made this example use an outline instead of a border, which I think looks a lot nicer.</p>
<p>It may sometimes even make sense to use a combination of <em>:valid</em> and <em>:user-invalid</em>.</p>
<p>And of course, you can use the <em>:has</em> selector to style other elements depending on the input too!</p>

<p>I do want to mention that for some stuff, such as date pickers <no-wrap>()</no-wrap> or datalists <no-wrap>()</no-wrap>, there are built-in elements that do the job, but you may find them limited in one way or the other. If you’re making an input like that with specific requirements, you may still need to dip your feet in a bit of JavaScript.</p>

<p>This section is kind of random but I wanted to include it here because I think a lot of people are messing this one up and I want more people to know how to do this stuff right.</p>
<p>So CSS has vw/vh units that correspond to 1% of the viewport width and height respectively, which makes perfect sense for desktop browsers.</p>

<p>Where it becomes a bit more nuanced is on mobile devices. For example, mobile versions of both Firefox and Chrome will hide the URL bar when scrolling down on a page.</p>
<p>This causes the vw/vh units to be a bit ambigous - do they represent the <em>entire</em> available screen, only the area that’s visible with the URL bar, or something in between?</p>
<p>If it’s the first option, you might end up with buttons or links off-screen<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>! If it’s the second, you may end up with a background div that doesn’t cover the entire background.</p>

<p>Above is a table of values your browser reports - if you're on mobile, try scrolling the blogpost up and down so that the URL bar hides and see how the numbers change.</p>
<p>The values are multiplied by 100 (eg 100vh is used instead of 1vh).</p>

</phone-content>
</phone-screen></epic-phone>
</div>
<p>The solution to this is to use the new responsive viewport units: <strong>lvh</strong>, <strong>svh</strong>, and <strong>dvh</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>lvh</strong> stands for <em>largest</em> viewport height, and thus is useful for things like backgrounds that you’d want to cover the entire screen with, and wouldn’t care about getting cut off.</p>
<p><strong>svh</strong> stands for <em>smallest</em> viewport height, and should be used for things that must always fit on the screen, such as buttons and links.</p>
<p>And <strong>dvh</strong> stands for <em>dynamic</em> viewport height - this one will update to whatever the current viewport height is. It might seem like the obvious choice, but it should not be used for elements you don’t want resizing or moving around as the user scrolls the page, as it could become quite annoying and possibly even laggy otherwise.</p>
<p>Of course, the respective <strong>lvw</strong>, <strong>svw</strong>, and <strong>dvw</strong> units exist too :).</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-cat">Keyboard cat</h3>
<p>By default, the viewport units do not account for the keyboard overlaying the page.</p>
<p>There are two ways to deal with that: the <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Viewport_meta_element#interactive-widget">interactive-widget</a></em> attribute, and the <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VirtualKeyboard_API">VirtualKeyboard</a></em> API.</p>
<p>The former option is widely supported across browsers, works without JS, and goes in the meta viewport tag. It makes it so that opening the keyboard will change <em>all</em> of the viewport units.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>&lt;meta</sx-t> <sx-r>name</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"viewport"</sx-v> <sx-r>content</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"width=device-width, interactive-widget=resizes-content"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>
</code></pre>
<p>The latter option is currently only supported in Chromium-based browsers, and requires a single line of JavaScript to use:</p>
<pre><code><sx-e>navigator</sx-e>.<sx-p>virtualKeyboard</sx-p>.<sx-p>overlaysContent</sx-p> = <sx-a>true</sx-a>;
</code></pre>
<p>The advantage of the second option is that it allows you to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env">environment variables</a> in CSS to get the position and size of the keyboard, which is pretty cool.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>floating-button</sx-t> {
  <sx-p>margin-bottom</sx-p>: <sx-k>env</sx-k>(<sx-a>keyboard-inset-height</sx-a>, <sx-n>0px</sx-n>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But considering the fact that it doesn’t work cross-browser, I’d avoid it.</p>
<h2 id="css-wishlist">CSS wishlist</h2>
<p>Alright, so this is a little different from the rest of the post, but I wanted to bring up some things that I wish were in CSS. I haven’t fully fleshed out all of them, so some definitely wouldn’t fit the spec as-is, but maybe they can inspire some other stuff at least.</p>
<p>They are just fun ideas, don’t take them too seriously.</p>
<h3 id="reusable-blocks">Reusable blocks</h3>
<p>I wish it was possible to put classes in other classes in CSS, so that you could write something like:</p>
<pre><code>.<sx-y>border</sx-y> {
  <sx-p>border</sx-p>: <sx-n>2px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>border-radius</sx-p>: <sx-n>4px</sx-n>;
}

.<sx-y>button</sx-y> {
  <sx-z>@apply</sx-z> <sx-y>border</sx-y>;
}

.<sx-y>card</sx-y> {
  <sx-z>@apply</sx-z> <sx-y>border</sx-y>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is something that <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply-directive">Tailwind already has</a>, and that makes me jealous.</p>
<!--
### Scoped variables

I wish we could scope variables, so that an inner element could set the value for an outer element.

<pre class="sx-block"><code><sx-t>foo</sx-t> {
  <sx-k>@property</sx-k> <sx-k>--color</sx-k> {
    <sx-p>syntax</sx-p>: <sx-s>'&lt;color&gt;'</sx-s>;
    <sx-p>initial-value</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
    <sx-p>scoped</sx-p>: <sx-a>true</sx-a>;
  }
  <sx-t>bar</sx-t> {
    &amp;:<sx-l>hover</sx-l> {
      <sx-e>--color</sx-e>: <sx-a>blue</sx-a>;
    }
  }
  <sx-c>/* foo will be blue on bar hover */</sx-c>
  <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--color</sx-e>);
}
</code></pre>
This idea has a lot of problems in practice, from little things such as nested statements getting reordered, to bigger issues that'd require rewriting and rethinking big parts of CSS. I don't see this ever being added, but it would be fun to have.
-->
<h3 id="combined-media-selectors">Combined @media selectors</h3>
<p>We can currently do nested <em>@media</em> queries, and also multiple selectors at the same time:</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  &amp;.<sx-y>foo</sx-y>, &amp;.<sx-y>bar</sx-y> {
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
    <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>8px</sx-n>;
    <sx-p>font-size</sx-p>: <sx-n>2em</sx-n>;
  }
  <sx-z>@media</sx-z> (<sx-p>width</sx-p> &lt; <sx-n>480px</sx-n>) {
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
    <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>8px</sx-n>;
    <sx-p>font-size</sx-p>: <sx-n>2em</sx-n>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>But we cannot combine the two into a single selector:</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-z>@media</sx-z> (<sx-p>width</sx-p> &lt; <sx-n>480px</sx-n>), &amp;.<sx-y>foo</sx-y> {
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
    <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>8px</sx-n>;
    <sx-p>font-size</sx-p>: <sx-n>2em</sx-n>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which means if you want to do that you’ll inevitably have to repeat code or do some silly variable hacks, neither of which is ideal.</p>
<h3 id="n-th-child-variable">n-th child variable</h3>
<p>For many of the CSS crimes I like to commit, I often end up writing code like:</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>1</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>1</sx-n>; }
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>2</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>2</sx-n>; }
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>3</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>3</sx-n>; }
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>4</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>4</sx-n>; }
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>5</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>5</sx-n>; }
  ...
  <sx-y>span</sx-y> {
    <sx-p>top</sx-p>: <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-e>--nth</sx-e> * <sx-n>24px</sx-n>);
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--nth</sx-e>) * <sx-n>90deg</sx-n>) <sx-n>100</sx-n> <sx-n>90</sx-n>);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And I think it would be a lot nicer if we could instead just do:</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-t>span</sx-t> {
    <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-k>nth-child</sx-k>();
    <sx-p>top</sx-p>: <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-e>--nth</sx-e> * <sx-n>24px</sx-n>);
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--nth</sx-e>) * <sx-n>90deg</sx-n>) <sx-n>100</sx-n> <sx-n>90</sx-n>);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="n-th-letter-targeting">n-th letter targeting</h3>
<p>CSS has the ability to style the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::first-letter">::first-letter</a> of text. It’d be cool if were was also a <strong>::nth-letter(…)</strong> selector, similar to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child">:nth-child</a>. I suspect the reason this isn’t a thing is because the <em>::first-letter</em> selector is a pseudo-element, which would be a bit tricky to implement with the nth-letter idea.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: the letter i in hi there is made red" role="figure" id="nth-example"><code-frame role="code"><sx-c>/* not a real feature */</sx-c>
<sx-t>p</sx-t>::<sx-l>nth-letter</sx-l>(2) {
  <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame>
<p>h<span>i</span> there~</p>
</fake-frame></code-compare>

<p><a href="https://www.blackle-mori.com/">Blackle</a> suggested that combining the nth-child() variable with :nth-letter targeting would also be fun for certain effects, such as putting the value in the sin() function to create wavy text.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: the text waves vertically, and has a trans-colored gradient going across it" role="figure" vertical="" id="wavey-example"><code-frame role="code"><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-c>/* not a real feature */</sx-c>

<h3 id="unit-removal">Unit removal</h3>
<p>I wish you could easily remove units from values, for example by dividing them.</p>

<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-c>/* Turns into: <screen-size></screen-size> (no unit) */</sx-c>
  <sx-e>--screen-width</sx-e>: <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-n>100vw</sx-n> / <sx-n>1px</sx-n>);
  <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--screen-width</sx-e>) <sx-n>100</sx-n>, <sx-n>50</sx-n>);
}</code></pre>
<p>This would allow you to use the size of the viewport or container as a numeric variable for things other than length. For example, the <a href="#color-picker">color picker</a> from earlier uses it to convert the location of the color picker dot to a number to be used in a color value instead.</p>
<p>Uh, but wait? Does that mean this feature already exists?</p>
<p>Yeah, lol! We already have the ability to get unitless values in CSS, but it involves doing hacky stuff such as <code>tan(atan2(var(--vw), 1px))</code> with a custom <em>@property</em>. It’d be nice to have this as just a division, for example.</p>
<p>Oh, and good news, this one we might actually be <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#calc-type-checking">getting soon</a>!</p>
<p><em>Also if you do something like <code>calc(1px + sqrt(1px * 1px))</code> your browser will crash<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</em></p>
<h3 id="a-better-image-function">A better image function</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/image"><strong>image()</strong> function</a> exists, but no browsers implement it. It’s similar to just using <em>url()</em>, but adds some really cool features such as a fallback color, and image fragments to crop a smaller section out of a bigger image (think spritesheets).</p>
<p>We can already do both fallbacks and spritesheets with the various background properties, but it’d be nice to have this pretty syntax. I’d honestly love this syntax even more for &lt;img&gt; tags than CSS.</p>
<h3 id="style-tags-in-body">style tags in body</h3>
<p>I make heavy use of &lt;style&gt; tags in &lt;body&gt; for my projects. On my blog, for example, I write the relevant CSS close to their graphics so that you can <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@rebane2001/114931064484832451">start reading the blog</a> before the entire page (or the entire CSS) has finished loading<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. And it works great!</p>
<p>But what’s unfortunate is that despite browsers supporting this, and major sites using this, it’s <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1605">not officially spec-compliant</a>. I suspect it’s in the spec to avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">FOUC</a> footgun, but there are so many reasons you would want/need style in body that I don’t think it justifies it.</p>
<p>I think an HTML validator should warn for this, but not error.</p>
<h2 id="the-art">The art</h2>
<p>I want to end this article by saying that to me, web development is an art, and thus, CSS is too. I often have a hard time relating to people who do webdev solely to earn money or build a startup - web development is very different when you’re on a team and are given tasks from above instead of having free will over what you create for fun.</p>
<p>It’s probably most apparent with things like AI<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, that for me take all the fun and creativity out of my work. But it also applies to build chain tooling such as linters and minifiers - the way I write my code is part of the art, and I don’t want a tool to erase that. I don’t even use an IDE<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Among the practical reasons for sticking to CSS listed throughout this post, there’s a secret extra reason I like to do everything in CSS, and that’s expression and art. Art isn’t always practical, and using CSS isn’t either. But it’s how I like to express myself, and it’s why I do what I do.</p>
<p>I tried to keep this post approachable and practical for all web developers. But there is so much more to CSS that I’d like to talk about, so expect another post about the stuff that isn’t practical, and is instead just cool as fuck. I think <em>CSS is a programming language</em>, and <a href="https://lyra.horse/css-clicker/">I made a game to prove it</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s a topic for another time.</p>
<h2 id="afterword">afterword</h2>
<p>it’s been almost a year since my last post, but i hope it’s been worth the wait ^_^</p>
<p>as usual, this post is a self-contained html file with no javascript, images, or other external resources - everything on the page is handwritten html/css, weighing in at around 49kB gzipped. it was really fun creating all the little interactive widgets and visuals this time around, i think i’ve improved in css a lot since the last time i posted.</p>
<p>this entire post turned out to be a bit of a fun mess (as did i!), it’s almost like a chaotic gradient of tone throughout, i hope it was still interesting and enjoyable to read though.</p>
<p>i have a few new posts in the works: in addition to the second css one mentioned earlier, i also have one about a new web vulnerability subclass i discovered, and one about a trans topic. i’m not sure when these posts will come out, but we’ll see! make sure to add me to your rss reader if that sounds fun.</p>
<p>i’ll also be giving <a href="https://pretalx.com/bsides-tallinn-2025/talk/S3V8UY/">a talk</a> at bsides tallinn in september! i’m hoping to also do css-related talks at the next ccc and disobey, but we’ll have to see whether i get accepted and have the travel budget for those.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a relatively new member of adult society, and an absolute infant of
the business world, I didn't think much about bank choice. I figured: you
put money in, you take money out, they're all the same. I also figured a local
branch of a global bank is just a fungible tentacle of the giant banking
machine, so also... who cares. Both incorrect assumptions, but let's relive and
rediscover the effect of these assumptions as I did.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2012">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I start my company. I am a 22 year old recent college graduate living in San
Francisco and pursuing the startup dream. I file my incorporation paperwork
and wait to receive the necessary information for one of the first
steps in the life of any new business: opening a bank account.</p>
<p>My filing is processed and I receive my EIN while visiting my parents
in a suburb of Los Angeles. I have time to kill during one of the days so
I drive down to the nearest Chase bank branch and open a business banking
account. We'll call the person who helped me at the local branch Alex (this
will be important later). I fund that account with a $20,000 personal loan which
was almost all of my savings. I get an account number, an online login, and
<em>boom, we're in business!</em></p>
<p>About 6 months later, I raise a ~$1M seed round. I supply my Chase business
banking account information for the wire, and at close the funding is wired to
the account. I am sitting in a cafe in downtown San Francisco and I receive a
call from an unknown number -- it's Alex, the banker that
helped me open my account. He is being very casual, sort of like
"Hey, just wanted to check on things." "I noticed a big deposit and wanted
to make sure you had everything you needed." etc. For my side, I am
mostly confused: why is this person calling me? I mostly say things like
"yes yes I'm fine" and end the call quickly. Some wheels have started
turning in Southern California, and I just hadn't known it yet.</p>
<div><p>Someone out there is probably mentally screaming at me "you fool!"
at this point. With hindsight, I agree, but I will remind you
dear reader that I have only been legally allowed to purchase alcohol
for just over a year at this point in my life in the story.</p></div>
<hr>
<ol start="2014">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The two years since 2012 -- from a banking perspective -- are quiet. Alex
doesn't call me again, and we have no changes in our banking setup. For two years,
the company was in heads-down building mode. We had shown significant product
traction and were now ready to ramp up hiring to continue building.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014, we raise a $10.2M series A. I once again provide the
same Chase business banking account and when the round closes, the funds are
wired. Surprise surprise, Alex calls me! I'm starting to realize banks get
an alert when there are major changes in account balances. Regardless,
I once again brush Alex off -- "everything is good thanks! bye!" -- and
continue on with my life.</p>
<p>At this point, I am bewildered that this guy I met at the random local branch
to sign some papers is the one calling me, but didn't think much more of
it at the time.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2016">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, the two years since 2014 are mostly quiet from a banking
perspective. Alex called more regularly to "check in" but otherwise
nothing has changed. We still bank with Chase. I still have never gone
back into a branch. I do everything online.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2016, we raise a $24M series B. I once again provide the
same Chase business banking account and when the round closes, the funds
are wired. Again, Alex calls. Again, I brush him off. The bank is where I
plant money, I don't need anyone calling me. I just want to focus on building
the company.</p>
<p>Throughout 2016, we had been building out an executive team for the company.
And around the same time of the funding, we hire a Vice President of Finance. As he gets
up to speed with our financial footing, he notices we have ~$35M sitting in
cash in a Chase bank account. This is <em>obviously</em> not a smart thing to do,
so he suggests some financial plans for how to better safeguard and utilize
this mountain of cash.</p>
<p>As part of these plans, he suggests moving to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).
They're local to the Bay Area, he's worked with them before, and their
bankers understand startups. It'll make accounts receivables, payables,
payroll, etc. easier. To me, a bank is a bank is a bank, and if it helps
make his job easier, I support his plan.</p>
<p>I log into the Chase online portal and initiate a wire for the full account
balance to SVB. I have to pay something like a $30 fee to wire $35M
(inconsequential to the story, but amusing nonetheless). Someone calls me for
verification -- not Alex -- and the wire processes. <em>Boom, we're done with
Chase.</em> Or so I think.</p>
<p>Alex calls me the next day. The day we initiated the wire was his day off.
He sounds slightly agitated. I wasn't rude to him, but I was short with him.
I switched banks, that's all there is to it. Thanks and goodbye. I never
talk to Alex ever again. A bank is a bank is a bank, you put money in,
you get money out, I don't understand why I would need to <em>talk to someone</em>.</p>
<div><p>I once again interrupt this story to appeal to the readers who are
screaming at me and thank you for joining me on this story recounting
my learning journey. Rest assured, at this point in the story, a professional
was now in charge of the company's finances. But the decisions of the
years leading up to this would have lingering effects for a few more years...</p></div>
<hr>
<ol start="2017">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>We now take a brief detour from the company, because this is where my
personal life becomes relevant to the story.</p>
<p>For the prior three years, I had been living in Los Angeles. At some
point during 2017, I had to go to a local Chase branch to make some
changes to my personal accounts. It has been close to a year since the company
stopped using Chase.</p>
<p>I visit the closest bank branch to my apartment. This bank branch is 20
miles north of where my parents live -- or the area with the branch where I
opened the original company business bank accounts. I'm going to Chase for
purely personal reasons, but this information is unfortunately relevant
to the story.</p>
<p>At my local branch, I walk up to the teller and provide some handwritten
information: my name, account number, desired transaction, etc. The teller looks at the paper,
then looks at me, then looks back at the paper, then asks "Are you the
HashiCorp guy?" <em>What?</em> HashiCorp is doing well but its not <em>at all</em>
something a random non-technical consumer would know about. What is going on?</p>
<p>I say yes and he acknowledges but doesn't automatically offer any more
information. I have to know, so I continue "How do you know that?" His
response is "Dude, everyone at Chase down here knows about HashiCorp." <em>Huh?</em></p>
<div><p>Up to this point, everything in the story is what I know and experienced
first hand. What follows however is now second hand information as told
by this teller. I haven't verified it, but other employees (at other branches)
have said similar things to me over the years.</p></div>
<p>The teller proceeds to explain that Alex -- the guy I opened my original
company account with -- became a fast rising star in the area. He had
opened a business account in a small suburb that grew from $20,000 to
$35,000,000 in balances in just four years! Despite the business (my business)
not engaging in higher-revenue activities with the bank, the opportunity
this account represented to the small business wing of the small suburban
branch stirred up some excitement. It was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>And then, overnight, the account went to $0. Without talking to anyone,
without any prior warning, that account was <em>gone</em>. I used online banking
to transfer the entirety of the balance to another bank. The small suburban
branch viewed this as a <em>huge loss</em> and Alex came into work with some tough
questions and no answers. I instantly recalled feeling that Alex was agitated
when he called me the day after the transfer, and I now had an idea of why.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened to Alex, the teller said he was "no longer
working in the area" and said it with a noticably negative tone. I don't
know what this means and I never found out. Perhaps, he just moved.</p>
<p>Following this event, Chase began an educational series to other local
branches in the Los Angeles area explaining that there are these "startups"
and how their financial patterns do not match those of a typical business. This series
taught branches how to identify startups and how to consider their accounts.
The case study they used for this presentation: HashiCorp.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2018">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It has been two years since hiring our VP of Finance and our financial
department is in really healthy shape. I still have certain approval rights
but no longer directly manage the accounts of the company.</p>
<div><p>Given the recent events with Silicon Valley Bank, I feel it's important to
mention that at this point of the company, we had already begun diversifying
our balances across multiple banks. SVB will not be mentioned again for
the remainder of the story.</p></div>
<p>I'm working at my office at home in Los Angeles and I receive a phone
call from our finance department. That's weird, I rarely receive phone calls.
They tell me that during a routine internal audit, they realized there are
a few customer accounts that are still paying their bill into the old Chase
account.</p>
<p><em>I never closed that original Chase business account back in 2016.</em> Let
me explain how that happens. To close an account, I had to do it in person at
any local Chase branch. Startups are busy, the account balance in 2016 was $0,
and so I just put it off. Well, a couple years passed, it was still open,
and a few customers were actually sending payments to it.</p>
<p>Worse, upon the realization that a few customers were paying into this account,
our finance team realized that there was also fraud. For over a year, someone
had been wiring thousands of dollars out every few weeks. We were short
over $100,000 due to fraud. The finance team immediately called Chase and
reported the fraud, locked down the account, and Chase started an investigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the finance team wanted me to close the account and wire the
remaining balance to our actual business bank. With the fraud actively being
handled by Chase and the finance team, I take on the task of closing the
account. I immediately head to the nearest local Chase branch (once again
a branch I've never been to before) and explain the situation.</p>
<p>After waiting for 15 minutes, a manager walks up to me. I know this can't
be good. The branch manager explains that due to the actions taken to lock
down the account for fraud, electronic transfers are unavailable. It doesn't
matter that I'm provably the person who opened the account, electronic
transfers are "impossible."</p>
<p>I say okay, and ask how I am supposed to close the account and transfer
the remaining balance. He said I can close the account and withdraw the
remaining balance only in cash. <em>Cash?</em> At this point, I literally asked:
"like, green paper money cash?" He says yes. The balance in the account is
somewhere around $1M.</p>
<p>I spent another two hours at the bank, juggling between calling our
finance department, talking to this branch manager, and calling the Chase
business phone line. We determine that instead of literal green cash, I
can get a cashier's check. But there is a major problem: the amount the
cashier's check is made out for has to be available <em>at that local branch</em>
(or, whichever branch issues it).
And, well, local branches I guess don't usually have $1M cash lying around.
Or, if they do, its not enough to cover other business activities for the day
so they're not willing to part with it.</p>
<p>The bank manager gives me the phone number of another branch manager that
"may be able to help me." He literally writes down a phone number on a
piece of paper. This is all feeling so surreal. I call this number and
its for a slightly larger branch a few miles down the road. He says
"you're the HashiCorp guy right?" And I roll my eyes. My infamy in the
area is still well known.</p>
<p>This manager is very helpful, if not a bit gruff. He explains to me that
each local branch has some sort of performance metric based on inflows and
outflows at the given branch. Therefore, funding a $1M cash withdrawal was
not attractive to them. I'm learning a lot in a really condensed period of
time at this point. I don't even know if what he's telling me is true, or
legal, all I hear is "this is going to be hard to do if you want it all at
once."</p>
<p><em>But we do want it all at once. And we want to close the account. Now.</em>
He is not happy, but he says he'll call me back in 24 to 48 hours. True
to his word, he calls me back the next day. He says that he had to coordinate
to ensure his branch had the proper funding to satisfy this transaction,
and that the funding would be available at a specific date a few days hence.
He said I have to do the withdrawal <em>that day</em> because his branch will not
hold that amount in cash for any longer.</p>
<p>He also subtly suggested I hire personal security or otherwise deposit
those funds somewhere with haste. I believe his exact words were "if you
lose that check, I can't help you." Again, this was a one time event, and
I don't know how true that all is, but it was said to me.</p>
<p>A few days later, I walk into the branch (I did not hire personal security).
I tell the teller my name and there is a flicker of immediate recognition.
The teller guides me to a cubicle, the account is successfully closed,
I'm issued a $1M cashier's check, and I walk out the door.</p>
<p>My business banking relationship with Chase is, at long last, complete.</p>
<div><p>I want to make it clear that Chase could've been an excellent
banking partner. I never gave them the chance. I never told them what
my business does or what I'd use the money for. I never talked to anyone
(besides saying what I needed to get off the phone). This story isn't
a cautionary tale about Chase, it is rather recounting my naivete
as a young, first-time startup founder.</p></div>
<hr>
<p>Epilogue.</p>
<p>The cashier's check was uneventfully deposited into our primary business
banking account shortly after I walked out of the Chase branch.</p>
<p>The fraud investigation took a few months to complete but we were
able to recover all of the lost funds.</p>
<p>Enough time has passed and employees cycled that I'm no longer recognized at
any Los Angeles area Chase branches.</p>
<p>I look back on these events and there are many places I cringe. At the
same time, I can't imagine making different choices because I was acting in
good faith at all times with the knowledge I had. I think the choices I made were
reasonable for any new founder, and I know many founders who have made
similar choices.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there was no long term negative impact of the events that
transpired (except maybe for Alex, but I truly don't know) and I can now
look back on it with amusement.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html">https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45055641">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m about to head away from looking after this site for a few weeks (part vacation, part work stuff). As I contemplate some weeks away from the daily routine, I feel an urge to share some scattered thoughts about the state of LLMs and AI.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’ve seen a few early surveys on the effect AI is having on software development, is it really speeding folks up, does it improve or wreck code quality? One of the big problems with these surveys is that they aren’t taking into account <em>how</em> people are using the LLMs. From what I can tell the vast majority of LLM usage is fancy auto-complete, often using co-pilot. But those I know who get the most value from LLMs reckon that auto-complete isn’t very useful, preferring approaches that allow the LLM to directly read and edit source code files to carry out tasks. My concern is that surveys that ignore the different work-flows of using LLMs will produce data that’s going to send people down the wrong paths.</p>

<p>(Another complication is the varying capabilities of different models.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’m often asked, “what is the future of programming?” Should people consider entering software development now? Will LLMs eliminate the need for junior engineers? Should senior engineers get out of the profession before it’s too late? My answer to all these questions is “I haven’t the foggiest”. Furthermore I think anyone who says they know what this future will be is talking from an inappropriate orifice. We are still figuring out how to use LLMs, and it will be some time before we have a decent idea of how to use them well, especially if they gain significant improvements.</p>

<p>What I suggest, is that people experiment with them. At the least, read about what others are doing, but pay attention to the details of their workflows. Preferably experiment yourself, and do share your experiences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❇&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’m also asked: “is AI a bubble”? To which my answer is “OF COURSE IT’S A BUBBLE”. All major technological advances have come with economic bubbles, from canals and railroads to the internet. We know with near 100% certainty that this bubble will pop, causing lots of investments to fizzle to nothing. However what we don’t know is <em>when</em> it will pop, and thus how big the bubble will have grown, generating some real value in the process, before that happens. It could pop next month, or not for a couple of years.</p>

<p>We also know that when the bubble pops, many firms will go bust, but not all. When the dot-com bubble burst, it killed pets.com, it killed Webvan… but it did not kill Amazon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/202106-reducing-speaking.html">retired from public speaking</a> a couple of years ago. But while I don’t miss the stress of giving talks, I do miss hanging out with my friends in the industry. So I’m looking forward to catching up with many of them at <a href="https://gotocph.com/2025">GOTO Copenhagen</a>. I’ve been involved with the GOTO conference series since the 1990s (when it was called JAOO), and continue to be impressed with how they put together a fascinating program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>My former colleague Rebecca Parsons, has been saying for a long time that hallucinations aren’t a bug of LLMs, they are a feature. Indeed they are <em>the</em> feature. All an LLM does is produce hallucinations, it’s just that we find some of them useful.</p>

<p>One of the consequences of this is that we should always consider asking the LLM the same question more than once, perhaps with some variation in the wording. Then we can compare answers, indeed perhaps ask the LLM to compare answers for us. The difference in the answers can be as useful as the answers themselves.</p>

<p>Certainly if we ever ask a hallucination engine for a numeric answer, we should ask it at least three times, so we get some sense of the variation. Furthermore we shouldn’t ask an LLM to calculate an answer than we can calculate deterministically (yes, I’ve seen this). It is OK to ask an LLM to generate code to calculate an answer (but still do it more than once).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>Other forms of engineering have to take into account the variability of the world. A structural engineer builds in tolerance for all the factors she can’t measure. (I remember being told early in my career that the unique characteristic of digital electronics was that there was no concept of tolerances.) Process engineers consider that humans are executing tasks, and will sometimes be forgetful or careless. Software Engineering is unusual in that it works with deterministic machines. Maybe LLMs mark the point where we join our engineering peers in a world on non-determinism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’ve often heard, with decent reason, an LLM compared to a junior colleague. But I find LLMs are quite happy to say “all tests green”, yet when I run them, there are failures. If that was a junior engineer’s behavior, how long would it be before H.R. was involved?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>LLMs create a huge increase in the attack surface of software systems. Simon Willison described the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">The Lethal Trifecta</a> for AI agents: an agent that combines access to your private data, exposure to untrusted content, and a way to externally communicate (“exfiltration”). That “untrusted content” can come in all sorts of ways, ask it to read a web page, and an attacker can easily put instructions on the website in 1pt white-on-white font to trick the gullible LLM to obtain that private data.</p>

<p>This is particularly serious when it comes to agents acting in a browser. Read an attacker’s web page, and it could trick the agent to go to your bank account in another tab and “buy you a present” by transferring your balance to the kind attacker. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/">Willison’s view</a> is that “the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely”.</p>

<h2>The wave of CLI Coding Agents</h2>

<p>If you have tried Claude Code, Gemini Code, Open Code or Simon
      Willison’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">LLM CLI</a>, you’ve experienced something fundamentally
      different from ChatGPT or Github Copilot. These aren’t just chatbots or
      autocomplete tools - they’re agents that can read your code, run your
      tests, search docs and make changes to your codebase async.</p>

<p>But how do they work? For me the best way to understand how any tool
      works is to try and build it myself. So that’s exactly what we did, and in
      this article I’ll take you through how we built our own CLI Coding Agent
      using the Pydantic-AI framework and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
      You’ll see not just how to assemble the pieces but why each capability
      matters and how it changes the way you can work with code.</p>

<p>Our implementation leverages AWS Bedrock but with Pydantic-AI you could
      easily use any other mainstream provider or even a fully local LLM.</p>
</section>

<section id="WhyBuildWhenYouCanBuy">
<h2>Why Build When You Can Buy?</h2>

<p>Before diving into the technical implementation, let's examine why we
      chose to build our own solution.</p>

<p>The answer became clear very quickly using our custom agent, while
      commercial tools are impressive, they’re built for general use cases. Our
      agent was fully customised to our internal context and all the little
      eccentricities of our specific project. More importantly, building it gave
      us insights into how these systems work and the quality of our own GenAI
      Platform and Dev Tooling.</p>

<p>Think of it like learning to cook. You can eat at restaurants forever
      but understanding how flavours combine and techniques work makes you
      appreciate food differently - and lets you create exactly what you
      want.</p>
</section>

<section id="TheArchitectureOfOurDevelopmentAgent">
<h2>The Architecture of Our Development Agent</h2>

<p>At a high level, our coding assistant consists of several key
      components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Core AI Model: Claude from Anthropic accessed through AWS Bedrock </li>

<li>Pydantic-AI Framework: provides the agent framework and many helpful
        utilities to make our Agent more useful immediately </li>

<li>MCP Servers: independent processes that give the agent specialised
        tools, MCP is a common standard for defining the servers that contain these
        tools. </li>

<li>CLI Interface: how users interact with the assistant</li>
</ul>

<p>The magic happens through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which
      allows the AI model to use various tools through a standardized interface.
      This architecture makes our assistant highly extensible - we can easily
      add new capabilities by implementing additional MCP servers, but we’re
      getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
</section>

<section id="StartingSimpleTheFoundation">
<h2>Starting Simple: The Foundation</h2>

<p>We started by creating a basic project structure and installing the
      necessary dependencies:</p>

<pre>uv init
uv add pydantic_ai
uv add boto3
</pre>

<p>Our primary dependencies include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pydantic-ai</code>: Framework for building AI agents</li>

<li><code>boto3</code>: For AWS API interactions</li>
</ul>

<p>We chose Claude Sonnet 4 from Anthropic (accessed via AWS Bedrock) as
      our foundation model due to its strong code understanding and generation
      capabilities. Here's how we configured it in our <code>main.py</code>:</p>

<pre>import boto3
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock import BedrockProvider
</pre>

<pre>bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig(
    read_timeout=300,
    connect_timeout=60,
    retries={"max_attempts": 3},
)
bedrock_client = boto3.client(
    "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config
)
model = BedrockConverseModel(
    "eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0",
    provider=BedrockProvider(bedrock_client=bedrock_client),
)
agent = Agent(
    model=model,
)
</pre>

<pre>if __name__ == "__main__":
  agent.to_cli_sync()
</pre>

<p>At this stage we already have a fully working CLI with a chat interface
      which we can use as you would a GUI chat interface, which is pretty cool
      for how little code this is! However we can definitely improve upon
      this.</p>
</section>

<section id="FirstCapabilityTesting">
<h2>First Capability: Testing!</h2>

<p>Instead of running the tests ourselves after each coding iteration why
      not get the agent to do it? Seems simple right?</p>

<pre>import subprocess
</pre>

<pre>@agent.tool_plain()
def run_unit_tests() -&gt; str:
    """Run unit tests using uv."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["uv", "run", "pytest", "-xvs", "tests/"], capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    return result.stdout
</pre>

<p>Here we use the same pytest command you would run in the terminal (I’ve
      shortened ours for the article). Now something magical happened. I could
      say “X isn’t working” and the agent would:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Run the test suite</li>

<li>2. Identify which specific tests were failing</li>

<li>3. Analyze the error messages</li>

<li>4. Suggest targeted fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> Instead of staring at test failures or copy
      pasting terminal outputs into ChatGPT we now give our agent super relevant
      context about any issues in our codebase.</p>

<p>However we noticed our agent sometimes “fixed” failing tests by
      suggesting changes to the tests, not the actual implementation. This led
      to our next addition.</p>
</section>

<section id="AddingIntelligenceInstructionsAndIntent">
<h2>Adding Intelligence: Instructions and intent</h2>

<p>We realised we needed to teach our agent a little more about our
      development philosophy and steer it away from bad behaviours.</p>

<pre>instructions = """
You are a specialised agent for maintaining and developing the XXXXXX codebase.

## Development Guidelines:

1. **Test Failures:**
   - When tests fail, fix the implementation first, not the tests
   - Tests represent expected behavior; implementation should conform to tests
   - Only modify tests if they clearly don't match specifications

2. **Code Changes:**
   - Make the smallest possible changes to fix issues
   - Focus on fixing the specific problem rather than rewriting large portions
   - Add unit tests for all new functionality before implementing it

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Keep functions small with a single responsibility
   - Implement proper error handling with appropriate exceptions
   - Be mindful of configuration dependencies in tests

Remember to examine test failure messages carefully to understand the root cause before making any changes.
"""
</pre>

<pre>agent = Agent(
instructions=instructions,
model=model,
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> The agent now understands our values around
      Test Driven Development and minimal changes. It stopped suggesting large
      refactors where a small fix would do (Mostly).</p>

<p>Now while we could continue building everything from absolute scratch
      and tweaking our prompts for days we want to go fast and use some tools
      other people have built - Enter Model Context Protocol (MCP).</p>
</section>

<section id="TheMcpRevolutionPluggableCapabilities">
<h2>The MCP Revolution: Pluggable Capabilities</h2>

<p>This is where our agent transformed from a helpful assistant to
      something approaching the commercial CLI agents. The Model Context
      Protocol (MCP) allows us to add sophisticated capabilities by running
      specialized servers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide
        context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.
        Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to
        various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to
        connect AI models to different data sources and tools. </p>

<p>-- <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">MCP Introduction</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can run these servers as a local process, so no data sharing, where
      we interact with STDIN/STDOUT to keep things simple and local. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/function-call-LLM.html">(More details on tools and MCP)</a></p>
</section>

<section id="SandboxedPythonExecution">
<h2>Sandboxed Python Execution</h2>

<p>Using large language models to do calculations or executing arbitrary code they create is not effective and potentially very dangerous! To make our Agent more accurate and safe our first MCP addition was Pydantic Al’s default server for sandboxed Python code execution:</p>

<pre>run_python = MCPServerStdio(
    "deno",
    args=[
        "run",
        "-N",
        "-R=node_modules",
        "-W=node_modules",
        "--node-modules-dir=auto",
        "jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python",
        "stdio",
    ],
)
</pre>

<pre>agent = Agent(
    ...
    mcp_servers=[
        run_python
    ],
)
</pre>

<p>This gave our agent a sandbox where it could test ideas, prototype
      solutions, and verify its own suggestions.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is very different from running the tests where we need the
      local environment and is intended to be used to make calculations much
      more robust. This is because writing the code to output a number and then
      executing that code is much more reliable and understandable, scalable and
      repeatable than just generating the next token in a calculation. We have
      seen from frontier labs (including their leaked instructions) that this is
      a much better approach.</p>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> Doing calculations, even more complex ones,
      became significantly more reliable. This is useful for many things like
      dates, sums, counts etc. It also allows for a rapid iteration cycle of
      simple python code.</p>
</section>

<section id="Up-to-dateLibraryDocumentation">
<h2>Up-to-Date library Documentation</h2>

<p>LLMs are mostly trained in batch on historical data this gives a fixed
      cutoff while languages and dependencies continue to change and improve so
      we added <a href="https://context7.com/">Context7</a> for access to up to date python
      library documentation in LLM consumable format:</p>

<pre>context7 = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx", args=["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"], tool_prefix="context"
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> When working with newer libraries or trying to
      use advanced features, the agent could look up current documentation
      rather than relying on potentially outdated training data. This made it
      much more reliable for real-world development work.</p>
</section>

<section id="AwsMcps">
<h2>AWS MCPs</h2>

<p>Since this particular agent was built with an AWS platform in mind, we
      added the AWS Labs MCP servers for comprehensive cloud docs and
      integration:</p>

<pre>awslabs = MCPServerStdio(
    command="uvx",
    args=["awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest"],
    env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"},
    tool_prefix="awslabs",
)
aws_docs = MCPServerStdio(
    command="uvx",
    args=["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
    env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR", "AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION": "aws"},
    tool_prefix="aws_docs",
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> Now when I mentioned “Bedrock is timing out”
      or “the model responses are getting truncated,” the agent could directly
      access AWS documentation to help troubleshoot configuration issues. While
      we've only scratched the surface with these two servers, this is the tip
      of the iceberg—the <a href="https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/">AWS Labs MCP
      collection</a> includes servers for
      CloudWatch metrics, Lambda debugging, IAM policy analysis, and much more.
      Even with just documentation access, cloud debugging became more
      conversational and contextual.</p>
</section>

<section id="InternetSearchForCurrentInformation">
<h2>Internet Search for Current Information</h2>

<p>Sometimes you need information that's not in any documentation—recent
      Stack Overflow discussions, GitHub issues, or the latest best practices.
      We added general internet search:</p>

<pre>internet_search = MCPServerStdio(command="uvx", args=["duckduckgo-mcp-server"])
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> When encountering obscure errors or needing to
      understand recent changes in the ecosystem, the agent could search for
      current discussions and solutions. This was particularly valuable for
      debugging deployment issues or understanding breaking changes in
      dependencies.</p>
</section>

<section id="StructuredProblemSolving">
<h2>Structured Problem Solving</h2>

<p>One of the most valuable additions was the code reasoning MCP, which
      helps the agent think through complex problems systematically:</p>

<pre>code_reasoning = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@mettamatt/code-reasoning"],
    tool_prefix="code_reasoning",
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> Instead of jumping to solutions, the agent
      would break down complex problems into logical steps, explore alternative
      approaches, and explain its reasoning. This was invaluable for
      architectural decisions and debugging complex issues. I could ask “Why is
      this API call failing intermittently?” and get a structured analysis of
      potential causes rather than just guesses.</p>
</section>

<section id="OptimisingForReasoning">
<h2>Optimising for Reasoning</h2>

<p>As we added more sophisticated capabilities, we noticed that reasoning
      and analysis tasks often took much longer than regular text
      generation—especially when the output wasn't correctly formatted on the
      first try. We adjusted our Bedrock configuration to be more patient:</p>

<pre>bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig(
    read_timeout=300,
    connect_timeout=60,
    retries={"max_attempts": 3},
)
bedrock_client = boto3.client(
    "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> The longer timeouts meant our agent could work
      through complex problems without timing out. When analyzing large
      codebases or reasoning through intricate architectural decisions, the
      agent could take the time needed to provide thorough, well-reasoned
      responses rather than rushing to incomplete solutions.</p>
</section>

<section id="DesktopCommanderWarningWithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility">
<h2>Desktop Commander: Warning! With great power comes great responsibility!</h2>

<p>At this point, our agent was already quite capable—it could reason
      through problems, execute code, search for information, and access AWS
      documentation. This MCP server transforms your agent from a helpful
      assistant into something that can actually <i>do</i> things in your development
      environment:</p>

<pre>desktop_commander = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"],
    tool_prefix="desktop_commander",
)
</pre>

<p>Desktop Commander provides an incredibly comprehensive toolkit: file
      system operations (read, write, search), terminal command execution with
      process management, surgical code editing with <code>edit_block</code>, and even
      interactive REPL sessions. It's built on top of the MCP Filesystem Server
      but adds crucial capabilities like search-and-replace editing and
      intelligent process control.</p>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> This is where everything came together. I
      could now say “The authentication tests are failing, please fix the issue”
      and the agent would:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Run the test suite to see the specific failures</li>

<li>2. Read the failing test files to understand what was expected</li>

<li>3. Examine the authentication module code</li>

<li>4. Search the codebase for related patterns</li>

<li>5. Look up the documentation for the relevant library</li>

<li>6. Make edits to fix the implementation</li>

<li>7. Re-run the tests to verify the fix</li>

<li>8. Search for similar patterns elsewhere that might need updating</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this happened in a single conversation thread, with the agent
      maintaining context throughout. It wasn't just generating code
      suggestions—it was actively debugging, editing, and verifying fixes like a
      pair programming partner.</p>

<p>The security model is thoughtful too, with configurable allowed
      directories, blocked commands, and proper permission boundaries. You can
      learn more about its extensive capabilities at the <a href="https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP">Desktop Commander
      documentation</a>.</p>

<p>How it changes our workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debugging becomes collaborative: you have an intelligent partner
        that can analyze error messages, suggest hypotheses, and help test
        solutions.</li>

<li>Learning accelerates: when working with unfamiliar libraries or
        patterns, the agent can explain existing code, suggest improvements, and
        teach you why certain approaches work better.</li>

<li>Context switching reduces: rather than jumping between
        documentation, Stack Overflow, AWS Console, and your IDE, you have a
        single interface that can access all these resources while maintaining
        context about your specific problem.</li>

<li>Problem-solving becomes structured: rather than jumping to
        solutions, the agent can break down complex issues into logical steps,
        explore alternatives, and explain its reasoning. Like having a real life talking rubber duck!</li>

<li>Code review improves: the agent can review your changes, spot
        potential issues, and suggest improvements before you commit—like having a
        senior developer looking over your shoulder.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="WhatWeLearnedAboutCliAgents">
<h2>What We Learned About CLI Agents</h2>

<p>Building our own agent revealed several insights about this emerging
      paradigm:</p>

<ul>
<li>MCP is (almost) all you need: the magic isn't in any single
        capability, but in how they work together. The agent that can run tests,
        read files, search documentation, execute code, access AWS services, and
        reason through problems systematically becomes qualitatively different
        from one that can only do any single task.</li>

<li>Current information is crucial: having access to real-time search
        and up-to-date documentation makes the agent much more reliable for
        real-world development work where training data might be outdated.</li>

<li>Structured thinking matters: the code reasoning capability
        transforms the agent from a clever autocomplete into a thinking partner
        that can break down complex problems and explore alternative
        solutions.</li>

<li>Context is king: commercial agents like Claude Code are impressive
        partly because they maintain context across all these different tools.
        Your agent needs to remember what it learned from the test run when it's
        making file changes.</li>

<li>Specialisation matters: our agent works better for our specific
        codebase than general-purpose tools because it understands our patterns,
        conventions, and tool preferences. If it falls short in any area then we
        can go and make the required changes.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="TheRoadAhead">
<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>The CLI agent paradigm is still evolving rapidly. Some areas we're
      exploring:</p>

<ul>
<li>AWS-specific tooling: the AWS Labs MCP servers
        (https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/) provide incredible depth for cloud-native
        development—from CloudWatch metrics to Lambda debugging to IAM policy
        analysis.</li>

<li>Workflow Enhancements: teaching the agent our common development
        workflows so it can handle routine tasks end-to-end. Connecting the agent
        to our project management tools so it can understand priorities and
        coordinate with team processes.</li>

<li>Benchmarking: <a href="https://www.tbench.ai/">Terminal Bench</a>
        looks like a great dataset and leaderboard to test this toy agent against
        the big boys!</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="WhyThisMatters">
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>CLI coding agents represent a fundamental
      shift from AI as a writing assistant to AI as a development partner.
      Unlike Copilot's autocomplete or ChatGPT's Q&amp;A, these agents can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand your entire project context</li>

<li>Execute tasks across multiple tools</li>

<li>Maintain state across complex workflows</li>

<li>Learn from your specific codebase and patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>Building one yourself—even a simple version—gives you insights into
      where this technology is heading and how to make the most of commercial
      tools when they arrive.</p>

<p>The future of software development isn't just about writing code
      faster. It's about having an intelligent partner that understands your
      goals, your constraints, and your codebase well enough to help you think
      through problems and implement solutions collaboratively.</p>

<p>And the best way to understand that future? Build it yourself.</p>

              <p>GPS coordinates aren’t exact.
                They’re noisy. They’re approximate. They’re probabilistic.
                That <code>horizontal<wbr>Accuracy</code> property tucked away in your <code>CLLocation</code> object
              is trying to tell you something important:
              you’re <em>probably</em> within that radius.
              <em>Probably.</em></p>
            <p>A <code>Bool</code>, meanwhile, can be only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
              That <code>if</code> statement needs to make a choice one way or another,
              but code like this doesn’t capture the uncertainty of the situation.
              If truth is light,
              then current programming models collapse the wavefunction too early.</p>
            <h2>
              Picking the Right Abstraction</h2>
            <p>In 2014, researchers at the University of Washington and Microsoft Research
              proposed a radical idea:
              What if uncertainty were encoded directly into the type system?
              Their paper,
              <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/uncertaint-a-first-order-type-for-uncertain-data-2/">Uncertain&lt;T&gt;: A First-Order Type for Uncertain Data</a></em>
              introduced a probabilistic programming approach that’s both
              mathematically rigorous and surprisingly practical.</p>
            
            <p>As you’d expect for something from Microsoft in the 2010s,
              the paper is implemented in C#.
              But the concepts translate beautifully to Swift.</p>

            <p>When you compare two <code>Uncertain</code> values,
              you don’t get a definitive <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.

            Replace your distance calculations with uncertain versions.
            Measure the impact.</p>
          <p>Remember:
            the goal isn’t to eliminate uncertainty —
            it’s to acknowledge that it exists and handle it gracefully.
            Because in the real world,
            nothing is certain except uncertainty itself.</p>
          <p>And perhaps,
            with better tools,
            we can finally stop pretending otherwise.</p>

<div><p>Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s).</p><p>- First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship.</p><p>- Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer.</p><p>Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups.</p><p>Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator (<a href="https://github.com/OperatorFoundation" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/OperatorFoundation</a>). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case.</p><p>In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols.</p><p>- The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term.</p><p>I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055852"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055852" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055852&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Thank you very much for a detailed answer. Might I rudely ask -- as you're knowledgeable in this space, what do you think of Mullvad's DAITA, which specifically aims to defeat traffic analysis by moving to a more pulsed constant bandwidth model?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055940"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055940" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055940&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>DAITA was introduced after my time in the industry, but this isn't a new idea (though as far as I know, it's the first time this kind of thing's been commercialized).</p><p>It's clever. It tries to defeat attacks against one of the tougher parts of VPN connections to reliably obfuscate, and the effort's commendable, but I'll stop short of saying it's a good solution for one big reason: with VPNs and censorship circumvention, the data often speaks for itself.</p><p>A VPN provider working in this space will often have aggregate (and obviously anonymized, if they're working in good faith) stats about success rates and failure classes encountered from clients connecting to their nodes. Where I worked, we didn't publish this information. I'm not sure where Mullvad stands on this right now.</p><p>In any case -- some VPN providers deploying new technology like this will partner with the research community (because there's a small, but passionate formal research community in this space!) and publish papers, studies, and other digests of their findings. Keep an eye out for this sort of stuff. UMD's Breakerspace in the US in particular had some extremely clever people working on this stuff when I was involved in the industry.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055945"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055945" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055945&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Classes began this week for students at the University at Buffalo, a public research university in western New York, but there were about 750 fewer international students on campus than expected.</p><p>The new students who did make it gathered for a welcome from the school's dean of students. "We know you have had to overcome hurdles to be here – especially this summer, with visas," Tomás Aguirre told the assembled students, representing more than 100 countries. "And I just wanted you to know that we are so glad you were able to make it."</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/g-s1-73572">NPR</a></p><hr><p>The sentiment was common among the students, too. "For me, the main thing is that I got here," says Daria Tofan, a freshman from Romania, who didn't get her student visa until about a week before orientation. "It was awful."</p><p>Over the last six months the Trump Administration has clamped down on international student visas, <a href="https://text.npr.org/2025/05/28/g-s1-69282/us-stops-visas-foreign-students" target="_blank">temporarily pausing</a> and then revamping the student visa interview process and bringing more scrutiny to the vetting system. That led to long delays and meant many accepted students couldn't get appointments at embassies or consulates in time for the start of the fall semester.</p><p>"I only had one goal from the beginning, it was to go to college here, so if I didn't reach that goal it would have been very painful," explains Shivaka Sing, a freshman psychology major from New Delhi. When she got accepted to Buffalo she joined a group chat of other students from India. Many of them couldn't get a visa appointment in time to start the fall semester with her. "Most of them are now transferring to the U.K. because of the visa situation," she says. "Some are planning to defer to the spring semester."</p><h3><strong>Fewer International students on campuses across the country this fall</strong></h3><p>At the University at Buffalo, the overall decline of about 15% of international students is happening mostly in graduate programs, especially in the STEM fields. But it's not just Buffalo. Universities all over the country are experiencing similar drops. Arizona State University <a href="https://news.asu.edu/20250813-sun-devil-community-asu-welcomes-14600-international-students-fall" target="_blank">reported a fall semester decline</a> for the <a href="https://www.kjzz.org/education/2025-08-17/international-student-enrollment-at-asu-drops-following-recent-federal-visa-guidance-changes" target="_blank">first time since 2020</a>. Declines have been announced at<a href="https://www.keranews.org/education/2025-08-19/texas-universities-international-student-enrollment" target="_blank"> universities in Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epKKY5l1-jM" target="_blank">Missouri</a> and <a href="https://www.wglt.org/local-news/2025-08-04/isu-iwu-and-hcc-international-student-enrollment-is-down-following-national-trend" target="_blank">Illinois</a>. The <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/08/26/massachusetts-international-students-customs-trump-administration" target="_blank">state of Massachusetts</a> is expecting about 10,000 fewer new international students this year.</p><p>"One would describe the situation with international students to be very much in flux with tremendous levels of uncertainty," says Fanta Aw, who leads the Association of International Educators, or NAFSA.</p><p>Last year more than a million international students studied in the U.S., contributing about $43 billion into the U.S. economy. But Aw's organization <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/about/about-nafsa/us-economy-could-suffer-7-billion-loss-precipitous-drop-international-students" target="_blank">predicts a drop of about 150,000</a> new international students this fall, leading to a decline of about 15% overall. If that happens, local economies could lose as much as $7 billion in spending and more than 60,000 jobs.</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5415740">NPR</a></p><hr><p>"The loss of international students will lead to a significant downturn in innovation," Aw says. "This will affect communities large and small."</p><p>The decline is also happening at a time when other countries, like the U.K. and South Korea have stepped up to fill the gap.</p><h3><strong>Mixed messages from federal government on student visas&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>President Trump has said he wants to keep campus safe. The State Department has revoked <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93vznxd07o" target="_blank">about 6,000 student visas</a> so far this year, citing threats of academic espionage, support for terrorist groups in Gaza and criminal behavior.</p><p>And in May, the State Department said it would <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/new-visa-policies-put-america-first-not-china" target="_blank">"aggressively revoke"</a> visas for Chinese students and add additional scrutiny for future visa applications from China.</p><p>But in recent days Trump has signaled a shift. This week, Trump told reporters he planned to double the amount of Chinese students studying in the U.S. He defended those comments a day later, saying "I like that their [China] students come here.

        <h3>Transcript</h3>
        <p>LEILA FADEL, HOST: </p><p> International students are arriving on American college campuses.</p><p>DARIA TOFAN: Hi. I'm Daria (ph). I'm a first-year international student, and I'm from Romania.</p><p>PRIYOTA NADH: Priyota Nadh (ph), and I'm from Bangladesh.</p><p>FRANCOIS HUMPHRIES: My name's Francois Humphries (ph). I'm from South Africa.</p><p>SHIVIKA SINGH: My name is Shivika (ph), and I'm from India.</p><p>FADEL: Those students made it to school in Buffalo, New York, after a rocky summer, when the Trump administration temporarily paused and then revamped student visa interviews. NPR's Elissa Nadworny reports from Buffalo.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome. We're so excited that you're here on campus.</p><p>ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: At orientation at the University at Buffalo, a public research university in western New York, newly arrived international students are getting their campus IDs...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: So just smile. I'm going to take it on three. One, two, three.</p><p>NADWORNY: ...And feeling relieved they made it to campus.</p><p>TOFAN: At least we're here. For me, the main thing is that I got here.</p><p>NADWORNY: Daria Tofan (ph) from Romania didn't get her student visa until a week before orientation.</p><p>TOFAN: To get scheduled for classes, you need to provide the immigration documents. So if you don't have the visa stamp, you're basically behind everything.</p><p>NADWORNY: Over the last six months, the Trump administration has clamped down on international student visas. That's created lots of delays and anxiety for accepted students.</p><p>SINGH: I only had one goal from the beginning. It was to go to college here. So if I didn't reach that goal, it would've been very painful.</p><p>NADWORNY: Shivika Singh (ph) is from New Delhi, starting as a freshman at UB to study psychology. When she first got accepted to Buffalo, she joined a group chat of other students from India. Many of them couldn't get a visa appointment in time.</p><p>SINGH: Most of them are now transferring to U.K. because of the visa situation, but some are still waiting for the spring semester.</p><p>SCOTT WEBER: Clearly, this year we're having more deferrals. They haven't been able to get appointments for the most part.</p><p>NADWORNY: Scott Weber is the provost at the University at Buffalo. The university is expecting a decline of about 750 international students this fall, many in graduate programs, especially in the STEM fields.</p><p>FANTA AW: The loss of international students will lead to really a significant downturn in innovation.</p><p>NADWORNY: Fanta Aw leads the Association of International Educators. She says universities all over the country are expecting similar drops. Last year, more than a million international students studied in the U.S. But Aw's organization estimates a decline of about 15% overall this fall.</p><p>AW: This will affect communities large and small.</p><p>NADWORNY: Other countries like Canada, the U.K. and South Korea have stepped up to fill the gap. President Trump has said he wants to keep campuses safe, citing threats of academic espionage, support for terrorist groups in Gaza and criminal behavior - all without much evidence. He's also accused international students of taking university spots that could go to American citizens. Provost Scott Weber says there's room for everyone at his university.</p><p>WEBER: I would assure you that our international students do not take spots, you know, for other students who are qualified to attend and would be successful here.</p><p>NADWORNY: Enrollment is actually up at the university overall, and there are still about 4,000 international students on campus this year.</p><p>WEBER: What they bring to the university is this incredibly rich, diverse cultural experience for students who may not have ever been outside of New York state.</p><p>NADWORNY: For the lucky ones, like Shivika Singh from New Delhi, now it's time to focus on being a college student.</p><p>What's the most exciting thing you bought for your dorm?</p><p>SINGH: I bought a pink "Lilo &amp; Stitch" soft toy (laughter).</p><p>NADWORNY: A toy?</p><p>SINGH: (Laughter) Yeah.</p><p>NADWORNY: To sleep with?</p><p>SINGH: Yeah. There are, like, three soft toys on my bed.</p><p>NADWORNY: She says those stuffed animals are the key to warding off home sickness that comes from being 7,000 miles from home.</p><p>Elissa Nadworny, NPR News, Buffalo, New York.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-chain-name="c0fUbP76WXURanD" data-gtm-name="Article Body" id="c0fUbP76WXURanD"><article><p>“The generator is down, and we don’t have enough ice to continue icing the remains of soldiers killed in action. How much longer, ma’am?”</p><p>That’s the message I received while deployed to Balad, Iraq, as an Air Force second lieutenant. I was overseeing generators in theater, and the one powering the mortuary facility had failed. The clock was ticking. I didn’t have HVAC expertise or the necessary parts. The only viable backup generator was on the other side of the country.</p><p>I had two choices: initiate a long contracting process to hire a civilian technician, or send a convoy across Iraq for the backup unit — risking lives to get it there. We chose the convoy. We got lucky.</p><p>But what if we hadn’t?</p><p>That question — what if — has stuck with me. Because this wasn’t a theoretical delay. This was a real moment where a failure in repair readiness jeopardized our ability to care for the fallen with dignity and speed. And I know it wasn’t the only one.</p><p>That’s why I support the right to repair.</p><p>I’ve lived what it means when a piece of equipment fails at a critical time. I know how far away contractors can be when you need them most. And I know what our service members are capable of — if we trust them with the tools and training to do the job.</p><p>Military right to repair means giving service members the ability to fix their own gear — on base, in the field or downrange — without having to wait on outside contractors. That includes access to the tools, parts and manuals they need to do the job. Right now, private companies can put restrictions on military equipment that block troops from making even basic repairs. That slows everything down, costs taxpayers more, and in the worst cases, puts lives at risk.</p><p>This year, Congress has a chance to change that.</p><p>Thanks to a growing, bipartisan push — including new legislation led by Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont. — right-to-repair reforms are being considered in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). These two senators, from opposite parties, have made it clear: The Pentagon is wasting billions, and service members are bearing the cost.</p><p>Including the Warrior Right to Repair Act in the NDAA is a critical step forward for readiness, national security and the safety of warfighters downrange, and it’s taxpayer friendly. </p><p>Mission readiness depends on the ability to make repairs in the field. Service members need the tools, parts and authority to make immediate fixes themselves, without having to navigate red tape.</p><p>When our military relies too heavily on private contractors for basic maintenance, that dependence gives outside companies leverage over military operations, introducing profit motives into urgent repair decisions. Our armed forces should operate on military timelines — not corporate maintenance schedules.</p><p>Warfighter safety is directly tied to the reliability of our gear. In high-risk environments, a delay in repairing a critical piece of equipment can mean the difference between life and death. </p><p>Right to repair is smart, responsible fiscal policy. Sustainment costs can represent <a href="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/right-to-repair-for-the-pentagon-to-dos-for-right-now" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/right-to-repair-for-the-pentagon-to-dos-for-right-now">up to 70% of a weapons system’s lifetime expense</a>. When troops are blocked from doing basic repairs, costs increase and transparency disappears. That’s a waste of taxpayer dollars. </p><p>Finally, repairing our own equipment is critical to inculcating and maintaining a military culture of adaptability and self-reliance. We train service members to be problem solvers. Empowering them to repair their own gear isn’t just smart policy — it reflects the values we instill in every recruit. Right to repair honors that ethos and ensures we treat service members like professionals, not passive end-users.</p><p>We wouldn’t tell a Marine they can’t clean their rifle without a manufacturer present. So why are we telling our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines they can’t fix a comms system or power supply?</p><p>I’m grateful that, in that moment in Iraq, we had a backup option — even if it meant launching a risky cross-country convoy. But what if we hadn’t? What if that second generator didn’t exist or wasn’t reachable in time? Without immediate repair options, the remains of our fallen could have become unrecognizable. The families who entrusted us with their loved ones would have suffered consequences that no one should have to imagine.</p><p>That’s what’s at stake when service members can’t repair the equipment they rely on. It’s not just about saving money or avoiding delays — it’s about honoring our dead, protecting the living and giving our troops the flexibility they need to do the right thing when it counts. Right to repair is about readiness. It’s about humanity. And it’s long overdue. </p><p>That’s why I’m calling on Congress — and especially House Armed Services Committee leaders like Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers — to include military right-to-repair provisions in this year’s NDAA by supporting the bipartisan Warrior Right to Repair Act.</p><p><i>Retired Lt. Col.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>The thing that surprised me most about traveling to China back in 2019 was how </span><em>quiet</em><span> it was. I expected chaos, noise, pollution—all the stuff you associate with a developing country. Instead, I found electric bikes gliding silently through tree-lined streets. We lived there for five months until COVID hit.</span></p><p>About a week ago, I went back to visit Yunnan. Walking through the ancient towns another reality hit me: China doesn't need us anymore. These towns were packed with only Chinese tourists, I counted maybe ten Westerners the whole week. No Starbucks, no McDonald's, no Western chains at all. Just tea shops selling pu'er, silver ornaments, wooden objects, ceramics, dried mushrooms, and flower cakes. China has built its own enormous internal market—its own tourism, its own brands, its own everything. They've turned inward not from isolation but from self-sufficiency.</p><p>It's wild how many people still think of China as the place that makes cheap crap. This perception is frozen somewhere in the 2000s. Japan went through the same arc. "Made in Japan" meant low quality in the 50s, then it meant the best electronics in the world by the 70s. But China's transformation happened even faster. In roughly a decade, they went from knockoff smartphones to homegrown EVs that compete head-to-head with Tesla.</p><p>The numbers are insane. By purchasing-power parity (PPP), China has been the world’s largest economy since the mid-2010s, responsible for roughly a fifth of global output. Chinese labs and firms now lead in the majority of frontier technologies. And in manufacturing, China’s output is larger than the US and EU combined. Yet somehow we still talk about China like it’s “emerging.” Crazy.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1125241,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://apropos.substack.com/i/171432290?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Shanghai in 2019</figcaption></figure></div><p>In rural Yunnan, I saw this ancient tractor with no hood—engine completely exposed—passing by a swarm of electric motorcycles. That image captures the development curve here: steep and fast.</p><p>Take banking. The US went from cash to checks to credit cards to using Venmo a lot. China went straight from cash to mobile payments. They had limited credit card infrastructure, so when Alipay and WeChat showed up, boom—an instant cashless society. Now about a billion Chinese pay with a scan.</p><p>Or look at energy. The West spent 150 years building coal plants, then natural gas, then slowly adding renewables. China went from burning coal directly to becoming the world's solar panel factory. They make 80% of all solar panels globally.</p><p>Transportation? California approved high-speed rail in 2008 to link LA and San Francisco for $33 billion. Costs ballooned; there’s still no service. The U.K. canceled HS2’s northern leg after years of overruns. Berlin’s new airport opened almost a decade late and billions over budget. Meanwhile, China built 40,000 kilometers of high-speed rail that runs at 350 km/h. </p><p>Retail? The US built 23 million square feet of retail space per capita—ten times more than Europe—most of it in strip malls and big boxes surrounded by parking lots. Then Americans slowly moved online, with Amazon taking 20 years to capture 10% of retail. China skipped the strip mall phase entirely. They went straight from street markets to super-apps that livestream shopping, where one influencer can sell $15 million worth of lipstick in five minutes. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg" width="698" height="930.5068681318681" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:698,&quot;bytes&quot;:3602477,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://apropos.substack.com/i/171432290?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>It’s this or electric cars, no in-between.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I imagine a Chinese family and there’s three completely different Chinas. One was about survival, the second aspiration, and the final one about prosperity.</p><p><strong>The grandmother, 75 years old (born 1950):</strong><span> She represents Mao's China, a world of scarcity and ideology. She was eight during the Great Leap Forward, when famines killed 30 million people. Her village had no electricity until she was twenty.  Her entire childhood was about collective farms, struggle sessions, and Red Guards. The state controlled everything—where you lived, what you ate, who you married. </span></p><p><strong>The father, 45 years old (born 1980):</strong><span> He represents Deng's China, when the country opened up and looked outward for models. He was born two years after Deng Xiaoping said "to get rich is glorious" and launched the reform era. His childhood coincided with China becoming the world's factory floor. Germany's exports to China surged from 52 billion euros in 2009 to 123 billion euros in 2021. This guy's first job in 1998 might have been at one of these German factories. His generation witnessed China join the WTO in 2001, Beijing hosting the Olympics in 2008, and becoming the world's second-largest economy in 2010.</span></p><p><strong>The teenager, 15 years old (born 2010):</strong><span> She represents Xi's China, technologically advanced and confident. Born the year China overtook Japan economically. Has never known a China that wasn't a superpower. She boards high-speed trains with facial recognition, uses apps the West doesn’t have, and has never written a check. Her China isn’t catching up to anyone.</span></p><p>That's three completely different universes of experience in one family, sitting around the same dinner table: from famine to facial recognition in 75 years.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apropos.substack.com/p/china-is-eating-the-world?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://apropos.substack.com/p/china-is-eating-the-world?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>China now leads in renewable—without the discourse</span><strong>.</strong><span> Solar panels? 80% Chinese-made. Wind turbines and EV batteries? 60% and 75% Chinese-made. Heat pumps? China is the main manufacturer and exporter. We’re going to solve climate change with a lot of Chinese technology—or we’re not going to solve it at all. (Who tells Greta Thunberg?)</span></p><p>The Global South is voting with its money. The Belt and Road now counts roughly 150 partner countries. Developing nations want material infrastructure, and China delivers: ports, railways, power plants.</p><p>Tech is splitting. There’s a Chinese internet (WeChat, Alipay, Douyin, Baidu) serving 1.4 billion people—and there’s everyone else. They don’t need Google.</p><p>Supply chains can’t function without China. Every single attempt to "decouple" fails. China doesn't just assemble your iPhone. They mine the rare earths, refine the materials, make the components, build the machines that build the machines. </p><p>Democracy stopped being inevitable. Singapore, Dubai, Rwanda—they're all copying the Chinese model: authoritarian capitalism with good PR. Deliver growth, maintain order, forget the voting.

Their infrastructure works. Extreme poverty collapsed. Life expectancy increased by 10 years.

That free markets require free politics. That our system was the "end of history." </p><p>But China proved you can pair authoritarian politics with a market economy. It offers a bargain we thought impossible: prosperity without freedom, development without democracy, safety without expansive civil liberties. And for the billions of people who remember being hungry, who want their kids to have better lives, who care more about rising wages than free speech—it's getting harder to argue they're wrong.</p><p>This worries me.

for production workloads. By reading this post you agree to never implement
or use this accursed abomination. This article is released to the public for
educational reasons. Please do not attempt to recreate any of the absurd
acts referenced here.</p></div></div>
<p>You may think that the world is in a state of relative peace. Things
look like they are somewhat stable, but reality couldn't be farther
from the truth. There is an enemy out there that transcends time,
space, logic, reason, and lemon-scented moist towelettes. That enemy
is a scourge of cloud costs that is likely the single reason why
startups die from their cloud bills when they are so young.</p>
<p>The enemy is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-managed-nat-network-address-translation-gateway-for-aws/">Managed NAT
Gateway</a>.
It is a service that lets you egress traffic from a VPC to the public
internet at $0.07 per gigabyte. This is something that is probably
literally free for them to run but ends up getting a huge chunk of
their customer's cloud spend. Customers don't even look too deep into
this because they just shrug it off as the cost of doing business.</p>
<p>This one service has allowed companies like <a href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/">the duckbill
group</a> to make <em>millions</em> by showing
companies how to not spend as much on the cloud.</p>
<p>However, I think I can do one better. What if there was a <em>better</em> way
for your own services? What if there was a way you could reduce that
cost for your own services by up to 700%? What if you could bypass
those pesky network egress costs yet still contact your machines over
normal IP packets?</p>

egress-heavy workloads (such as webhooks that need to come from a common IP
address), you should be using a <a href="https://www.tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/">exit

address attached to it. If you also attach this node to the same VPC as your
webhook egress nodes, you can basically recreate Managed NAT Gateway at home.
You also get the added benefit of encrypting your traffic further on the wire.
This is the only thing in this article that you can safely copy into your
production workloads.</p></div></div>
<h2>Base facts</h2>
<p>Before I go into more detail about how this genius creation works,
here's some things to consider:</p>
<p>When AWS launched originally, it had three services:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3">S3</a> - Object storage for
cloud-native applications</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Simple_Queue_Service">SQS</a> - A
message queue</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud">EC2</a> -
A way to run Linux virtual machines somewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those foundational services, I'm going to focus the most on S3: the
Simple Storage Service. In essence, S3 is <code>malloc()</code> for the cloud.</p>

explanation. It may be worth revisiting this if you do though!</p></div></div>
<h3>The C programming language</h3>
<p>When using the C programming language, you normally are working with
memory in the stack. This memory is almost always semi-ephemeral and
all of the contents of the stack are no longer reachable (and
presumably overwritten) when you exit the current function. You can do
many things with this, but it turns out that this isn't very useful in
practice. To work around this (and reliably pass mutable values
between functions), you need to use the
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html"><code>malloc()</code></a>
function. <code>malloc()</code> takes in the number of bytes you want to allocate
and returns a pointer to the region of memory that was allocated.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is sus" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/sus"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Huh? That seems a bit easy for C. Can't allocating memory fail when there's no
more free memory to allocate? How do you handle that?</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is happy" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/happy"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>Yes, allocating memory can fail. When it does fail it returns a null pointer
and sets the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html">errno</a>
superglobal variable to the constant <code>ENOMEM</code>. From here all behavior is
implementation-defined.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Isn't "implementation-defined" code for "it'll probably crash"?</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is hacker" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>In many cases: yes most of the time it will crash. Hard. Some applications are
smart enough to handle this more gracefully (IE: try to free memory or run a
garbage collection run), but in many cases it doesn't really make more sense
to do anything but crash the program.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is facepalm" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/facepalm"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Oh. Good. Just what I wanted to hear.</p></div></div>
<p>When you get a pointer back from <code>malloc()</code>, you can store anything in
there as long as it's the same length as you passed or less.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Numa is delet" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/delet"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span></span></p><p>Fun fact: if you overwrite the bounds you passed to <code>malloc()</code> and anything
involved in the memory you are writing is user input, congradtulations: you
just created a way for a user to either corrupt internal application state or
gain arbitrary code execution. A similar technique is used in The Legend of
Zelda: Ocarina of Time speedruns in order to get arbitrary code execution via
<a href="https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/srm/srm-overview">Stale Reference
Manipulation</a>.</p></div></div>
<p>Oh, also anything stored in that pointer to memory you got back from
<code>malloc()</code> is stored in an area of ram called "the heap", which is
moderately slower to access than it is to access the stack.</p>
<h3>S3 in a nutshell</h3>
<p>Much in the same way, S3 lets you allocate space for and submit
arbitrary bytes to the cloud, then fetch them back with an address.
It's a lot like the <code>malloc()</code> function for the cloud. You can put
bytes there and then refer to them between cloud functions.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is hacker" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>The bytes are stored in the cloud, which is slightly slower to read from than
it would be to read data out of the heap.</p></div></div>
<p>And these arbitrary bytes can be <em>anything</em>. S3 is usually used for
hosting static assets (like all of the conversation snippet avatars
that a certain website with an orange background hates), but nothing
is stopping you from using it to host literally anything you want.
Logging things into S3 is so common it's literally a core product
offering from Amazon. Your billing history goes into S3. If you
download your tax returns from WealthSimple, it's probably downloading
the PDF files from S3. VRChat avatar uploads and downloads are done
via S3.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is happy" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/happy"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>It's like an FTP server but you don't have to care about running out of disk
space on the FTP server!</p></div></div>
<h3>IPv6</h3>
<p>You know what else is bytes? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_packet">IPv6
packets</a>. When you send an
IPv6 packet to a destination on the internet, the kernel will prepare
and pack a bunch of bytes together to let the destination and
intermediate hops (such as network routers) know where the packet
comes from and where it is destined to go.</p>
<p>Normally, IPv6 packets are handled by the kernel and submitted to a
queue for a hardware device to send out over some link to the
Internet. This works for the majority of networks because they deal
with hardware dedicated for slinging bytes around, or in some cases
shouting them through the air (such as when you use Wi-Fi or a mobile
phone's networking card).</p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Wait, did you just say that Wi-Fi is powered by your devices shouting at
eachother?</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is aha" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/aha"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Yep! Wi-Fi signal strength is measured in decibels even!</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Numa is delet" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/delet"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span></span></p><p>Wrong. Wi-Fi is more accurately <em>light</em>, not <em>sound</em>. It is much more accurate
to say that the devices are <em>shining</em> at eachother. Wi-Fi is the product of
radio waves, which are the same thing as light (but it's so low frequency that
you can't see it). Boom. Roasted.</p></div></div>
<h3>The core Unix philosophy: everything is a file</h3>
<span id="postcloud"></span>
<p>There is a way to bypass this and have software control how network links work,
and for that we need to think about Unix conceptually for a second. In the
hardcore Unix philosophical view: everything is a file. Hard drives and storage
devices are files. Process information is viewable as files. Serial devices are
files. This core philosophy is rooted at the heart of just about everything in
Unix and Linux systems, which makes it a lot easier for applications to be
programmed. The same API can be used for writing to files, tape drives, serial
ports, and network sockets. This makes everything a lot conceptually simpler and
reusing software for new purposes trivial.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is hacker" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>As an example of this, consider the
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html"><code>tar</code></a> command. The name
<code>tar</code> stands for "Tape ARchive". It was a format that was created for writing
backups <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_drive">to actual magnetic tape
drives</a>. Most commonly, it's used to
download source code from GitHub or as an interchange format for downloading
software packages (or other things that need to put multiple files in one
distributable unit).</p></div></div>
<p>In Linux, you can create a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TUN/TAP</a> device to let
applications control how network or datagram links work. In essence,
it lets you create a file descriptor that you can read packets from
and write packets to. As long as you get the packets to their intended
destination somehow and get any other packets that come back to the
same file descriptor, the implementation isn't relevant. This is how
OpenVPN, ZeroTier, FreeLAN, Tinc, Hamachi, WireGuard and Tailscale
work: they read packets from the kernel, encrypt them, send them to
the destination, decrypt incoming packets, and then write them back
into the kernel.</p>
<h3>In essence</h3>
<p>So, putting this all together:</p>
<ul>
<li>S3 is <code>malloc()</code> for the cloud, allowing you to share arbitrary
sequences of bytes between consumers.</li>
<li>IPv6 packets are just bytes like anything else.</li>
<li>TUN devices let you have arbitrary application code control how
packets get to network destinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, all you'd need to do to save money on your network bills
would be to read packets from the kernel, write them to S3, and then
have another loop read packets from S3 and write those packets back
into the kernel. All you'd need to do is wire things up in the right
way.</p>
<p>So I did just that.</p>
<p>Here's some of my friends' reactions to that list of facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like you've just told me how to build a bomb. I can't belive
this actually works but also I don't see how it wouldn't. This is
evil.</li>
<li>It's like using a warehouse like a container ship. You've put a
warehouse on wheels.</li>
<li>I don't know what you even mean by that. That's a storage method.
Are you using an extremely generous definition of "tunnel"?</li>
<li>sto psto pstop stopstops</li>
<li>We play with hypervisors and net traffic often enough that we know
that this is something someone wouldn't have thought of.</li>
<li>Wait are you planning to actually <em>implement and use</em> ipv6 over
s3?</li>
<li>We're paying good money for these shitposts :)</li>
<li>Is routinely coming up with cursed ideas a requirement for working
at tailscale?</li>
<li>That is horrifying. Please stop torturing the packets. This is a
violation of the Geneva Convention.</li>
<li>Please seek professional help.</li>
</ul>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is enby" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Before any of you ask, yes, this was the result of a drunken conversation with
<a href="https://twitter.com/quinnypig">Corey Quinn</a>.</p></div></div>
<h2>Hoshino</h2>
<p>Hoshino is a system for putting outgoing IPv6 packets into S3 and then
reading incoming IPv6 packets out of S3 in order to avoid the absolute
dreaded scourge of Managed NAT Gateway. It is a travesty of a tool
that does work, if only barely.</p>
<p>The name is a reference to the main character of the anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshi_no_Ko">Oshi no
Ko</a>, Hoshino Ai. Hoshino is
an absolute genius that works as a pop idol for the group B-Komachi.</p>
<p>Hoshino is a shockingly simple program. It creates a TUN device,
configures the OS networking stack so that programs can use it, and
then starts up two threads to handle reading packets from the kernel
and writing packets into the kernel.</p>
<p>When it starts up, it creates a new TUN device named either <code>hoshino0</code>
or an administrator-defined name with a command line flag. This
interface is only intended to forward IPv6 traffic.</p>
<p>Each node derives its IPv6 address from the
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html"><code>machine-id</code></a>
of the system it's running on. This means that you can somewhat
reliably guarantee that every node on the network has a unique address
that you can easily guess (the provided ULA /64 and then the first
half of the <code>machine-id</code> in hex). Future improvements may include
publishing these addresses into DNS via Route 53.</p>
<p>When it configures the OS networking stack with that address, it uses
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlink">netlink</a> socket to do this.
Netlink is a Linux-specific socket family type that allows userspace
applications to configure the network stack, communicate to the
kernel, and communicate between processes. Netlink sockets cannot
leave the current host they are connected to, but unlike Unix sockets
which are addressed by filesystem paths, Netlink sockets are addressed
by process ID numbers.</p>
<p>In order to configure the <code>hoshino0</code> device with Netlink, Hoshino does
the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds the node's IPv6 address to the <code>hoshino0</code> interface</li>
<li>Enables the <code>hoshino0</code> interface to be used by the kernel</li>
<li>Adds a route to the IPv6 subnet via the <code>hoshino0</code> interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it configures the AWS API client and kicks off both of the main
loops that handle reading packets from and writing packets to the
kernel.</p>
<p>When uploading packets to S3, the key for each packet is derived from
the destination IPv6 address (parsed from outgoing packets using the
handy library
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/gopacket">gopacket</a>) and the
packet's unique ID (a
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oklog/ulid/v2">ULID</a> to ensure that
packets are lexicographically sortable, which will be important to
ensure in-order delivery in the other loop).</p>
<p>When packets are processed, they are added to a
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/within.website/x/internal/bundler">bundle</a> for
later processing by the kernel. This is relatively boring code and
understanding it is mostly an exercise for the reader. <code>bundler</code> is
based on the Google package
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/support/bundler"><code>bundler</code></a>,
but modified to use generic types because the original
implementation of <code>bundler</code> predates them.</p>
<h3>cardio</h3>
<p>However, the last major part of understanding the genius at play here
is by the use of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/within.website/x/cardio">cardio</a>.
Cardio is a utility in Go that lets you have a "heartbeat" for events
that should happen every so often, but also be able to influence the
rate based on need. This lets you speed up the rate if there is more
work to be done (such as when packets are found in S3), and reduce the
rate if there is no more work to be done (such as when no packets are
found in S3).</p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Okay, this is also probably something that you can use outside of this post,
but I promise there won't be any more of these!</p></div></div>
<p>When using cardio, you create the heartbeat channel and signals like
this:</p>
<pre><code><span>heartbeat<span>,</span> slower<span>,</span> faster <span>:=</span> cardio<span>.</span><span>Heartbeat</span><span>(</span>ctx<span>,</span> time<span>.</span>Minute<span>,</span> time<span>.</span>Millisecond<span>)</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>The first argument to <code>cardio.Heartbeat</code> is a
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context"><code>context</code></a> that lets you cancel the
heartbeat loop. Additionally, if your application uses
<a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/ln-the-natural-logger-2020-10-17"><code>ln</code></a>'s
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/within.website/ln/opname"><code>opname</code></a> facility, an
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/expvar"><code>expvar</code></a> gauge will be created and named
after that operation name.</p>
<p>The next two arguments are the minimum and maximum heart rate. In this
example, the heartbeat would range between once per minute and once
per millisecond.</p>
<p>When you signal the heart rate to speed up, it will double the rate.
When you trigger the heart rate to slow down, it will halve the rate.
This will enable applications to spike up and gradually slow down as
demand changes, much like how the human heart will speed up with
exercise and gradually slow down as you stop exercising.</p>
<p>When the heart rate is too high for the amount of work needed to be
done (such as when the heartbeat is too fast, much like tachycardia in
the human heart), it will automatically back off and signal the heart
rate to slow down (much like I wish would happen to me sometimes).</p>
<p>This is a package that I always wanted to have exist, but never found
the need to write for myself until now.</p>
<h3>Terraform</h3>
<p>Like any good recovering SRE, I used
<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to automate creating
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM</a> users and security policies for
each of the nodes on the Hoshino network. This also was used to create
the S3 bucket. Most of the configuration is fairly boring, but I did
run into an issue while creating the policy documents that I feel is
worth pointing out here.</p>
<p>I made the "create a user account and policies for that account" logic
into a Terraform module because that's how you get functions in
Terraform. It looked like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>data <span>"aws_iam_policy_document"</span></span> <span>"policy"</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>statement</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>actions</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
</span><span>      <span>"s3:GetObject"</span>,
</span><span>      <span>"s3:PutObject"</span>,
</span><span>      <span>"s3:ListBucket"</span>,
</span><span>    <span>]</span>
</span><span>    <span>effect</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Allow"</span>
</span><span>    <span>resources</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
</span><span>      var.bucket_arn,
</span><span>    <span>]</span>
</span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>statement</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>actions</span>   <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"s3:ListAllMyBuckets"</span><span>]</span>
</span><span>    <span>effect</span>    <span>=</span> <span>"Allow"</span>
</span><span>    <span>resources</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"*"</span><span>]</span>
</span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>When I tried to use it, things didn't work. I had given it the
permission to write to and read from the bucket, but I was being told
that I don't have permission to do either operation. The reason this
happened is because my statement allowed me to put objects to the
bucket, but not to any path INSIDE the bucket. In order to fix this, I
needed to make my policy statement look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>statement</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>actions</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
</span><span>    <span>"s3:GetObject"</span>,
</span><span>    <span>"s3:PutObject"</span>,
</span><span>    <span>"s3:ListBucket"</span>,
</span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span><span>  <span>effect</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Allow"</span>
</span><span>  <span>resources</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
</span><span>    var.bucket_arn,
</span><span>    <span>"<span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>var</span><span>.</span><span>bucket_arn</span><span>}</span></span>/*"</span>, <span># allow every file in the bucket</span>
</span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This does let you do a few cool things though, you can use this to
create per-node credentials in IAM that can only write logs to their
part of the bucket in particular. I can easily see how this can be
used to allow you to have infinite flexibility in what you want to do,
but good lord was it inconvenient to find this out the hard way.</p>
<p>Terraform also configured the lifecycle policy for objects in the
bucket to delete them after a day.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>resource <span>"aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration"</span></span> <span>"hoshino"</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>bucket</span> <span>=</span> aws_s3_bucket.hoshino.id
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>rule</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>"auto-expire"</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>filter</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>expiration</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>      <span>days</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
</span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Enabled"</span>
</span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>If I could, I would set this to a few hours at most, but the minimum

<h3>The horrifying realization that it works</h3>
<p>Once everything was implemented and I fixed the last bugs related to
<a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/more-throughput/">the efforts to make Tailscale faster than kernel
wireguard</a>, I tried to
ping something. I set up two virtual machines with
<a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/series/waifud">waifud</a> and installed Hoshino.
I configured their AWS credentials and then started it up. Both
machines got IPv6 addresses and they started their loops. Nervously, I
ran a ping command:</p>
<pre><code><span>xe@river-woods:~$ ping fd5e:59b8:f71d:9a3e:c05f:7f48:de53:428f
</span><span>PING fd5e:59b8:f71d:9a3e:c05f:7f48:de53:428f(fd5e:59b8:f71d:9a3e:c05f:7f48:de53:428f) 56 data bytes

</span></code></pre>
<p>It worked. I successfully managed to send ping packets over Amazon S3.
At the time, I was in an airport dealing with the aftermath of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-outage-1.6861923">Air
Canada's IT system falling the heck
over</a>
and the sheer feeling of relief I felt was better than drugs.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Sometimes I wonder if I'm an adrenaline junkie for the unique feeling that you
get when your code finally works.</p></div></div>
<p>Then I tested TCP. Logically holding, if ping packets work, then TCP
should too. It would be slow, but nothing in theory would stop it. I
decided to test my luck and tried to open the other node's metrics
page:</p>

<p>I was floored. It works. The packets were sitting there in S3, and I
was able to pluck out <a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/hoshino/01H20ZQ3H9CW1FS9CAX6JX0NPY">the TCP

would prevent things from getting through, but you could have your lambda
handler funge a TCP packet to either side of the connection with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.html#section-3.1:~:text=Reset%20Generation%0A%0A%20%20As%20a%20general%20rule%2C%20reset%20(RST)%20must%20be%20sent%20whenever%20a%20segment%20arrives%0A%20%20which%20apparently%20is%20not%20intended%20for%20the%20current%20connection.%20%20A%20reset%0A%20%20must%20not%20be%20sent%20if%20it%20is%20not%20clear%20that%20this%20is%20the%20case.">the <code>RST</code>
flag
set</a>
(RFC 793: Transmission Control Protocol, the RFC that defines TCP, page 36,
section "Reset Generation"). That could let you kill connections that meet
unwanted criteria, at the cost of having to invoke a lambda handler. I'm
<em>pretty sure</em> this is RFC-compliant, but I'm a shitposter, not a the network
police.</p></div></div>

support jumbo frames then you can usually get away with 9216 bytes at max.</p></div></div>

network equipment here, so realistically our packets can be up to to the limit
of the IPv6 packet header format: the oddly specific number of 65535 bytes.
This is configured by the Maximum Transmission Unit at the OS level (though
usually this defines the limit for network frames and not IP packets).
Regardless, Hoshino defaults to an MTU of 53049, which should allow you to
transfer a bunch of data in a single S3 object.</p></div></div>
<h2>Cost analysis</h2>
<p>When you count only network traffic costs, the architecture has many
obvious advantages. Access to S3 is zero-rated in many cases with S3,
however the real advantage comes when you are using this cross-region.
This lets you have a worker in us-east-1 communicate with another
worker in us-west-1 without having to incur the high bandwidth cost
per gigabyte when using Managed NAT Gateway.</p>
<p>However, when you count all of the S3 operations (up to one every
millisecond), Hoshino is hilariously more expensive because of simple
math you can do on your own napkin at home.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, consider the case where an idle node is
sitting there and polling S3 for packets. This will happen at the
minimum poll rate of once every 500 milliseconds. There are 24 hours
in a day. There are 60 minutes in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a
minute. There are 1000 milliseconds in a second. This means that each
node will be making 172,800 calls to S3 per day, at a cost of $<span id="hnprice1">0.86</span>
per node per day. And that's what happens with no traffic. When
traffic happens that's at least one additional <code>PUT</code>-<code>GET</code> call pair
<em>per-packet</em>.</p>
<p>Depending on how big your packets are, this can cause you to easily
triple that number, making you end up with 518,400 calls to S3 per day
($<span id="hnprice2">2.59</span> per node per day). Not to mention
TCP overhead from the three-way handshake and acknowledgement packets.</p>
<p>This is hilariously unviable and makes the effective cost of
transmitting a gigabyte of data over HTTP through such a contraption
vastly more than $0.07 per gigabyte.</p>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>This architecture does have a strange advantage to it though: assuming
a perfectly spherical cow, adequate network latency, and sheer luck
this does make UDP a bit more reliable than it should be otherwise.</p>
<p>With appropriate timeouts and retries at the application level, it may
end up being more reliable than IP transit over the public internet.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Good lord is this an accursed abomination.</p></div></div>
<p>I guess you could optimize this by replacing the S3 read loop with
some kind of AWS lambda handler that remotely wakes the target
machine, but at that point it may actually be better to have that
lambda POST the contents of the packet to the remote machine. This
would let you bypass the S3 polling costs, but you'd still have to pay
for the egress traffic from lambda and the posting to S3 bit.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Before you comment about how I could make it better by doing x, y, or z;
please consider that I need to leave room for a part 2. I've already thought
about nearly anything you could have already thought about, including using
SQS, bundling multiple packets into a single S3 object, and other things that
I haven't mentioned here for brevity's sake.</p></div></div>
<h2>Shitposting so hard you create an IP conflict</h2>
<p>Something amusing about this is that it is something that technically
steps into the realm of things that my employer does. This creates a
unique kind of conflict where I can't easily retain the intellectial
property (IP) for this without getting it approved from my employer.
It is a bit of the worst of both worlds where I'm doing it on my own
time with my own equipment to create something that will be ultimately
owned by my employer. This was a bit of a sour grape at first and I
almost didn't implement this until the whole Air Canada debacle
happened and I was very bored.</p>
<p>However, I am choosing to think about it this way: I have successfully
shitposted so hard that it's a legal consideration and that I am going
to be <em>absolved of the networking sins I have committed</em> by instead
outsourcing those sins to my employer.</p>
<p>I was told that under these circumstances I could release the source
code and binaries for this atrocity (provided that I release them with
the correct license, which I have rigged to be included in both the
source code and the binary of Hoshino), but I am going to elect to not
let this code see the light of day outside of my homelab. Maybe I'll
change my mind in the future, but honestly this entire situation is so
cursed that I think it's better for me to not for the safety of
humankind's minds and wallets.</p>
<p>I may try to use the basic technique of Hoshino as a replacement for
DERP, but that sounds like a lot of effort after I have proven that
this is so hilariously unviable. It would work though!</p>

        <h2>(mobile shell)</h2>
        <p>Remote terminal application that
        allows <strong>roaming</strong>, supports <strong>intermittent connectivity</strong>, and provides intelligent <strong>local echo</strong> and line editing of user keystrokes.</p>
        <p>Mosh is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It's more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.</p>
        <p>Mosh is free software, available for GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, Solaris, Android, Chrome, and iOS.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="features">
  <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Change IP. Stay connected.</h2>
        <p>Mosh automatically roams as you move between Internet
        connections. Use Wi-Fi on the train, Ethernet in a hotel,
        and LTE on a beach: you'll stay logged in. Most network
        programs lose their connections after roaming,
        including SSH and Web apps like Gmail. Mosh
        is different.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Makes for sweet dreams.</h2>
        <p>With Mosh, you can put your laptop to sleep and wake it
        up later, keeping your connection intact. If your
        Internet connection drops, Mosh will warn you — but
        the connection resumes when network service
        comes back.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Get rid of network lag.</h2>
        <p>SSH waits for the server's reply before showing you your
        own typing. That can make for a lousy user interface. Mosh
        is different: it gives an instant response to typing,
        deleting, and line editing. It does this adaptively and
        works even in full-screen programs like emacs and vim. On
        a bad connection, outstanding predictions are underlined
        so you won't be misled.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>No privileged code. No daemon.</h2>
        <p>You don't need to be the superuser to install or run
        Mosh. The client and server are executables run by an
        ordinary user and last only for the life of the
        connection.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Same login method.</h2>
        <p>Mosh doesn't listen on network ports or authenticate
         users. The <span>mosh</span> client logs in to the server via
         SSH, and users present the same credentials (e.g.,
         password, public key) as before. Then Mosh runs the
         <span>mosh-server</span> remotely and connects to it over UDP.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Runs inside your terminal, but better.</h2>
        <p>Mosh is a command-line program, like ssh. You can use it
        inside xterm, gnome-terminal, urxvt, Terminal.app, iTerm,
        emacs, screen, or tmux. But mosh was designed from scratch
        and supports just one character set: UTF-8. It fixes Unicode
        bugs in other terminals and in SSH.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Control-C works great.</h2>
        <p>Unlike SSH, mosh's UDP-based protocol handles packet loss
          gracefully, and sets the frame rate based on network conditions. Mosh
          doesn't fill up network buffers, so Control-C always works
          to halt a runaway process.</p>

      <h3>Server binary outside path</h3>
      <pre>$ mosh <b>--server=/tmp/mosh-server</b> <i>r2d2</i></pre>
      <p>The user can specify an alternate path for the <code>mosh-server</code> on the remote host. The server binary can even
        be installed in the user's home directory.</p>

  <h2>How Mosh works</h2>

  <div>
  <p>Remote-shell protocols traditionally work by conveying a
    byte-stream from the server to the client, to be interpreted
    by the client's terminal. (This includes TELNET, RLOGIN, and
    SSH.) Mosh works differently and at a different layer. With
      Mosh, the server and client both maintain a snapshot of
      the current screen state. The problem becomes one of
      state-synchronization: getting the client to the
      most recent server-side screen as efficiently as
      possible.</p>

    <p>This is accomplished using a new protocol called the
      <strong>State Synchronization Protocol</strong>, for which Mosh is the
      first application. SSP runs over UDP, synchronizing the
      state of any object from one host to another. Datagrams
      are encrypted and authenticated
      using <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/">AES-128
      in OCB3 mode</a>. While SSP takes care of the networking
      protocol, it is the implementation of the object being
      synchronized that defines the ultimate semantics of the
      protocol.</p>

    <p>Roaming with SSP becomes easy: the client sends datagrams
      to the server with increasing sequence numbers, including
      a "heartbeat" at least once every three seconds. Every time
      the server receives an authentic packet from the client
      with a sequence number higher than any it has previously
      received, the IP source address of that packet becomes the
      server's new target for its outgoing packets. By doing
      roaming “statelessly” in this manner, roaming works in and
      out of NATs, even ones that may themselves be
      roaming. Roaming works even when the client is not aware
      that its Internet-visible IP address has changed. The
      heartbeats allow Mosh to inform the user when it hasn't
      heard from the server in a while (unlike SSH, where users
      may be unaware of a dropped connection until they try to
      type).</p>

    <p>Mosh runs two copies of SSP, one in each direction of the
      connection. The connection from client to server
      synchronizes an object that represents the keys typed by
      the user, and with TCP-like semantics. The connection from
      server to client synchronizes an object that represent the
      current screen state, and the goal is always to convey the
      client to the most recent server-side state, possibly
    skipping intermediate frames.</p>

    <p>Because SSP works at the object layer and can control the
      rate of synchronization (in other words, the frame rate),
      it does not need to send every byte it receives from the
      application. That means Mosh can regulate the frames so as
      not to fill up network buffers, retaining the
      responsiveness of the connection and making sure Control-C
      always works quickly. Protocols that must send every byte
      can't do this.</p>

  <h3>Careful terminal emulation</h3>

    <p>One benefit of working at the terminal layer
      was the opportunity to build a clean UTF-8 terminal
      emulator from scratch. Mosh fixes several Unicode bugs in
      existing terminals and in SSH, and was designed as a fresh
      start to try to be robust and correct even for
      pathological inputs.</p>

  </dd>

  <dt>Evil escape sequences</dt>

  <dd><p>Only Mosh and GNOME Terminal have a defensible rendering when
Unicode mixes with an ECMA-48/ANSI escape sequence. The OS X Terminal
unwisely tries to normalize its input before the vt500 state machine,
causing it to misinterpret and become unusable after receiving the
following input!* (This also means the OS X Terminal's interpretation
of the incoming octet stream <strong>varies</strong> depending on how
the incoming octets are split across TCP segments, because the
normalization only looks ahead to available bytes.)</p>

<p><small>* We earlier wrote that this misbehaving sequence "crashes"
the OS X Terminal.app. This was mistaken—instead, Terminal.app
interprets the escape sequence as shutting off keyboard input, and
because of an unrelated bug in Terminal.app, it is not possible for
the user to restore keyboard input by resetting the terminal from the
menu.</small></p>

  </dd>

  <dt>Mosh sets IUTF8</dt>

  <dd><p>In the POSIX framework, the kernel needs to know whether
    the user is typing in an 8-bit character set or in UTF-8,
    because in canonical mode (i.e. "cooked" mode), the kernel
    needs to be able to delete a typed multibyte character
    sequence from an input buffer.  On OS X and Linux, this is
    done with the "IUTF8" termios flag.)
    (See <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=665757">diagnostic
        explaining the need for this flag.</a>)</p>

    <p>Mosh sets the IUTF8 flag when possible and stubbornly refuses to start up unless the user has a
    UTF-8-clean environment. SSH does not set the IUTF8 flag, which can lead to garbage in input buffers.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

  <h3>Instant local echo and line editing</h3>

    <p>The other major benefit of working at the
      terminal-emulation layer is that the Mosh client is free
      to scribble on the local screen without lasting
      consequence. We use this to implement intelligent local
      echo. The client runs a predictive model in the background
      of the server's behavior, hypothesizing that each
      keystroke will be echoed at the cursor location and that
      the backspace and left- and right-arrow keys will have
      their traditional effect. But only when a prediction is
      confirmed by the server are these effects actually shown
      to the user. (In addition, by default predictions are only
      displayed on high-delay connections or during a network
      “glitch.”) Predictions are done in epochs: when the
      user does something that might alter the echo behavior
      — like hit ESC or carriage return or an up- or
      down-arrow — Mosh goes back into making background
      predictions until a prediction from the new batch can be
      confirmed as correct.</p>

    <p>Thus, unlike previous attempts at local echo with TELNET
      and RLOGIN, Mosh's local echo can be used everywhere, even
      in full-screen programs like emacs and vi.</p>

  <h3>Real-world benefits</h3>

<p>We evaluated Mosh using traces contributed by six users, covering
about 40 hours of real-world usage and including 9,986 total
keystrokes. These traces included the timing and contents of all
writes from the user to the host and vice versa. The users were asked
to contribute "typical, real-world sessions." In practice, the traces
include use of popular programs such as the bash shell and zsh shells,
the alpine and mutt e-mail clients, the emacs and vim text editors,
the irssi and barnowl chat clients, the links text-mode Web browser,
and several programs unique to each user.</p>

<p>To evaluate typical usage of a "mobile" terminal, we replayed the
traces over an otherwise unloaded Sprint commercial EV-DO (3G)
cellular Internet connection in Cambridge, Mass. A client-side process
played the user portion of the traces, and a server-side process
waited for the expected user input and then replied (in time) with the
prerecorded server output. We speeded up long periods with no
activity.  The average round-trip time on the link was about half a
second.</p>

<p>We replayed the traces over two different transports, SSH and Mosh,
and recorded the user interface response latency to each simulated
user keystroke. The Mosh predictive algorithm was frozen prior to
collecting the traces and was not adjusted in response to their
contents or results.</p>

<h4>The results</h4>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://mosh.org/cdfs.png" alt=""></p><h4>Cumulative distribution of keystroke response times with Sprint EV-DO (3G) Internet service</h4>
</div>

<p>Mosh reduced the median keystroke response
time from 503 ms to nearly instant (because more than 70% of the
keystrokes could be immediately displayed), and reduced the mean
keystroke response time from 515 ms to 173 ms. Qualitatively, Mosh makes
remote servers "feel" more like the local machine!</p>

      <div id="faq">
  <dl>
  <dt>Q: Who wrote Mosh?</dt>

  <dd><p>Mosh was written by Keith Winstein, along with Anders Kaseorg, Quentin Smith, Richard Tibbetts, Keegan McAllister, and John Hood.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Why another remote-terminal protocol?</dt>

  <dd><p>Practical latency on the Internet is on the increase, with
    the rise of bufferbloat and sophisticated wireless links
    that optimize for throughput over delay. And roaming is more
    common than ever, now that laptops and handheld devices have
    largely displaced desktops. SSH is great, but frustrating to
    use when you want to change IP addresses or have a
    long-delay link or a dodgy connection.</p>

  <p>Moreover, TELNET had some good things going for it — a
    local-echo mode and a well-defined network virtual
    terminal. Even today, SSH doesn't properly support UTF-8
    end-to-end on a POSIX system.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Are the mosh principles relevant to other network applications?</dt>

  <dd><p>We think so. The design principles that Mosh stands for are
    conservative: warning the user if the state being displayed
    is out of date, serializing and checkpointing all
    transactions so that if there are no warnings, the user
    knows every prior transaction has succeeded, and handling expected events (like roaming from one
    WiFi network to another) gracefully.</p>

  <p>Those don't seem too controversial, but fancy apps like
  Gmail-in-Chromium or on Android still behave atrociously on
  dodgy connections or after switching IP addresses. (Have you
  ever had Gmail leave an e-mail message in "Sending..." for ten
  hours while merrily retrieving new mail and not indicating any
  kind of error? Us too.) We think there may be considerable
  room for improvement in many network user interfaces from the
  application of these values.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: I'm getting "mosh requires a UTF-8 locale." How can I fix this?</dt>

        <dd><p>To diagnose the problem, run <code>locale</code> on the local
        terminal, and <code>ssh <i>remotehost</i> locale</code>. To use Mosh,
        both sides of the connection will need to show a UTF-8 locale, like
        <code>LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"</code>.</p>

        <p>On many systems, SSH will transfer the locale-related
        environment variables, which are then inherited by
        <code>mosh-server</code>.  If this mechanism fails, Mosh (as of
        version 1.2) will pass the variables itself.  If neither
        mechanism is successful, you can do something like</p>

        <pre>mosh <i>remotehost</i> <b>--server="LANG=en_US.UTF-8 mosh-server"</b></pre>

        <p>If <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> does not exist on the remote server,
        you can replace this with a UTF-8 locale that does exist.  You
        may also need to set LANG locally for the benefit of
        <code>mosh-client</code>.  It is possible that the local and
        remote machines will need different locale names. See also <a href="https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/98">this GitHub
        ticket</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: What does the message "Nothing received from the server on UDP port 60003" mean?</dt>

  <dd>
    <p>This means that <code>mosh</code> was able to start
    <code>mosh-server</code> successfully on the remote machine, but the client is
    not able to communicate with the server.  This generally means that
    some type of firewall is
    blocking the UDP packets between the client and the server.  If you
    had to forward TCP port 22 on a NAT for SSH, then you will have to
    forward UDP ports as well.  Mosh will use the first available
    UDP port, starting at 60001 and stopping at 60999.  If you are only
    going to have a small handful of concurrent sessions on a server, then you can
    forward a smaller range of ports (e.g., 60000 to 60010).
    </p>

    <p>
    Tools like netstat, netcat, socat, and tcpdump can be useful for debugging
    networking and firewall problems.
    </p>

    <p>This problem can also be the result of a bug in glibc 2.22 that
      affects programs that link with protobuf and utempter and use
      aggressive compiler hardening flags. (<a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19861">glibc bugtracker entry</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues/727">Mosh bugtracker entry</a>.) The
      problem causes mosh-server to segfault immediately on startup. We
      believe we have worked around this problem in Mosh 1.2.6, but please
      report a bug if you find otherwise.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Q: Why do you insist on UTF-8 everywhere?</dt>

  <dd><p>We're really not UTF-8 zealots. But it's a lot easier to
  correctly implement <strong>one</strong> terminal emulator
  than to try to do the right thing in a variety of difficult
  edge cases. (This is what GNU screen tries to do, and in our
  experience it leads to some very tricky-to-debug situations.)
  So mosh just won't start up until the user has everything
  configured for a UTF-8-clean pathway. It may be annoying, but
  it also probably reduces frustration down the
  road. (Unfortunately an 8-bit vt220 and a UTF-8 vt220 are
  different and incompatible terminal types; the UTF-8 goes
  in <strong>underneath</strong> the vt220 state machine.)</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I use a different SSH port (not 22)?</dt>

        <dd><p>As of Mosh 1.2, you can pass arguments to <code>ssh</code> like so:</p>

        <pre>mosh <i>remotehost</i> <b>--ssh="ssh -p 2222"</b></pre>

        <p>Or configure a host alias in <code>~/.ssh/config</code> with a
        <code>Port</code> directive.  Mosh will respect that too.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: I'm getting 'mosh-server not found'.</dt>

  <dd><p>Please make sure that mosh is installed on the client, and
  mosh (or at least mosh-server) is installed on the server you are
  trying to connect to.  Also, the server is expected to be available
  on your server's default login <code>PATH</code>, which is not
  usually true on OS X and BSD servers, or if you install mosh-server
  in your home directory.  In these cases please see the "Server
  binary outside path" instructions in the Usage section,
  above.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: SSH authenticates using Kerberos tickets, but Mosh asks me for a password.</dt>
        <dd><p>In some configurations, SSH canonicalizes the hostname
        before passing it to the Kerberos GSSAPI plugin.  This breaks
        for Mosh, because the initial forward DNS lookup is done by
        the Mosh wrapper script.  To work around this, invoke Mosh as</p>

        <pre>mosh <i>remotehost</i> <b>--ssh="ssh -o GSSAPITrustDns=no"</b></pre>

        <p>This <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1008">will
        often fail</a> on a round-robin DNS setup.  In that case it is probably
        best to pick a specific host from the round-robin pool.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Why is my terminal's scrollback buffer incomplete?</dt>

        <dd><p>Mosh synchronizes only the <b>visible</b> state of the terminal.  We
are tracking this issue; see <a href="https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/2">this issue</a> and the
        others which are linked from there.  For now, the workaround is to use
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> on the remote side.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I get 256 colors?</dt>

  <dd><p>Make sure you are running mosh in a terminal that
  advertises itself as 256-color capable. (This generally means
  TERM will be xterm-256color or screen-256color-bce.)</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I type C-^, Mosh's default escape character?</dt>

  <dd><p>On keyboards with the United States layout, this can be typed
  as Ctrl-Shift-6, or often as Ctrl-6 (this depends on your OS and
  terminal emulator).  On non-US keyboards, it is often hard to find
  the right key, and sometimes it's not available at all.  If your
  keyboard has a dead key with an accent-circumflex, this is not
  likely to be the right key.  Ctrl-6 sometimes works, though.  If you
  are unable to type this character, you will need to set
  the <code>MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY</code> variable; see the Mosh man page for
  details.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How can I make the server automatically clean up dormant sessions?</dt>

  <dd><p>Please see the entries for <code>MOSH_SERVER_NETWORK_TMOUT</code>
      and <code>MOSH_SERVER_SIGNAL_TMOUT</code> in the <i>mosh-server(1)</i> man page.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: What is Mosh's security track record so far?</dt>

  <dd><p>Mosh 1.0 was released in March 2012. As of the release of Mosh
      1.4.0 in October 2022, as far as the developers are aware:

      </p><ul>
      
      <li>In the last decade, <b>no security vulnerabilities of
	any kind</b> (major or minor) have been reported in Mosh.

      </li><li>No major security vulnerabilities have <b>ever</b> been
      reported in Mosh. We define major security vulnerabilities to
      include privilege escalation, remote code execution,
      denial-of-service by a third party, etc.

      </li><li>Two denial-of-service issues were discovered and fixed in
	releases in 2012. One issue allowed a mosh-server to cause the
	mosh-client to spend excess CPU (CVE-2012-2385, fixed in Mosh
	1.2.1, released May 2012). Another issue allowed the server
	host to cause the mosh-client to send UDP datagrams to an
	incorrect address, foiling its attempt to connect (fixed in
	Mosh 1.2.3, released October 2012).
      </li></ul></dd>

      <dt>Q: How does Mosh's security compare with SSH's?</dt>
      
    <dd><p>We think that Mosh's conservative design means that its attack
      surface compares favorably with more-complicated systems like
      OpenSSL and OpenSSH. Mosh's track record has so
      far borne this out. Ultimately, however, only time will tell
      when the first serious security vulnerability is discovered in
      Mosh—either because it was there all along or because it
      was added inadvertently in development. OpenSSH and OpenSSL have
      had more vulnerabilities, but they have also been released
      longer and are more prevalent.</p>

    <p>In one concrete respect, the Mosh protocol is more secure than
      SSH's: SSH relies on unauthenticated TCP to carry the contents
      of the secure stream. That means that an attacker can end an SSH
      connection with a single phony "RST" segment. By contrast, Mosh
      applies its security at a different layer (authenticating every
      datagram), so an attacker cannot end a Mosh session unless the
      attacker can <b>continuously</b> prevent packets from reaching
      the other side. A transient attacker can cause only a transient
      user-visible outage; once the attacker goes away, Mosh will
      resume the session.</p>

    <p>However, in typical usage, Mosh relies on SSH to exchange keys
      at the beginning of a session, so Mosh will inherit the
      weaknesses of SSH—at least insofar as they affect the
      brief SSH session that is used to set up a long-running Mosh
      session.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Is Mosh affected by the 2018 <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1040.pdf">attacks against the OCB2 cipher mode</a>?</dt>

  <dd><p>Not that we know of—Mosh uses OCB3. The authors of the
paper write that the attack is not applicable to OCB3.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Why does mosh use AES-128 for a session-key, not AES-192 or AES-256?</dt>

  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>AES-128 is more than an adequate key length for a session key.</li>

      <li>The <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/ocb-faq.htm#what-blockcipher">OCB FAQ</a> recommends AES-128.</li>

      <li>AES-128 is a bit nicer and is not subject to the related-key attacks that afflict AES-192 and AES-256. (Schneier: "the key schedule for 256-bit version is pretty lousy -- something we pointed out in our 2000 paper -- but doesn't extend to AES with a 128-bit key." See <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.html">this blog post</a>.)</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Q: Does mosh work with Amazon EC2?</dt>

  <dd><p>Yes, it works great, but please remember to open up UDP ports 60000–61000 on the EC2 firewall.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I tell if mosh is working correctly?</dt>

  <dd>
      <p>After you run <code>mosh user@server</code>, if successful you will be dropped into your login
      shell on the remote machine.

      If you want
      to check that mosh is being used instead of ssh, try typing <code>Ctrl-^ Ctrl-Z</code>
      to suspend the session (with mosh 1.2.4 or later on the client). Running <code>fg</code> will then return.
      </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Q: What's the difference between mosh, mosh-client, and mosh-server?   Which one do I use?</dt>

  <dd>
      <p>The <code>mosh</code> command is a wrapper script that is designed to be the primary way that
      you use mosh.  In most cases, you can simply just replace "ssh" with "mosh" in your command line.
      Behind the scenes, the <code>mosh</code> wrapper script will SSH to the server, start up
      <code>mosh-server</code>, and then close the SSH connection.  Then it will start up the
      <code>mosh-client</code> executable on the client, passing it the necessary information for
      it to connect to the newly spawned <code>mosh-server</code> instance.
      </p>

      <p>In normal usage, <code>mosh-client</code> and
      <code>mosh-server</code> don't need to be run directly.
      </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I run the mosh client and server separately?</dt>

  <dd><p>If the <code>mosh</code> wrapper script isn't working for you, you can try running
    the <code>mosh-client</code> and <code>mosh-server</code> programs separately to
    form a connection. This can be a useful debugging technique.</p>

  <p>1. Log in to the remote host, and run <code>mosh-server</code>.</p>

  <p>It will give output like:</p>
<pre>$ mosh-server 

MOSH CONNECT <b>60004</b> <b>4NeCCgvZFe2RnPgrcU1PQw</b>

mosh-server (mosh 1.1.3)

</pre>

  <p>2. On the local host, run:</p>
<pre>$ MOSH_KEY=<b>key</b> mosh-client <b>remote-IP</b> <b>remote-PORT</b></pre>

<p>where "key" is the 22-byte string printed by mosh-server (in this
example, "4NeCCgvZFe2RnPgrcU1PQw"), "remote-PORT" is the port number
given by the server (60004 in this case), and "remote-IP" is the IP address of the server. You can look up the
server's IP address with "host remotehost".</p>

  <p>3. If all goes well, you should have a working Mosh connection. Information about where the process fails can help us debug why Mosh isn't working for you.</p>

  </dd><dt>Q: With the mosh-server on FreeBSD or OS X, I sometimes get weird color problems. What's wrong?</dt>

<p><em>Learning to Think Again, and the Cost of AI Dependency.</em></p>
<p>There are so many (hype/boring) posts about AI coming out every day. It’s OK to use it, and everyone does it, but still <strong>learn your craft</strong>, and try to <em>think</em>.</p>
<p>Similar to what <a>DHH</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s also more fun to be competent in something than constantly waiting for an AI to complete.</p></blockquote>
<p>The probability that AI will make us unhappy is very high IMO. Use it, yes, but not for every task. For discovering, creating a historical overview, or creating diagrams (Canva, Figma), but a big no to <em>the</em> writing (or coding). Someone needs to add knowledge or new insights; AI cannot train itself. So articles, books, and words will be written, and writers will be more in demand as everyone relies on AI, which at some point just plateaus.</p>
<p>It will be a long-term loss; people stop thinking and learning. Time will tell. My two cents, if you are a senior in something, you know better.

<p>I 

<a href="https://youtu.be/zy2FjRCqBSI?si=pgsNVBXDZhkaIgjq&amp;t=1688" rel="noopener">heard</a> from <a>ThePrimeagen</a>: It depends on how far you fix into the future. Short-term autocomplete is fine, but architectural decisions are big no, no’s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/img_Will%20AI%20replace%20Humans%20_eg%20Writing__1744275062582.webp" width="auto"><br>
This is about the bottom where we have time and the left where we have amount of errors. This means that the longer we use AI for fixing something in the future, like an architecture, the more errors it will produce.</p>
<p>If we use it for quick autocomplete or creating a well-defined algorithm function, it’s less prone to errors. In that first phase, you gain 20% productivity; in the later phases, you lose more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is like in real life, the longer I wait with making m decision, the more information I have, the better the decison will be. And is exactly what <a>Shape Up</a> preaches with maximum deciding for 6 weeks (a cycle),  don’t have roadmaps and backlogs for longer than that in the future. Similar is it with using AI, as all of it is predicted probability.</p></blockquote>

<a href="#soulless"><h2 id="soulless"><span arialabel="Anchor"># </span>Soulless</h2></a>
<p>Nobody wants to read some <a>soulless</a> text, and what if it’s even good? Where do you get more from? I think this is a big trap that only over time people will realize. Sure, they help, and everyone needs to use them for “certain” tasks, but not the writing itself.</p>
<p>In the end, LLMs and AI require guidance; they’re just probabilities. See also <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/writing-manually" rel="noopener" data-src="/brain/writing-manually">Writing Manually</a>.</p>
<a href="#distraction"><h2 id="distraction"><span arialabel="Anchor"># </span>Distraction</h2></a>
<p>I think we will be more distracted than ever. We can’t even have 2 seconds to think before Grammarly, Copilot, or Cursor suggests something. So instead of doing the thinking, we just cruise on. We are losing the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>It brings me back to the article I wrote recently about «

<a href="https://ssp.sh/blog/finding-flow/" rel="noopener">Finding Flow</a>». More on <a>Don’t use AI for everything, you stop thinking-learning AI Use</a> and <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/writing-is-hard#is-ai-solving-this" rel="noopener" data-src="/brain/writing-is-hard">Writing is Hard</a>.</p>
<a href="#dont-get-me-wrong"><h2 id="dont-get-me-wrong"><span arialabel="Anchor"># </span>Don’t Get Me Wrong</h2></a>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I use it every day, too. But more deliberately. I turned off my <a>Grammarly</a> and my Copilot (a long time ago), so I have the space to think and to learn. If you do it once or twice, that’s OK, but if you do it everywhere, you also lose the ability to learn new skills or the <a>fun</a> of it.</p>
<p>Interesting about the <a>LCI (LLM Collaborative Intelligence)</a>, and sure, there will be a lot of benefits, but I am not sure if these insights are anything that comes close to a human insight that <strong>has felt, sensed, or experienced</strong> something through hardship. So yes, but I do not have many expectations, nor do I want it to create new insights. This is the fun part of my job :)</p>
<a href="#exercising-a-skill"><h3 id="exercising-a-skill"><span arialabel="Anchor"># </span>Exercising a Skill</h3></a>
<p>It’s never always or never; it’s in between. The problem with learning is if you use it often, I’d argue that you, in fact, don’t learn much. You just copy and paste in writing or just tab tab tab in coding. The learning is gone. And do that often enough; our brain is not used to learning or, more critically, thinking anymore. Same as remembering, how good can we remember mobile phone numbers? not really, but I could very well during the early phone times because I trained it every day.</p>
<p>It’s all a matter of exercise, and I learned for myself—it doesn’t have to be true for everyone—that I didn’t learn or think anymore. And frankly, it was also not fun anymore. That’s to be said in the stuff I know well.</p>
<p>In other areas, like creating an image (like the one I created for this article 😆) or updating my website’s front page with HTML/CSS, which would have taken me much longer as I don’t practice, it helped a lot. But I’d argue the fact that I didn’t learn anything new except prompting Claude Code :). It’s all tradeoffs, as always, right? :)</p>

<p>2.5 years into the AI craze, and I continue to firmly believe that if your company wasn’t already interesting/succeeding without AI, then doing “whatever plus AI” isn’t going to save you. For the few that seem this way (eg Cursor), I think their moat is a lot weaker than it seems. You have to play the game and the game is AI, but I don’t think it’s a defensible foundational capability. Might play out as an excellent land and grab strategy to buy you time to fill out the meat though. <a>Mitchell Hashimoto</a> on

<blockquote>
<p>Some people today are <strong>discouraging others from learning programming</strong> on the grounds AI will automate it. This advice will be seen as some of <strong>the worst career advice ever given</strong>. I disagree with the Turing Award and Nobel prize winner who wrote, “It is far more likely that the programming occupation will become extinct […] than that it will become all-powerful. More and more, computers will program themselves.”​ Statements discouraging people from learning to code are harmful!</p>
<p>In the 1960s, when programming moved from punchcards (where a programmer had to laboriously make holes in physical cards to write code character by character) to keyboards with terminals, programming became easier. And that made it a better time than before to begin programming. Yet it was in this era that Nobel laureate Herb Simon wrote the words quoted in the first paragraph. Today’s arguments not to learn to code continue to echo his comment.</p>
<p>As coding becomes easier, more people should code, not fewer!</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, as programming has moved from assembly language to higher-level languages like C, from desktop to cloud, from raw text editors to IDEs to AI assisted coding where sometimes one barely even looks at the generated code (which some coders recently started to call vibe coding), it is getting easier with each step.</p>
<p>I wrote previously that I see tech-savvy people coordinating AI tools to move toward being 10x professionals — individuals who have 10 times the impact of the average person in their field. I am increasingly convinced that the best way for many people to accomplish this is not to be just consumers of AI applications, but to learn enough coding to use AI-assisted coding tools effectively.<br>
den&gt;<br>
One question I’m asked most often is what someone should do who is worried about job displacement by AI. My answer is: Learn about AI and take control of it, because one of the most important skills in the future will be the ability to tell a computer exactly what you want, so it can do that for you. Coding (or getting AI to code for you) is a great way to do that.</p>
<p>When I was working on the course Generative AI for Everyone and needed to generate AI artwork for the background images, I worked with a collaborator who had studied art history and knew the language of art. He prompted Midjourney with terminology based on the historical style, palette, artist inspiration and so on — using the language of art — to get the result he wanted. I didn’t know this language, and my paltry attempts at prompting could not deliver as effective a result.</p>
<p>Similarly, scientists, analysts, marketers, recruiters, and people of a wide range of professions who understand the language of software through their knowledge of coding can tell an LLM or an AI-enabled IDE what they want much more precisely, and get much better results. As these tools are continuing to make coding easier, this is the best time yet to learn to code, to learn the language of software, and learn to make computers do exactly what you want them to do.</p></blockquote>

When you grapple with a text or book for seven hours, it will change you. This will influence your writing, too. There’s no summary that gives you this kind of in-depth connection.</p>
<p>Also, you can’t prompt your way into it, as there’s no prompt that knows that you don’t know yet, or AI doesn’t know what you wanted to have read or what connections you would have made. On the contrary, you actually lose time reading something, and over time, we think we read lots of stuff, but we actually only read summaries. Full episode on

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/how-install-truenas-on-raspberry-pi">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/how-install-truenas-on-raspberry-pi</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45052429">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now that Joel0 in the TrueNAS community has created a <a href="https://forums.truenas.com/t/truenas-on-arm-now-available/49160/16?u=geerlingguy">fork of TrueNAS that runs on Arm</a>, I thought I'd give it a spin—on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-with-hard-drives.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-7d31be78-66b1-44d6-85c3-3c427ad83265" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;7d31be78-66b1-44d6-85c3-3c427ad83265&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 with Hard Drives"></p>

<p>I currently run an <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/building-efficient-server-grade-arm-nas">Ampere Arm server in my rack with Linux and ZFS</a> as my primary storage server, and a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/radxas-sata-hat-makes-compact-pi-5-nas">Raspberry Pi with four SATA SSDs and ZFS</a> as backup replica in my studio. My <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/arm-nas">configuration for these Arm NASes is up on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I've been looking forward to TrueNAS support on Arm for years, though it seems the sentiment in that community was 'Arm servers aren't powerful enough to run serious storage servers'—despite myself and many others doing so for many years... but that's besides the point.</p>

<h2>On a Raspberry Pi?</h2>

<p>Yes, in fact.</p>

<p>I've found <em>numerous</em> times, running modern applications on slower hardware is an <em>excellent</em> way to expose little configuration flaws and misconceptions that lead to learning how to run the applications <em>much</em> better on more capable machines.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-nas-ssd.jpeg" width="700" height="467" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-4ed5f5d6-1d77-4c2e-b32e-4dd31135ffda" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;4ed5f5d6-1d77-4c2e-b32e-4dd31135ffda&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 NAS with SSDs"></p>

<p>From my <a href="https://pidramble.com/">Pi Dramble</a> to my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/petabyte-pi-project">Petabyte Pi Project</a>, running apps intended for much more powerful hardware taught me a lot. So maybe running TrueNAS, which demands <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/13.0/gettingstarted/corehardwareguide/">8 GB of RAM and 16 GB of primary storage</a>, would be a fun learning exercise.</p>

<p>I've done it on x86 servers, but that's boring. It's <em>easy</em>. I don't learn much when a project goes off without a hitch, and I'm not forced to look closer at some of the configuration quirks.</p>

<h2>On a Raspberry Pi, there's no UEFI</h2>

<p>One glaring problem with the Raspberry Pi is no official support for UEFI, a standard way to boot computers and interface operating systems to device firmware. Raspberry Pi only <em>officially</em> supports device-tree-based Linux booting, which is much less standard. That means you can't just throw any old Linux distribution on the Pi, you have to have ones tailored to the Pi. There <em>are</em> good OSes for the Pi, like Raspberry Pi OS, based on Debian. But it's not the same as <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/system76-built-fastest-windows-arm-pc">grabbing Windows on Arm and installing it on my Ampere workstation</a>.</p>

<p>To get past this restriction, we have to rely on a community project, forked from <a href="https://worproject.com/">Windows on Raspberry Pi</a>. Specifically, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi">NumberOneGit's rpi5-uefi fork</a>.</p>

<p>To get your Pi 5 to support UEFI (CM5 process may be slightly different):</p>

<ol>
<li>Update the EEPROM to the 2025-06-09 release (or later - check what version you're running in Pi OS with the command <code>rpi-eeprom-update</code>):
 a. Typically, you can upgrade using <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>, <code>sudo apt full-upgrade -y</code>, or <code>sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a</code>. However, at the time of this writing, those methods will get you to the latest stable release (2025-05-08), so until then, use one of these methods:
 b. Manually update the bootloader with <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot"><code>usbboot</code></a> from source.
 c. Switch to the beta bootloader release channel: <code>sudo nano /etc/default/rpi-eeprom-update</code>, then change <code>latest</code> to <code>beta</code>, and run <code>sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a</code>.
 d. Verify the bootloader version you're running with <code>rpi-eeprom-update</code> after a reboot.</li>
<li>Download the latest .zip file release from <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi/releases">rpi5-uefi Releases</a>.</li>
<li>Take a microSD card that's already formatted for the Pi (I just pulled the Pi OS card out of my Pi 5 that I just used for the EEPROM update), and clear out the contents of the FAT32 'bootfs' volume. Copy all the contents of the .zip file you downloaded into that folder (including <code>RPI_EFI.fd</code>).</li>
<li>Eject the microSD card, insert it into the Pi, and power it on with an HDMI display connected.</li>
<li>You should see a Raspberry Pi logo and the EDK2 bootloader screen appear. Unless you have NVMe or USB boot media installed, it will say "Press any key to enter the Boot Manager Menu."</li>
<li>Since I couldn't find the 'any' key, I pressed 'Enter', then I could navigate through a standard boot manager menu. In there you can configure SD card speeds, set the PCIe bus speed, etc.</li>
<li>After you've changed the settings to your liking (see some <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi?tab=readme-ov-file#linux">suggestions for Linux</a>), save and reset.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that the Pi is booting into UEFI mode, you can install TrueNAS. To do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download a TrueNAS on Arm ISO from <a href="https://truenas-releases.jmay.us/">https://truenas-releases.jmay.us</a> (I chose <a href="https://truenas-releases.jmay.us/TrueNAS-SCALE-Fangtooth/TrueNAS-SCALE-25.04.2-aarch64.iso">25.04.2</a>).</li>
<li>Use a tool like <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Etcher</a> to write the ISO to a USB drive.</li>
<li>After Etcher finishes, eject the USB drive and insert it into the Pi (I used a USB 3 thumb drive, so I inserted it into one of the blue USB 3 ports on the Pi for maximum speed).</li>
<li>If it doesn't automatically boot to the TrueNAS installer, select the external USB drive in the UEFI boot manager and boot into the TrueNAS installer.</li>
<li>Follow the TrueNAS installer's prompts to install TrueNAS on any device other than the installer drive or the microSD card (I used a second USB flash drive plugged into the other USB 3 port). Wait for installation to complete.</li>
<li>When prompted, reboot and remove the USB drive.</li>
</ol>

<p>TrueNAS SCALE should boot up, and the first boot can take a while as many services need to generate files, configure services, and start them the first time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/truenas-raspberry-pi-5-setup-ix-etc-fail.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-5a56a1cc-dac6-405d-80d3-43c1183099c5" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;5a56a1cc-dac6-405d-80d3-43c1183099c5&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="TrueNAS installer ix-etc failure to start"></p>

<p>In my case, on first boot, the <code>ix-etc</code> service failed to start (it timed out), and its purpose is to <code>Generate TrueNAS /etc files</code>. After booting, I chose to enter the Linux console, then ran <code>systemctl start ix-etc</code>, and rebooted.</p>

<p>After a reboot, TrueNAS seemed to launch all its services without issue, including the web UI. I visited the IP address printed on the console, logged in as the admin user I set up during install, and was greeted with the TrueNAS dashboard:</p>

<h2>Current Limitations</h2>

<p>Right now, most of the limitations are around <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-peripherals-in-uefi">missing features in UEFI mode</a>; since Raspberry Pi hasn't pushed RP1 support into the Linux kernel, and nobody's yet reverse-engineered RP1 interfaces, you can't use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fan header PWM support (no fan control)</li>
<li>CSI/DSI connections for displays/cameras</li>
<li>GPIO</li>
<li>Built-in Ethernet</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ethernet limitation is especially annoying, as you are <em>forced</em> to use an external USB Ethernet dongle, just like on most non-Qualcomm systems running Windows on Arm.</p>

<p>Andrea della Porta from SUSE is <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Raspberry-Pi-5-RP1-Linux-RFC">working on upstreaming RP1 support into Linux</a> with some <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=360653">help from Raspberry Pi</a>, but progress has been a bit slow.</p>

<p>What I've been wondering lately, more and more: <em>why doesn't Raspberry Pi consider official UEFI support in the first place?</em> With or <em>without</em> Microsoft's official blessing, being able to boot vanilla Windows 11 for Arm on the Pi would be neat. Not to mention, any regular Linux Arm distro (including TrueNAS SCALE) would boot too...</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>I recently received a new hardware project, the <a href="https://github.com/kelroy1990/Homelabs-Pi-Storage">Homelabs Pi Storage server</a>, which uses a custom CM5 SATA backplane and a 3D printable enclosure for a 6-bay NAS:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/homelabs-pi-storage-server-cm5.jpeg" width="700" height="467" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-23a178a0-d361-429c-8b65-d81dad1d2162" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;23a178a0-d361-429c-8b65-d81dad1d2162&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Homelabs Pi Storage server"></p>

<p>I got TrueNAS installed on a CM5 Lite (using the same process as above), but when I installed four SATA hard drives, they spun up, but were not recognized. Right now the <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi/issues/21">Pi 5 UEFI support doesn't allow for more than one PCIe device</a>, and the Homelabs Pi Storage server has a PCIe switch that branches off to 2.5 Gbps Ethernet and a 6-port SATA controller.</p>

<p>These devices all work perfectly out of the box on Raspberry Pi OS (and I was able to set up a ZFS array, getting 250 MB/s over the built-in 2.5G Ethernet—see below), but they aren't recognized currently when running under UEFI :(</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/windows-zfs-file-copy-homelabs-pi.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-87ec9e17-4873-4def-babf-7025dbf865f6" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;87ec9e17-4873-4def-babf-7025dbf865f6&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Homelabs Pi ZFS array Samba Windows 250 MB per second"></p>

<p>I'm already running vanilla ZFS under Raspberry Pi OS on my other <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/radxas-sata-hat-makes-compact-pi-5-nas">Raspberry Pi storage server</a>, and that's running on four SSDs and no hard drives. It can sustain 200 MB/sec writes, and I presume TrueNAS would be able to do the same.</p>

<p>There are also NVMe-only boards, like the <a href="https://amzn.to/41Us51s">$50 GeeekPi N16 Quad-NVMe HAT</a>, which provide a pretty small footprint all-flash server option. But again, since those boards use switch chips (because the Pi is limited to 1 PCIe lane), none of those drives would be accessible to TrueNAS as it stands today. Your best bet if you want to use <em>TrueNAS</em> instead of just managing ZFS on you own on a Pi would be to use a single-purpose HAT or SATA controller or HBA in IT mode, to connect disks directly to the Pi.</p>

<p>Because of the current UEFI limitations, I would still recommend running TrueNAS on higher-end Arm hardware (like Ampere servers). If you want to stick to an SBC, there's <a href="https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk3588">UEFI firmware for RK3588 platforms</a> under active development. It may offer even more functionality for some boards, so check the <a href="https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk3588?tab=readme-ov-file#platinum">compatibility list</a>.</p>

<p>Or you could be boring and just install TrueNAS on x86, where it's fully supported ;)</p></div></div>]]></description>
