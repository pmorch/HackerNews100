<h3>from the <i>I-can't-drive-55</i> dept</h3>

<p>Last September, Mozilla came out with a <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/">privacy study</a> indicating that the auto industry was <strong>the worst tech industry the organization tracked</strong>. Mozilla found that not only does the industry hoover up a ton of data from your use of vehicles, it collects and monetizes most of the data on your phone. Often without transparency or adequate safeguards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚Äú<strong>All 25 car brands we researched earned our *Privacy Not Included warning label ‚Äî making cars the official worst category of products for privacy that we have ever reviewed.</strong>‚Äú</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward to this week, and the New York Times‚Äô Kashmir Hill has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html?unlocked_article_code=1.cE0.jN6D.nfeyIYUoly5W&amp;smid=url-share">a new story</a> exploring how the auto industry is also collecting reams of personal driving data, then sharing it with your insurance company. More specifically, automakers are selling access to the data to Lexis Nexis, which is then crafting ‚Äúrisk scores‚Äù insurance companies then use to adjust rates. Usually upward. </p>
<p>If consumer approval is even obtained, it‚Äôs obtained via fine print buried deep in user agreements either in automakers‚Äô car apps or road-side assistant apps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúAutomakers and data brokers that have partnered to collect detailed driving data from millions of Americans say they have drivers‚Äô permission to do so. But the existence of these partnerships is nearly invisible to drivers, whose consent is obtained in fine print and murky privacy policies that few read.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even law professors, who are surely used to reckless treatment of consumer data at this point, were somehow surprised at the cavalier behavior by the auto industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúI am surprised,‚Äù said Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Cornell University. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not within the reasonable expectation of the average consumer, it should certainly be an industry practice to prominently disclose that is happening.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the same auto industry that has been fighting tooth and nail against ‚Äúright to repair‚Äù reforms ‚Äî in a bid to protect their lucrative repair monopolies ‚Äî often under the pretense that they‚Äôre just <strong>that</strong> concerned <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/09/11/auto-industry-pushes-bullshit-claim-that-right-to-repair-laws-aid-sexual-predators/">about the consumer privacy ramifications</a>. </p>
<p>Please notice that the <strong>absolute bare minimum</strong> that the auto industry could be doing here is making this tracking and monetization of your data transparent, and <em>they‚Äôre not even doing that</em>. Because they know Congress and U.S. federal regulators, lobbied into apathy over decades, are too corrupt to take meaningful action. At least not at any real, consistent scale. </p>
<p>Again, like countless past scandals, this is the direct byproduct of a country that has proven too corrupt to pass even a baseline privacy law for the internet era. Too corrupt to regulate data brokers. And obsessed with steadily defanging, defunding, under-staffing and curtailing the authority of regulators tasked with overseeing corporations with a broad and reckless disdain for U.S. consumer privacy and safety. </p>
<p>Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-urges-ftc-to-investigate-invasive-data-privacy-practices-of-automakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a>&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. And California regulators are purportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/california-agency-probes-automakers-data-privacy-practices-2023-07-31/#:~:text=The%20California%20Privacy%20Protection%20Agency,which%20companies%20it%20is%20reviewing.">investigating automaker privacy standards</a>. But a grotesquely corrupt Congress means federal inquiries will likely go nowhere (also keep in mind looming Supreme Court rulings are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/13/supreme-court-chevron-defense-case-00121535">poised to erode federal regulatory authority further</a>). And any inquiries that do materialize will feature fines that are miniscule compared to the money made from the abuses. </p>
<p>The data-hoovering surveillance economy we‚Äôve created is so lucrative, all the financial incentives point in the wrong directions. And the only thing likely to shake U.S. politicians out of their corrupt stupor is a scandal so extreme ‚Äî potentially involving mass fatalities or the leaked data of the rich and powerful ‚Äî that the problem is no longer easy to ignore. And even then, we‚Äôll <strong>still</strong> probably try. </p>

<p dir="auto">Oxy¬Æ Parser does the heavy lifting of parsing HTMLs for you. It uses Pydantic models to describe the structure of the HTML and then automatically parses the HTMLs into the Pydantic models.:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Describe a Pydantic model of your expected HTML structure</li>
<li>Pass the URL or HTML to Oxy¬Æ Parser together with the Pydantic model</li>
<li>Oxy¬Æ Parser will parse the HTML and return the parsed data as Pydantic models</li>
<li>Oxy¬Æ Parser will also cache the selectors for later re-use, so you don't need to call OpenAI's API every time you want to parse the same HTML</li>

<p>The Internal Revenue Service's free tax filing service, Direct File, is now available in 12 states for taxpayers with simple tax returns. The service, available in English and Spanish, underwent "weeks of successful testing" before the launch, the US Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2172">said today</a>.</p>
<p>"Direct File provides a free, secure option for taxpayers with simple tax situations in 12 states to file their taxes directly with the IRS," the Treasury Department said. "Direct File is easy to use, with no hidden junk fees, and works as well on a smartphone as it does on a laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Direct File shows taxpayers the math so they can be sure that their return is accurate, and they are getting the refund they are entitled to."</p>
<p>You can check whether you qualify to use the system at <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">directfile.irs.gov</a>. Based on the eligibility restrictions in the IRS program, the Treasury Department said it "estimates that one-third of all federal income tax returns filed could be prepared using Direct File."</p>
<p>In the 12 eligible states combined, the department estimates that 18.7 million taxpayers are eligible for Direct File. That includes a high of 5.2 million taxpayers in California and a low of 80,000 in Wyoming. "Thousands of taxpayers across all 12 states have already successfully filed returns during the pilot's testing phase," the Treasury Department said.</p>
<p>The government is calling this year's version of Direct File a pilot program. It will presumably expand to more states and perhaps have fewer restrictions on who can file in future years.</p>
<h2>State tax options vary</h2>
<p>Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and New York worked with the IRS to integrate their state taxes into the Direct File pilot, the IRS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/irs-to-offer-free-tax-filing-in-competition-against-much-criticized-turbotax/">said in October 2023</a>. The pilot is also available in eight states without an income tax: Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The IRS originally said that Alaska, which also has no income tax, was slated to be part of the pilot. But the state was not included in the end. "The Direct File pilot does not support reporting the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend for federal income tax reporting purposes," the IRS was <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/01/12/alaska-excluded-from-free-irs-direct-tax-filing-pilot-program/">quoted as saying</a> in January.</p>
<p>There are different options for state taxes depending on what state you live in. There's a <a href="https://www.fileyourstatetaxes.org/">free state filing tool</a> for Arizona and New York that integrates with IRS Direct File. Users in California and Massachusetts will be <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/state">directed</a> to their respective state's online tax tools for filing state taxes.</p>
<h2>What you can and can‚Äôt file</h2>
<p>Direct File supports employment income, unemployment compensation, Social Security benefits, and $1,500 or less in interest income. But there are many limits that would prevent taxpayers from using the system.</p>
<p>Income types that cannot be reported with Direct File include income from payment apps, online marketplaces, or payment cards; income from independent contractor and gig work; income from rent, prizes, and awards; income from pension and retirement account distributions; allocated tips and unreported tips; and alimony.</p>
<p>Direct File is further <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/income">limited by the amount of income</a>. You can't use Direct File if your wages were over $200,000, or $160,200 if you had more than one employer. Direct File also isn't available to those who use the filing status "Married Filing Separately" and had wages of more than $125,000. For a married couple filing a joint return, there is a combined wage limit of $250,000.</p>
<p>There's another limit related to how you obtain health insurance. Direct File won't work if you bought health insurance from a HealthCare.gov marketplace or if you withdrew money from a health savings account. Other types of health insurance are supported.</p>
<p>Direct File supports the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Credit for Other Dependents but does not support other types of credits. Itemized deductions also are not supported, though the IRS says that about 90 percent of people filing federal taxes use the standard deduction.</p>

          <p>We‚Äôre Fly.io and we transmute containers into VMs, running them on our hardware around the world with the power of Firecracker alchemy. We do a lot of stuff with WireGuard, which has become a part of our customer API. This is a quick story about some tricks we played to make WireGuard faster and more scalable for the hundreds of thousands of people who now use it here.</p>
<p>One of many odd decisions we‚Äôve made at Fly.io is how we use WireGuard. It‚Äôs not just that we use it in many places where other shops would use HTTPS and REST APIs. We‚Äôve gone a step beyond that: every time you run <code>flyctl</code>, our lovable, sprawling CLI, it conjures a TCP/IP stack out of thin air, with its own IPv6 address, and speaks directly to Fly Machines running on our networks.</p>

<p>There are plusses and minuses to this approach, which we talked about <a href="https://fly.io/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/" title="">in a blog post a couple years back</a>. Some things, like remote-operated Docker builders, get easier to express (a Fly Machine, as far as <code>flyctl</code> is concerned, might as well be on the same LAN). But everything generally gets trickier to keep running reliably.</p>

<p>It was a decision. We own it.</p>

<p>Anyways, we‚Äôve made some improvements recently, and I‚Äôd like to talk about them.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-left-off"><a href="#where-we-left-off" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Where we left off</h2>
<p>Until a few weeks ago, our gateways ran on a pretty simple system.</p>

<ol>
<li>We operate dozens of ‚Äúgateway‚Äù servers around the world, whose sole purpose is to accept incoming WireGuard connections and connect them to the appropriate private networks.
</li><li>Any time you run <code>flyctl</code> and it needs to talk to a Fly Machine (to build a container, pop an SSH console, copy files, or proxy to a service you‚Äôre running), it spawns or connects to a background agent process.
</li><li>The first time it runs, the agent generates a new WireGuard peer configuration from our GraphQL API. WireGuard peer configurations are very simple: just a public key and an address to connect to.
</li><li>Our API in turn takes that peer configuration and sends it to the appropriate gateway (say, <code>ord</code>, if you‚Äôre near Chicago) via an RPC we send over the NATS messaging system.
</li><li>On the gateway, a service called <code>wggwd</code> accepts that configuration, saves it to a SQLite database, and adds it to the kernel using WireGuard‚Äôs Golang libraries. <code>wggwd</code> acknowledges the installation of the peer to the API.
</li><li>The API replies to your GraphQL request, with the configuration.
</li><li>Your <code>flyctl</code> connects to the WireGuard peer, which works, because you receiving the configuration means it‚Äôs installed on the gateway.
</li></ol>

<p>I copy-pasted those last two bullet points from <a href="https://fly.io/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/" title="">that two-year-old post</a>, because when it works, it does <em>just work</em> reasonably well. (We ultimately did end up defaulting everybody to WireGuard-over-WebSockets, though.)</p>

<p>But if it always worked, we wouldn‚Äôt be here, would we?</p>

<p>We ran into two annoying problems:</p>

<p>One: NATS is fast, but doesn‚Äôt guarantee delivery. Back in 2022, Fly.io was pretty big on NATS internally. We‚Äôve moved away from it. For instance, our <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/" title="">internal <code>flyd</code> API</a> used to be driven by NATS; today, it‚Äôs HTTP.  Our NATS cluster was losing too many messages to host a reliable API on it. Scaling back our use of NATS made WireGuard gateways better, but still not great.</p>

<p>Two: When <code>flyctl</code> exits, the WireGuard peer it created sticks around on the gateway. Nothing cleans up old peers. After all, you‚Äôre likely going to come back tomorrow and deploy a new version of your app, or <code>fly ssh console</code> into it to debug something. Why remove a peer just to re-add it the next day? </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of peers are created by <code>flyctl</code> in CI jobs, which don‚Äôt have persistent storage and can‚Äôt reconnect to the same peer the next run; they generate new peers every time, no matter what.</p>

<p>So, we ended up with a not-reliable-enough provisioning system, and gateways with hundreds of thousands of peers that will never be used again. The high stale peer count made kernel WireGuard operations very slow - especially loading all the peers back into the kernel after a gateway server reboot - as well as some kernel panics.</p>

<p>There had to be</p>
<h2 id="a-better-way"><a href="#a-better-way" aria-label="Anchor"></a>A better way.</h2>
<p>Storing bajillions of WireGuard peers is no big challenge for any serious n-tier RDBMS. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbig data‚Äù. The problem we have at Fly.io is that our gateways don‚Äôt have serious n-tier RDBMSs. They‚Äôre small. Scrappy. They live off the land.</p>

<p>Seriously, though: you could store every WireGuard peer everybody has ever used at Fly.io in a single SQLite database, easily.  What you can‚Äôt do is store them all in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>So, at some point, as you push more and more peer configurations to a gateway, you have to start making decisions about which peers you‚Äôll enable in the kernel, and which you won‚Äôt.</p>

<p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we just didn‚Äôt have this problem? What if, instead of pushing configs to gateways, we had the gateways pull them from our API on demand?</p>

<p>If you did that, peers would only have to be added to the kernel when the client wanted to connect. You could yeet them out of the kernel any time you wanted; the next time the client connected, they‚Äôd just get pulled again, and everything would work fine.</p>

<p>The problem you quickly run into to build this design is that Linux kernel WireGuard doesn‚Äôt have a feature for installing peers on demand. However:</p>
<h2 id="it-is-possible-to-jit-wireguard-peers"><a href="#it-is-possible-to-jit-wireguard-peers" aria-label="Anchor"></a>It is possible to JIT WireGuard peers</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go" title="">interface for configuring WireGuard</a> is <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/intro.html" title="">Netlink</a> (which is basically a way to create a userland socket to talk to a kernel service). Here‚Äôs a <a href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wg-dynamic/blob/master/netlink.h" title="">summary of it as a C API</a>. Note that there‚Äôs no API call to subscribe for ‚Äúincoming connection attempt‚Äù events.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs OK! We can just make our own events. WireGuard connection requests are packets, and they‚Äôre easily identifiable, so we can efficiently snatch them with a BPF filter and a <a href="https://github.com/google/gopacket" title="">packet socket</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it‚Äôs even easier for us to get the raw WireGuard packets, because our users now default to WebSockets WireGuard (which is just an unauthenticated WebSockets connect that shuttles framed UDP packets to and from an interface on the gateway), so that people who have trouble talking end-to-end in UDP can bring connections up.</p>
<p>We own the daemon code for that, and can just hook the packet receive function to snarf WireGuard packets.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not obvious, but WireGuard doesn‚Äôt have notions of ‚Äúclient‚Äù or ‚Äúserver‚Äù. It‚Äôs a pure point-to-point protocol; peers connect to each other when they have traffic to send. The first peer to connect is called the <strong>initiator</strong>, and the peer it connects to is the <strong>responder</strong>.</p>

<p>For Fly.io, <code>flyctl</code> is typically our initiator,  sending a single UDP packet to the gateway, which is the responder. According <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf" title="">to the WireGuard paper</a>, this first packet is a <code>handshake initiation</code>.  It gets better: the packet type is recorded in a single plaintext byte. So this simple BPF filter catches all the incoming connections: <code>udp and dst port 51820 and udp[8] = 1</code>.</p>

<p>In most other protocols, we‚Äôd be done at this point; we‚Äôd just scrape the username or whatnot out of the packet, go fetch the matching configuration, and install it in the kernel. With WireGuard, not so fast. WireGuard is based on Trevor Perrin‚Äôs <a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/" title="">Noise Protocol Framework</a>, and Noise goes way out of its way to <a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#identity-hiding" title="">hide identities</a> during handshakes. To identify incoming requests, we‚Äôll need to run enough Noise cryptography to decrypt the identity.</p>

<p>The code to do this is fussy, but it‚Äôs relatively short (about 200 lines). Helpfully, the kernel Netlink interface will give a privileged process the private key for an interface, so the secrets we need to unwrap WireGuard are easy to get. Then it‚Äôs just a matter of running the first bit of the Noise handshake. If you‚Äôre that kind of nerdy, <a href="https://gist.github.com/tqbf/9f2c2852e976e6566f962d9bca83062b" title="">here‚Äôs the code.</a></p>

<p>At this point, we have the event feed we wanted: the public keys of every user trying to making a WireGuard connection to our gateways. We keep a rate-limited cache in SQLite, and when we see new peers, we‚Äôll make an internal HTTP API request to fetch the matching peer information and install it. This fits nicely into the little daemon that already runs on our gateways to manage WireGuard, and allows us to ruthlessly and recklessly remove stale peers with a <code>cron</code> job.</p>

<p>But wait! There‚Äôs more! We bounced this plan off Jason Donenfeld, and he tipped us off on a sneaky feature of the Linux WireGuard Netlink interface.</p>
<p>Jason is the hardest working person in show business.</p>
<p>Our API fetch for new peers is generally not going to be fast enough to respond to the first handshake initiation message a new client sends us. That‚Äôs OK; WireGuard is pretty fast about retrying. But we can do better.</p>

<p>When we get an incoming initiation message, we have the 4-tuple address of the desired connection, including the ephemeral source port <code>flyctl</code> is using. We can install the peer as if we‚Äôre the initiator, and <code>flyctl</code> is the responder. The Linux kernel will initiate a WireGuard connection back to <code>flyctl</code>. This works; the protocol doesn‚Äôt care a whole lot who‚Äôs the server and who‚Äôs the client. We get new connections established about as fast as they can possibly be installed.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve been running this in production for a few weeks and we‚Äôre feeling pretty happy about it. We went from thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of stale WireGuard peers on a gateway to what rounds to none. Gateways now hold a lot less state, are faster at setting up peers, and can be rebooted without having to wait for many unused peers to be loaded back into the kernel.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll leave you with this happy Grafana chart from the day of the switchover.</p>

<p><img alt="a Grafana chart of 'kernel_stale_wg_peer_count' vs. time. For the first few hours, all traces are flat. Most are at values between 0 and 50,000 and the top-most is just under 550,000. Towards the end of the graph, each line in turn jumps sharply down to the bottom, and at the end of the chart all datapoints are indistinguishable from 0." src="https://fly.io/blog/jit-wireguard-peers/assets/wireguard-peers-graph.webp"></p>

<p><strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> Despite our tearful protests, Lillian has decided to move on from Fly.io to explore new pursuits. We wish her much success and happiness!&nbsp;‚ú®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Recently, a former employee of F5 and main contributor of the Nginx project announced the fork <a href="http://freenginx.org/">Freenginx</a> of the popular web server. The new project was started to <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/K5IC6VYO2PB7N4HRP2FUQIBIBCGP4WAU.html">address a security dispute</a> and wants to be a drop-in replacement of Nginx, run by developers rather than corporate entities. <a href="http://mdounin.ru/">Maxim Dounin</a>, formerly principal software engineer at F5, provides insights into the fork:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, some new non-technical management at F5 recently decided that they know better how to run open-source projects. In particular, they decided to interfere with the security policy Nginx has used for years, ignoring both the policy and the developers' position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Originally developed by <a href="http://sysoev.ru/en/">Igor Sysoev</a> and currently maintained by F5, Nginx is open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, and media streaming. According to the <a href="https://www.netcraft.com/blog/january-2024-web-server-survey/">Web Server Survey</a>, even two decades after its initial launch, Ngnix remains the leading web server serving 23.21% of all sites. In a popular <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373327">thread</a> on Hacker News, user <em>sevg</em> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373804">points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that there are only two active "core" devs, Maxim Dounin (the OP) and Roman Arutyunyan. Maxim is the biggest contributor that is still active. Maxim and Roman account for basically 99% of the current development. So this is a pretty impactful fork.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his announcement on the <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel">nginx-devel mailing list</a>, Dounin highlights the <a href="https://freenginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2024-February/000007.html">initial dispute</a> that prompted Nginx to issue a security patch addressing two critical vulnerabilities. He adds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am no longer able to control which changes are made in Nginx within F5, and I no longer see Nginx as a free and open-source project developed and maintained for the public good. As such, starting from today, I will no longer participate in Nginx development as run by F5. Instead, I am starting an alternative project, which is going to be run by developers, and not corporate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freenginx is not the first fork and drop-in replacement for Nginx: <a href="https://github.com/webserver-llc/angie">Angie</a> was created by other Russian Nginx developers when F5 left Russia in 2020 and it is currently managed by the Russian company <a href="https://wbsrv.ru/">Web Server</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Nginx is an incredible software and platform, but I was wondering if it wouldn't be time to just bite the bullet and create a more modern solution based on Rust. Having a solution that follows a similar model, "understands" the Nginx configuration language, and reaches similar performance levels, but with the memory safety and wide community adoption of Rust could lead to an amazing new project - perhaps even doing to Nginx what Nginx did to Apache HTTP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vincentz Petzholtz, network engineer and architect, is less optimistic and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincentz-berlin_announcing-freenginxorg-activity-7164343754835931136-_GEM?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">adds</a>:</p>

<p><em>This manual supersedes TM 11-140, 10 September 1940</em></p></div>

<h2 id="SECTION_I">SECTION I<p>

GENERAL</p></h2>

<h3 id="Para_1">1. Purpose</h3>

<p>This manual provides instructions for proper breeding, care, and
training of the homing pigeon, and for the selection and training of
enlisted pigeoneers. With certain modifications this information can
be used by all pigeon units serving field forces, both in theaters of
operations and in the zone of the interior. Instructions in FM 24-5 for
units using the homing pigeon in communication have not been repeated.
The mission, function, and operation of a signal pigeon company and the
tactical employment of pigeons are described in FM 11-80.</p>


<h3 id="Para_2">2. Methods</h3>

<p>The methods prescribed in this manual are based upon experience.
Accordingly, if any new procedures are found by experience to improve
pigeon communication they should be submitted to the Chief Signal
Officer for consideration.</p>

<h3 id="Para_3">3. Origin and History</h3>

<p>The homing pigeon used by the Army for signal communication (referred
to in this manual as ‚Äúpigeon,‚Äù ‚Äúhoming pigeon,‚Äù and ‚Äúbird‚Äù) is a
distinct variety created through careful cross-breeding to obtain
maximum distance and speed in controlled and directed flight. Homing
pigeons are grouped in families or strains usually identified by
the names of the civilian pigeon fanciers who bred them for many
generations to develop certain characteristics of performance and
appearance. When the several varieties of pigeons used to breed the
modern homing pigeon actually originated is not certain. It is known,
however, that the following varieties existed in England and Belgium
before the nineteenth century, although the exact percentage and order
of their blend have not been determined: Smerle, Horseman, Cumulet,
Dragoon, Carrier, and Owl.</p>

<h3 id="Para_4">4. Nature</h3>

<p>The principle of using homing pigeons as messengers is based on their
instinctive attempt to return to their home lofts whenever they are
removed some distance and released. They will do this even with an
attached message or other light article. This desire to return is
largely based on natural urges of hunger and reproduction. Because the
pigeon has only one mate the reproductive urge is often the stronger.
These impulses can be stimulated by <em>controlled</em> feeding, mating, and
breeding without harming the pigeon‚Äôs health.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<h3 id="Para_5">5. Utility</h3>

<p>The pigeon‚Äôs usefulness to the Army is measured by the reliability
and speed with which it returns to its loft. Speed and reliability
are largely determined by the pigeon‚Äôs strain, physical condition,
training, and treatment. Therefore any lowering of standards for
these factors will be a serious handicap. Further handicaps are
discussed in <em>e</em> below. Section V sets minimum ability standards for
properly-trained, well-bred, healthy birds to be used by combat units
as message carriers.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Breeding.</span> Since physical characteristics and homing
instinct are usually inherited from the parents, records are maintained
for each pigeon. Then pairs are selected, mated, and allowed to produce
young birds on the basis of these records, plus other desirable
attributes described in section VI.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Condition.</span> The physical condition of a pigeon greatly
affects its performance. Therefore, study physical characteristics of
pigeons and enforce procedures prescribed in sections III and VII for
feeding, watering, and maintaining proper physical condition.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Training.</span> Training of the pigeon begins at an early age,
and is progressive and constant. The object is to settle the pigeon in
its home loft in order to develop reliability and speed as described in
section V.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Treatment.</span> The pigeon is highly sensitive and responsive
to kindness, firmness, reward for good performance, and calmness of
personnel handling it. Make the loft as attractive as possible because
the pigeon prizes its home.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Handicaps.</span> Bad weather, darkness, and injury, as well as
inadequacies in breeding, conditioning, and training, reduce efficiency
of pigeons (see <a href="#Para_9_c">par. 9<em>c</em></a>).</p>

<p>(1) <em>Bad weather.</em> This includes snow, fog, rain, and adverse winds, or
any other conditions which reduce visibility or oppose the flight of
the pigeon. Generally, flights may be predicted according to certain
atmospheric conditions as follows:</p>

<div>
<table summary="atmospheric conditions">
<tbody><tr>
<th><em>Conditions</em></th>
<th><em>Results</em></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Blue sky, high ceiling with white fleecy clouds, and low humidity.</p></td>
<td><p>Very fast speed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Solid grey or bluish grey sky with
low ceiling, no clouds, and high humidity.</p></td>
<td><p>Very slow speed, losses may occur.</p></td>
</tr></tbody></table></div>

<p>(2) <em>Darkness.</em> Pigeons never lose their initial fear of flying at
night, but it is possible to train them to overcome this fear to a
great extent. Their natural instinct and intelligence will come to
their aid. Night operation, however, is considered impracticable for
the Army pigeons because of the highly mobile tactics of modern warfare.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Injury.</em> Injuries are commonly caused by improper handling,
predatory birds (such as hawks), enemy shellfire, or obstacles pigeons
strike in flight. Protect pigeons by destroying all hawks in the
vicinity of the lofts with shotguns provided for that purpose. Select
safe locations for releasing pigeons. Minor injuries rarely prevent a
homing pigeon from returning to its loft as long as they do not hamper
it from determining the proper course of flight. When vitally injured,
the pigeon will continue its return flight until physically exhausted.
Any injury which permanently impairs the eyes or wings of a pigeon
makes it unsuitable for any employment except breeding.</p>

<h2 id="SECTION_II">SECTION II<p>

DESCRIPTION</p></h2></div>

<h3 id="Para_6">6. General Appearance</h3>

<p>Pigeons must look healthy, well-balanced, alert, intelligent, and
showing abundance of rich feathers and sheen. Figure 1 shows the main
parts of the homing pigeon (the right wing is extended for ease of
description).</p>

<h3 id="Para_7">7. Weight</h3>

<p>A cock weighs from 14 to 17 ounces; a hen, from 13 to 16 ounces.</p>

<h3 id="Para_8">8. Plumage</h3>

<p>Rich, abundant, and soft plumage should cover the entire body. The
color itself is of no importance, but rich shades, with the checkered
pattern (if present) standing out brightly and distinctly, usually
indicate good health and satisfactory condition. For classification of
pigeons according to color see paragraph <a href="#Para_26">26</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Para_9">9. Head</h3>

<p>The head should be of a medium size, round or oval shaped, of broad
structure and strongly set. It should not be tight or drawn at any one
place.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Bill.</span> The bill should be of medium length with small
to medium wattles and set well into the head. No openings should be
noticeable when the bill is closed.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Eye.</span> See <a href="#SECTION_VI">section VI</a>.</p>

<p id="Para_9_c"><em>c.</em> <span>Ear.</span> The ear seems to play an important part in the
bird‚Äôs sense of direction. It includes three parts: external ear,
middle ear, and inner ear. At the top of the inner ear there are
three semicircular canals which appear to be the nerve conductors of
orientation. Although no one knows just what helps homing pigeons
find their loft, it is possible that the great sensitiveness of their
ears enables them to receive magnetic and atmospheric impression, and
thereby to determine direction either at departure or during flight.
This theory is based on the fact that atmospheric disturbances often
cause the bird temporarily to lose its way.</p>

<h3 id="Para_10">10. Neck</h3>

<p>The neck is of medium length, with no sign of dewlap at the throat. It
tapers to a wide, well-sprung chest.</p>

<h3 id="Para_11">11. Body</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Breast.</span> The breast (or chest) is broad and full in front;
depth of breastbone should not exceed the width.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Shoulders.</span> The shoulders are heavy and strongly
reinforced with muscles.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Back.</span> The back is well-feathered, strong, flat and broad
at the shoulders, narrowing toward the rump.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Keel.</span> The keel is strong, arched in front, and of medium
length and depth. Width of keel denotes strength.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Abdomen.</span> The abdomen is reduced to the smallest
proportions.</p>

<p><em>f.</em> <span>Wings.</span> The wings must be medium-sized, strong,
well-proportioned, and rounded at the butt, with plenty of muscle.
Primary flights should be of a good width, with plenty of overlapping
space and a pronounced curvature towards the body. See <a href="#Para_11_i"><em>i</em></a> below.
Secondary feathers should also be long and wide to provide a good
covering for the entire back. Covert feathers should be sturdy and
abundant, because they supply additional wing strength, as well as
protect pigeons against adverse weather.</p>

<p><em>g.</em> <span>Pelvic bones.</span> The pelvic bones (or vent bones) are very
firm, close together over the vent, and extend toward the keel on each
side of the vent. These bones form a body girdle by which the legs are
joined to the body.</p>

<p><em>h.</em> <span>Rump.</span> The rump is wide and continues the line of the
back. It is well covered on all sides with fine, soft feathers.</p>

<p id="Para_11_i"><em>i.</em> <span>Tail feathers.</span> The tail feathers, 12 in number, are
short, wide, overlapping, and do not extend farther than ¬æ inch
beyond the wing tips.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p><em>j.</em> <span>Legs.</span> The legs are of medium length and well muscled.
Thighs are chubby. Lower leg is red and stout, and toes are short with
firm nails.</p>

<h3 id="Para_12">12. Respiratory Channels (<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>)</h3>

<div id="fig_2">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p05.jpg" width="439" height="600" alt="TL70172"></p><p><em>Figure 2. Respiratory channels of homing pigeon. (Air
sacs are named in accordance with McLeod and Wagers. Other names are
given in parenthesis.)</em></p></div>

<p>Respiratory channels are highly developed, enabling the pigeon to fly
continuously from 12 to 15 hours. Air circulates through the bronchial
tubes and lungs and also through nine air sacs, from which other small,
irregular cavities extend under the skin between the muscles, and even<span><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
into the inside of the bones. These small air sacs contain a reserve
of warm air which feeds the lungs during flight when the muscular
apparatus consumes a large amount of oxygen. They inflate and collapse
alternately, acting as a lift and force pump which renews air in the
lungs.</p>

<h3 id="Para_13">13. Digestive Organs</h3>

<p>Digestive organs of the pigeon are shown in figure 3 (for functions see
<a href="#Para_50_b">par. 50<em>b</em></a>).</p>

<div id="fig_3">

<h3 id="Para_14">14. Bloom or Milt</h3>

<p>This white, chalky powder is one of the means provided by nature to
protect feathers against moisture during flight. When the pigeon
bathes,<span><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a><br><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> the bloom is deposited in the form of a white scum on the top
of the water. If a bird is caught and held closely, the bloom rubs off,
leaving a white substance on the clothes. Absence of bloom is a symptom
of poor health.</p>

<div id="fig_4">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p07.jpg" width="600" height="112" alt="TL70174"></p><p><em>Figure 4. A flight.</em></p></div>

<h3 id="Para_15">15. Molt</h3>

<p>Molting is nature‚Äôs way of shedding feathers and furnishing new ones
for the entire body. Thus, feathers lost or injured the preceding year
are replenished, and a perfect coat is insured for the coming year. An
imperfect molt indicates an unhealthy condition which will reduce the
pigeon‚Äôs efficiency and result in the breeding of inferior offspring.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Time of molt.</span> Every pigeon should molt once a year. Mated
pigeons start molting approximately 1 week after the second set of eggs
has been laid in the new season. Unmated old pigeons ordinarily begin
molting in May or June. The time young birds molt depends primarily on
the date of hatch. Those hatched during the early part of July begin
with head and neck feathers very soon after leaving the nest, and later
during the year partially molt all feathers. The process is completed
the following summer. Various influences hasten or retard molting. For
example, exceptionally warm weather may hasten it. Poor health retards
and may prevent a complete molt. Early breeding ordinarily hastens the
process, while late breeding tends to delay it.</p>

<div id="fig_5">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p08.jpg" width="600" height="576" alt="TL70175"></p><p><em>Figure 5. Tail feathers of homing pigeon.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Order of molt.</span> Feathers are shed in the following order
(see <a href="#Para_16">par. 16</a> and <a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>):</p>

<p>(1) Primary flight No. <em>1</em> is shed first, and new feathers begin to
grow in its place.</p>

<p>(2) As soon as new feathers are one-half to three-quarters grown,
remaining primary flights are shed in numerical order.</p>

<p>(3) When flights Nos. <em>5</em> or <em>6</em> have been shed, molt spreads to neck
and shoulders.</p>

<p>(4) By the time flights Nos. <em>6</em> or <em>7</em> have been shed, the tail-molt
begins with feathers No. <em>2</em> (<a href="#fig_8">fig. 8</a>), then continues in the following
numerical order: <em>1</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em>, <em>6</em>, and <em>5</em>.</p>

<p>(5) When the last flights have been shed, the molt is practically
complete, except for a few fine body feathers.</p>

<p><em>c. Care during molt.</em> The molt is a great physical drain on pigeons;
therefore, if practicable, hard flying and breeding activities should
be temporarily abandoned during this period. Exercise flights should
be only as long as is necessary for the pigeon‚Äôs health. When weather
permits, the birds should be allowed to bathe regularly, because this
will soften the skin and help feathers drop. The only sure method
of correcting an unsatisfactory molt is to restore the pigeon to
a healthy, vigorous physical condition. No attempt should be made
to aid the molt by plucking the next feathers in order, as in all
probability the new feathers will be inferior, or may not even appear.
The substance which creates new feathers is lacking in the sockets
for about 2 months after the molt is completed. During the molting
period, it is especially necessary that birds be fed rich, oily, easily
digested food such as grain (hemp, canary, flax or linseed) and greens.
This food will keep weight up to normal and insure a good growth of
feathers.</p>

<h3 id="Para_16">16. Varieties of Feathers</h3>

<p>Feathers grow in definite areas on the body. These feathered areas
or strips are known as pterylae. Bare spaces in between are called
apterylae. Feathers are divided into four types: contour feathers, hair
feathers, fluff feathers, and down feathers.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Contour feathers.</span> Contour feathers are large feathers
covering the pigeon‚Äôs body. When the bird is not in flight or excited,
they lie close to its body, normally overlapping and presenting a
smooth outer surface. The larger ones are the flight and tail feathers.
The average pigeon has 12 main tail feathers; on each wing there are
10 primary flights and 12 secondary flights. The bases of these large
feathers are covered by shorter feathers called coverts. These give a
rounded, smooth, and continuous line to the body.</p>

<p>The main tail feathers act as a rudder in flight, controlling the
bird‚Äôs direction. Flying is possible because every flight feather
overlaps, presenting a solid surface on the downbeat of the wing.
Besides, flight feathers provide lift and pull for the bird‚Äôs
propulsion. On the upbeat of the wing, the large flight feathers rotate
in such a manner as to cut through the air with little resistance, and
at the same time to permit escape of air.</p>

<p>The general structure of a contour feather can be best observed in a
primary flight from the wing or a large rectrix from the tail. The
stiff, hollow, cylindrical portion emerging from the skin is called
the quill. The bare quill proper extends only to the webbed portion
of the feather. It has a small hole (inferior umbilicus) at the end,
penetrating the skin.<span><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> Nourishment for the feather passes through this
opening. The expanded portion of the feather, from the tip to the
quill, is known as the vane. The central portion of the vane, which
is called the shaft, is solid. Extending laterally from the shaft is
a web or webbing composed of barbs or rays. These rays are blade-like
in structure. The web of most feathers is generally wider on one side
of the shaft than on the other. The barbs are connected by a series of
cross structures called barbules which can be seen only with the aid of
magnifying lens. To see the barbs, however, apply a slight tension on
the webbing of the feather, causing it to spread apart. The invisible
barbules will split if too much tension is applied. Barbs can be
repaired so that little or no evidence of the split can be detected, by
stroking the feather between the index finger and thumb. Pigeons repair
a split in the barb by squeezing oil from the oil duct with their beak,
and then spreading it on the injured feather.</p>

<p>Feather textures vary greatly with the breed of the bird and the part
of the body from which they grow. When selecting homing pigeons, try to
select those with strong, firm feathers.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Hair feathers.</span> Also known as filoplumes, hair feathers
are hair-like structures interspersed among the regular body feathers.
They are so fine that they are usually overlooked.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Fluff feathers.</span> Sometimes called semiplumes, fluff
feathers are soft and fluffy because of the absence of a rigid feather
shaft and barbules in their web. The barbs are also long, soft, and
fluffy, and present a downy appearance. Fluff feathers grow only on
certain parts of the body.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Down feathers.</span> Down feathers are the soft, hairy, yellow
feathers on young pigeons. They are extremely fine, almost filamentous
in structure. These feathers drop off all through the period of
the young bird‚Äôs growth; a few, however, may remain after complete
feathering has taken place.</p>

<h3 id="Para_17">17. Loft</h3>

<p>Pigeons are housed in lofts which may be buildings or vehicles designed
and equipped for that purpose. The loft includes all the equipment,
accessories and utilities necessary for the care of pigeons (figs. 6,
7, and 8). Perches are placed on the sides of loft walls. When a pigeon
is ‚Äúsettled‚Äù to a loft, that loft becomes its home.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> An <em>aviary</em> is the part of the loft where pigeons can be given
sunlight. It is usually built with wire netting on the sides and roof.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The <em>trap</em> is a specially constructed opening which permits the
pigeon to enter but not to leave the loft. When a pigeon enters the
loft this way, it is said to have ‚Äútrapped.‚Äù A trap which permits the
pigeon to enter and leave at will is called an ‚Äúopen trap.‚Äù A landing
board is placed in front of the trap upon which pigeons alight when
about to enter the loft.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> A <em>settling cage</em> of wire which is built to fit over the roof and
landing board of the loft, is used to aid in settling and training
pigeons to trap.</p>

<h3 id="Para_18">18. Preparation of Loft to Receive Pigeons</h3>

<p>The first step in preparing to receive a shipment of pigeons is to
arrange for their housing. If it is the initial stock for a loft, the
entire loft will be available. In the case of subsequent shipment,
place new stock in a separate compartment for a period of observation.
In order to anticipate arrival of birds, maintain contact with the
agency making delivery. Then proceed as follows:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Clean the loft.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In good weather keep front of the loft open so that plenty of
sunlight and air can enter.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> To keep drafts out during extreme cold and windy weather, cover
openings of the loft with porous materials which will allow passage of
air and will not interfere with the camouflage appearance.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Spread a small quantity of coarse sand on the floor of the loft to
aid cleanliness and to supplement the grit.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Provide 10 percent more perching space than is necessary for the
number of incoming birds.</p>

<h3 id="Para_19">19. Receipt of Pigeons at Loft</h3>

<p>To receive pigeons at a loft, proceed as follows:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Immediately upon their arrival transfer the birds to the loft from
the crates or baskets in which they were transported. The pigeons may
have completed a lengthy trip and be in comparatively poor condition
because of delays in travel or lack of proper care and attention.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Immediately after the birds have been transferred to the loft,
carefully examine and handle each pigeon, separating the healthy
from the sickly. Place the healthy birds in a compartment where they
can obtain<span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> plenty of fresh drinking water, and feed them sparingly.
Isolate the birds which appear sick until they are fully recovered.</p>

<div id="fig_6">

<p><span><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_7">

<p><span><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p><em>c.</em> It is imperative that the pigeons be vaccinated against pigeon pox
if they were not vaccinated prior to shipment.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Thereafter water, feed, and provide bathing water according to
instructions in paragraphs 20 to 23, inclusive.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Make an exact inventory of the pigeons, noting band markings,
colors, special markings, and physical condition of each bird.</p>

<p><em>f.</em> Become familiar with the pigeons while they are confined. Accustom
them to the presence of caretakers and to feeding at definite times.</p>

<p><em>g.</em> Begin training of the new birds immediately. The longer the time
between their arrival at their new home and the beginning of their
training, the more difficult it will be for them to be trained properly.</p>

<h3 id="Para_20">20. Watering</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> The health of a pigeon depends more upon pure drinking water than
upon any other factor; therefore, keep plenty of fresh water available
at all times.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The homing pigeon does not drink like most other birds. The pigeon
places its bill into the water, and takes a long, deep draft like a
horse. For this reason, keep the depth of the water in the drinking
fountain not less than 1¬Ω inches deep. Always supply water in a
fountain or other receptacle which will prevent bathing. Fountains
PG-37-C provide excellent watering facilities for the birds and are
constructed to reduce contamination to a minimum (<a href="#fig_9">fig. 9</a>).</p>

<div id="fig_8">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p14.jpg" width="600" height="529" alt="TL70178"></p><p><em>Figure 8. Loft PG-68/TB.</em></p></div>

<p><em>c.</em> In warm weather, change the water three times a day, cleaning
the<span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> container thoroughly each time. In cool weather, twice a day may
be sufficient, provided the water can be kept clean. Water containing
impurities gives the pigeon a sour crop or acute indigestion. If a
sanitary water supply is not readily available, use drinking water
purified for troops. When it is necessary to use water of doubtful
purity, add a sufficient amount of potassium permanganate until a light
pink color is attained. Empty drinking fountains at night in cold
weather so that the water will not freeze. Having running water in the
drinking fountain is not advisable as it is usually cool and may cause
diarrhea during hot weather.</p>

<div id="fig_9">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p15.jpg" width="563" height="600" alt="TL70179"></p><p><em>Figure 9. Fountain PG-37-C in loft.</em></p></div>

<h3 id="Para_21">21. Feeding</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>General.</span> The health and general physical condition of
a pigeon largely depend on the amount of food, time of feeding, and
the kind of food provided. Pigeons should not refuse food unless they
have just been fed. They will be alert, active, happy, and much more
manageable if kept a little hungry. It is easy to overfeed pigeons
so that they become sluggish and listless. Many good pigeons have
been spoiled by overfeeding. The pigeoneer should hand-feed the birds
and watch them closely while they are eating because their appetite
reflects their general health and condition. Sick birds may be
discovered by their failure to eat. Pigeons become<span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> better acquainted
with the pigeoneer through hand-feeding, and he in turn can keep them
alert and under control.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Method.</span> Feed pigeons <em>twice</em> a day during training, light
feeding in the morning and heavier in the evening. After each exercise,
training, or other flight, call the pigeons into the loft and give them
a small quantity of feed as a reward. While the pigeons are taking
their morning exercise, clean the loft and place in it a fresh supply
of grit and drinking water. Call the birds in when they have completed
their exercises, then scatter the food slowly on the sand-covered floor
as the birds enter through the trap. Scatter the feed, a handful at
a time. Wait until the pigeons have eaten nearly all the feed before
distributing another handful. The feed should be well scattered so
that individual birds do not get all of the choice grains. No harm
is done if the pigeons eat some of the sand, providing it is clean,
as sand supplements grit as an aid to digestion. There are several
reasons why pigeons should be fed only a handful at a time. If the
whole amount of grain for one feeding is thrown on the floor at once,
the actual amount needed cannot be estimated exactly. If the amount
estimated was too little, the pigeons are underfed; if the amount was
excessive, the grain not immediately consumed becomes contaminated and
may cause sickness if eaten later. Another reason for scattering feed
in small quantities is to prevent the pigeons from picking out the
kinds of grain they particularly like and leaving those which contain
food elements they need for proper development. Pigeons always drink
immediately after feeding. When the first pigeon stops eating and takes
a drink, it is a sign that the pigeons have had enough food so do not
scatter any more grain.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Breeding pigeons.</span> Parent pigeons feed their young in
the nest by ejecting food from their own crops into the youngster‚Äôs
crop. Therefore, when young pigeons are in the nest, return in about
30 minutes after the initial feeding and offer additional food to the
parents. When the youngsters are approximately 18 days of age, start
placing a handful of grain each day in the back corner of the nest
compartment out of the way of the droppings. The parent pigeons will
eat a few grains in the presence of the youngsters. The youngsters will
imitate their parents and thus learn to eat by themselves more rapidly.</p>

<h3 id="Para_22">22. Pigeon Feed</h3>

<p>The diet for a pigeon should include legumes (peas and vetch), seeds,
cereal grains, green foods, and grit. The seeds and grains are fed
as an ordinary diet in the form of a feed mixture, but grit is fed
separately. Feed must be of a specific grade and mixture to assure the
pigeon of proper growth, a generally healthy condition, and enough
energy to endure the hardships of messenger flights. Pigeon feed, which
is a perishable item, must be grown under prescribed conditions from
the finest quality seed, harvested, cleaned, stored, and then mixed
when required. When harvested, grain or seed is likely to contain many
impurities like chaff, weed seeds, weevils, or other injurious insects,
kernels which are dead or damaged, and excessive moisture. Practically
all of these impurities must be removed before the feed is suitable
for use. Mixing must be accomplished under conditions that will insure
uniformity. The word ‚Äúfeed‚Äù as used below will refer to either mixed
feed, grain, or seeds, as applicable. A single grain or seed will be
referred to as a ‚Äúkernel.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Suitable feed.</span> Feed should‚Äî</p>

<p>(1) Be sound and have a natural odor, without traces of sour, musty, or
foreign odors.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Be well matured and of good natural color, without a noticeable
amount of dead or damaged kernels.</p>

<p>(3) Be free of dirt, dust, or foreign material, beyond a slight trace.</p>

<p>(4) Be free from live weevils or other insects and the defects caused
by them.</p>

<p>(5) Be free-flowing, without traces of webbyness.</p>

<p>(6) Not contain excessive moisture as determined by the field test
described in <em>b</em> (5) below.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Defective pigeon feed.</span> Defects in feed can be recognized
by smell, visual inspection, or laboratory test. Feed is unsuitable for
use if it has any of the following defects:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Unsound.</em> This condition may be detected by a sour or musty odor
or by an ‚Äúoff color‚Äù appearance.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Foreign materials.</em> Chaff, dirt, dust, stones, etc., can be
detected by visual inspection.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Webbyness.</em> When feed has been, or is infected, with injurious
insects it is likely to be webby. The feed will cling together in small
balls by webs similar to cobwebs. It may also have an objectionable
odor.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Dead or damaged kernels.</em> Kernels that have sprouted, been bored
by insects, or are discolored as a result of frost, fermentation, or
immaturity, can be detected by a visual inspection.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Moisture.</em> Small amounts of moisture cannot be detected without
a laboratory test. However, a field method which may be employed to
determine roughly the moisture content of feed is to place a few of
the kernels on a flat surface and then strike them a few times with
a hammer or similar tool. If the feed tested does not contain an
excessive amount of moisture, the kernels will crumble into small
pieces like ‚Äúcorn meal.‚Äù If an excessive amount of moisture is present
the kernels will become pulpy. When performing this test, remember that
hulled oats, flax seed, hemp seed, and vetch, because of their oil
content, will become pulpy even though their moisture content is within
required limits.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Harmful insects.</span> The two most harmful insects to pigeon
feed are weevils and grain moths.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Weevils.</em> Weevils are small beetle-type insects which vary in
color from brown to black. They eat by boring holes into the portion of
the kernel containing the nutritive elements. Weevils can be detected
by the test described in <a href="#Para_22_i_2_b"><em>i</em>(2)(<em>b</em>)</a> below.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Grain moths.</em> These small moths vary in color from buff to grayish
or yellowish brown. During the larva stage they gnaw their way into
the kernel and then eat the inside portion to secure nourishment for
growth. When fully grown they eat their way out of the kernel. The
presence of moths in feed can be detected by the holes they leave in
kernels.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Feed mixtures.</span> Various seeds and grains are mixed in
specified percentages to acquire a feed mixture of certain required
amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Factors determining the
type of feed mixture used are climatic conditions, the way in which
the pigeon is used, and the condition of the bird. Different mixtures
are fed during the breeding and molting period, while training or
conditioning, or while the pigeons are used for messenger service. Use
of feed mixtures is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Breeding feed</em> is used to maintain a healthy physical condition
in parent pigeons, and at the same time supply essential food elements
necessary to raise strong young pigeons.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Training and conditioning feed</em> builds and maintains a physical
condition suitable for short distance messenger service during the
training period.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <em>Special feed</em> supplies energy and replaces the body tissues
consumed by the pigeon when it is continuously used for messenger
service.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Molting feed</em>, a supplementary feed mixture containing hemp,
canary, flax, and rape, insures good feathers and keeps the weight of
the pigeon normal by supplying rich, oily, and easily digested feed.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Analysis.</span> The three principal properties of feed that are
necessary for development and maintenance of a sound physical condition
are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Proteins</em> contribute a large portion of the elements necessary for
maintaining the pigeon‚Äôs health, muscular and respiratory system, and
the organs essential to flying. The most important feeds in the protein
class are peas and vetch.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Carbohydrates</em> supply energy. The portion of carbohydrates not
used immediately changes to ‚Äúfat‚Äù and is held in reserve by the pigeon
to be drawn upon when it is being used continuously for messenger
service. The most important suppliers of carbohydrates are rice,
kaffir, wheat, corn, and hulled oats.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Fats</em> keep the pigeon warm and also build a reserve supply of
energy. The feeds which furnish fats are rape, flax, and hemp seed.</p>

analysis of the grains and seeds used for pigeon feed:</p>

<p><em>i.</em> <span>Storage and fumigation.</span> Pigeon feed procured in
accordance with U.&nbsp;S. Army Specification 24-17-C, is of the finest
ingredients obtainable in accordance with U.&nbsp;S. Department of
Agriculture standards, and is processed prior to packing. If stored
properly this feed will not become contaminated. Improper storage,
however, counteracts the precautions taken to procure best quality
feed. Therefore, the instructions below have been prepared to safeguard
the original quality of the feed during storage.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Proper method of storage.</em> The larval, pupal and adult stages of
injurious grain insects are inactive in a temperature of 50¬∞ F. or
lower. Thus the first and the most important rule is to store feed in a
COOL, DRY PLACE, on a platform at least 6 inches above the floor.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) There are several simple methods of stacking bagged feed. One way
is to stand the first tier of bags on end on a movable floor of narrow
boards nailed to joists. Bags should be set far enough apart to admit
air and light. The air keeps the bags dry and the light discourages
rats. Other tiers of bags are laid flat, each tier at right angles to
the previous tier, to admit air and light (<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>). A second method is
to lay a tier of bags flat on two parallel timbers, each tier laid at
right angles to the previous tier (<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) After feed has been stacked, it must be protected against rats.
An inexpensive protective method is to construct a wooden framework
inside the building where the feed is to be stored, and to cover it
completely with ¬º-inch wire mesh. The size of the wire mesh inclosure
depends on the amount of feed to be stored.</p>

<div id="fig_10">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p20.jpg" width="600" height="260" alt="TL70180"></p><p><em>Figure 10. Methods of stacking bags.</em></p></div>

<p>(2) <em>Examination for contamination.</em> Feed stored in a hot climate or in
buildings where injurious grain insects are present is likely to become
infested.<span><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> Therefore feed should be visually examined bimonthly for
presence of moths or adult insects.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Take the temperature of the feed by inserting a thermometer into
the feed, especially in the bags at the center of the pile. If it
exceeds 75¬∞ F. make a closer and more frequent examination.</p>

<p id="Para_22_i_2_b">(<em>b</em>) A simple and practical test to discover the presence of insects
is to place a quantity of the questionable feed in a sieve with
1/16-inch wire mesh (sieve PG-35), and shake over a white cloth or
paper. Examine screenings and if insects are present, fumigate the feed
according to instructions in (3) below to prevent further damage and
ultimate ruin.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Fumigation.</em> There are three methods for fumigating contaminated
pigeon feed available to pigeon units.</p>

<div id="fig_11">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p21.jpg" width="528" height="600" alt="TL70217"></p><p><em>Figure 11. Bath Pan PG-38.</em></p></div>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Quartermaster, fumigation and bath companies (T/O &amp; E 10-257)
have facilities, such as portable methyl bromide fumigation chambers,
for delousing clothing which may be used for fumigating pigeon feed.
These units are generally assigned to posts, camps, or stations and
to theaters of operations, and their services may be obtained. To use
their equipment,<span><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> load chamber with bags of contaminated feed, seal,
and charge it with a 2-pound can of methyl bromide, Stock Number 51M892
(see Quartermaster supplement of the Federal Standard Stock Catalog).
Feed should remain in the chamber for at least 24 hours. Temperature of
the interior of the chamber should be maintained at a minimum of 70¬∞ F.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) If a portable fumigation chamber is not available, a building
which can be tightly sealed, like those used for training purposes
in the Chemical Warfare Service, may be used. The feed should be
loaded into the vault so that the entire floor space is utilized. Seal
vault tightly and apply methyl bromide from the outside of the vault
through a ¬º-inch diameter copper tubing at the top of the chamber.
The connection between the tubing and the methyl bromide container
should allow no leakage. The feed should remain in the vault for at
least 24 hours. The temperature of the interior of the vault should
be maintained at a minimum of 75¬∞ F. for best results. Use at least
1 pound of methyl bromide per 1,000 cubic feet of space. After the
24-hour exposure period, open vault and air it for a few hours before
removing feed. Methyl bromide is toxic to human beings. Therefore,
before opening or entering the vault after the exposure period, the
fumigator should wear a gas mask type M9A1, with a standard service
canister.</p>

<div id="fig_12">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p22.jpg" width="596" height="600" alt="TL70181"></p><p><em>Figure 12. Catching pigeon in loft.</em></p></div>

<p>(<em>c</em>) If a portable fumigation chamber or gas tight vault is not
available, ‚Äútarpaulin method‚Äù of fumigation may be used. Sweep clear
the floor<span><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> (preferably cement) where the feed is to be placed for
fumigation. Stack the bags of feed in a square area to a height of 5
or 6 feet. After the feed is stacked, center four bags of feed in an
upright position on top of the pile to form a gas expansion dome. Throw
a tarpaulin which is large enough to cover completely the entire pile
of feed over the pile. Allow a minimum margin of 2 feet on the floor
for sealing. The tarpaulin should be of treated material, preferably
rubberized, to prevent leakage and to be impervious to the fumigant.
Seal the marginal excess of tarpaulin with filled bags or weights. The
fumigant is released from the container through a tubing extending from
the container under the tarpaulin to the top of the gas expansion dome.
The same type of fumigant, dosage, exposure, and temperature required
for vault or chamber fumigation are employed, and the same precautions
are observed when removing the tarpaulin after the exposure period. If
circumstances prevent a tight sealing of the tarpaulin use an increased
amount of fumigant to compensate for leakage.</p>

<p><em>j.</em> <span>Use and preparation of grit.</span> Grit is a prepared mixture
which serves as a mechanical grinder for the food in the pigeon‚Äôs
gizzard and assists in assimilation. Grit also purifies the crop and
supplies lime for bone building and forming of egg shells. Many grit
mixtures are available, most of which contain crushed oyster shell,
gravel, sand, small sea shells, crushed limestone, salt, charcoal, and
other ingredients.</p>

<p>(1) Between 5 and 10 percent of the food fed a pigeon should be grit.
Normally 5 percent is sufficient, except during the breeding season
when as much as 10 percent may be fed since the parent pigeons pump
grit into the youngsters when they start eating grains.</p>

<p>(2) A preferred grit is made as follows:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Thoroughly mix (in the manner of mixing mortar) 20 pounds of
medium granite grit, 20 pounds of medium oyster shell, 20 pounds of
medium crushed limestone, 5 pounds of medium charcoal, and 1/8 pound
of oxide of iron (hematite). Then dissolve 3 pounds of table salt in
boiling water and add just enough of this solution to the mixture to
dampen it thoroughly. Do not add too much water. Thoroughly mix the
whole preparation and allow to dry before feeding to birds.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Each of the various ingredients in the mixture has a purpose. The
granite is a grinder and pulverizes the food; the oxide of iron has
a beneficial effect upon the blood and acts as a tonic; the charcoal
purifies the crop, acting as a stomachic, that is, strengthening or
stimulating action of the stomach. Limestone provides the materials for
strengthening the bones. The oyster shells contribute lime which enters
into the composition of bones and egg shells.</p>

<p>(3) The grit mixtures used are listed in the Signal Corps General
Catalog, as Stock Nos. 9A1321 (color red), and 9A1322 (color natural)
‚ÄúSeashell‚Äù or equal.</p>

<p>(4) Keep grit in the loft constantly except during the 24 hours before
the pigeons are to be sent away to a point 50 or more miles distant
for immediate liberation. Since grit contains salt and minerals which
cause thirst, pigeons might land en route for water, thereby losing
valuable time and exposing themselves to the danger of being shot or
captured. Place the grit in a wooden box designed so that the pigeons
cannot easily introduce foreign matter into the mixture. Inspect the
box daily and remove all foreign matter. Refill the grit container with
dry grit as needed. Once a week empty the grit container and clean it
thoroughly. Add a<span><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> fresh supply and destroy the old grit. Always keep
an ample supply of grit in stock at the loft.</p>

<p><em>k.</em> <span>Allowance of feed and grit.</span> (1) The annual allowance of
feed mixture is 52 pounds for each pigeon because the average pigeon,
including those breeding and those not breeding, consumes 1 pound of
grain per week.</p>

<p>(2) The annual allowance of grit is 6 pounds a pigeon.</p>

<h3 id="Para_23">23. Bathing</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> No other class of fowl, except the duck family, enjoys a bath as
much as pigeons. Pigeons that are kept clean have less trouble with
mites or feather lice. The use of a quassia chip solution in the bath
water is excellent for keeping pigeons free from lice and should be
used once a week. To prepare the solution, boil one pound of quassia
chips in 2 gallons of water for 20 minutes. Strain off the liquid and
use 2 quarts of this solution to 3 gallons of bath water.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> As far as practicable, provide bath water daily during warm
weather but omit in freezing weather. Approximately 1 hour after the
morning feeding prepare the bath pan PG-38 and leave it in position
about 1 hour. Scrub the pan thoroughly after the pigeons have finished
bathing. During the breeding season provide the bath after the morning
feeding as usual, but on alternate days provide the bath in the early
afternoon. This method enables both cocks and hens to bathe every other
day (see <a href="#Para_44">par. 44<em>a</em></a>).</p>

<h3 id="Para_24">24. Catching and Handling</h3>

<p>Great care must be exercised when catching and handling pigeons because
their flying ability depends upon their physical condition, and awkward
and improper handling may result in the loss or breaking of tail and
flight feathers. The correct methods of catching and handling birds are
shown in figures 12 and 13.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Catching in crate.</span> To catch a pigeon in a crate or
container, gently force it to the corner or end of the container and
place palm of the hand in a firm position over pigeon‚Äôs shoulders (<a href="#fig_14">fig. 14</a>);
then turn the bird around<span><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> (facing bird to door or entrance) and
gently grasp it between both hands for lifting from crate. Bring pigeon
to normal position in front of the waistline. Pigeons must be taken
head first from all crates to prevent injury to the feathers.</p>

<div id="fig_15">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p26.jpg" width="337" height="600" alt="TL70184"></p><p>(1) <em>Correct</em><span>(2) <em>Incorrect</em></span><br>
<em>Figure 15. Crating a pigeon.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Catching in loft.</span> This should be done with great care
and ease as both the physical and feather condition of a pigeon may
be impaired by awkward handling. There are several good methods for
catching pigeons. The following one has been found to be satisfactory
when carried out properly:</p>

<p>(1) Always catch pigeons while in nests or on perches (<a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>).
Approach pigeon calmly, avoiding sudden movements that might frighten
it.</p>

<p>(2) Grasp bird by a quick movement of the hands. Catch it from the
front, with the thumbs on its back and fingers under its body.</p>

<p><b>Caution</b>: Never attempt to catch birds in the aviary, or when
they are flying about the loft.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Inspecting birds.</span> When examining the wings, back, or tail
feathers of a pigeon, always hold its chest or front portion against
your body (<a href="#fig_12">fig. 12</a>) for security. To examine the head, eyes, or bill,
place the bird properly in one hand using the other hand as a front or
side support, leaving fingers free for examination.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Crating birds.</span> Hold the bird with your thumb across its
back and its legs between your first two fingers; place the palm of the
other hand over the front part of the pigeon, extend fingers downward
in the direction of the keel (<a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>), and guide the bird into the
crate. Do not release until bird‚Äôs feet are firmly on crate floor.
Avoid crating birds with one hand only.</p>

<p>A pigeoneer in charge of a loft can best care for his pigeons by
observing the following daily routine in loft management:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Upon entering the loft, make a general inspection to see that
everything is in order.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Sweep or scrape all sand and droppings and sift through a fine
screen. Add new sand and spread in a thin layer.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Provide fresh drinking water (<a href="#Para_20">Par. 20</a>).</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Provide bath water (<a href="#Para_23">par. 23</a>).</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Conduct prescribed exercise and other training for pigeons
according to schedule. This may include all types of flights.</p>

<p><em>f.</em> Post loft records.</p>

<p><em>g.</em> Prepare daily quantity of feed and give prescribed portions.</p>

<p><em>h.</em> Inspect all pigeons as to condition, health, mating, breeding,
etc., whenever required.</p>

<p><em>i.</em> Carry out any special instructions given for the day.</p>

<h3 id="Para_26">26. Classification of Pigeon Colors</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> The color of the upper body and wings determines the principal
color classification of pigeons. In addition to principal
color classification (see <a href="#Para_26_b_1"><em>b</em>(1)</a> below), include the following
classifications when applicable:</p>

<p>(1) If any of the primary flights are white, the pigeon is classed as
a ‚Äúwhite flight.‚Äù Unless the flights are pure white the classification
‚Äúwhite flight‚Äù is not made.</p>

<p>(2) If all the coverts exhibit a light gray fringe on their outer
edges, presenting a checkered appearance rather than a solid color, the
pigeon is classed as ‚Äúcheckered.‚Äù</p>

<p>(3) When a pigeon has white patches of feathers on its head, it is
classed as ‚Äúpied.‚Äù If these white patches extend to its body, it is
classed as ‚Äúsplash.‚Äù</p>

<p>(4) If a pigeon exhibits one or two white feathers about the eyes, it
is classed as ‚Äútick.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Main color classifications for pigeons and their authorized
abbreviations follow:</p>

<h3 id="Para_27">27. Records and Reports</h3>

<p>The records and reports required for each pigeon unit are Breeding
Card, Pigeon Breeding Record, Pigeon Flight Record, Pigeon Pedigree,
and Monthly Pigeon Loft Report.</p>

<p id="Para_27_a"><em>a.</em> <span>Breeding Card, WD SC Form 1132</span> (<a href="#fig_16">fig. 16</a>). The breeding
card is fastened on the outside of the nest compartment as soon as
the cock and the hen are mated and take possession of the nest. It
remains there during the breeding activities of the particular pair
of parent pigeons. The data provide the initial identification record
of the youngsters and permit a careful check on the progress of their
development. Entries must be timely, accurate, and legible. When the
youngster leaves the breeding compartment, pertinent information from
the breeding card is entered on the Pigeon Breeding Record (<em>b</em> below).
Fill in the breeding card as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Pair number.</em> Number of the nest compartment occupied by the
parent pigeons.</p>

training flight (such as first, second) and the speed attained in
yards per minutes (YPM) or miles per hour (MPH). Speed is entered for
all flights if facts are available for calculation. When birds are
group-tossed, enter ‚Äúlate‚Äù for those failing to arrive at the loft with
the group. If birds break away and arrive at the loft in advance of the
group, note position of arrival (such as 1, 2, etc.).</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Pigeon Pedigree Record, WD SC Form 68</span> (<a href="#fig_22">fig. 22</a>). The
pigeon pedigree record is kept for each pigeon used for breeding. Data

<h3 id="Para_28">28. Banding</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> Each breeding loft is furnished with identifying metal leg
bands to be used in banding all youngsters. These bands, PG-16, are
manufactured in pairs. Each pair bears the pigeon‚Äôs serial number.</p>

<p>(1) One of the pair of bands bears a marking which includes U*S, the
last two figures of the calendar year the bird was hatched, the letters
SC or AAF, and a serial number. This band is placed on the left leg and
indicates that the pigeon was bred by the United States Army. It should
not be removed as it serves to identify the pigeon with its breeding
record.</p>

<p>(2) The other band of the pair bears marking identical to that in (1)
above except that in place of the ‚ÄúU*S‚Äù it bears the letters ‚ÄúUSA.‚Äù
This band is placed on the right leg, and it means that the pigeon was
bred by and is the property of the United States Army. This band is
removed whenever the pigeon ceases to remain the property of the United
States Army.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In addition to the banded pigeons bred and owned by the United
States Army, there are those of the United States Navy, and two large
national associations of civilian pigeon fanciers, the American Racing
Pigeon Union and the International Federation of American Homing Pigeon
Fanciers, as well as those of numerous smaller organizations. The
following examples illustrate the character of the legends used on the
bands:</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p><em>c.</em> When banded pigeons are lost in flight, their band markings are
listed on the Monthly Pigeon Loft Report (<a href="#Para_27_e">par. 27 <em>e</em></a>).</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Each loft is authorized to use various colored, spiral, celluloid
leg bands for special identification purposes. For example, all pigeons
in a particular compartment of each loft may be fitted with celluloid
bands of the same color to facilitate keeping track of them. These
bands, PG-15, are requisitioned in the following colors: red, yellow,
green, light-blue, dark-blue, black, and pink.</p>

<h3 id="Para_29">29. Loft Equipment</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> T/O &amp; E 11-39 prescribes the authorized allowances of
nonexpendable pigeon equipment for signal pigeon companies and is the
basis for requisition.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Army Service Forces Catalog SIG 4-1, Signal Supply Catalog,
Allowances of Expendable Supplies, prescribes the authorized allowances
of expendable items for signal pigeon companies and is the basis for
requisition.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> The basis for other pigeon units to requisition equipment and
supplies depends upon the number of authorized pigeons they have and
their particular needs.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Sufficient descriptive information of items must be indicated
on the requisition to permit positive identification. All required
information pertaining to allowances, supplies on hand, due in (on
requisition), and basis for issue must be clearly stated on all
requisitions submitted to the station signal property officer.</p>

<h3 id="Para_30">30. Message Holders</h3>

<p>Message Holder PG-67 consists of a body, cap, leg clamp, strap,
and fastener (<a href="#fig_23">fig. 23</a>). The body, cap, and leg clamp are made of
transparent plastic material.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> To attach message holder to pigeon, place leg clamp of holder,
around the aluminum identification band on the pigeon‚Äôs leg and secure
strap by means of the fastener. The message holder must always be
attached with the cap pointing in the direction of the pigeon‚Äôs body.
If attached with the cap pointing down it will interfere with the
bird‚Äôs walking. The aluminum bands must be loose enough on the pigeon‚Äôs
leg to allow the message holder to adjust itself to positions that will
not interfere with the bird‚Äôs flying. In emergencies, a message holder
may be placed on each leg.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Pigeons to be used for signal communication should be trained with
the message holder attached to the leg to accustom them to carrying
it. Pigeons should be distributed to combat troops, with message
holders attached if it is known that the receiving troops have not had
training or experience in handling the birds. Otherwise, holders may be
delivered separately. Personnel of a loft should make every effort to
provide message center units being served with necessary information
concerning care, handling, and release of birds.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> To remove a message from a pigeon, catch the bird after it has
trapped; hold it in one hand, extend its leg, and remove the message
holder with the other hand. Release pigeon in loft.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> When it is necessary for a pigeon to carry a message and a message
holder is not available, fold message blank, attach it by looping it
around the leg band and tie its two ends together with a piece of
thread or light weight string.</p>

<p><b>Caution</b>: <em>NEVER WIND a string or rubber band around a pigeon‚Äôs
leg</em> because it will stop the circulation and may cause the pigeon to
lose its leg.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h3 id="Para_33">33. Introduction to Pigeon Training</h3>

<p>It is almost impossible to prescribe any one method for training homing
pigeons. There are certain steps, however, that must be followed if the
birds are to give reliable messenger service. The methods for training
Army homing pigeons are prescribed in this section. However, they are
not the only methods by which birds can be trained. Success with the
birds depends largely on the individual pigeoneer‚Äôs experience and
technical knowledge. This is particularly true concerning operation of
combat lofts.</p>

<h3 id="Para_34">34. Settling Pigeons</h3>

<p>Settling is the process of conditioning a pigeon to return to its home
loft when released. Best results can be expected from young birds just
out of the nest because settling and resettling become more difficult
as the age of the pigeon increases. Many different methods are used to
settle pigeons to lofts, and no ironclad rules can be set down to cover
all situations. The age of the birds, type of loft, and experience of
the pigeoneer will determine the method used and success achieved. Two
settling procedures will be explained in this section. The first will
be for young birds not strong on the wing, and the second for older
birds that are strong on the wing. These procedures are general and
may be used, with slight variations, to settle birds to all types of
lofts. In the case of the combat loft, however, remember that pigeons
are trained to recognize a certain type of loft rather than terrain
features or geographic locations. A combat loft is moved daily during
training so that the birds do not become accustomed to one location.
Otherwise settling to a combat loft is the same as settling to any
other loft.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Settling birds not strong on wing.</span> The expression ‚Äúnot
strong on the wing‚Äù means that pigeons do not have sufficient strength
in their wings to stay in the air for sustained flight, for example,
youngsters removed from the nest when 28 to 36 days old. These young
pigeons are tame and easy to handle; they are not as excitable as older
birds because their sense of fear has not yet developed. For these
reasons they can be easily settled. They are not strong enough on the
wing, however, to stay away from the loft for prolonged periods.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Feed and water.</em> Feed birds liberally on the first day they are
placed in the loft, but never feed them heavily at any time after that.
Make sure the water fountain is placed where it can be found easily.
Young pigeons should be kept prisoners for about 2 days. During this
time watch them carefully to determine whether all have learned how to
drink. If any bird appears sleepy it may not have learned how to drink
or where to obtain water. This bird can be taught to drink by forcing
its entire beak into the water.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Learning to trap.</em> It is of the utmost importance that pigeons
used for delivering messages trap promptly. A bird may be the fastest
flyer in the loft yet be useless because it will not trap immediately
upon return to the loft. The message cannot be removed from the
pigeon‚Äôs leg if the bird stays on the roof of the loft instead of
entering the trap. For this reason it is essential that trapping
exercises be carefully carried out. The best time for this training
is when birds are being settled. Install the trap late in the evening
of the second day of confinement and allow the youngsters to go out
on their own initiative and look around. This enables them to become
familiar with the outside of the loft and the surrounding territory. On
the third day catch the youngsters, place them on the landing board,
and gently push one at a time through the trap. Some birds may take to
the wing but they will only stay in the air a few minutes<span><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> at any one
time. These pigeons will not fly away; they are merely learning the use
of their wings and will return when tired. Place a small amount of feed
in the loft during this training and repeat the trapping exercise until
the youngsters overcome all fear of the trap. After the birds have
learned how to go through the trap allow them to remain outside the
loft for about ¬Ω hour and then persuade them to trap into the loft
themselves. The birds are especially nervous at this time and should
not be frightened. While persuading the birds to enter the loft, the
pigeoneer should give them a small amount of feed by hand, and at the
same time acquaint them with the feed call.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Exercising.</em> On the fourth and following days of training the
birds may be turned out morning and late afternoon for approximately
¬Ω hour of exercise. After each exercise period continue training the
birds to trap promptly upon their return to the loft. At this time
they should be fed only enough to assist in trapping. On these first
few days the pigeons may exercise singly or in small groups. On the
eighth day or soon after, however, most of the birds will begin to
take their exercise flights in one compact flock. As soon as they do
this, exercise the birds at noon as this will condition them faster
and also accustom them to flying during the heat of the day. If after
the seventh day there are a few birds that do not leave the loft for
exercise, induce them to fly by pushing them gently off the loft with
a bamboo fishing rod or similar pole. After all birds have learned to
exercise in a flock for ¬Ω hour or more and then return to the loft
they may be considered settled. They are now ready for their first
training tosses (<a href="#Para_35">par. 35</a>).</p>

<div id="fig_25">

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Settling birds strong on wing.</span> The following method is
suggested for settling pigeons that are 36 days of age or older. It is
assumed<span><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span> that these birds have been trained to trap and that they are
familiar with the feed call. If they have not been taught to trap, then
such training must be carried on in conjunction with this method of
settling. It is necessary to use a wire inclosure such as a settling
cage in teaching these birds to trap because they will fly away if not
confined.</p>

<div id="fig_26">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p48.jpg" width="425" height="600" alt="TL70195"></p><p><em>Figure 26. Hand-feeding pigeons in loft.</em></p></div>

<p>(1) <em>Hunger and tameness.</em> These are the two most important factors in
settling birds strong on the wing, and the extent to which they are<span><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
developed and controlled will greatly determine the speed with which
the pigeons can be settled.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Hunger.</em> Never feed pigeons a full ration of feed at any one
time during the settling period. Keep them definitely on the hungry
side at all times. This serves to impress upon them that the loft is
the place to find food. Hand-feeding will control the distribution
of feed and, at the same time, encourage the birds to become tame.
Pigeoneers are urged to hand-feed their birds at all times if possible.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Tameness.</em> The pigeoneer should spend as much time as he can
in the loft with the birds. The loft should be arranged so that the
birds will be near the pigeoneer. This will serve a double purpose: the
pigeoneer becomes better acquainted with his birds, and they in turn
lose all fear of him.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Confinement.</em> It may be necessary to confine these birds for
several days, depending on their age. A settling cage to fit on the
landing board and roof of the loft may be constructed from wood and
wire mesh (<a href="#fig_27">fig. 27</a>). This confines the pigeons, but at the same time
allows them to become acquainted with the roof, landing board, trap,
and immediate territory around the loft. The qualified pigeoneer can
anticipate by the tameness, hunger, and actions of the birds, when they
are ready to be given their first freedom.</p>

<p>(3) <em>First freedom.</em> Days with overcast skies or light rains are most
favorable for first releasing the birds. Best results can be expected
if birds are released in the late afternoon when they are hungry. When
the pigeoneer determines that the birds are ready to be given their
freedom, or on the third or fourth day of settling at the new location,
the following procedure is observed:</p>

<p>Force all of the pigeons into the settling cage, except for three
or four birds chosen in advance for their tameness. Give this small
group of birds their freedom. Pigeons love company; therefore, after
taking to the air, these birds will usually be attracted back by the
remaining birds in the settling cage. After the pigeons circle the loft
a few times call them in to prevent them from straying. For this first
liberation move the settling cage on the loft far enough to one side
to expose approximately half of the trap. This permits the pigeons to
enter the loft as soon as they return.</p>

<p>When the first group returns satisfactorily, give another small group
their freedom. The number of birds in the subsequent groups may be
increased if satisfactory results are obtained with the first few
groups. If the first group, or any part of it fails to return, however,
no other birds should be given their freedom that day. Repeat this
procedure the following day.</p>

<p>At no time during the first 2 days of liberty should the entire flock
be given its freedom at one time. After approximately 50 percent of the
birds has been given their liberty one or more times, the entire flock
may be given open loft and permitted to go in and out at will during
the late afternoon. Give open loft again the next day at the same time.
On subsequent days allow the birds their freedom each morning and
evening for approximately ¬Ω hour of exercise.</p>

<p>Any birds that fail to take to the air should be gently forced to
exercise. Noon exercise periods will accustom birds to flying in the
heat of the day. When all birds have learned to exercise freely in a
flock and then return to the loft they are considered settled and ready
for further training as message carriers.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_27">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p50.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="TL70196"></p><p><em>Figure 27. Settling cage for loft, PG-68/TB.</em></p></div>

<p>(4) <em>Summary.</em> These essential points are to be remembered in settling
young pigeons:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Teach birds to enter loft immediately after each exercise flight.
Loitering outside may become a fixed habit which will make the birds
undesirable for messenger service.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Never drive pigeons from the loft during the first few days of
settling.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Be sure pigeons are exercised and fed <em>regularly</em>.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Keep birds as tame as possible and do not overfeed them.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) At no time allow the birds to become frightened.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Do not interpret these instructions on settling as ironclad
rules. It may be necessary to vary them from time to time, depending
upon the situation.</p>

<h3 id="Para_35">35. Training for Messenger Service</h3>

<p>This training is started as soon as the birds have been settled to the
loft from which they will be distributed. All pigeons except those
specifically reserved for breeding purposes may undergo training
continuously from the time they are 28 days old until they are no
longer suitable for messenger service. Fundamentally, the methods for
training pigeons to mobile combat lofts are the same as those for
stationary lofts. To avoid confusion, any difference in method will be
noted in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Conditioning.</span> The first step in training homing pigeons
for messenger service is to develop the health and strength necessary
to endure sustained flight. This process is called conditioning. The
degree of training necessary to condition the birds will vary with the
mission for which they are being trained. Birds that will be required
to fly long distances will necessarily be given longer and more
intensive training than birds that will be required to fly only short
distances.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Health</em> of the pigeon is dependent on proper care. Overcrowding
of birds should be avoided at all times. Good loft sanitation and
ventilation, together with proper diet and uncontaminated drinking
water, are factors in health that are under the control of the
pigeoneer. He is therefore largely responsible for the over-all health
of pigeons in his loft.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_28">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p51.jpg" width="367" height="600" alt="TL70197"></p><p><em>Figure 28. Releasing pigeons from Crate PG-49.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <em>Strength</em> is developed by exercise flights around the loft, and by
training flights made from distant points.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Training flights.</span> Pigeons may be given training flights
in groups, in pairs, or singly. This training procedure is sometimes
called ‚Äútaking the birds down the road for a training toss.‚Äù</p>

<p>(1) <em>Group tossing.</em> Three or more birds are released at one time.
Young birds are gregarious and will work more satisfactorily when
released in small groups rather than individually. For this reason
birds being given their first training flights should be group tossed.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Double tossing.</em> A flock of pigeons is released in pairs; each
pair is permitted sufficient time to disappear before the next pair is
released.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Single tossing.</em> One bird at a time is released and permitted
to return to the loft alone. This is valuable training and all birds
should be given two or more single tosses of 10 or more miles before
being used in messenger service. Single tossing should not be practiced
at distances in excess of 10 miles until the pigeons have been well
settled in a particular location.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Use of cage PG-50 in training.</em> Preliminary training of pigeons
should include several brief periods of confinement in the 10-bird
training cage PG-50. After a period of confinement open doors carefully
and allow the birds to emerge of their own free will. The release point
should be within sight of the loft.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Use of pigeon equipment PG-103/CB and PG-105/CB.</em> Pigeons to be
used for carrying messages should be released from these 2- or 4-bird
containers after a brief interval of confinement. This will accustom
them to the boxes before combat use. Make sure fresh water is available
for the birds during confinement period.</p>

PG-103/CB.</em></p></div>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Advanced training flights.</span> Advanced training of military
pigeons is primarily directional flight training, that is, releasing
training pigeons to fly back in one general direction from various
distances along the same course. The course may be north, south, east
or west as determined by the location of the loft in relation to
the point of release. Directional flights are the most suitable for
military use, since speed and reliability of the bird are considerably
increased and the time involved in training is comparatively short.
If properly trained, however, pigeons will return to their loft
from reasonable distances in any direction. A return flight from a
direction different from the trained line of flight would be called
a nondirectional flight. The speed from nondirectional flights will
usually be slower and less reliable than from directional flights.
This is particularly true when the pigeon must fly from the opposite
direction of the trained line of flight. For nondirectional flights
to be reliable, pigeons should be given training tosses from varying
distances from all points of the compass. Since this type of training
is not stressed in the Army Pigeon Service the subject will not be
discussed any further.</p>

pigeons.</em></p></div>

<p>(1) <em>Directional training to stationary lofts.</em> The stationary loft
training chart (<a href="#fig_32">fig. 32</a>) will aid the pigeoneer in directional training
of pigeons when the loft is in a permanent location. During training,
flight speeds will average 30 miles an hour from distances of 13 miles
or more if a direct line of flight is followed. When the training
flights (<a href="#fig_32">fig. 32</a>) have been completed, the speed of pigeons will
usually be faster than 37¬Ω miles an hour. To maintain this speed
approximately once a week give pigeons one flight from 40 to 50 miles
and two or more short flights from 15 to 20 miles. Such flights will
keep the birds in condition for messenger service from distances up to
125 miles. Any bird returning in bad condition will be benefited more
by a rest of 3 or more days than by further training. If birds exceed
40 miles an hour on their first training flight from release<span><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> points
of 13 miles or more, they may be failing to observe variations in
topography. Therefore, to be conservative during this training period,
release them again from the same point in order that they may learn
thoroughly the physical characteristics of the region over which they
fly. This second liberation from the same point greatly assists in
avoiding losses at future liberating points from greater distances. A
second liberation is also recommended if the birds return at speeds of
less than 20 miles an hour, since it can be assumed that they did not
follow a direct line of flight. A second flight over the same course
gives the birds an opportunity to learn a more direct line of flight.
Unless adverse weather conditions exist, pigeons generally continue to
fly in a direct line once it is learned. Strong head winds and the need
to fly around local storms will slow the birds down.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Directional training to combat lofts.</em> Combat (or mobile) lofts
are used during combat when it is necessary to establish immediate
pigeon communication. Since pigeons may be required to furnish reliable
messenger service within 8 days after moving to a new location, their
training must be carefully planned and skillfully accomplished.
Flight training begins as soon as the loft is established near the
headquarters to be served. Until this time, however, the birds are
not given any training tosses. They are, of course, fully settled
to the loft and have been taking daily exercise flights around the
loft at each new location to which the loft has been moved. Give the
birds their first exercise flight shortly after establishing the new
location. After the birds have had a brief rest they are given their
first training toss. If weather permits, group toss the birds many
times each day thereafter. Increase the distance and reduce the size
of<span><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span> the group each day so that the birds may be trained to distances of
25 to 50 miles in 5 days. When giving this flight training, follow the
combat loft training chart shown in figure 36.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Remobile training.</span> (1) <em>Remobiling.</em> After combat birds
have been moved into a stationary position and have been flown from
this location, it is desirable to train them to mobility again before
moving them into a new location. This process is called remobiling
and can best be accomplished by moving the loft only a few feet at a
time until the pigeons again become accustomed to having it moved.
The birds will seem quite nervous and a few may settle on the ground
or fail to enter the loft the first few times it is moved. The birds
should become accustomed to searching for the loft regardless of its
location. After this stage of training has been reached, the loft
should be moved farther and farther away from the old location. Work
the pigeons as a regular mobile team from this point on, always making
sure that the birds are allowed plenty of time in the settling cage
before they are released. This process of remobiling homing pigeons
can best be accomplished with young birds that have not been settled
in one location for more than 6 weeks. If there is a shortage of young
birds and it is necessary to use older birds which have been remobiled
numerous times, transport them to the new location as many times as
possible. Feed the birds at the new location and never at the old home
loft. The birds will thus learn to retrace their flight to the new loft
if they return to their previous location. This method is useful only
when the new location is known in advance. Birds that fail to perform
properly as message carriers and are unsuitable for breeding purposes
should be destroyed. Birds showing symptoms of sickness should be
removed from the loft and forwarded for hospitalization, or destroyed
if hospitalization facilities are not available.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Reestablishing new location.</em> If the tactical situation requires
the message center to be moved forward, a new loft with birds that
have been trained in mobility will be placed in the new location. The
old loft may continue to operate until the new loft has established
reliable communication. This method of operation insures continuous
message service. As soon as the new loft has established reliable
message service, the old loft will be removed, and if the birds are
still suitable for combat loft flying the loft will be remobiled. If
the birds are no longer suitable for combat flying because of numerous
resettling at different locations, or from being settled in one
location too long, they may be returned to the base camp and put in one
of the breeding sections. The combat loft will then be restocked with
new youngsters from the breeding lofts and training in mobility will
begin.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Training precautions.</span> (1) <em>Overtraining.</em> Care should be
taken during flight training not to overtrain the birds. Such training
does more harm than good, particularly if long distances are involved.
Overtraining can be detected by the slightly dizzy, sleepy, and
unbalanced appearance of the birds while resting. When this condition
occurs, allow the pigeon to rest for a few days with open loft but no
forced exercise.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Feed mixtures while training.</em> The birds should have access to
fresh water and grit at all times. Make sure that the feed is clean
and in the best possible condition. Never change the mixture during
training or while the pigeons are being used for messenger service
because the change will throw the birds out of condition.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Training losses.</em> Forcing the birds to undertake distant flying
before they become properly settled to a location causes frequent
losses<span><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span> during the training stage. Care should be taken to limit the
first few training flights to distances of approximately 1 mile or less.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Catching pigeons.</em> The pigeoneer should avoid quick or sudden
movements in the loft and should never chase the birds in order to
catch them. When it is necessary to catch pigeons during daylight
hours, close the blackout windows or insert the shutters to darken
the loft. The pigeons may then be picked up easily with the aid of a
flashlight. The pigeoneer should avoid catching the pigeons in the loft
immediately after their return from a training flight.</p>

<h3 id="Para_36">36. Delivering Pigeons by Parachute</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Equipment.</span> Parachute equipment PG-100/CB consists of a
collapsible, cylinder-type, 4-bird container and a 6-foot hemispherical
baseball-type parachute with a quick release clip. Parachute equipment
PG-101/CB is of similar design except that the container has an 8-bird
capacity and is attached to a 9-foot parachute. This equipment is
specifically designed to supply initially or to resupply pigeons to
infantry parachute troops, infantry glider troops, or any isolated
forces requiring delivery of pigeons by air.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span> The instructions printed on each parachute pack should be
strictly adhered to.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Results.</span> Best results will be obtained when pigeons are
launched between the altitudes of 200 and 1,000 feet with air speed
not exceeding 125 miles an hour. Pigeons launched within these general
limits are less likely to become lost because of excessive drift. The
possibility of injury to the birds from high speed air rushing through
the container, or from shock when the parachute opens, will be reduced
to a minimum.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Instructions for repacking parachutes.</span> The following
method is suggested for repacking either 6- or 9-foot parachutes for
future use after they have been used once for dropping pigeons to
ground troops.</p>

<p>(1) Stretch parachute full length, with one man holding the canopy
at the center of the top and another man holding the shroud lines
taut at the shroud line separator disk. Straighten all shroud lines,
making sure none are twisted. Lay the parachute on a flat surface and
pick each fold of the canopy as one would pick petals from a flower,
dividing the folds and associated shroud lines equally on each side
(<a href="#fig_35">fig. 35</a>). Eliminate creases by running the hand between the folds.</p>

<p>(2) Make an ‚ÄúS‚Äù fold in the canopy lengthwise from the crown (<a href="#fig_36">fig. 36</a>).
The hem will form a large letter ‚ÄúS‚Äù if the fold is made properly.</p>

<p>(3) Lay the shroud lines in small ‚ÄúS‚Äù folds on the canopy starting
approximately 10 or 12 inches back from the hem, making a sufficient
number of folds to bring the shroud line separator disk close to the
hem of the canopy. The parachute is now ready to be folded into a pack.
To do this, make three accordion folds in the canopy (<a href="#fig_37">fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p>(4) Tie the folded canopy in position with two tie cords of not more
than 15 pounds strength. Place one cord approximately 2¬Ω inches
back from the hem and the other cord 2¬Ω inches from the end of the
pack. Attach the static line to the tie cord near the end of the pack,
leaving enough tail for another tie to be made to the other tie cord
near the hem with 3 inches of slack left between the two ties (<a href="#fig_38">fig. 38</a>).
The static line must have a tensile strength of at least 200
pounds and be 15 feet long. The 3 inches of slack left between the two
ties are necessary for each tie cord to receive a sharp individual
snap; otherwise both cords will break simultaneously.</p>

<p>(5) Push the remainder of the static cord between one of the folds in
the parachute. The parachute is now ready for reuse.</p>

MATING AND BREEDING</p></h2></div>

<h3 id="Para_37">37. Mating</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>General.</span> Pigeons will keep the same mate for life unless
forcibly separated. The desire to mate is a natural instinct. Since
pigeons are monogamous their mating can be controlled for breeding
purposes. If left to their own inclinations, pigeons will mate between
the ages of 4 and 9 months. Mating for breeding purposes, however,
should not be permitted until pigeons are at least 9 months of age.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Purpose.</span> The aim in mating is to produce youngsters which
are equal, if not superior, in ability, to either of the parents. Such
youngsters are obtained by selecting breeder stock with pedigree,
performance, physical qualities, and temperament which will probably
produce youngsters of the required type.</p>

<h3 id="Para_38">38. Sex</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> Sex of the pigeon is difficult to determine without experience;
however, some external characteristics help recognition. Under ordinary
circumstances the cock usually has‚Äî</p>

<p>(1) Broader skull.</p>

<p>(2) Larger head.</p>

<p>(3) Larger bill and wattle.</p>

<p>(4) Stronger neck.</p>

<p>(5) Broader shoulders.</p>

<p>(6) Closer vent bones.</p>

<p>(7) Larger legs and feet.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In some cases, where the physical characteristics of the male and
female are similar, it is often necessary to observe their actions when
together to determine sex. Some of the common actions of the cock are:</p>

<p>(1) Chasing hen when cooing.</p>

<p>(2) Scraping of the tail when cooing.</p>

<p>(3) Pecking the head of the hen when she shows no desire to mate.</p>

<p>(4) Cock‚Äôs coo is deep and full, while hen‚Äôs is sharp.</p>

<h3 id="Para_39">39. Selection of Stock</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>General.</span> Stock for breeding at a loft should be selected
with the advice of the pigeon expert in charge of breeding. The
pigeoneer who desires to become an expert in the art of breeding
pigeons is encouraged to study additional literature on this subject.
The pedigree for at least two generations is used to determine probable
qualities of future youngsters since it shows family, strain, and kind
of flying in which the birds excel, as well as the performance of other
youngsters produced by the same parent.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Physical qualities.</span> Pigeons selected for breeding should
be in good health and as nearly perfect physically as possible. A
pigeon which<span><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> has had a serious injury, or has been very ill, is
unsuitable. The following physical qualities are desirable:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Feathers.</em> Feathers should be of good quality. Flights, which are
most important, should be heavy and wide, and should overlap when the
wing is extended, showing no gaps. Birds with very thin flight should
not be bred. Body feathers should be soft and plentiful. Those on neck
and chest should be glossy and iridescent.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Eye.</em> The eye is complex and is of great importance. It should
never be of a sunken or extended nature, but should completely fill
the orbit (bone cavity containing the eye) and be surrounded by a fine
white textured cere. The eye should be clear and bright; its color is
of no importance. The eye may be best examined with a magnifying glass.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The pupil is approximately one-third the size of the eye. It
dilates and contracts according to intensity of light and distance of
object being focused. The pupil should be black and brilliant.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) A thin visible muscle (often called the scouting sight) should
completely encircle the pupil. This muscle dilates and contracts the
pupil. A portion of the muscle may be of a darker shade and located
either at the front or lower front of the pupil. This muscle should
be prominent in at least one of the birds selected for breeding to
produce a higher percentage of dependable birds. If pigeons which do
not possess this muscle, or which have only a small portion of it
visible, are to be used for breeding purposes, they should be mated to
pigeons having a muscle which is more prominent even though it may not
completely surround the pupil.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) The iris determines the color of the eye. It should be well
blended and possess the brilliance denoting life and observance.
Pigeons possessing faded or weak eyes are not desirable for breeding
purposes.</p>

<p>Splashed birds often possess a ‚Äúbull eye‚Äù which has an iris of a solid,
dark purplish-brown color. When this color appears only on a part of
the iris, the bird has a splashed eye. It is hard to detect the muscle
surrounding the pupil when the ‚Äúbull eye‚Äù is present.</p>

<p>The color of the iris may be maroon, ruby-red, rose, pink, walnut,
chestnut-brown, orange, yellow-orange, carrot, violet, grayish white,
or pearl. When the iris consists of one color only, it will be
considered a ‚Äúfull eye.‚Äù Two colors may occasionally be present in the
iris, such as red and yellow, orange and yellow, and so forth. The two
colors should be well blended in any case. ‚ÄúFull eyes‚Äù and ‚Äútwo-colored
eyes‚Äù are both satisfactory for breeding purposes. Mated birds should
have irises of similar shades.</p>

<p>The outer part of the iris is normally darkest; the color diminishes
toward the center of the eye. This coloring is more pronounced when the
birds are in top condition.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The thin line circumscribing the iris should be extremely dark
and very distinct.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) The remainder of the eyeball should be dark and well covered by
the cere. The bird is said to have an ‚Äúopen eye‚Äù when the portion of
the eyeball which should be covered by the cere is visible. Birds with
open eyes are undesirable for breeding.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) The upper and lower lids are a part of the eye cere. A third lid
which is a transparent membrane frees the eye from foreign material.
The blinking of the third lid can scarcely be detected when the pigeons
are in perfect health.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Size and temperament.</em> Medium-sized pigeons are most desirable and
birds should be mated to attain this uniform size. Birds being mated<span><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
to breed stock for pigeon communication should be calm and easy going,
not high-strung. Nervous or excitable birds should never be mated.</p>

<h3 id="Para_40">40. Line Breeding</h3>

<p>The aim of breeding from pigeons of the same or closely related
parentage is to reproduce the qualities of the old birds in their
young, amplifying the good qualities and minimizing the bad. Line
breeding requires the services of an experienced pigeoneer. Only
champions which are physically perfect should be mated. Except for line
breeding, inbreeding should not be practiced.</p>

<h3 id="Para_41">41. Nests</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> Bowl PG-75 is an expendable item made of pressed wood pulp and is
used as a nesting place for pigeons. It is advisable to replace the
bowls occasionally to avoid vermin. Cocks display a keen desire to use
the same nest compartment each time they are mated or, if moved to a
different loft, the nest compartment in the same relative position as
the one occupied previously. If not permitted to do this, the cock will
fight the occupant of the compartment. Therefore, consult previous
breeding records carefully in assigning nest compartments. Hens do not
show this trait, but accept a change in compartments and follow their
mates.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Keep a supply of tobacco stems for nest material in a rack on the
floor of the loft. Allow the pigeons to arrange this material to suit
their fancy. Put a handful of sawdust or wood shavings in the nest bowl
to prevent breaking of eggs.</p>

<h3 id="Para_42">42. Control of Breeding</h3>

<p>The method of control given below is simple, natural, and successful;
it requires minimum handling of the birds.</p>

<div id="fig_39">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p64.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="TL70208"></p><p><em>Figure 39. Parent pigeons in nest with youngsters in
Bowl PG-75.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Time.</span> Since best youngsters are obtained when birds are
mated during February, March, and April, whenever possible, arrange all
breeding for the year during these months. Eggs which should not be
hatched should be replaced with EGG PG-50 (glass).</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Mating.</span> To begin breeding, place each pair to be mated
in its nest, and confine for approximately 1 day. Open one of the
nests and allow the pair to leave and return at will. The pair may be
considered mated after it returns to the nest several times. Close the
nest compartment and proceed in the same manner with the next pair, and
so on until each pair is mated.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>After mating.</span> To minimize the danger of birds entering
the wrong nest and fighting, open only alternate nest compartments for
the first few days after mating.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Following season.</span> Any pair producing outstanding
youngsters should be mated the same way each year. Mated pairs
producing unsatisfactory youngsters should be separated and each
pigeon remated. Destroy breeder pigeons which produce unsatisfactory
youngsters subsequently.</p>

<h3 id="Para_43">43. Laying</h3>

<p>The first egg is usually laid during late afternoon from 7 to 10 days
after nesting has been started. The second egg is laid approximately 44
hours later. As a rule, parent birds do not hover the first egg until
the second egg has been laid. This usually enables the youngsters to
hatch within 1 hour of each other, and gives each one an equal chance.
The youngster from the first egg will be much larger than the other
if the parent birds start to hover at the time the first egg is laid.
Fertility is indicated if the egg becomes a light bluish color after 10
days, or if it shows blood lines after 5 days when held up to the sun‚Äôs
rays. Do not destroy the first pair of eggs as it is generally believed
that they often produce the best youngsters of that year.</p>

<h3 id="Para_44">44. Hatching and Feeding</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> The incubation period is from 17 to 18 days long. The hen pigeon
usually sits from 1600 of one day to 1000 the following morning; the
male pigeon sits the remainder of that day.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The young pigeons are fed by both parents. Their first feed is a
thick, creamy-white excretion produced in the crop of both female and
male (pigeon milk or pap). Pigeons are the only birds both sexes of
which produce milk for their young. The young pigeon places it‚Äôs bill
down the throat of either parent, and the parent in return forces the
food into the young one‚Äôs throat. This method of feeding is known as
‚Äúregurgitation.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="Para_45">45. Identification</h3>

<p>The identification record of the pigeon is started when the hen lays
the egg. Until the time that the youngster leaves the nest compartment,
this record is kept on a breeding card (<a href="#Para_27">par. 27</a>). For identification
purposes, each pigeon is banded when approximately 8 days of age (<a href="#Para_28">par. 28</a>).</p>

<h3 id="Para_46">46. Culling</h3>

<p>It is necessary to cull (destroy) severely to keep the stock in a loft
up to standard. Cull birds which do not meet physical requirements
for breeding<span><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> unless all birds are needed. In addition, destroy those
which show a definite lack of intelligence, or which do not perform up
to the average. About 30 percent of the young bred in any one season
are normally under the physical standard and should be culled to keep
the stock from degenerating. In addition to losses sustained through
culling, 20 to 30 percent of the remaining stock may be expected to
be lost during training flights, as result of disease and injury, or
through additional culling because of substandard performance.</p>

DISEASES AND MEDICINES</p></h2></div>

<h3 id="Para_47">47. General</h3>

<p>Certain diseases attack pigeons. Normal preventive methods usually
protect pigeons from disease. If, however, these diseases are not
detected immediately, they are likely to sweep through the loft,
destroying or ruining most of the birds. It is necessary, therefore,
that the pigeoneer be able to detect, correctly diagnose, and treat the
more common pigeon diseases, in addition to taking preventive measures.</p>

<h3 id="Para_48">48. Prevention of Disease</h3>

<p>Disease prevention is much simpler and cheaper than control or cure.
Medicines are only emergency measures used in an attempt to overcome
disease.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Sanitation.</span> This is the most important way of preventing
disease and its value should never be underestimated. The following
rules for sanitation in the care of pigeons must be strictly adhered to:</p>

<p>(1) Keep loft clean and dry.</p>

<p>(2) Keep drinking fountain clean and water free from pollution.</p>

<p>(3) Quarantine new stock until certain that all birds are free from
disease.</p>

<p>(4) Never permit stray pigeons, wild birds, or rodents (mice, rats,
etc.) to enter the loft.</p>

<p>(5) Never feed pigeons on a dirty floor, because most of the more
serious diseases are transmitted through the droppings.</p>

<p>(6) Bury or burn diseased birds that have been destroyed.</p>

<p>(7) Immediately isolate birds showing any signs of sickness.</p>

<p>(8) After touching diseased birds disinfect the hands before handling
other birds.</p>

<p>(9) Thoroughly clean and disinfect lofts contaminated by disease.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Loft condition.</span> Pigeons must never be crowded in the
loft. It is best to subdivide large lofts into smaller compartments
for better control and ease of observation. Sunlight and dryness are
two great natural disinfectants which should be utilized fully through
plenty of window space and adequate ventilation. Eliminate strong
direct drafts because they chill birds and lower their resistance to
disease.</p>

<h3 id="Para_49">49. Control of Disease</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> Pigeons showing any signs of sickness must be segregated
immediately. In combat lofts there is normally no place available to
isolate and treat diseased birds, therefore, it is usually advisable to
destroy them and burn or bury their remains to avoid contaminating the
rest of the flock.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In any case of disease, the loft should be thoroughly cleaned and
disinfected to destroy the germs of the disease as well as the mites
and lice which may be carriers. Cresol, saponated solution, is an
efficient disinfectant<span><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> when used in a 4-percent solution in warm or
hot water. This disinfectant is issued to signal pigeon companies.</p>

<h3 id="Para_50">50. Anatomy and Physiology</h3>

<p>A knowledge of the structure and function of the bird‚Äôs body helps
a pigeoneer understand his birds and certain of their diseases. For
convenience, the various organs are divided into groups or systems
according to their functions.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Respiratory system.</span> (1) Mouth and nostrils admit air.</p>

<p>(2) Glottis or larynx is the opening into the trachea.</p>

<p>(3) Trachea conducts air to and from the lungs.</p>

<p>(4) Lungs are organs of gaseous interchange. Air spaces are surrounded
by a network of capillaries. Here the blood gives off carbon dioxide
and takes on oxygen.</p>

<p>(5) Nine air sacs cool the pigeon, give it buoyance, and mechanically
aid the pigeon to breathe.</p>

<p id="Para_50_b"><em>b.</em> <span>Digestive system.</span> (1) Mouth is the opening through which
food is received.</p>

<p>(2) Esophagus conducts food to the crop.</p>

<p>(3) Crop, or ingluvius, stores and softens the food.</p>

<p>(4) True stomach, or proventriculus, furnishes gastric digestive juices
that digest proteins and carbohydrates.</p>

<p>(5) Gizzard is the grinding and mixing organ.</p>

<p>(6) Pancreas furnishes digestive juices that digest fats, proteins, and
carbohydrates, besides furnishing certain internal secretions.</p>

<p>(7) Liver produces bile which helps digest food.</p>

<div id="fig_40">

<p><span><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>(8) Intestines provide space for food while it is being digested
and absorbed by the blood stream. The intestines also furnish some
digestive juices.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Circulatory system.</span> The circulatory system consists of
the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. Its function is to convey
nourishing blood from the heart to all parts of the body and to dispose
of the waste material produced by the working tissues. The heart
consists of four chambers: two ventricles and two auricles. The right
auricle receives the stale blood from the veins and pumps it into the
right ventricle which pumps it through an artery to the lungs. Here
waste matter, such as carbon dioxide, is eliminated from the blood
and fresh oxygen is restored. The blood then returns to the heart
through a vein entering the left auricle. Proceeding from the left
auricle to the left ventricle, it is pumped out through the arteries
to the capillaries, which are the smallest vessels of the body. The
capillaries circulate the blood through every tissue of the body,
dispensing oxygen and food. The blood then picks up waste material on
its return to the heart through the veins. The circulation of blood in
the pigeon is very rapid, and with the heart beating 200 to 300 times a
minute, only a few minutes are required to complete the circuit.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Reproductive system.</span> (1) Male birds have two testes
(testicles).</p>

<p>(2) Female birds have one (left) ovary and one oviduct, or egg tube,
through which the yolks pass to get the albumin, shell membrane, and
shell.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Urinary system.</span> The kidneys take impurities out of the
blood, and pass them into the cloaca (combination bladder and rectum).</p>

<h3 id="Para_51">51. Indications of Sickness</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> The common indications of sickness are‚Äî</p>

<p>(1) Refusing to eat.</p>

<p>(2) Dull, watery eyes.</p>

<p>(3) Droopy appearance with ruffled feathers and no desire to move.</p>

<p>(4) Green, watery droppings. If such droppings are noted in the loft
all birds should be watched until the sick one is detected.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The easiest and best way to detect sick pigeons is to observe the
birds at feeding time. The pigeoneer should also examine all birds as
they are being basketed for training tosses.</p>

<h3 id="Para_52">52. Diseases</h3>

<p>Pigeons are subject to numerous infectious and contagious diseases.
These diseases are caused by germs such as bacteria and viruses, and
are transmitted in poor feed, dirty water, unclean lofts, and similar
conditions showing mismanagement. Infectious diseases are contagious if
the birds themselves transmit germs to one another.</p>

<p><em>a. Pigeon pox</em> is a common infectious, contagious disease which
usually affects unfeathered portions of the pigeon‚Äôs head and feet.
Pox often develop on the mucous membrane, lining of the mouth and
throat. In an outbreak, both types are usually seen. The pox appear as
swellings covered with light yellow material and are sometimes called
wet pock, diphtheria, or canker.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The course of the disease runs about 4 weeks.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The virus gets into the skin or mucous membrane and causes a
wartlike swelling, called a pock, at the point of infection. The virus
grows and causes the pock to enlarge for about 10 days.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) During the next 10 days the tissues begin to die and turn
yellow.<span><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span> Sometimes a blister forms in the pock, but only a slight
enlargement occurs during this period. During the last 10 days the
affected tissues begin to dry and form scabs which soon heal and drop
off.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Pock in the mouth and throat follows the same course as in (<em>b</em>)
above except they are covered with a light yellow layer of tissues.
Instead of becoming a dry scab formation, the pock becomes a yellow
cheesy formation.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Usually this is of little value, as pox will run its
course of about 4 weeks, regardless of treatment.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) One percent yellow oxide of mercury ointment will help soothe
affected eyes.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Pock in the mouth may be cut away, and the area painted with
tincture of iodine or carefully cauterized with silver nitrate to stop
bleeding.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Birds that refuse to eat may be fed by force until the disease
runs its course.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Vaccination has no curative value on affected birds.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Thoroughly clean and disinfect loft after an outbreak of this
disease.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> This is simple if all susceptible birds are
vaccinated. Vaccination against pox is one of the most successful known
because all birds receiving it are made permanently immune. Birds may
be vaccinated at 5 or 6 weeks of age.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Pluck five or six feathers from the breast region of the bird and
brush the vaccine into the follicles.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) In about 10 days the follicles swell and a pock develops. This
runs a course of about 4 weeks and heals.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) All susceptible birds in a loft should be vaccinated at the same
time and each should be examined for ‚Äútakes‚Äù after vaccinations.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Paratyphoid</span> is a common infectious disease of pigeons
and is probably the most devastating of bacterial infectious diseases
at the present time. It may affect the bird in many ways, and produce
such a variety of symptoms that it is often mistaken for numerous
other diseases. The only definite way of diagnosing paratyphoid is by
laboratory tests. A tentative diagnosis can be made, however, upon
observing typical symptoms.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The course of the disease varies from a rapidly fatal
blood poisoning to a slow, chronic disease with, or without, complete
recovery. The infection may take place through the egg, by way of milk
fed to youngsters, or by contaminated feed, water, and grit. The manner
of infection has no bearing on the course of the disease. The germs may
get into the blood-stream, go all through the body, and cause sudden
death; or the infection may be less severe and localize in any one of
the numerous organs.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Bacteria may localize in the intestines and produce mild to very
severe inflammation. This usually results in diarrhea.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Localizations in the lungs are very common and appear as hard,
dried abscesses. These are seldom so serious as to cause respiratory
distress.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Joint boils result from direct localization of the germs in the
joints of the legs or wings. Naturally this produces lameness.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Inflammatory reactions of the spleen and liver are often the
result of the localization of the germ in these organs. Chronic
inflammation of the entire liver is also observed. The abdomen of such
birds usually fills with fluid and the bird then gets thin and dies.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Paratyphoid germs quite often localize in the brain and cause
abscess formation. Such abscesses cause a variety of symptoms,
depending on which part of the brain is involved. Usually the bird
shows loss of equilibrium. It may twist its head and neck about, show
trembling of the head and neck, or other nervous symptoms. Such birds
rarely recover.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Occasionally the germ will localize in the eye. The inside of the
eye turns white and sight is lost. Only rarely are both eyes involved.
Such birds appear to be very ill and usually die in a short period of
time.</p>

<p>(<em>g</em>) Germs may localize in the ovary of the female or testes of the
male. Such birds may show no symptoms, or they may become sterile. Eggs
laid by such birds may be infertile. Youngsters, if hatched, may be
weak and die soon after. Germs may localize in the oviduct and cause an
impacted oviduct.</p>

<p>(<em>h</em>) The only definite way of diagnosing paratyphoid is by laboratory
tests. A tentative diagnosis can be made, however, upon observing the
typical symptoms.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Treatment is useless for visibly affected birds.
Neither drugs nor vaccines seem to be of any value in treating this
condition. Many birds recover from mild infections without treatment.
Therefore, the best possible care should be provided for the birds
in order to keep their resistance high so that they can successfully
combat the infection and overcome disease.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Since contamination of feed, water, and grit by
droppings is probably the greatest cause of paratyphoid, sanitation is
the best preventive.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Clean the loft scrupulously.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Maintain sanitary drinking fountains with fresh water to avoid
spreading infection by way of water. Take special care to prevent
dampness from spillage or leakage around the drinking fountain, as this
makes an ideal place for bacteria to accumulate.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Feces from birds with diarrhea should be removed from the loft as
soon as noticed.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Frequent disinfection of the loft with a strong disinfectant like
4 percent saponified cresol will help keep down contamination.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Trichomoniasis.</span> This is a very common disease of pigeons
commonly seen in the mouth, esophagus, or crop in the form of cheesy
yellow or white lesions. For this reason it is often called ‚Äúcanker‚Äù by
pigeon fanciers. The cause is a motile one-celled organism. Only the
common type of this organism will be considered here. This disease has
many carriers. It shows up only where sanitary conditions are bad or
other diseases are present.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The course of the disease varies according to
resistance of the affected bird, treatment, and care. Young birds in
the nest become infected through ‚Äúmilk‚Äù of infected parents. Infection
doubtless spreads by contact while ‚Äúbilling‚Äù and fighting. Germs cause
affected tissues to die. This results in the formation of a sore or
opening down into the tissue with a varying-sized yellow, cheesy
exudate or scab forming over it. Sometimes such scabs become very large
and nearly fill the mouth, throat, or crop.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Various drugs and chemicals have been used to treat
trichomoniasis. However, this condition has proved quite unresponsive
to usual medication. In fact, drugs do not have much, if any, direct
effect on the healing of tissue. All that medicine can do is to cut
down the number<span><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span> of parasites present and permit nature to repair the
damage done to the tissue. Suggested procedures for treatment follow:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Remove all yellow pus patches with cotton swabs. Then paint area
with a mixture of iodized oil and sulfanilamide powder. The iodized oil
is prepared by using 1 gram iodine, 1.5 grams potassium iodide, and 2
ounces light petrolatum. The iodine requires some time and frequent
shaking to dissolve. Make a small cotton swab on an applicator stick,
dip it into the oil, roll it in the sulfanilamide powder, and then
apply to cleaned trichomoniasis (canker) lesion. Daily treatment, rest,
and an abundance of good feed are necessary.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Clean off exudate by local applications of tincture of iodine,
or a mixture of one part iodine to three parts glycerine; at the same
time lesions will respond to such treatment. Silver nitrate may be used
either in stick form or in solution.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Sanitation is the best preventive.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Correct predisposing causes such as wet floors, nests, and
perches.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Try to isolate infected birds, provided the number is not too
large.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Attempt to control spread of parasitic infestation by using a
parasiticide like copper sulphate in the drinking water. This is used
in a 1-2000 solution.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Tuberculosis.</span> This is an infectious and highly contagious
disease caused by a highly-resistant germ which can live in soil for 2
years.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The young die suddenly and old birds waste away.
Grayish white nodules appear in liver and spleen, basket ulcers in
intestines, and yellow nodules in all parts of the body.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> There is no treatment for tuberculosis. Destroy all
affected birds and thoroughly clean and disinfect loft.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Keep all stray pigeons out of loft and maintain
sanitary conditions at all times.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>One-eye cold</span> (<span>CONJUNCTIVITUS</span>). (1) <em>Symptoms.</em>
There is a watery discharge from the eye, and the surrounding membranes
are frequently swollen.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Place bird in a warm room and treat eye daily with one
drop of metaphin, or one drop of 15 percent argyrol.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Provide proper ventilation in the loft. Avoid
dampness and drafts.</p>

<p><em>f.</em> <span>Going light.</span> This is not a disease in itself but a
symptom or result of a disease. Any pigeon showing loss of flesh should
be isolated and observed until the affecting disease is determined.</p>

<p><em>g.</em> <span>Diarrhea.</span> This is not usually a distinct disease, but the
result of some other disease.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> Droppings are green and watery.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Sick birds should be isolated and observed to
determine if they have some other disease. Feeding of rice will usually
check the condition if it is caused by feed or drinking water.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Sanitary loft conditions, proper diet, and fresh
drinking water will help prevent it.</p>

<p><em>h.</em> <span>Sour crop.</span> Sour crop is caused by damp or mouldy grain,
impure water or lack of grit.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The pigeon will sit with feathers ruffled. A greenish
diarrhea usually accompanies sour crop. On examination the crop is
found to be hard and distended.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Hold the bird with head down and gently press on
the crop until all feed has been removed. Flush out the crop with a
solution<span><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span> of 4 teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda to a quart of warm
water. Feed a light mixture, consisting mostly of rice, millet, kaffir
corn, and other small seeds. Repeat the cleaning and flushing of the
crop daily, if necessary, until this condition clears.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Sanitary loft conditions, proper diet, and fresh
drinking water will help prevent it.</p>

<h3 id="Para_53">53. External Parasites</h3>

<p>Many insects and related species live off other animals. Some of these
parasites, like lice, live on the host but feed only upon bits of its
feathers and tiny scales and excretions of the skin. Others are more
vicious and suck blood from the animal. Diseases are often spread from
bird to bird through the life habits of these parasites.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Lice.</span> Lice are undoubtedly the most common of these
external parasites.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Different species.</em> There are at least six different species of
lice that attack pigeons in this country. The three most common are‚Äî</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Feather louse.</em> This is the long, slender species that lives on
the barbs and shaft of the feather over nearly any part of the bird‚Äôs
body.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Golden feather louse.</em> This louse is a little shorter and much
broader and lives on the feathers, particularly on the bird‚Äôs body.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Body louse.</em> This is the largest of the pigeon lice. It lives on
the skin rather than on the feathers. It is thought that these lice,
by biting the very young pin feathers when they are filled with blood,
cause the small pinhole perforations often seen in pigeon feathers.</p>

<div id="fig_41">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p73.jpg" width="550" height="530" alt="TL70210"></p><p><em>Figure 41. Life cycle of pigeon lice.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <em>Habits</em> (<a href="#fig_41">fig. 41</a>). In order to combat lice properly and
intelligently, it is necessary to know something about where and how
they feed, live, and breed.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Adult lice live on the skin and feathers of the bird and only
rarely leave the pigeon. When accidentally dislodged, they crawl very
short distances to other birds. Lice cannot live longer than a few days
away from the birds.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Lice eat bits of feathers, scales, and other debris off the skin.
They do not suck blood.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Female lice lay eggs (nits) along the shafts of the feathers,
particularly on the primary coverts.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Louse eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Young lice eat, molt (3 to 5 times), and grow to maturity in
about 14 days.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Infested pigeons are restless and constantly pick and
scratch in an effort to dislodge the lice. Heavily infested birds may
become weak and thin because the constant annoying movement of lice
interferes with their proper relaxation and rest. Careful examination
of the birds will reveal the lice.</p>

<div id="fig_42">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p74.jpg" width="550" height="541" alt="TL70211"></p><p><em>Figure 42. Life cycle of common red mite.</em></p></div>

<p>(4) <em>Treatment.</em> The use of sodium fluoride is a good standard method
for ridding pigeons of lice. It can be applied in two ways:</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Dip method</em> is very efficient, but can be used only in warm
weather. Birds should be dipped on a warm, sunny day early enough so
they will dry before night. Each bird is immersed into the solution
up to the head, and the feathers ruffled to allow penetration of the
solution. Then the mouth and nostrils are held shut and the head
immersed. The dip is made of 1 gallon warm water, and 1 ounce sodium
fluoride.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Dust method</em> may be used at any time. The birds are held while
a few pinches of powdered sodium fluoride are dusted into the feathers
over various parts of the body. Sodium fluoride poisons lice when
they eat it. Efficiency in delousing birds depends on thoroughness of
wetting or dusting.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Repeat treatment.</em> Neither method above will kill nits nor prevent
them from hatching; therefore, the delousing must be repeated in 10 to
14 days in order to kill newly hatched lice.</p>

<p>(6) <em>Prevention.</em> Normally, only pigeons carry pigeon lice. For this
reason, the spread of lice to or from other kinds of birds is of no
concern. However, common pigeons and stragglers are prolific sources of
spread. Contact in crates is also a common source of infestation. Lice
are often brushed from infested birds onto the hands and clothing of
pigeoneers who later carry them to clean birds handled later.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Red mites.</span> Red mites are a common parasite of the pigeon.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Habits</em> (<a href="#fig_42">fig. 42</a>). It is important to note the difference between
the habits of lice and mites.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Mites live in, on, and under the nest bowls, nest boxes, and any
available crack or crevice.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Mites go onto the birds only long enough to feed‚Äîusually about
¬Ω hour.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Red mites suck blood from the pigeons. It is the engorged blood
that makes the mite red.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Mite eggs are deposited in the cracks and crevices or debris
around the nest box where they live.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Eggs hatch in 2 or more days, according to weather conditions.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Newly-hatched mites mature in about 5 days.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Pigeon‚Äôs loss of condition is the most evident
indication of mite infestation. Actual loss of blood is probably less
harmful to the bird than annoyance caused by crawling and biting of
mites.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> Most good disinfectants supplied to lofts will kill
mites satisfactorily if worked well into all cracks and crevices.
Oily disinfectants are inexpensive and very effective, but leave the
loft rather unsightly. Whitewash kills only by covering up and is
ineffective if any areas are missed. For this reason, some of the more
refined cresols are used. Four percent saponified cresol in warm water
is quite effective.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Repeat.</em> Since the cresol does not kill the eggs, it is necessary
to repeat treatment in 5 to 7 days.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Prevention.</em> Mites that attack pigeons are apparently the same
as found on other birds, including domestic poultry. Therefore, wild
birds, straggling pigeons, and neighborhood poultry are possible
sources of infection. Light, dry, airy lofts do not favor breeding of
mites.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Pigeon flies which are particularly troublesome in warm climates
are true flies with short, flat, wide bodies and long wings.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Life cycle</em> (<a href="#fig_46">fig. 46</a>). (<em>a</em>) Pigeon flies live among body feathers.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) They leave the birds only to deposit larvae, or when disturbed.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Adult flies suck blood from the birds.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Female flies deposit living larvae in or around the nest bowl,
nest box, or around the loft.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Newly deposited larvae are white and about the size of a small
buck shot. Within a few hours, a hard shell forms around them and they
turn from white to brown and then to jet black.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Young flies emerge from these shells in about 30 days and are
ready for their first meal of blood.</p>

<div id="fig_43">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p76.jpg" width="442" height="600" alt="TL70212"></p><p><em>Figure 43. Life cycle of pigeon fly.</em></p></div>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Pigeon flies can easily be observed crawling among
the<span><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span> bird‚Äôs feathers. Their movement as well as biting greatly annoys
the birds. However, the greatest damage they do is transmitting pigeon
malaria.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> A very effective and easily applied method of
treatment is to dust the birds lightly with pyrethrum powder. Sweep
nest boxes and loft carefully to collect pupae so that they can be
destroyed. Pigeon flies will not travel far from the birds; therefore,
keep stragglers out of loft and carefully inspect newly-introduced
birds to avoid admitting flies.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Mosquitoes.</span> Mosquitoes are a very common but usually
underestimated pest. Besides molesting the birds by biting and sucking
blood, they may transmit pox. These troublesome insects breed in
standing water, such as swampy areas, old tin cans, and rain barrels.
Control consists of draining or oiling breeding places and using
screens on loft openings.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Other parasites attacking pigeons are fleas, chiggers, ticks,
bed bugs, depluming mites, feather mites, air sac mites, subcutaneous
mites, sand flies, and beetle larvae. Fortunately, these are rare.</p>

<h3 id="Para_54">54. Internal Parasites</h3>

<p>These are the worms that live inside pigeons. Round worms are by far
the most numerous. Tape worms are occasionally found in pigeons, but
seldom present a serious problem.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Ascarids, or common large round worms are the largest and most
prevalent of the round worms. Adult worms are from 1 to 2 inches long.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Habits.</em> Knowledge of the life cycle of a round worm is of great
importance for successful control of this troublesome parasite. This
worm has a ‚Äúdirect‚Äù life cycle (<a href="#fig_47">fig. 47</a>) (completing it in one species).</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Mature worms live in the upper part of the small intestines and
feed by absorbing food from the intestinal contents through their own
body walls.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Eggs (ova) are deposited by female worms in the intestinal
contents of the pigeon, and later pass out in the pigeon droppings. It
has been estimated that female worms lay as many as 12,000 eggs a day.
Feces from parasitized birds often contain countless numbers of ova.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Freshly deposited worm eggs are much like freshly laid pigeon
eggs, in that they must be incubated before they are ready to hatch.
They need to remain in warm, moist litter or soil for 10 to 16 days
before the worm larvae can develop. Severe freezing, excessively hot
soil, and direct sunlight will destroy the eggs.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) When birds eat the incubated eggs, the worms hatch out in their
intestines.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) The tiny larvae then ‚Äúsew‚Äù themselves into the lining of the
intestines and begin to grow.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) After a few days, the larvae crawl back into the intestinal canal
where they mature in 30 to 40 days.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Ascarids injure birds in several ways.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) When the newly hatched worm ‚Äúsews‚Äù itself into the intestinal
lining the area around the puncture becomes inflamed because of
mechanical injury, loss of blood, and introduced infection. This
localized inflammation renders that part of the intestinal lining
useless for digesting and absorbing food.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The worm absorbs food from the intestinal contents which should
go to the birds.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) In order to protect themselves and avoid being digested, the
worms give off a substance that neutralizes digestive juices. This
substance becomes mixed with intestinal contents and prevents proper
digestion.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Worms sometimes become so numerous that they actually clog the
intestines. As many as 500 worms have been found in a single bird.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Worm-infested birds show loss of condition and general
unhealthiness. Diagnosis is made by finding worms or worm eggs in
droppings or by autopsy on typical specimens.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> The following drugs are only effective against mature
worms and, at best, are only 80 percent efficient:</p>

<p>1-CC Oil of turpentine per bird.<br>
<span>¬Ω-CC Tetrachlorethylene per bird.</span><br>
<span>¬Ω-CC Carbon tetrachloride per bird.</span></p>

<p>(4) <em>Prevention.</em> This is relatively simple and practically 100 percent
effective.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Clean loft daily and provide fresh water.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) If aviary does not have a wire bottom spread clean sand about 1
or 2 inches deep over its floor once every two weeks.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Replace moisture and shade by sunshine and dry conditions.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Strongyles are the most dangerous of the common round worms and
one of the most common causes of death among poorly kept pigeons. The
‚Äústrongyle‚Äù is a very small parasite which multiplies rapidly and is a
vicious blood sucker. Adult worms are from ¬Ω to ¬æ inches long and
about the same size as thin thread.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Habits.</em> This worm has a ‚Äúdirect‚Äù cycle; that gives the key to
successful control (<a href="#fig_45">fig. 45</a>).</p>

<div id="fig_44">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p78.jpg" width="550" height="520" alt="TL70213"></p><p><em>Figure 44. Life cycle of pigeon ascarids.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Adult strongyles live in the upper intestinal contents, but may
be found as far up as the crop.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Strongyles are ravenous blood suckers.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Female worms deposit eggs in the intestinal contents which later
pass out in the feces.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Eggs incubate in about 1 day, if conditions are favorable.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Young larvae hatch out and molt about 8 hours later. These larvae
again molt in about 3 days and are then infective. Thus, about 5 days
elapse from the time the eggs are voided by the bird and the time the
young larval worms hatch, molt, and become infective.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) The infective larvae are eaten by the pigeons. Then they pass to
the intestines where they mature.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> (<em>a</em>) Strongyles injure the birds by lacerating
the intestine and sucking blood. After the parasite moves on, the
laceration still bleeds considerably before a blood clot forms. Each
laceration results in an area of infection and inflammation.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Constant movement of the worms over the inflamed intestine adds
to the irritation.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Severe, and sometimes rapid, loss of condition and accompanying
anemia are usual symptoms. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding strongyles
in the intestine upon autopsy of typical specimens.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> Treatment is not satisfactory. One-half CC doses of
tetrachlorethylene may be tried.</p>

<div id="fig_45">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p79.jpg" width="550" height="536" alt="TL70214"></p><p><em>Figure 45. Life cycle of pigeon strongyle.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>(4) <em>Prevention.</em> The same methods prescribed for ascarids apply to
strongyles.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Other round worms attacking pigeons are numerous, but only
capillary worms will be discussed here. These are very thin, hair-like
worms sometimes found in the digestive tract of pigeons from the crop
down through the intestine. Their life cycle is direct. No satisfactory
drug has been found to rid pigeons of this worm. Fortunately, their
life cycle is similar to that of ascarids, and the same preventive
measures are effective.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Tape worms, which are occasionally seen in pigeons, acquire a
length of 6 to 8 inches.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Life cycle.</em> Tape worms have what is called an indirect life
cycle, that is they must pass through at least two different species to
complete it (<a href="#fig_46">fig. 46</a>).</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Adult tape worms are found in the small intestine. Their bodies
are made up of a head and segments. The head is essentially an anchor
that fastens the worm to the intestine of the bird. The body segments
form at the head and mature as they grow further from the head.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Each segment contains both male and female sex organs and, as it
matures, becomes virtually a packet of tape worm eggs.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Segments break off and pass out in the feces.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The tape worm‚Äôs eggs are then eaten by a snail, slug, beetle, or
other insect which becomes the ‚Äúintermediate host.‚Äù Here the tape worm
undergoes a certain amount of development.</p>

<div id="fig_46">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p80.jpg" width="550" height="500" alt="TL70215"></p><p><em>Figure 46. Life cycle of pigeon tape worm.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) If the intermediate host is eaten by a pigeon, the young tape
worm attaches itself to the bird‚Äôs intestine and soon grows to maturity.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Tape worms harm the host by injuring the intestine at
the point where they bury their heads, by absorbing food, and by giving
off antenzymes.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> Unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Prevention.</em> (<em>a</em>) Pigeons must be well-cared-for and fed so that
they will not care to eat the intermediate hosts.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The method of prevention prescribed for ascarids is also
applicable for tape worms.</p>

<h3 id="Para_55">55. Treatment of Injuries</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Cuts and wounds.</span> Pigeons have marvelous powers of healing
their own tissues, perhaps because of their high body temperature and
rapid rate of body processes. The following are aids to healing.</p>

<p>(1) Clean solid or contaminated wounds with boric acid solution or some
very mild antiseptic. Strong disinfectants burn the exposed tissues and
delay wound healing.</p>

<p>(2) Stitch or suture large tears in the skin to make them relatively
smaller. Avoid placing suture in such a way that a pocket is formed for
this often results in an abscess formation. Use white silk or cotton
thread.</p>

<p>(3) Remove excessively rough edges or hanging flaps of skin with sharp
scissors.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Fractures.</span> (1) Broken bones in the extremities of the
legs usually respond readily to treatment; those involving the large
bones present a more complicated problem.</p>

<p>(2) The type of fracture governs the seriousness of the injury.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Simple</em> fractures are those in which there is no break in the
skin in the region of the fracture.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Compound</em> fractures are those in which there is a break in the
skin over the bone injury.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Partial</em> fractures are those in which the bone is cracked but
not completely separated.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) <em>Complete</em> fractures are those in which there is actual
separation of the parts of bone.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) <em>Comminuted</em> fractures are those in which the bone is splintered
or fragmented.</p>

<p>(3) Treatment of fractures is quite simple: bring broken parts into
contact and immobilize them to avoid movement which might injure
delicate healing tissues.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Since bones heal in whatever position they are placed, it is
necessary to splint the limb in as nearly normal a position as possible.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Take care that the splint does not interfere with healing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>1.</em> Do not bandage splint too tightly. The bandage must be snug
to avoid movement of the parts, however, if it is too tight, the
blood supply will be cut off and the limb will die. Splints applied
before the injured limb has swollen must be closely observed for
several hours, or until the swelling has reached its maximum so
that circulation is not impeded.</p>

<p><em>2.</em> Pad limb with cotton or gauze to protect it from the hard
surfaces of the splint.</p>

<p><em>3.</em> Dust powdered boric acid on the region of the fracture,
particularly if the fracture is compound.</p></blockquote>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Splints may be easily and satisfactorily fashioned from pieces
of<span><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span> pliable tin. Cut and bend to fit contour of limb in normal resting
position (<a href="#fig_47">fig. 47)</a>. Splints for fractures in the shank should extend
down along the shank on one side, then bend to form a loop down around
the foot and back up the opposite side of the limb. In a short time
the bird learns that it can step on the limb without pain because the
weight falls on the loop of the splint rather than on the foot.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Splints should be left in place for 3 weeks before removing.
Healing, if successful, will be sufficient to permit removal of splint
at this time.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Torn crops.</span> These may be successfully sutured if the
edges are turned in so that the outside surfaces, not the lining, of
the crop come in contact. The skin may then be sutured to help support
the crop.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

For additional contact information:

    Dr. Gregory B. Newby
    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

<p dir="auto">NVTOP stands for Neat Videocard TOP, a (h)top like task monitor for GPUs and
accelerators. It can handle multiple GPUs and print information about them in a
htop-familiar way.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently supported vendors are AMD (Linux amdgpu driver), Apple (limited M1 &amp;
M2 support), Huawei (Ascend), Intel (Linux i915 driver), NVIDIA (Linux
proprietary divers), Qualcomm Adreno (Linux MSM driver).</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GPU Support</h2><a id="user-content-gpu-support" aria-label="Permalink: GPU Support" href="#gpu-support"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">AMD</h3><a id="user-content-amd" aria-label="Permalink: AMD" href="#amd"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NVTOP supports AMD GPUs using the <code>amdgpu</code> driver through the exposed DRM and
sysfs interface.</p>
<p dir="auto">AMD introduced the fdinfo interface in kernel 5.14 (<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_fdinfo.c?h=linux-5.14.y" rel="nofollow">browse kernel
source</a>).
Hence, you will need a kernel with a version greater or equal to 5.14 to see the
processes using AMD GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Support for recent GPUs are regularly mainlined into the linux kernel, so please
use a recent-enough kernel for your GPU.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Intel</h3><a id="user-content-intel" aria-label="Permalink: Intel" href="#intel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NVTOP supports Intel GPUs using the <code>i915</code> linux driver.</p>
<p dir="auto">Intel introduced the fdinfo interface in kernel 5.19 (<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_drm_client.c?h=linux-5.19.y" rel="nofollow">browse kernel
source</a>).
Hence, you will need a kernel with a version greater or equal to 5.19 to see the
processes using Intel GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>INTEL SUPPORT STATUS</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Intel is working on exposing more hardware information through an <code>HWMON</code>
interface. The patches are still a work in progress: <a href="https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/104278/" rel="nofollow">see patch
series</a>.</li>
<li>The fdinfo interface does not expose the memory allocated by the process. The
field in the process list is therefore empty.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">NVIDIA</h3><a id="user-content-nvidia" aria-label="Permalink: NVIDIA" href="#nvidia"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>NVML library</em> does not support some of the queries for GPUs coming before the
Kepler microarchitecture. Anything starting at GeForce 600, GeForce 800M and
successor should work fine. For more information about supported GPUs please
take a look at the <a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/nvml-api-reference.html#nvml-api-reference" rel="nofollow">NVML documentation</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Adreno</h3><a id="user-content-adreno" aria-label="Permalink: Adreno" href="#adreno"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NVTOP supports Adreno GPUs using the <code>msm</code> linux driver.</p>
<p dir="auto">msm introduced the fdinfo interface in kernel 6.0 (<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/msm/msm_drv.c?h=linux-6.0.y" rel="nofollow">browse kernel
source</a>).
Hence, you will need a kernel with a version greater or equal to 6.0 to see the
processes using Adreno GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Apple</h3><a id="user-content-apple" aria-label="Permalink: Apple" href="#apple"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NVTOP includes some initial support for Apple using Metal. This is only supported when building for Apple, and when building for Apple only this vendor is supported.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>APPLE SUPPORT STATUS</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Apple support is still being worked on. Some bugs and limitations may apply.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ascend</h3><a id="user-content-ascend" aria-label="Permalink: Ascend" href="#ascend"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NVTOP supports Ascend (testing on Altas 800 (910B)) by DCMI API (version 6.0.0).</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, the DCMI only supports limited APIs, missing PCIe generation, tx/rx throughput info, max power draw etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build</h2><a id="user-content-build" aria-label="Permalink: Build" href="#build"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Several libraries are required in order for NVTOP to display GPU info:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The <em>ncurses</em> library driving the user interface.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This makes the screen look beautiful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For NVIDIA: the <em>NVIDIA Management Library</em> (<em>NVML</em>) which comes with the GPU driver.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This queries the GPU for info.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For AMD: the libdrm library used to query AMD GPUs through the kernel driver.</li>
</ul>

              <p>Article <a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/03/04/do-you-use-it-how-tidbits-readers-install-macos-updates/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Do You Use It? How TidBITS Readers Install macOS Updates - TidBITS</a> says that ‚ÄúSome people even wait until Apple announces or even releases the next macOS version, under the theory that it somehow isn‚Äôt fully baked until then.‚Äù. I wait until the next major release, but not under that theory.</p>
<p>It used to be one reason to wait was that macOS updates have become so time consuming that I‚Äôd wait until there were just the faster security updates left. But now with the sealed system volume even the security updates are a pain.</p>
<p>So that leaves my primary reason: I used to look forward to classic Mac and OS X updates. That ended with OS X Lion. I think every OS X/macOS version since Snow Leopard has been worse than the one before. So, I put off the pain of lost functionality as long as possible.</p>
<p>You think I‚Äôm joking? Just look at what we‚Äôve lost in each upgrade since OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard:</p>
<p><strong>10.7 Lion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rosetta (PowerPC apps)</li>
<li>iSync</li>
<li>DVD distribution of the upgrade</li>
<li>Save As (change to ‚Äúmodern document model")</li>

<li>A usable Disk Utility</li>
<li>Freedom to update /usr, such as the locate database script in /usr/libexec</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Console logs</li>
<li>Audio and video chats in Messages</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>11 Big Sur</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kexts where there is a System Extension equivalent (firewall and anti-virus)</li>
<li>Hiding Date/Time in menu bar</li>
<li>Distinctive icons; they now look like iOS</li>

<li>Python (but is installed by Xcode Command Line Utilities)</li>
</ul>
<p>I hate Big Sur‚Äôs icons and vertical dialog boxes intensely.</p>

              <p>Interesting what you have posted, in general.</p>
<p>I am not challenging you, or saying you are wrong, but I would like to know how you compiled this list.</p>
<p>Also, specifically regarding -</p>

<p>If I am interpreting your notes correctly, this particular item states, starting with Mavericks macOS, the local sync (via USB) of Contacts and Calendars went away.</p>
<p>However up until my installation of Ventura, I was able to successfully perform a local sync (via USB) (of Calendars, although the Contacts syncing simply did not perform at that point).</p>
<p>When I installed Ventura, my attempt at local sync (via USB) of Calendars blew up, and basically destroyed my Calendar data.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a long, sordid story, but at this point, I am giving up on the Apple versions of Calendar, and Contacts, and am in the process of switching to BusyCal and Busy Contacts.</p>

              <p>IIRC Craig Federighi said (maybe on the Talk Show podcast?) that Settings app was redone in SwiftUI for several reasons - one was to make it more consistent with iOS and iPadOS. Lots of people are coming to the Mac for the first time after experiencing iOS (there are many more users of iOS than MacOS for sure) and the consistent interface would be helpful. But I think another reason, and perhaps more important, was that the System Preferences set of individual panes was getting hard to manage and update - remember that they were all single pane, and couldn‚Äôt scroll, so they had to create subpages when the number of options grew too large to fit in a single window -  and Apple switched instead to SwiftUI which would, in the long run, be much easier to maintain and, Apple thinks, use.</p>
<p>Frankly I think it‚Äôs fine, and improved from the first release of Ventura. It can take me a while to find particular options, but the search box actually works pretty well. And I suppose if I was somebody who never used a Mac but had extensive experience with iOS I‚Äôd probably prefer the current layout.</p>

<p>I compiled the list from notes I make while I‚Äôm using macOS. I started using Macs with System no-number-yet in 1984 but only started keeping track of what‚Äôs Lost in the Upgrade in 2013.</p>
<p>Sync Services was dropped in Mavericks, and with it, local synching over USB. It was iCloud or nothing, as this TidBITS article explains: <a href="https://tidbits.com/2013/11/15/making-the-most-of-contacts-in-mavericks/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Making the Most of Contacts in Mavericks - TidBITS</a>. Notice the comment from Adam Engst about its removal.</p>
<p>I think USB synching was supposed to have returned with OS X 10.9.3 and iTunes 11.2: <a href="https://tidbits.com/2014/05/15/local-contactcalendar-syncing-returns-in-itunes-11-2/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Local Contact/Calendar Syncing Returns in iTunes 11.2 - TidBITS</a>.

<p>But then why does the new System Settings not show the list of Apps Using iCloud until you click ‚ÄúShow All‚Äù? That fooled me, since everywhere else they show the full list.</p>
<p>If it were just re-arrangement that would be an inconvenience. What bugs me is the loss of functionality. For example, Time Machine no longer shows the size of excluded folders.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd be more accomodating of the Settings window if it was resizable. It seems positively silly to have this skinny window - with much scrolling or searching required - when I have access to a 32" high res monitor.  Even on the 14" MBP it‚Äôs annoying.</p>

<p>My objection to Airport Utility was it was the typical Apple procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>There‚Äôs a full-featured utility or application. (In this case, Airport Utility 5.6)</li>
<li>Apple releases a completely new version, but it is missing functionality that was in the old version.</li>
<li>Users complain.</li>
<li>Apple says: but this is just version 1! We‚Äôll add the missing features later.</li>
<li>Time passes. Apple never adds the missing features.</li>
<li>Apple removes the ability to run the old, full featured utility.</li>
</ol>
<p>(See Airport Utility, Quicktime Player, Disk Utility‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>In particular, the newer Airport Utility could not fully manage the features in an Airport base station or Time Capsule. And since there‚Äôs no other way to manage an ABS or TC except through the Airport Utility, that means that they effectively removed capabilities from those devices.</p>
<p>(I actually can still run AirPort Utility 5.6 on Monterey, but it is not easy!)</p>

            <div><h2>Taxpayers encouraged to try innovative new option before April 15 deadline</h2>

<p>IR-2024-68, March 12, 2024</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Internal Revenue Service announced today the full-scale launch of the innovative <a data-entity-substitution="pup_linkit_media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ec08e586-b236-49ae-b2f6-8ad4e0f46ad7" href="https://directfile.irs.gov/" title="IRS Direct File">Direct File pilot</a> and encouraged eligible taxpayers in 12 states to try the new service to file their tax returns online for free directly with the IRS.</p>

<p>The pilot effort has been in testing mode for several weeks, allowing early users to file their 2023 federal tax returns online for free and directly with the IRS. Thousands of taxpayers have successfully used the system, and early users are giving the new option positive reviews.</p>

<p>Following the initial Direct File success, the IRS is moving the pilot out of the test phase, allowing all eligible taxpayers in the 12 states ‚Äì representing 19 million taxpayers ‚Äì to use the system at any time. Taxpayers can log in to <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">Direct File</a> to start their return and complete it any time before the April filing deadline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe early results from Direct File have shown taxpayers like the ease and convenience of the tool, and moving into the full-scale launch of the pilot will give more taxpayers the chance to use this free option,‚Äù said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. ‚ÄúExpanding Direct File as the tax deadline approaches will provide more taxpayers a way to file directly with the IRS for free, and it will give us more valuable information to assess this pilot. For those who haven‚Äôt filed their taxes in these 12 states, we encourage them to visit IRS.gov and see if Direct File is the right option for them.‚Äù</p>

<p>Direct File is one of many options that taxpayers have to file their taxes, including tax software and tax professionals. For the pilot, the IRS worked on a streamlined way for people with simpler tax situations to file directly with the agency.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA team of experts from across government built and tested the Direct File pilot to give taxpayers an easy, accurate free way to file their taxes online directly with the IRS,‚Äù Werfel added. ‚ÄúOur goal with the Direct File pilot is to help people meet their tax obligations as easily and quickly as possible. We developed Direct File from the beginning with taxpayers‚Äô help, and we‚Äôll continue to talk to taxpayers about their experience to learn more about what taxpayers want for future digital services.‚Äù</p>

<p>Direct File walks the taxpayer through the complexities of the nation‚Äôs tax code to complete their filing easily with an accurate calculation of their refund or tax owed. Direct File is designed to be easy for taxpayers to use. At every step, it shows the work behind the calculations, so users can be confident that the tax return is complete and accurate. Once taxpayers start their return on the <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">Direct File</a> site, they can pause and then securely sign in to finish any time before the April filing deadline.</p>

<p>Users can also get support from special IRS customer service representatives through Direct File‚Äôs live chat feature. Direct File, like other electronic filing options, allows taxpayers to typically get their refund in less than 21 days when the direct deposit is chosen.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten great initial feedback from the thousands of taxpayers who used it during testing,‚Äù Werfel said. ‚ÄúMany taxpayers we‚Äôve heard from filed their taxes in less than 30 minutes using Direct File and praised it as an easy, no cost tax filing experience.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Who‚Äôs eligible?</h3>

<p>Taxpayers in 12 pilot states who meet certain requirements can use Direct File through the April tax deadline. Pilot states include:</p>

<ul><li>Arizona</li>
	<li>California</li>
	<li>Florida</li>
	<li>Massachusetts</li>
	<li>Nevada</li>
	<li>New Hampshire</li>
	<li>New York</li>
	<li>South Dakota</li>
	<li>Tennessee</li>
	<li>Texas</li>
	<li>Washington State</li>
	<li>Wyoming</li>
</ul><p>After completing their federal returns, taxpayers in the states with a state-income tax ‚Äì Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York -- will be guided to a state-sponsored tool to complete their state tax return.</p>

<p>The IRS designed the pilot to follow the best practices for launching a new technology platform by starting small, making sure it works and then building from there. The pilot is purposefully limited to cover relatively straightforward tax situations.</p>

<p>The Direct File pilot is an option for taxpayers who fall into these categories:</p>

<ul><li>Report income earned from jobs that generate a Form W-2; including taxpayers with more than one job with W-2 wages;</li>
	<li>Claim Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and the Credit for Other Dependents;</li>
	<li>Claim the standard deduction and deductions for educator expenses and student loan interest;</li>
	<li>Lived in the same state for the entire calendar year 2023.</li>
</ul><p>Interested taxpayers can go to <a data-entity-substitution="pup_linkit_media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ec08e586-b236-49ae-b2f6-8ad4e0f46ad7" href="https://directfile.irs.gov/" title="IRS Direct File">directfile.irs.gov</a>, where they can determine if they are eligible. Using Direct File requires identity verification through ID.me. Once their identity is verified and they‚Äôve signed in securely to Direct File, they will be providing the tax information directly to the IRS, not a third party.</p>

<p>For taxpayers who visit Direct File but aren‚Äôt eligible for the pilot, they will be directed to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a2fc2c3-9e78-4514-b1dc-6959b2f5e891" href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free" title="File your taxes for free">Free File on IRS.gov</a>. Now in its 22nd filing season, taxpayers across the nation can access free software products provided by IRS Free File trusted partners. Through this public-private partnership, tax preparation and filing software providers make their online products available to eligible taxpayers. Eight private-sector Free File partners provide online guided tax software products this year to any taxpayer with an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of $79,000 or less in 2023. Free access to online products is available by starting from IRS Free File.</p>

<h3>Direct File pilot for filing season 2024</h3>

<p>The IRS launched the Direct File pilot for the 2024 filing season. The Inflation Reduction Act mandated that the IRS study interest in and feasibility of creating a direct e-filing tool taxpayers could use to prepare and file their federal income tax return. The IRS commissioned an independent study, which indicated broad interest in such a system, which the IRS detailed in a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f743231f-73a1-418f-bb7f-5d7daa75bebf" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-submits-direct-file-report-to-congress-treasury-department-directs-pilot-to-evaluate-key-issues" title="IRS submits Direct File report to Congress; Treasury Department directs pilot to evaluate key issues">Direct File Report to Congress</a> in May 2023.</p>

<p>Shortly after that report, as directed by the Treasury Department, the IRS assembled a team of tax experts, technologists, engineers and strategists from across government to build the Direct File system. The IRS worked closely with the U.S. Digital Service and the General Services Administration‚Äôs technology office 18F to build and test Direct File.</p>

<p>Initial testing began in early February 2024 with a handful of federal and state government employees, followed by short open availability windows for more taxpayers to start their returns. On March 4, the IRS announced that Direct File would enter final testing, which included an allotment of available spaces with more spaces added every day. Direct File is now open to all eligible taxpayers in pilot states to decide if it is the right option for them to file their 2023 federal tax return online for free, directly with IRS.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/13/24070864/samotsvety-forecasting-superforecasters-tetlock">https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/13/24070864/samotsvety-forecasting-superforecasters-tetlock</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39685894">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dDPrPk">The question before a group made up of some of the best forecasters of world events: What are the odds that <a href="https://www.vox.com/china" data-source="encore">China</a> will control at least half of Taiwan‚Äôs territory by 2030?</p>
<p id="ZezmsO">Everyone on the chat gives their answer, and in each case it‚Äôs a number. Chinmay Ingalagavi, an economics fellow at Yale, says 8 percent. Nu√±o Sempere, the 25-year-old Spanish independent researcher and consultant leading our session, agrees. Greg Justice, an MBA student at the University of Chicago, pegs it at 17 percent. Lisa Murillo, who holds a PhD in <a href="https://www.vox.com/neuroscience" data-source="encore">neuroscience</a>, says 15-20 percent. One member of the group, who asked not to be named in this context because they have family in China who could be targeted by the government there, posits the highest figure: 24 percent.</p>
<p id="xaGAvy">Sempere asks me for my number. Based on a quick analysis of past military clashes between the countries, I came up with 5 percent. That might not seem too far away from the others, but it feels embarrassingly low in this context. Why am I so out of step?</p>
<p id="nFqbpL">This is a meeting of Samotsvety. The name comes from a 50-year-old Soviet rock band ‚Äî more on that later ‚Äî but the modern Samotsvety specializes in predicting the future. And they are very, very good at it. At <a href="https://www.infer-pub.com/">Infer</a>, a major forecasting platform <a href="https://www.infer-pub.com/the-pub/rand-program-update">operated by Rand</a>, the <a href="https://capture.dropbox.com/qENgJOuZgsTPZy3c">four most accurate forecasters in the site‚Äôs history</a> are all members of Samotsvety, and there is a wide gap between them and fifth place. In fact, the gap between them and fifth place is bigger than between fifth and 10th places. They‚Äôre waaaaay out ahead.</p>
<p id="JdyadS">While Samotsvety members converse on Slack regularly, the Saturday meetings are the heart of the group, and I was sitting in to get a sense of why, exactly, the group was so good. What were these folks doing differently that made them able to see the future when the rest of us can‚Äôt?</p>
<p id="9fJdRC">I knew a bit about forecasting going into the meeting. I‚Äôve <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters">written about it</a>; I‚Äôve read <em>Superforecasting</em>, the bestseller by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner describing the research behind forecasting. The whole <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect" data-source="encore">Future Perfect</a> team here at Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/1/24011179/2024-predictions-trump-politics-ohtani-oppenheimer-elections">puts together predictions</a> at the start of each year, hoping not just to lay down markers on how we think the next year will go, but to get better at forecasting in the process. </p>
<p id="Rz7hod">Part of the appeal of forecasting is not just that it seems to work, but that you don‚Äôt seem to need specialized expertise to succeed at it. The aggregated opinions of non-experts doing forecasting have <a href="https://arbresearch.com/files/comparing_forecasters.pdf">proven to be a better guide to the future</a> than the aggregated opinions of experts. One <a href="https://goodjudgment.io/docs/Goldstein-et-al-2015.pdf">frequently cited study</a> found that accurate forecasters‚Äô predictions of geopolitical events, when aggregated using standard scientific methods, were more accurate than the forecasts of members of the US intelligence community who answered the same questions in a confidential prediction market. This was true even though the latter had access to classified intelligence.</p>
<p id="5Cxojy">But I felt a bit stuck. After years of doing my annual predictions, I didn‚Äôt sense they were improving much at all, but I wasn‚Äôt predicting enough things to tell for sure. Events kept happening that I didn‚Äôt see coming, like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/7/23907683/israel-hamas-war-news-updates-october-2023">Gaza war</a> in recent months or the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/26/23774184/putin-wagner-group-mutiny-prigozhin">Wagner mutiny</a> a few months before that. I wanted to hang out with Samotsvety for a bit because they were the best of the best, and thus a good crew to learn from.</p>
<p id="z2FpqJ">They count among their fans Jason Matheny, now CEO of the RAND Corporation, a think tank that‚Äôs long worked on developing better predictive methods. Before he was at RAND, Matheny funded foundational work on forecasting as an official at the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), a government organization that invests in technologies that might help the US intelligence community. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve admired their work,‚Äù Matheny said of Samotsvety. ‚ÄúNot only their impressive accuracy, but also their commitment to scoring their own accuracy‚Äù ‚Äî meaning they grade themselves so they can know when they fail and need to do better. That, he said, ‚Äúis really rare institutionally.‚Äù</p>
<p id="LQfJlz">What I discovered was that Samotsvety‚Äôs record of success wasn‚Äôt because its members knew things others didn‚Äôt. The factors its members brought up that Saturday to explain their probabilities sounded like the points you‚Äôd hear at a think tank event or an academic lecture on China-Taiwan relations. The anonymous member emphasized how ideologically important capturing the island was to Xi Jinping, and how few political constraints he faces. Greg Justice countered that the CCP has depended on economic growth that a war would jeopardize. Murrillo put a higher probability on an attack because of a projection that the US will not be likely to back up Taiwan once the latter‚Äôs chip production monopoly has waned due to other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23806813/eu-chips-act-approved-semiconductor-manufacturing">nations</a> investing in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/opinion/america-biden-semiconductor-tsmc.html">fabrication plants</a>.  </p>
<p id="yJezaf">But if the factors being listed reminded me of a normal think tank discussion, the numbers being raised didn‚Äôt. Near the end of the session, I asked: If some of you think there are such strong reasons for China to capture Taiwan, why is the highest odds anyone has proposed 24 percent, meaning even the most bullish member thinks such an event is nearly 75 percent likely <em>not </em>to happen? Why does no one here think Chinese control by 2030 is more likely than not?</p>
<p id="iYrBCE">The team had an answer, and it‚Äôs an answer that goes some way toward explaining why this group has managed to get so good at predicting the future.</p>
<h3 id="aG0hVZ">The story of Samotsvety</h3>
<p id="Y9D6iK">The name Samotsvety, co-founder Misha Yagudin says, is a multifaceted pun. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Russian for semi-precious stones, or more directly ‚Äòself-lighting/coloring‚Äô stones,‚Äù he writes in an email. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a few puns on what forecasting might be: finding nuggets of good info; even if we are not diamonds, together in aggregate we are great; self-lighting is kinda about shedding light on the future.‚Äù</p>
<p id="OYAKmw">It began because he and Nu√±o Sempere needed a name for a Slack they started around 2020 on which they and friends could shoot the shit about forecasting. The two met at a summer fellowship at Oxford‚Äôs Future of Humanity Institute, a hotbed of the rationalist subculture where forecasting is a favored activity. Before long, they were competing together in contests like Infer and on platforms like <a href="https://www.gjopen.com/">Good Judgment Open</a>.</p>
<p id="F1eV8h">The latter site is part of the <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/">Good Judgment Project</a>, led by Penn psychologists Philip Tetlock and Barbara Mellers. Those researchers have studied the process of forecasting intensely in recent decades. One of their main findings is that <a href="https://michaelmbishop.github.io/superforecasters.pdf">forecasting ability is not evenly distributed</a>. Some people are consistently much better at it than others, and strong past performance indicates better predictions going forward. These high performers are known as ‚Äúsuperforecasters,‚Äù a term Tetlock and Gardner would later borrow for their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718?ascsubtag=___vx__p_23834905__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_23834905__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">book</a>.</p>
<p id="15FuSx">Superforecaster¬Æ is now a <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/how-to-become-a-superforecaster/">registered trademark of Good Judgment</a>, and not every member of Samotsvety has been through that exact process, although more than half of them (8 of 15) have. I won‚Äôt call the group as a whole ‚Äúsuperforecasters‚Äù here for fear of stealing superforecaster valor. But their team‚Äôs track record is strong.</p>
<p id="rhukLG">A common measure of forecasting ability is the <a href="https://www.cultivatelabs.com/crowdsourced-forecasting-guide/what-are-relative-brier-scores-and-how-are-they-calculated">relative Brier score</a>, a number that aggregates the result of every prediction for which an outcome is now known, and then compares each forecaster to the median forecaster. A score of 0 means you‚Äôre average; a positive score means worse than average while negative means better than average. In 2021, the last full year Samotsvety participated, their score in the Infer tournament was -2.43, compared to -1.039 for the next-best team. They were more than twice as good as the nearest competition.</p>
<p id="GWIdnR">‚ÄúIf the point of forecasting tournaments is to figure out who you can trust,‚Äù the <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/mantic-monday-31422?s=r">writer Scott Alexander</a> once quipped. ‚Äúthe science has spoken, and the answer is ‚Äòthese guys.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p id="Qe8nRN">So, why these guys? Part of the answer is selection. Members‚Äô stories of how they joined the Samotsvety were usually some variation of: I started forecasting, I turned out to be pretty good at it, and the group noticed me. It‚Äôs a bit like how a youth soccer prodigy might eventually find themselves on Manchester City.</p>
<p id="ZqDsLL">Molly Hickman came to forecasting by way of the government. Taking a contracting job out of college, she was assigned to IARPA, the intelligence research agency where Jason Matheny and others were running forecasting tournaments. The idea intrigued her, and when she went back to grad school for computer science, she signed up at Infer to try forecasting herself. She put together a team with her dad and some friends, and while the team as a whole didn‚Äôt do great, she did amazing. The Samotsvety group saw her scores and invited her to join.</p>
<p id="67db9S">Eli Lifland, a 2020 economics and computer science grad at UVA now <a href="https://www.elilifland.com/">attempting to forecast AI progress</a>, got his start predicting Covid-19. 2020 was in some ways a banner year for forecasting: Superforecasters were <a href="https://time.com/5848271/superforecasters-covid-19/">predicting that Covid would reach hundreds of thousands of cases</a> in February of that year, a time when government officials were still <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/02/17/nih-disease-official-anthony-fauci-risk-of-coronavirus-in-u-s-is-minuscule-skip-mask-and-wash-hands/4787209002/">calling the risk ‚Äúminuscule.‚Äù</a> Users of the forecasting platform <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/news/2020/06/02/LRT/">Metaculus outperformed a panel of epidemiologists</a> when predicting case numbers. Even in that company, Lifland did unusually well. The fast-moving nature of the pandemic made it easy to learn quickly because you could predict cases on a near-weekly basis and quickly realize what you got right or wrong. Before long, Misha and Nu√±o from Samotsvety came calling.</p>
<p id="rbUMv2">But ‚Äúselect people already good at forecasting‚Äù doesn‚Äôt explain why Samotsvety is so good. What made these forecasters good enough to win Samotsvety‚Äôs attention? What are these people, specifically, doing differently that makes their predictions better than almost everyone else‚Äôs?</p>
<h3 id="C6ZyNZ">The habits of highly effective forecasters</h3>
<p id="FN0O3w">The literature on superforecasting, from Tetlock, Mellers, and others, finds some commonalities between good predictors. One is a tendency to think in numbers. Quantitative reasoning sharpens thinking in this context. ‚ÄúSomewhat likely,‚Äù ‚Äúpretty unlikely,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be surprised.‚Äù These kinds of phrases, on their own, convey some useful information about someone‚Äôs confidence in a prediction, but they‚Äôre impossible to compare to each other ‚Äî is ‚Äúpretty unlikely‚Äù more or less doubtful than ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be surprised‚Äù? Numbers, by contrast, are easy to compare, and they provide a means of accountability. Unsurprisingly, many great forecasters, in Samotsvety and elsewhere, have backgrounds in computer science, economics, math, and other quantitative disciplines.</p>
<p id="D1Wx0a">Hickman recalls telling her coworkers in intelligence that she was working on forecasting and being frustrated by their skeptical responses: that it‚Äôs impossible to put numbers on such things, that the true probabilities are inherently unknowable. Of course, the true probabilities aren‚Äôt known, but that isn‚Äôt the point. Even if they weren‚Äôt using numbers, her peers were ‚Äúactually doing these calculations implicitly all the time,‚Äù she recalls.</p>
<p id="YtJmZj">You might not tell yourself ‚Äúthe odds of China invading Taiwan this year is 10 percent,‚Äù but how much time a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense spends studying, say, Taiwan‚Äôs naval strategy is probably a reflection of their concept of the underlying probability. They wouldn‚Äôt spend any time if their probability was 0.1 percent; they would be losing their mind if their probability was 90 percent. In reality, it‚Äôs somewhere in between. They‚Äôre just not making that assessment explicit or putting it in a form that makes it possible to judge their accuracy and from which they can learn in the future. Numeric predictions can be graded; they let you know when you‚Äôre wrong and how wrong you are. That‚Äôs exactly why they‚Äôre so scary to make.</p>
<p id="IOKHIY">That leads to another commonality: practice. Forecasting is a lot like any other skill ‚Äî you get better with practice ‚Äî so good forecasters forecast a lot, and that in turn makes them better at it. They also update their forecasts a lot. The Taiwan numbers I heard from the team at the start of our meeting? They weren‚Äôt the same by the end. Part of practicing is adjusting and tweaking constantly.</p>
<p id="cugS8M">But not everyone who practices, and uses numbers to do so, succeeds. In <em>Superforecasting</em>, Tetlock and Gardner come up with an array of ‚Äúcommandments‚Äù to help us mere mortals do better, but I often find myself struggling to implement them. One is ‚Äústrike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence‚Äù; another is ‚Äústrike the right balance between under- and overconfidence.‚Äù Great, I will simply strike correct balances in all things. I will become Ty Cobb by always striking the right balance between swinging too early and swinging too late.</p>
<p id="QYu0Bh">However, another commandment ‚Äî to pay attention to ‚Äúbase rates‚Äù ‚Äî came up a lot when talking to the Samotsvety team. In forecasting lingo, a ‚Äúbase rate‚Äù is the rate at which some event tends to happen. If I want to project the odds that the New York Yankees win the World Series, I might note that out of 119 World Series to date, the Yankees <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/world-series-winners-complete-list-by-year">have won 27</a>, for a base rate of 22.7 percent. If I knew nothing else about baseball, that would incline me to give the Yankees better odds than any other team to win the next World Series.</p>
<p id="X2krmN">Of course, you‚Äôd be a fool to depend on that alone ‚Äî in baseball, you have a lot more information than base rates to go on, like stats on every player, years of modeling telling you which stats are most predictive of team performance, etc. But when projecting other kinds of events where far less data exists, you often don‚Äôt have any more to go on than the base rate.</p>
<p id="AmHnjD">This was the whole explanation, it turns out, for why everyone in the group put a relatively low probability on the odds of a successful Chinese attempt to retake Taiwan by 2030. Members argued over just how strong the reasons for China to attempt such an effort was, but there was broad agreement that the base rate of war ‚Äî between China and Taiwan or just between countries in general ‚Äî is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-wars-project-mars">not very high</a>. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs why we were all so far below 50 percent, because we were all starting really low,‚Äù Justice explained when I asked.</p>
<p id="uR4ALX">That kind of attention to base rates can be surprisingly powerful. Among other things, it gives you a starting point for questions that might seem otherwise intractable. Say you wanted to predict whether <a href="https://www.vox.com/india" data-source="encore">India</a> will go into a recession next year. Starting by counting up the number of years in which India has had a recession since independence and calculating a probability is a simple way to begin a guess without requiring huge amounts of research. One of my first <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/7/21051910/predictions-trump-brexit-recession-2019-2020">successful predictions</a> was that neither India nor China would go into a recession in 2019. I got it right not because I‚Äôm an expert on either, but because I paid attention to the base rates.</p>
<p id="whqRS8">But there‚Äôs more to successful forecasting than just base rates. For one thing, knowing what base rate to use is itself a bit of an art. Going into the China/Taiwan discussion, I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis">counted</a> that there have been four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Princess">lethal</a> exchanges <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dong-Yin">between</a> China and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis">Taiwan</a> since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. That‚Äôs four incidents over 75 years, implying that there‚Äôs a 5 percent chance of a lethal exchange in a given year. There are six years between now and 2030, so I got a 26.5 percent chance that there‚Äôd be a lethal exchange in at least one of them. After adjusting down for the odds that the exchange is just a skirmish versus a full invasion, and compensating for the chances that Taiwan beats China, I got my 5 percent number.</p>
<p id="iZLvrx">But in our discussion, the participants brought up all kinds of other base rates I hadn‚Äôt thought of. Sempere alone brought up three. One was the rate at which provinces claimed by China (like Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet) have eventually been absorbed, peacefully or by force; another was how often control of Taiwan has changed over the last few hundred years (twice; once when Japan took over from the Qing Empire in 1895 and once when the Chinese Nationalists did in 1945); the third base rate used <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Tg5pQCjpefFiqaKjw/limitations-of-laplace-s-rule-of-succession">Laplace‚Äôs rule</a>. Laplace‚Äôs rule states that the probability of something that hasn‚Äôt happened before happening is 1 divided by N+2, where N is the number of times it hasn‚Äôt happened in the past. So the odds of the People‚Äôs Republic of China invading Taiwan this year is 1 divided by 75 (the number of years since 1949 when this has not happened) plus 2, or 1/77, or 1.3 percent.</p>
<p id="GqfXx2">Sempere averaged his three base rates to get his initial prediction: 8 percent. Is that the best method? Should he have added even more? How should he have adjusted his guess after our discussion? (He nudged up to 12 percent.) There‚Äôs no firm rule about these questions. It‚Äôs ultimately something that can only be judged by your track record.</p>
<h3 id="Mk6pIR">What if knowing the future is knowing the world?</h3>
<p id="uCvk6i">Justice, the MBA student, tells me that quantitative skill is one reason why the Samotsvety crew is so good at prediction. Another reason is more abstract, maybe even grandiose: that as you forecast, you develop ‚Äúa better model of the world ... you start to see patterns in how the world works, and then that makes you better at forecasting.‚Äù</p>
<p id="HL9wSy">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs helpful to think of learning forecasting as having two steps,‚Äù he wrote in a follow-up email to me. ‚ÄúThe first (and most important) step is the recognition that the future and past will look mostly the same. The second step is isolating that small bundle of cases where the two are different.‚Äù And it‚Äôs in that second step that developing a clear model of how the world works, and being willing to update that model frequently, is most helpful.</p>
<p id="znOEsC">A lot of Justice‚Äôs ‚Äúupdates‚Äù to his world model have been toward assuming more continuity. In recent years, he says, he learned a lot from facts like, ‚ÄúPutin didn‚Äôt die of cancer, use nukes, or get removed from office; bird flu didn‚Äôt jump to and spread among humans (so far); Viktor Orban (very recently) dropped his objection to Ukraine aid.‚Äù What these have in common is ‚Äúthey‚Äôre predominantly about major events that <em>didn‚Äôt</em> happen, implying the future will look a lot like the past.‚Äù</p>
<p id="nfEYXW">The hardest part of the job is predicting those rare exceptions where everything changes. Samotsvety‚Äôs big coming-out party happened in early 2022 when they published an <a href="https://samotsvety.org/blog/2022/03/10/samotsvety-nuclear-risk-forecasts-march-2022/">estimate of the odds that London would be hit by nuclear weapons</a> as a result of the Ukraine conflict. Their estimated odds of a reasonably prepared Londoner dying from a nuclear warhead in the next month were 0.00241 percent: very, very low, all things considered. The prediction got some <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/micromorts-nuclear-war/">press attention</a> and earned rejoinders from nuclear experts like Peter Scoblic, who argued it significantly <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W8dpCJGkwrwn7BfLk/nuclear-expert-comment-on-samotsvety-nuclear-risk-forecast-2">understated the risk of a nuclear exchange</a>. It was a big moment for the group ‚Äî but also an example of a prediction that‚Äôs very, very difficult to get right. The further you‚Äôre straying from the ordinary course of history (and a nuclear bomb going off in London would be straying very far), the harder this is.</p>
<p id="Uh7QKL">The tight connection between forecasting and building a model of the world helps explain why so much of the early interest in the idea came from the intelligence community. Matheny and colleagues wanted to develop a tool that could give policymakers real-time numerical probabilities, something that intelligence reports have historically not done, much to policymakers‚Äô consternation. As early as 1973, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_9pEYgRPsF0R1EMXUQIb6TSXw9fIZNM/view">Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was telling colleagues</a> he wished ‚Äúintelligence would supply him with estimates of the relevant betting odds.‚Äù</p>
<p id="UvdXJ5">Matheny‚Äôs experiment ran through 2020. It included both the aggregative contingent estimation (ACE), which used members of the public and grew into the Good Judgment Project, and the IC Prediction Market (ICPM), which was available to intelligence analysts with access to classified information. The two sources of information were <a href="https://goodjudgment.io/docs/Goldstein-et-al-2015.pdf">about equally accurate</a>, despite the outsiders‚Äô lack of classified access. The experiment was exciting enough to spawn a <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/04/15/how-spooks-are-turning-to-superforecasting-in-the-cosmic-bazaar">UK offshoot</a>. But funding on the US side of the Atlantic ran out, and the culture of forecasting in intelligence died off.</p>
<p id="43Y8qh">To Matheny, it‚Äôs a crying shame, and he wishes that government institutions and think tanks like his would get back into the habit and act a bit more like Samotsvety. ‚ÄúPeople might assume that the methods that we use in most institutions that are responsible for analysis have been well-evaluated. And in fact, they haven‚Äôt. Even when there are organizations whose decisions cost billions of dollars or even trillions, billions of dollars in the case of key national security decisions,‚Äù he told me. Forecasting, by contrast, works. So what are we waiting for?</p>

When I read ‚ÄúCFD‚Äù I always think of computational fluid dynamics and so ‚ÄúCFD gambling‚Äù sounds pretty cool to me. Obviously I do know I‚Äôm just overfitting to a TLA and I‚Äôd like to know what it <i>actually</i> means.

CFD gambling app<p>I don't think 'gambling app' is a fair description given it's a regulated security, any broker that truly offers CFD trading is (1) going to be legit; (2) going to be competing with the broker you were searching for for result space.</p><p>Of course to serve its users any app store should massively prioritise the word/brand (incl. typos) you actually search for though.

OTOH I think it is legit to trust top app store search results to return quality apps, especially if there is a massive disparity between their quality. The scam app has obvious repetitive spam reviews. The developer's website is terrible and the submit button doesn't even work. This is basic quality control on apple's part. If every single app store user needs to manually vet every single app they install to the proper extent there would be a fraction of a fraction of the installs and respectively, a fraction of a fraction of the revenue.</p><p>Consider the extent of lawsuits between apple and companies with app store apps - does it not strike you that apple protects that revenue stream? Wouldn't it make sense to give app store users a sense of trust in the top search results?

<h2><a name="index1h1"></a>Introduction</h2>

<pre><code>10 PRINT "HELLO"
20 GOTO 10
</code></pre>

<p>In April, 1984, my father bought a computer for his home office, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_800#ABC_802">Luxor ABC-802</a>, with a
Z80 CPU, 64 kilobytes of RAM, a yellow-on-black screen with 80 by 25
text mode, or about 160 by 75 pixels in graphics mode, and two floppy
drives. It had BASIC in its ROM, and came with absolutely no games. If
I wanted to play with it, I had to learn how to program, and write my
own games. I learned BASIC, and over the next few years would learn
Pascal, C, and more. I had found my passion. I was 14 years old and I
knew what I wanted to do when I grew up.</p>

<p>When I was learning how to program, I thought it was important to
really understand how computers work, how programming languages work,
and how various tools like text editors work. I wanted to hone my
craft and produce the finest code humanly possible. I was wrong.</p>

<p>This essay is a condensation of what I wish I had been told after I
had learned the basics of how to code. Instead, I was told, in person
and in magazine articles, that by the time I would be twenty five
years old, I'd be too old to work as a programmer. It was critical
that I learn as many algorithms, data structures, and languages as
quickly as possible. Programming was, after all, a young man's game,
and required being able to stay up all night, every night, to crank
out more code than anyone else. That was the only way to succeed. It
turns out that none of that was true: not the part about youth, nor
the part of missing sleep, and especially not the part about gender.</p>

<p>As I write this essay, it will soon be forty years to the day since I
first wrote computer code. I've managed to support myself by
developing software, and I still write code every day. There is
nothing else I would rather do for a living. I can't point at
enormous successes and impressive feats, but I hope that surviving for
decades in the industry gives me sufficient credentials to speak about
software development.</p>

<p>This essay discusses some of the things I've learned about how to
successfully build software. These are things I've learned from my own
experience; I'm not a researcher, and there are few references to
sources, and this is largely not supported by evidence. I'm basing
this essay on my own experience, and if you disagree, that's fine.</p>

<p>My goal in this essay is to get the reader to think, to research, to
learn, to ponder. My goal is not to tell the reader how to think, what
to think, how things are, or to give the answer to every question
about every aspect of the process of building software.</p>

<h2><a name="index2h1"></a>The core skills</h2>

<p>Interesting and significant software is beyond the capacity of any one
person to build alone in a reasonable time frame. This means that the
fundamental, crucial, core skills in building software are
communication and collaboration.</p>

<p>It's not enough to know how computers work, how to use programming
languages, to know algorithms and data structures, or how to use the
varied tools involved in software construction. You also need to know
how to talk with other people to learn what software to build, what it
must do, how much effort is acceptable, how to manage the work, and
many more things. You have know how to work with others to build
something together that's bigger than any of you. If you and your team
can do it well, it'll be bigger than the sum of you. Team work can be
a force multiplier.</p>

<p>These are difficult skills to learn. I've found them much more
difficult than any technical part of building software.</p>

<p>Even in the projects where I'm the only person, there are at least
three people involved: past me, present me, and future me.</p>

<ul>
<li>Past me is a lazy and careless slob who always leaves a mess.</li>
<li>Present me does superb work, but has to cope with all the stupid
stuff done by past me, and needs to placate future me.</li>
<li>Future me is an egotistic and opinionated snob for whom nothing is ever
good enough.</li>
</ul>


<p>Getting these three people to get along well enough to get anything
done is a constant struggle for me. I use my journal to cope. I write
there what I do, why, and what the result is. I try to write so that
I'll understand it, even if I'm tired, or have just experienced a
short term neuralizer mind wipe a la Men in Black. I also plan
explicit iterations, with specific tasks, and I use the GTD system to
track things that still need to done.</p>

<h2><a name="index3h1"></a>On productivity</h2>

<p>What productivity means is not well defined for software development:
time is easy to measure, but the output is not. Most people have at
least a vague idea what productivity means to them. However, there are
known factors that impact productivity---these are customarily
ignored.</p>

<p>To do good work you need to take care of yourself. You have to sleep
well. You have to eat well. If you're tired, or have too much stress,
you'll make mistakes and bad decisions. These result in you doing bad
work. That's not a moral problem, but you may have to fix your own
mistakes. You'll enjoy life, and work, more if you do good work.</p>

<p>Hillel Wayne has talked about sleep and has sources. Recommended

</ul>


<p>You also need to have an environment that helps you do good work. Is
it quiet? Are there interruptions? Is the furniture comfortable, and
unlikely to hurt you in the long run? Do you have access to
necessities, such as a toilet and tea? Can you take a break from your
work area? Can you go for a walk: walking helps thinking. This is an
incomplete list.</p>

<p>Further, you need to manage yourself and your work in ways that suit
you. The best way to do this depends on who you are, your preferences
and experiences, and the kind of work you do. There is no single
solution that works for everyone all the time.</p>

<p>For myself, I've found applying the David Allen <a href="https://gtdfh.liw.fi/">Getting Things
Done</a> system has worked well, but whatever you
do, you need to know what you need to achieve, today and in the near
future, and you need to arrange things so that you can concentrate on
one thing at a time. Note, however, that I use the GTD system partly
to know that I can slack off; I do not aim to be as productive as
possible at all times.</p>

<p>It may be worth tracking what you've done. Reflecting on that can give
you a sense of achievement, and lets you see the progress you make.
This can be a motivation and morale booster.</p>

<p>Multi-tasking is fine for a computer, but your brain can only think
about one thing at a time and has really miserable context switching.</p>

<h2><a name="index4h1"></a>On governance</h2>

<p>When a group collaborates, one of the things they need to establish
early on is governance: basically, how does the group make decisions,
and how do they change them? The decisions range from the fundamental
to the mundane: Who is in the group? Is it a democracy, or hierarchy,
or some other structure? Who gets to have a say? What beverages does
the group get? What font should the website use?</p>

<p>Governance is difficult, but it's easier when it's explicit.
Uncertainty about responsibility and power results in confusion and
quarrel, and these can tear a group apart.</p>

<p>All groups eventually have conflicts. Managing this and resolving
differences is nominally the job of management, but really it falls on
everyone. This requires skills that seem to be rarely taught to
programmers, which is a shame.</p>

</ul>


<h2><a name="index5h1"></a>On politics and ethics</h2>

<p>Software development is always a political and ethical act. Whenever
you're building software, you have to make a myriad of decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>what shall the software do?</li>
<li>what resources will using it require?</li>
<li>how shall it be used?</li>
<li>what abilities shall using it require?</li>
<li>what things will be easy to do?</li>
<li>what things will be hard to do?</li>
<li>will the software empower its users, or force them to do things for
someone else's benefit?</li>
</ul>


<p>All these decisions have consequences, which will favor some people
over other people. Hence, they have political and ethical
aspects, which need to be considered.</p>

<p>As an example, if you make something that can be used with a cheap
phone, you enable most people in the world to use it. If you make
it so that it requires expensive hardware, you exclude many people,
especially poor people. Sometimes that is inevitable, and inherent in
the problem you're building software to solve, but it's still a
choice.</p>

<p>There may not be a right or wrong choice for a particular decision,
but there are always consequences. You have to consider them, and
decide if they're acceptable, and for whom.</p>

<p>In general, the software you build will reflect some values. Make sure
you know you agree with them.</p>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>On ethics and software freedom</h2>

<p>Free and open source software is the ethical kind of software.
Software freedom is essential for the well-being of people whose lives
are affected by the use of computers, whether they are using computers
directly or someone else is using computers to do things that matter
to other people.</p>

<p>I have been writing free software since 1986, when I first read the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">GNU Manifesto</a> on a BBS. (The
term "open source" is a synonym: I do not care to debate the
differences between the two.)</p>

<p>Much of my career has involved building open source software. My
preference for free and open source over non-free software is clear,
and well documented.</p>

<p>Entire libraries' worth of text has been produced over the past three
decades about the ethics of free and open source software versus other
kinds, and specifics of licenses. I'm not going to make a summary of
arguments here, or even point at recommended reading.</p>

<p>I wanted to make my position clear, in case it matters to the reader.
However, very little of this essay, including the topic of ethics, is
related to software freedom and applies equally to the development
non-free software.</p>

<h2><a name="index6h1"></a>On diversity and quality</h2>

<p>Human rights are fundamentally important. Treating other people well
is the right thing to do. All of this is of paramount priority,
whatever you do. If you don't agree with this, I have no hope for
you.</p>

<p>In a software development context, I've found that the most crucial
thing for building high quality software is to have diversity of
thought among the people contributing to it. The more different kinds
of thinking is brought into the project, the more likely the decisions
will work for more circumstances, for more people, and deal with more
things going wrong.</p>

<p>Diversity of thought comes from different kinds of people coming from
different backgrounds and having lived different kinds of lives.
Sometimes differences are visible externally, sometimes not.</p>

<p>When in doubt, choose different. If you exclude people based on them
being unlike you, you will likely be choosing poorly.</p>

<p>Diversity doesn't guarantee success. Nothing guarantees success.
However, uniformity guarantees you get one-sided answers. Sometimes
that's enough, but often it's not.</p>

<p>Collaboration and communication can certainly be more challenging in a
diverse setting. Do not fear this. Treat challenges as an opportunity
to learn, to become better at what you do.</p>

<p>People will make mistakes, and you too will make them. It's a good
policy to be benign and kind when others make mistakes, and expect
that from others in return. Punishing others for mistakes will leave
you alone.</p>

<h2><a name="index7h1"></a>On maintenance</h2>

<p>It is widely considered, in the software industry, that most of the cost of
software production comes after the initial release, in the so called
maintenance phase. The initial development might take a year or two,
maintenance will take decades.</p>

<p>One would think that this would lead to development practices, and
architectural decision, and everything else to be optimized for lower
maintenance costs. Unfortunately, the economic and other incentives
favor the opposite. In most companies, the event horizon tends to be a
quarter year, or a full year at most. It's not considered acceptable to spend
a lot more effort now to save most of the effort in the long term.</p>

<p>Even for personal hobby projects, there is often a strong urge to get
something working as soon as possible rather than taking one's time to
do things well,
but at least that's an internal urge, not external pressure. Even so,
the end result is the same: software that's harder to change later on,
when bugs are found, requirements change, or the software needs to be
adapted to changes in the surrounding system or ecosystem.</p>

<p>I am not alone in seeing the problem. I don't think it can be solved,
unless the economic incentives are radically changed. It's on
individual developers to try to reduce maintenance costs
surreptitiously, when they can, as a kind of preemptive guerrilla
maintenance.</p>

<h2><a name="index8h1"></a>Big questions for projects</h2>

<p>I find that it's important, but also helpful, to answer a few
questions at the beginning of every new project. The answers don't
have to be final, and it's OK to change them at any time: if you don't
adjust your thinking when you learn new things, you're not good at
what you do. The answers can even be inane, as long as they're honest.
The point to is to get you thinking about the questions at all.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For whom are you building the software? Whose opinions about it
matter?</p>

<p>This tells you some of the stakeholders in the project. There will
likely be more stakeholders later on, but it's a start. Knowing who
the stakeholders are lets you concentrate on their needs. This helps
make the project a success.</p>

<p>The stakeholders might be the end users, or might be the CEO. If you
think it's the end users, but it's actually the CEO, you will
make decisions that make the CEO unhappy, and the project will fail,
and you won't understand why. And vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>Why are you building the software?</p>

<p>"It's my job" might be a very practical answer. It's an answer that
means that you need to re-evaluate everything if the chance of
getting money is reduced. A different answer might be more about
passion, or mission, and this means your reaction to changing
circumstances is going to be different. There's no wrong answer
here, but be sure to be honest, at least to yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>What should the software do, in broad strokes? Also, what should it
not do?</p>

<p>This is about knowing if you're building a word processor or a
spreadsheet. It's not about detailed requirements or acceptance
criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>How should the software work, in broad strokes?</p>

<p>Again, big picture view. Are you making a command line tool, a web
service, an operating system, a mobile app, or something else? What
type and size of hardware?</p></li>
<li><p>What's important and what is just nice to have?</p>

<p>This gets into requirements and acceptance criteria. You need to
know them to build something good. Write them down. Also write down

<h2><a name="index9h1"></a>Planning and estimating</h2>

<p>Detailed planning beyond the very near future is difficult and usually
fails. This includes estimating how long the work will take. I avoid
doing this.</p>

<p>Planning and estimation are far from useless and should not be
neglected. I plan and I estimate, but within the limits of what I've
learned to be realistic. Specifically, I find it nearly impossible to
make detailed plans beyond a one or two week iteration. By detailed
plans I mean figuring out tasks at a granularity of what can be done
in one sitting.</p>

<p>Something surprising usually happens that ruins the plans beyond a
couple of weeks. It might be management changing priorities, or the
client changing their mind, or the company going bankrupt, or being
bought. It might be something else, but usually something happens. If
an iteration is short, you don't lose too much if all your planning
has to be thrown away.</p>

<p>You can also react more easily if you need to change course.</p>

<p>I stress that I'm talking about detailed planning here. It's fine to
make plans for what to do next month or next quarter, as long as
everyone involved knows that these plans are likely to have to change,
and the plans are kept suitably high level.</p>

<p>An analogy: if you're planning a road trip across the country, you
will probably want to plan what cities to drive through. You probably
don't want plan every stop to fill up on fuel or to eat. You want to
leave enough flexibility that you can change route if there's an
accident, or weather, or something else that may come as a surprise on
the way.</p>

<p>Iteration works. Nothing else seems to work for large software
projects. At least I've never seen any other approach work.</p>

<p>For me, iterations work better if they're focused. Having an explicit,
clear goal helps cut down on scope creep. It concentrates work to aim
at the iteration goal, rather than on what seems like a good idea in
the moment.</p>

<p>When I plan for an iteration, I break things into small tasks that can
be finished in one sitting. My estimates for tasks fall into four
buckets: up to a quarter hour, full hour, four hours, or too long. I
prefer the shorter tasks: they're easier to estimate, and easier to
do, and usually break fewer things. Anything that's too long needs to
be broken down further.</p>

<p>Some tasks are impossible to estimate. Debugging is a typical example.
How long will it take you to realize the Ethernet cable is broken, or
an operating system update broke things, or find the cause of some
other unforeseen problem? Debugging happens, and you had best leave
enough slack in your planning to cope with some troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Interruptions also happen. Sometimes you have no option but to react
and respond to them immediately. Leave room for that.</p>

<h2><a name="index10h1"></a>Express yourself in writing</h2>

<p>Your memory is fleeting and fallible. You will forget details. You
will forget important stuff. You will remember things wrongly. When
you collaborate, you and others will disagree on what was said, agreed
upon, and decided.</p>

<p>I was once in a meeting, with four people, plus the CTO. The CTO
forbade us to take notes: it seems the fad of the week was that
note taking is what makes meetings a waste of time. The meeting took
two hours. Afterwards, the four of us had about eight different
opinions of what had been decided. No follow-up actions were ever
taken.</p>

<p>Write things down. It seems like a stupid chore, tedious, boring, and
archaic, but it's the way organizations remember. Writing things down
is a super power that is easily overlooked.</p>

<p>Your team should keep meeting minutes, covering at least the
important decisions, and what actions everyone should do after the meeting.
Keep them short enough that they're easy write, and to read.
Archive them somewhere everyone can look at them at any time. This
helps people who weren't there, perhaps because they were on vacation,
or only join a year later.</p>

<p>Apropos meetings, learn how to have good meetings. What works for me
is an agenda set well ahead of time, with supporting materials.
Prepare for the meeting so that you don't waste everyone's time. Have
a chair who keeps discussion on track, and time boxed. Your process
for a good meeting might be different, but you should find one.</p>

<h2><a name="index11h1"></a>On doing work</h2>

<p>When making a change, make only one change at a time. If you can, split the
change you're making into smaller partial changes. Small changes are
easier to understand and less likely to be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Automate away friction: running tests, making a release, packaging,
delivery, deployment, etc. Do this from as early
on as feasible. Set up a pipeline where you can make a change and make
sure the software still works and willing users can start using the
changed software. The smoother you can make this pipeline, the easier
it will be to build the software.</p>

<p>Use version control for every project. Practice continuous integration
by merging changes to the main line of development often.</p>

<p>Develop an automated test suite that you trust: if tests pass, you can
make a release, or deploy to production. This usually means starting
the test suite early on in the project. Make sure the automated tests
cover all aspects you care about: the goal is to make sure that what
you give to others works they way it's intended. Update production
code and test code together.</p>

<p>Run the test suite many times in a row to identify flaky tests. Do not
suffer flaky tests.</p>

<p>Do stress or load testing, even if you only do it in simple ways. You
don't know your software and system can handle 10,000 concurrent users
until you've done so. Mine didn't.</p>

<p>In one job, we had a system that had worked fine in production for a
while. We deployed it to a customer who had a lot more traffic. Our
software failed. The problem turned out that we ran out of TCP port
numbers: we made an HTTP request for each incoming message, but we
didn't re-use the underlying TCP connection. There was so much traffic
that all possible port numbers were used, and then everything stalled.
The fix was to re-use the TCP connection, a change that took about one
line, and then everything worked fine. We would have found this
ourselves had we done even the simplest load testing.</p>

<p>If possible, use the software yourself. You'll understand your users
better.</p>

<p>Watch other people use the software. You'll understand your software's
sharp corners better. True story: it's hard for people who've not been
involved in the development of software to use the software, if it has
three different names for the same thing. Seeing someone struggle with
this makes it painfully obvious.</p>

<p>Treat testers as friends who help you find when you've made a mistake.
They're not out to humiliate you. Nobody is so perfect that they never
make mistakes or overlook details or forget entire features. Don't ask
me how I know.</p>

<h2><a name="index12h1"></a>Advice on coding</h2>

<p>Simple, obvious code is easier to write, easier to get to work, easier
to understand, and easier to change without breaking it. Simplify
things as much as you can, but no more than that. Sacrifice simplicity
at the altar of performance only when you have proven the performance
gains are worth it.</p>

<p>Complexity is the enemy you think is a friend.</p>

<p>Coupling and cohesion are still important concepts.</p>

<p>In every project, conceptual clarity is important. Also, keep your
terminology consistent. Confusion lurks where clarity hides. With
great confusion comes great annoyance and the certainty of bugs.</p>

<p>Speed is a feature to users, but not always for development, as too
much haste leaves too little time to think. Functionality can be a
misfeature.</p>

<p>Recommended reading:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php">A Philosophy of Software
Design</a> by John
Ousterhout, which I've not yet read, only skimmed, but which people
I respect keep recommending to me.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index13h1"></a>Developing a career</h2>

<p>You can choose to be a deep expert on something very specific, or to
be a generalist, or some mix. Choose wisely. There may not be any
wrong choice, but every choice has consequences.</p>

<p>Be humble. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witches_(Discworld)">Be Nanny, not Granny</a>. People may respect the powerful
witch more, but they like the kind one better.</p>

<p>Be open and honest. Treat others fairly. You don't have to believe in
karma for it to work, so make it work for you, not against you.</p>

<p>Help and lift up others. But at the same time, don't allow others to
abuse or take advantage of you. You don't need to accept bullshit. Set
your boundaries.</p>

<p>Ask for help when you need it, or when you get stuck. Accept help when
offered.</p>

<p>I am not the right person to talk about developing a career, but when
I've done the above, things have usually ended up going well.</p>

<h2><a name="index14h1"></a>Takeaway</h2>

<p>Take care of yourself. Sleep. Eat. Exercise. Rest. Relax. Take care of
other people, as best you can. People are important. Software is just
fun.</p>

  <div>
  <p>‚ÄúThe Netherlands hosts some of the world‚Äôs largest internet exchanges. This obliges us to make the best use of these exchanges for our national security. With the Temporary Cyber Act, we will make optimum use of the data carried on our cables to protect The Netherlands against Russian and Chinese hackers‚Äù ‚Äì <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/12/inlichtingendiensten-kunnen-sneller-en-beter-optreden-tegen-cyberdreiging">Dutch government announcement</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote this earlier, but did not publish it then because I wasn‚Äôt happy with the post. However, since <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/12/inlichtingendiensten-kunnen-sneller-en-beter-optreden-tegen-cyberdreiging">the new Dutch Intelligence and Security act just passed</a>, it is relevant for an international audience. Earlier, I wrote a piece for <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/dutch-intel-law-about-intel/">about:intel</a>, and in there you can find further discussion in English.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of specific note, this law vastly expands when the Dutch agencies can perform SIGINT on Dutch Internet Exchanges like the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. These powers extend to any form of communication, including private peering and Private Network Interconnects (PNI). Every cable must be made available for ‚Äôexploration‚Äô, and it is likely that due to the wording in the new law, any request for such examination will be granted by the commission that rules on these things. Such exploration includes the right to send data to foreign intelligence agencies, including non-European ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the law also makes it clear that requests for full intercepts should now mostly be judged on technical terms (‚Äòis the request complete‚Äô) and with much less emphasis of the merits of full SIGINT. But do read on for the details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, the upper house of Dutch parliament passed a law to reduce (I think) the oversight on the Dutch intelligence and security services, while simultaneously granting them more leeway to execute their powers. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/resignation-as-intelligence-regulator/">In 2022, I resigned as regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security services because of this attempt</a>. Politico.eu wrote <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/intelligence-watchdog-bert-hubert-netherlands-hacking-cyber-law/">a comprehensive article</a> about it, representing various points of view.</p>
<p>In this page I will try to explain how the new law works and what these changes mean. I also provide some context from the European Court of Human Rights<!-- and the EU Court of Justice-->. This page refers to the just passed version of the proposed legislation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/uitleg-over-de-wiv-2/">far longer page in Dutch</a>. This post is an attempt to summarise the changes for an international audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<center>
<p><img src="https://berthub.eu/articles/cables2.jpg" alt=""></p>

</center>
<h2 id="applicability">Applicability</h2>
<p>The Dutch Law on Intelligence and Security Services defines a broad set of powers. It is also a somewhat odd law with a long history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An English translation of a 2016 draft of the law <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/index.cfm/en/search/?trisaction=search.detail&amp;year=2016&amp;num=188&amp;dLang=EN">can be found on the European Commission website</a>. Note that this is a draft and it definitely differs from <a href="https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0039896">the law that is in force (Dutch)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A remarkable aspect of the law is that it is universally applicable - it extends as much powers to spy on Dutch people as those from other countries. There are no general protections for people from or in The Netherlands or in the EU. This stands in stark contrast to US legislation which provides some privacy protection to ‚ÄòUS Persons‚Äô, but to no one else.</p>
<p>In addition, the powers can be used around the world - Dutch agencies are free to hack computers anywhere, or to intercept communications anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>The services can investigate anything or anyone that gives rise to the suspicion that their activities or goals might be harmful for the survival of the system of democratic rule of law, for security or other important interests of the state. In addition, the services can investigate other countries.</p>
<h2 id="powers">Powers</h2>
<p>The powers granted to the services are broad, but also largely ‚Äòread-only‚Äô. The services do not operate drones (unlike the CIA), and they have limited powers to intervene or disturb things, with one exception.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 40: Observing and following people and objects</li>
<li>Article 41: Operate &amp; instruct agents, who are allowed to break other laws under specific conditions</li>
<li>Article 42: Enter &amp; investigate closed objects and premises</li>
<li>Article 43: Collect, store and match DNA data from people</li>
<li>Article 44: Intercept and investigate physical post and packages</li>
<li>Article 45: Hack ‚Äòautomated works‚Äô, computers in the very broadest sense of the word</li>
<li>Article 47: Intercept any form of (tele)communications from a specific person, organization of technical identifier</li>
<li>Article 48: Intercept &amp; record whole cables</li>
<li>Article 49: Investigate data recorded under article 48 to find targets or technical identifiers</li>
<li>Article 50: Select part of the data recorded under article 48 for use in intelligence/security investigations</li>
<li>Article 54: Requisitioning data</li>
<li>Article 60: Perform automated analysis and ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù on all data, including 48 data</li>
<li>Article 73: ‚ÄúUndertake measures to protect interests of the services‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subjects-of-these-powers">Subjects of these powers</h2>
<p>The law is somewhat unique that all these powers are only tied to the <em>interests</em> the services protect, and not to specific people. So unlike police forces, the services can spy not only on direct targets of investigation, they can also eavesdrop ‚Äônon-targets‚Äô (who might know interesting things about targets) or even hack ‚Äôthird parties‚Äô that could function as a stepping stone to useful information.</p>
<p>Before the services can use their investigatory powers on non-targets or third parties, they do have to explain why this is the only way for an investigation to proceed.</p>
<h2 id="oversight-warrant-process">Oversight, warrant process</h2>
<p>For all of the powers, there must be internal sign-off. Depending on the nature, this sign-off can be mandated to lower ranking employees. The most infringing powers however need to be approved by the relevant minister. Then, the <a href="https://tib-ivd.nl/">ex-ante regulator</a> rules if this permission was obtained lawfully. The minister takes the political decision, the ex-ante regulator verifies this decision. The opinion of the ex-ante regulator is binding.</p>
<p>In addition, there is <a href="https://ctivd.nl/">a non-binding ex-post regulator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="administrative-warrant-extensions">Administrative warrant extensions</h2>
<p>The powers are available for use on people or organizations. If someone turns out to have an additional phone number, or starts using a different phone number, a warrant can administratively be updated with this new information. No new permission process is required. In addition, if a warrant was written to target an organization, if this organization was described well, newly discovered members of the organization can also be added to a warrant administratively.</p>
<p>Crucially, such administrative extensions can not be used to add non-targets or third parties - these can not have been a member of a well described organization.</p>
<h2 id="sigint">SIGINT</h2>
<p>The SIGINT or bulk interception powers are complicated. The intelligence and security law considers that the copying, collecting and storing of data is a lesser infringement than actually looking at the data. This is in line with recent European Court of Human Rights precedents. The infringement of privacy increases at every step of the intelligence process, from collection to storing to selecting relevant communications to exploiting such communications for intelligence/security purposes. Crucially however, merely intercepting and storing data is already an infringement that needs a justification.</p>
<p>Article 48 provides for the collection powers. Services need to describe why a specific cable is interesting, and what they expect to achieve with that data. They must also use a well-targeted cable, one that is expected to best provide the data the services are interested in. There are also some restrictions on traffic with origin and destination in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Article 49 enables technical analysis of this data to see if it includes interesting targets or subjects. Article 50 meanwhile allows for the selection of communications for dissemination to intelligence teams.</p>
<p>Finally, with specific permission, article 60 allows for the algorithmic analysis of all data intercepted under article 48. It was not found possible to properly limit what ‚Äúalgorithmic analysis‚Äù might be, so this was left to the ex-ante regulator to determine. In an adversarial reading, ‚Äúfinding all email from a specific person‚Äù might be dressed up as an algorithmic analysis. This means article 60 could be an alternative to article 50, and thus it needs the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-changes">Proposed changes</h2>
<p>In the proposed additional ‚Äòcyber law‚Äô, several things would change:</p>
<ul>
<li>The non-binding ex-post regulator gets binding oversight powers on select capabilities. To actually stop an operation involves a heavyweight procedure which can also be stayed. In addition, the regulator needs a lot of new highly technical staff which has been hard to find.</li>
<li>Hacking operations no longer need to detail plans or technical risks to the regulator. These risks include the leaking of ‚Äòzero days‚Äô, or damaging non-target or third party services. In addition, technical risk includes the possibility that the facilities installed by the services could be abused by yet other services or hackers.</li>
<li>Hacking operations no longer need to be tied to specific groups of people or organizations. It will become possible to hack into generic companies, for example to enable the retrieval of phone location data in the future. For such strategic hacks on infrastructure, no technical risks need to be described to the regulator.</li>
<li>Services gain the power to intercept and store any cable for a year, no matter where it leads to, and also store the data for a year. No justification needs to be given for this exploration beyond that there is an interest in figuring out what traffic a cable carries. Data collected under this article may be investigated for a whole year, but (crucially!) not for any other purpose than finding targets. Such exploratory data can be shared with foreign and non-EU intelligence agencies.</li>
<li>In addition, the article 48 powers can now be applied based solely on ‚Äòindications‚Äô what the technical plans are with this data. The regulators are instructed to mostly only study these indications, to the detriment of proportionality, subsidiarity and ‚Äòas targeted as possible‚Äô requirements. The indications are non-binding and the services have the liberty to do other things during the year if they need to. <strong>In effect, regulators do not have a lot left to regulate with this change</strong>.</li>
<li>The administrative permissionless extension of warrants is extended to <em>NON-TARGETS</em>. This means that if a hacker group is being targeted, warrants for eavesdropping, hacking, requisitioning are automatically extended to the <em>victims</em> of those hackers as well. This means that the additional test that used to apply to non-targets is no longer required, and instead, non-targets now get less protection than targets (!).</li>
<li>Algorithmic analysis on bulk intercepted data no longer needs regulatory approval. Since it is not well described what this automated analysis entails, this is a large expansion of powers that are not regulated up front. The European Court of Human Rights argues explicitly that such automated analysis needs safeguards (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-context">Some context</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-210077">CASE OF BIG BROTHER WATCH AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM</a> - with particular attention to:
<ul>
<li>‚Äú330. The Court considers that Article 8 applies at each of the above stages. While the initial interception followed by the immediate discarding of parts of the communications does not constitute a particularly significant interference, the degree of interference with individuals‚Äô Article 8 rights will increase as the bulk interception process progresses. In this regard, the Court has clearly stated that even the mere storing of data relating to the private life of an individual amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 8 (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, ¬ß 48, Series A no. 116), and that <strong>the need for safeguards will be all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned</strong> (see S. and Marper, cited above, ¬ß 103). The fact that the stored material is in coded form, intelligible only with the use of computer technology and capable of being interpreted only by a limited number of persons, can have no bearing on that finding (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, ¬ß 69, ECHR 2000‚ÄëII and S. and Marper, cited above, ¬ß¬ß 67 and 75).‚Äù</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><header><section><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog">Blog</a><svg width="8" height="12" viewBox="0 0 8 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2 10L6 6L2 2" stroke="#667999" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="square"></path></svg><span>Bluesky‚Äôs Stackable Approach to Moderation</span></section><div><p>March 12, 2024</p><p><span>by <!-- -->The Bluesky Team</span></p></div></header><div><p>Bluesky was created to put <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">users and communities in control</a> of their social spaces online. The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders. Our online experience doesn‚Äôt have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Today, we‚Äôre excited to announce that we‚Äôre <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui">open-sourcing Ozone</a>, our collaborative moderation tool. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content across the network. Later this week, we‚Äôre opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app.</strong> This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we‚Äôre investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a>. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation ‚Äî no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we‚Äôve also been building something bigger ‚Äî an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.</p>
<p>In designing these moderation services, <strong>Bluesky operated by three principles</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple and Powerful:</strong> Give users a pleasant default experience, with customization options under the hood</li>
<li><strong>User Choice:</strong> Empower users and communities to develop their own moderation systems</li>
<li><strong>Openness:</strong> Create an open system that increases trust in the governance of our digital spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>We first shared our vision for <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> before Bluesky even had 20,000 users last year. Now, we serve over 5 million users. In this blog post, we‚Äôll dive into how moderation works on the network, where you can choose and customize all the pieces that make up your social media experience.</p>
<h2>Sensible Defaults with User Choice</h2>
<p>In everything we build, we aim to provide a polished user experience with further customization options for those you who want them. When you sign up for Bluesky, you will be subscribed to Bluesky‚Äôs built-in moderation service by default. This is similar to how custom feeds work on Bluesky ‚Äî we‚Äôll show you a couple feeds by default, but you can also create and subscribe to more. Bluesky‚Äôs moderation service combines around-the-clock coverage by our team to resolve user reports according to our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a> with several automated moderation systems. This provides a strong foundation for moderation on the app. You can read our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023">2023 Moderation Report</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Bluesky‚Äôs vision for moderation is a stackable ecosystem of services. Starting this week, you'll have the power to install filters from independent moderation services, layering them like building blocks on top of the Bluesky app's foundation. This allows you to create a customized experience tailored to your preferences (see example below).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/mod-image-1.jpg" alt="An example moderation service that users can subscribe to." width="600">
  <figcaption>An example moderation service that users can subscribe to.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the first stage of this week‚Äôs rollout, these independent moderation services filters will be available on the desktop version of the app. Soon, they‚Äôll also be available on mobile, so you can shape your social media experience across all platforms.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach is intended to provide a cohesive experience, where our in-house moderation works in conjunction with additional layers customized to each community. The Bluesky app, as an online space that we created and maintain, will always have the foundation of the moderation we provide. Independent moderation services will let you and community builders further customize your own spaces, and open APIs will let developers evolve and innovate on these systems.</p>

</figure>
<p>One team will never be perfect at moderation and curation for the entire world, with its wide variety of contexts, cultures, and preferences. So we‚Äôre excited about opening the ecosystem to empower experts, developers, and users with local context to provide their own input that you can additionally subscribe to, on top of Bluesky‚Äôs moderation service.</p>
<p>Later this week, we will publish a technical explainer for moderation across the AT Protocol. (This blog post will be updated with a link at that time.)</p>
<h2>How will this all work?</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs what users, moderators, and developers can expect to see this week:</p>
<h3>From a user perspective:</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we want Bluesky to be a great and intuitive experience as soon as you install the app. But if you want to customize your experience, you can easily browse and select from other independent moderation services and subscribe to them in the Bluesky app ‚Äî as easily as you‚Äôd follow another account.</p>
<p>For example, someone could make a moderation service that blocks photos of spiders from Bluesky ‚Äî let‚Äôs call it the Spider Shield. If you get a jump scare from seeing spiders in your otherwise peaceful nature feed, you could install this moderation service and immediately any labeled spider pictures would disappear from your experience.</p>
<p>Moderation services can also accept reports, so if you came across an unlabeled picture of a spider, you could report it to the Spider Shield for review.</p>
<h3>From a moderator perspective:</h3>
<p>If you want to offer a moderation layer on top of what the Bluesky app provides, you can do this without running a lot of infrastructure or building your own client app. We‚Äôve built open source software to simplify the process of running a moderation service. While you need some technical know-how for now, we expect this process to get simpler over time.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_ozone_ui.png" alt="Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network." width="600">
  <figcaption>Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Today, you can already run a mute list or block list that other users can subscribe to. But it often gets tied to your account in a way that makes it hard to delegate responsibility to others. Once you‚Äôre running a popular blocklist, that list becomes associated with your account, and users may start directly tagging you in the app. This can get overwhelming at scale.</p>
<p>Ozone, the open source moderation labeling system we‚Äôre releasing today, lets you set up a service like a blocklist, but more nuanced ‚Äî instead of just adding accounts, you can label specific posts too. You will have access to a reporting queue, and users will be able to send reports via the in-app reporting flow. You will be able to set custom labels, and specify what those labels should do. Moderation services will not be tied to individual users, and multiple people can manage them. Tooling designed for teams and communities can help take the burden off individuals and make it possible to run a sustainable moderation service.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre the creator of the previously mentioned Spider Shield labeler that labels photos of spiders. You can set up an Ozone dashboard that provides a queue of spider pictures that have been reported, reducing the need for people to tag you directly every time they find a new spider picture online. It‚Äôs customizable ‚Äî you could create one kind of label that blocks pictures of real spiders, and one kind of label that blurs out illustrations of spiders. You could recruit others who don‚Äôt like spiders to help you manage the reports, and even hand the project off to someone else altogether without disrupting the people who are using it.</p>
<h3>From a developer perspective:</h3>
<p>As a developer, you've got options when it comes to labeling content. You can use our software, like Ozone, or you can apply labels directly through the API. Ozone is built to help humans review moderation reports, but you can also use automated labeling to power your moderation services. Check out Ozone's open-source repo <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to set up Spider Shield as a fully automated service that uses machine learning to find and label spider pictures, you can do that without even touching Ozone, our moderation tool. And if you want to customize Ozone for your own purposes, you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui">submit a PR</a> or fork the project. Our goal in building this open source moderation tooling is to help apps in the AT Protocol ecosystem handle trust &amp; safety challenges without having to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The generic, customizable nature of labels allows you to get creative with them ‚Äî it would be possible to use labels to ‚Äúverify‚Äù nature accounts that don‚Äôt post pictures of spiders, for example. Although the initial functionality of labelers is intended to hide, block, or blur content, it could eventually be used for curation or verification too. We think that the atproto developer ecosystem will find even more ways to use labels and independent moderation services, and will drive innovation in how moderation works on social networks.</p>
<p>Moderation services can work across the entire atproto network, not just the Bluesky app. Imagine if someone creates a new photo-sharing app called Skygram. The Spider Shield moderation service built for Bluesky could easily be used on Skygram too. That's the power of "composable moderation" ‚Äî all the pieces can be mixed and matched in tons of different ways, even across completely separate apps.</p>
<p>We think it's important for Bluesky to lay the groundwork for a great experience in the app, which is why our moderation service is the default for all Bluesky app users. But we also believe in giving users the freedom to choose and the right to leave. So if Bluesky's moderation doesn‚Äôt meet your needs and you want an altogether different experience, you can make that happen. You'll need to build or use a different client app with your own moderation service, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up. However, all content shown in the Bluesky app must adhere to Bluesky‚Äôs community guidelines.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong><em>Where can I find the open-sourced Ozone tool?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can find the GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why are you open-sourcing Ozone?</em></strong></p>
<p>By making Ozone open-source and providing it as a ready-to-use tool for independent moderators on the AT Protocol, we're creating a system that encourages collaboration and transparency. Unlike most social media companies that develop their safety tools in private, Ozone's development will be out in the open. This means that new social apps built on the AT Protocol can benefit from all the improvements made by Bluesky and other organizations. By working together and sharing knowledge, we can create better tools faster and build a social media ecosystem that works for everyone.</p>
<p><strong><em>How is this different from community moderation on Mastodon?</em></strong></p>
<p>Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. Our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">post on federation</a> goes into more detail on how Bluesky differs from Mastodon.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I need to do to moderate my own community on Bluesky?</em></strong></p>
<p>All users of Bluesky‚Äôs client app are subscribed by default to Bluesky‚Äôs moderation. If you would like to run a moderation service that layers on top of these defaults, you can create a new account for that new service and get it up and running with Ozone.</p>
<p>However, if you want to opt out of our defaults, this is still possible ‚Äî we believe it‚Äôs important to give users the right to leave and not lock you in. You would need to use or develop a separate client app that connects to the AT Protocol, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up.</p>
<p><strong><em>How will running a moderation service be sustainable?</em></strong></p>
<p>Moderation services, much like feed generators, will likely start off as community-run projects. Just like the 40,000+ custom feeds on Bluesky, or the many Mastodon instances that exist, they may continue to operate as independent projects of individuals or organizations. However, there is also nothing stopping a moderation service from having paid subscribers.</p></div></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Happy 2024! Last year was a big year for our team: we joined Amazon in August,
and by November, we had already shipped
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/command-line-getting-started-installing.html">Amazon CodeWhisperer for command line</a>.</p><p>We‚Äôre keenly aware of the impact generative AI is having on the way developers
build. We‚Äôre hard at work innovating and we have a lot of exciting new things
coming to CodeWhisperer for command line later this year. With that said, we
have decided to fully focus our efforts on these new features, and given that,
we will be sunsetting Fig on September 1, 2024.</p><p>We will continue supporting Fig until September 1. Until then, we encourage
users to migrate over to
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/command-line-getting-started-installing.html">CodeWhisperer for command line</a>.
To make this transition as easy as possible, users can upgrade to CodeWhisperer
for command line directly from the Fig dashboard (more below).</p><h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-fig-and-codewhisperer-for-the-command-line"><a href="#whats-the-difference-between-fig-and-codewhisperer-for-the-command-line">What‚Äôs the difference between Fig and CodeWhisperer for the command line?</a></h3><p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/command-line-getting-started-installing.html">CodeWhisperer for command line</a>
offers Fig‚Äôs core features including 1) IDE-style completions for 500+ CLIs
and 2) natural language-to-bash translation. It‚Äôs free on the Individual tier
and is designed to be faster and more reliable than Fig. We have several
exciting new CodeWhisperer for command line features coming in 2024 including
support for Linux, AI chat, inline AI completions, autocomplete in SSH, and
private autocomplete.</p><p>CodeWhisperer for command line does not include features similar to Fig Scripts,
Dotfiles, Plugins, or Servers and we do not plan to support these features any
time soon.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-migrate"><a href="#how-do-i-migrate">How do I migrate?</a></h3><p>The Fig Dashboard UI will handle the migration for you ‚Äî it takes just a few
minutes. The migration process exports your data to your local device, installs
CodeWhisperer for command line, transfers your settings, then uninstalls Fig.
Once the CodeWhisperer app is installed, you will be prompted to grant macOS
accessibility permissions and then login or sign up.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You will need to be on v2.18 to see the new Fig Dashboard UI.</p><h3 id="what-happens-to-my-data"><a href="#what-happens-to-my-data">What happens to my data?</a></h3><p>Fig will delete all user data on September 1. Users can export their data to
their local device any time before then by running <code>fig export</code>. The Fig to
CodeWhisperer migration flow will automatically do this for users.</p><h3 id="can-i-use-fig-and-codewhisperer-for-command-line-together"><a href="#can-i-use-fig-and-codewhisperer-for-command-line-together">Can I use Fig and CodeWhisperer for command line together?</a></h3><p>Yes! Before Fig is sunset you can use Fig and CodeWhisperer at the same time.
When both tools are installed, Fig‚Äôs Autocomplete feature will turn off in favor
of CodeWhisperer for command line. This means you can keep using Fig for
Scripts, Dotfiles, Plugins, and Servers until September 1st but start using
CodeWhisperer for command line for its more reliable CLI completions and AI
straight away.</p><p>If you have any questions about the migration, please just create a discussion
in our
<a href="https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;projects=&amp;template=1_general_question.md">public community</a>.</p><h3 id="thank-you"><a href="#thank-you">Thank you</a></h3><p>To all Fig‚Äôs users, customers, and contributors, we are incredibly grateful for
your feedback, contributions, and support over the years. We are thrilled to
have made such an impact and we are beyond excited to continue working with you
all while we continue to ship!</p><p>Brendan, Matt, and the Amazon CodeWhisperer for command line team.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">How much is a Mandelbrot set image affected by the floating point precision of the code used to compute it?</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The points in a region of a Mandelbrot set image have <em>sensitive dependence upon initial conditions.</em>  (This property is the "chaos" in "chaos theory.")  A small deviation in the value of C in Z=Z^2+C can lead to a very different outcome for one point versus another point that is only a miniscule distance from it.  This fact remains true at all scales of magnification, i.e., "miniscule" can be arbitrarily small.</li>
<li>Floating point math cannot perfectly represent many rational numbers.  Moreover, floating point math can generate inaccuracies that can snowball with repeated calculations, including repeated operations of multiplication and addition.  Repeated multiplication and addition are the core of the Mandelbrot set algorithm.</li>
<li>Since the Mandelbrot set is always generated on a computer, typically using floating point math of some precision or other, we ask: How much of a Mandelbrot set image's visual complexity is due to the mathematical properties of the algorithm, and how much is due to floating point inaccuracies in its computer calculation?  Could some of the familiar visual properties of the Mandelbrot set simply be "noise" introduced by floating point calculations that have iterated thousands or even millions of times?</li>

<p dir="auto">A 2013 academic paper, <a href="https://mathr.co.uk/blog/2018-08-20_trustworthy_fractals.html" rel="nofollow">"Images of Julia Sets That You Can Trust" </a>, by L. H. de Figueiredo, D.

<p dir="auto">I wrote easy-to-modify c++ code that simply uses <code>typedef</code> to allow the user to explore the Mandelbrot set and to compare how the Mandelbrot set image looks when generated using the <em>same parameters</em> on the <em>same points</em>, but using three different floating-point implementations to calculate the result.  In addition to standard <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> types, the <code>Boost::Multiprecision</code> <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/floats/cpp_bin_float.html" rel="nofollow">cpp_bin_float</a> class was used to implement extended-precision floating-point types of the user's choice.</p>
<p dir="auto">The program is multi-threaded so it generates the desired Mandelbrot set image in all three float types simultaneously.  Keys <code>&lt;1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;3&gt;</code> display the image as generated by the three different types of floating point precision that the user has selected.  Keys <code>&lt;4&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;5&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;6&gt;</code> <em>subtract pairs of images</em> to highlight any pixels that are different:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>Key &lt;4&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 1 from 2</li>
<li><code>Key &lt;5&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 1 from 3</li>
<li><code>Key &lt;6&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 2 from 3</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Green pixels indicate a positive value following the subtraction, red pixels a negative value.
Basic statistics of the comparison are given in console output, such as the total number of pixels that are different, the percentage of the total image that is different, and the greatest difference between the values of the pixels (which tends to be close to the max iterations that one has selected for the Mandelbrot algorithm).  The console output also prints basic information about the three types one has chosen at start-up, such as digits of precision.</p>

<p dir="auto">Here are some sample images from a zoom in the neighborhood of C = -0.104943 + 0.927572i. Magnification is approximately 33E+6. The distance between adjacent pixels is 1/(2^33).  Max iterations is 30K.  Here's the image generated with standard <code>double</code> (53 bits of precision):</p>

<p dir="auto">Here is the same image generated with <code>cpp_bin_float_quad</code> (113 bits of precision).  Superficially it looks largely the same:</p>

<p dir="auto">But upon subtraction, we find that 8.77% ofthe pixels are different!  92,007 out of 1,048,576 pixels have different values.  These differences include points estimated to be in the Mandelbrot Set in one image and not in the other, as well as points which exceeded the orbit boundary check (i.e., the magnitude of Z &gt; 2) in both images but at different iterations.  Here's what we get when we subtract the Quad image from the Double precision image and color-code the difference:</p>

<p dir="auto">The three floating point types are <code>typedef</code>ed as <code>first_float</code>, <code>second_float</code> and <code>third_float</code> throughout the code.  Variable names also have these names as suffixes.  Yes, templated code would be more elegant than coding everything in triplicate!  I began with templated code, but finding the proper arguments to pass to <code>std::asynch</code> for templated overloaded functions proved too hard.</p>
<p dir="auto">Places to customize your settings are preceded by the comment tag <code>// OPTION</code>, for which string you can search.  The basic options are below.  The first setting is the most important: selecting your floating point types.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Set your types</h3><a id="user-content-set-your-types" aria-label="Permalink: Set your types" href="#set-your-types"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Alter these three lines in the code to choose your own floating point implementations and <em>voila!</em> You are all set to go.  It will be helpful to order your types from the least precise for <code>first_float</code> to the most precise for <code>third_float</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="typedef double first_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_quad second_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_oct third_float;"><pre><code>typedef double first_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_quad second_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_oct third_float;
</code></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">Depending on how many cores you have you may wish to change <code>unsigned int numThreads;</code> This setting creates <code>numThreads</code> <em>for each of the three floating point types</em>.  So <code>unsigned int numThreads=4;</code> will start 12 threads initially.  Built-in types (like <code>float</code>, <code>double,</code> <code>long double</code>) go much faster on most platforms because of intrinsic processor support.  So threads dedicated to those types will finish far sooner than those using  <code>Boost::multiprecision</code>'s <code>cpp_bin_float</code> types.  Software-emulated floating-point support is always slower.  That's why they invented FPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each thread calculates a batch of pixels at a time.  You can tweak the amount per batch here:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="unsigned int batchSize_first_float=10240;
unsigned int batchSize_second_float=2048;
unsigned int batchSize_third_float=512;"><pre><code>unsigned int batchSize_first_float=10240;
unsigned int batchSize_second_float=2048;
unsigned int batchSize_third_float=512;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Choosing a built-in type like <code>double</code> for the <code>first_float</code> type, and asigning it a large number of pixels per batch (like 10K above), can be useful to display an image quickly on screen 1 to help perfect your center and zoom.</p>

<p dir="auto">Every pixel on the screen has X and Y coordinates (ranging 0-1023) which correspond to some point on the complex plane and constitute the value of C in the formula Z=Z^2+C.  Presuming that your floating point types range from least precise (for <code>first_float</code>) to most precise, as you zoom deeper, the calculation of C will begin to be affected by the precision of your floating point types, beginning with <code>first_float</code> losing precision in its last decimal places.  You can choose whether to start iterating with a value for C that is calculated separately for each type, in its own precision, which may lead to slightly different values for C.  Or you can start iterating with the exact same value for C for all types by simply casting the value for C in <code>first_float</code> into the higher-precision types.  The latter approach can highlight differences in value due solely to floating-point inaccuracy accumulated through iteration.</p>

<p><strong>Irvine, Calif., March 12, 2024</strong> <strong>‚Äî </strong>Scientists know relatively little about particles released into the air when a vehicle driver brakes, though evidence suggests those particles may be more harmful to health than particles exiting the tailpipe.</p>



<p>In a new study in <em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313897121">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a></em>, University of California, Irvine researchers show how most of these particles emitted during light braking carry an electric charge ‚Äì something that could potentially be exploited to help reduce air pollution from vehicles.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe found that up to 80% of aerosol particles emitted from braking are electrically charged, and that many of them are in fact highly charged,‚Äù saidAdam Thomas, a doctoral candidate in the lab of Jim Smith, professor of chemistry, who led the study alongside UCI postdoctoral researcher Paulus Bauer.</p>



<p>To do the work, the team used a large lathe to spin a detached brake rotor and caliper. They then measured the electric charge of the aerosols emitted into the air and discovered the 80 percent figure.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI was very surprised,‚Äù said Smith. ‚ÄúWe were also surprised that this has not really been studied given how common cars are in human societies.‚Äù</p>



<p>The research is part of a broader team effort at UCI to understand the public health impacts of non-tailpipe emissions in areas beset by car traffic, including many areas in Southern California.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe toxicity and health effects of brake wear particles are largely unknown,‚Äù said Manabu Shiraiwa, professor of aerosol chemistry at UCI and one of the researchers behind the university-wide project. ‚ÄúRecent results from my lab indicate that they may induce oxidative stress, but more research is needed.‚Äù</p>



<p>The new study reveals a problem that may grow as electric cars become more and more common over the next several decades. Electric cars, Smith explained, are not truly zero-emission vehicles, so municipalities need to think about strategies to reduce emissions from brake use as well as tailpipes.</p>



<p>The team found that the percentage of charged particles emitted largely depended on the material makeup of brake pads. Because the particles carry an electric charge, this should make it relatively easy to remove from the air.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIf they are charged, they can be removed easily from the air before they have a chance to have an impact at all on health,‚Äù said Smith. ‚ÄúAll you would need to do is to collect them with an electrostatic precipitator ‚Äì a device that exposes the charged particles to an electric field and efficiently sweeps them away.‚Äù</p>



<p>The public health risk posed by brake emissions is not borne equally by a population ‚Äì lower-income parts of cities tend to be more traffic-heavy than others, which creates an environmental justice issue wherein certain socioeconomic classes are more exposed to brake emissions than others.</p>



<p>According to Professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts, Distinguished Emeritus Professor of chemistry and the principal investigator of the project at UCI, emissions from braking are not well-characterized but are potentially significant in high-traffic areas. ‚ÄúThese areas are often in poorer communities and highlight an important aspect of environmental justice that has been largely overlooked,‚Äù Finlayson-Pitts said.</p>



<p>The UCI team is working with local community organizations like the Madison Park Neighborhood Association in Santa Ana, which is helping disseminate UCI‚Äôs scientific findings to the public. Funding for the study came from fees paid by Volkswagen as part of a 2016 settlement reached with the California Department of Justice, which found that the company used devices that contributed to increased air pollution.</p>

   <p>Police in Charleston, S.C., are investigating the death of John Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager who became a whistleblower when he went public with his concerns about serious safety issues in the company's commercial airplanes.</p>   <p>Barnett's body was found in a vehicle in a Holiday Inn parking lot in Charleston on Saturday, police said. One day earlier, he testified about the string of problems he says he identified at Boeing's plant where he once helped inspect the 787 aircraft before delivery to customers.</p>

   <p>Police said officers were sent to the hotel to conduct a welfare check after people were unable to contact Barnett, who had traveled to Charleston to testify in his lawsuit against Boeing. </p>   <p>"Upon their arrival, officers discovered a male inside a vehicle suffering from a gunshot wound to the head," police said in a statement sent to NPR. "He was pronounced deceased at the scene."</p>   <p>The office of Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal said that Barnett, who had been living in Louisiana after retiring from Boeing, died "from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound." </p>   <p>Charleston police said detectives are actively investigating the case and are awaiting a formal cause of death as they try to determine the circumstances surrounding Barnett's death.</p>   <p>Barnett, who spent decades working for Boeing at its plants in Everett, Wash., and North Charleston, S.C., had repeatedly alleged that Boeing's manufacturing practices had declined ‚Äî and that rather than improve them, he added, managers had pressured workers not to document potential defects and problems. </p>   <p>"We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends," Boeing said in a statement sent to NPR.</p>   <p>Barnett, 62, made international headlines in April of 2019 when he and other former Boeing employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/business/boeing-dreamliner-production-problems.html">spoke to The New York Times</a> about what he called shoddy manufacturing problems at Boeing. Barnett accused the company of adopting a culture that prioritized raw numbers and profits over quality ‚Äî and by extension, passenger safety. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238040572" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public," Barnett told the newspaper. "And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy."</p>   <p>By the time the article appeared, Barnett had already filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing, saying that his attempts to raise quality and safety problems had been ignored and that he was punished for continuing to flag them.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238041466" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing in early 2017; his case against the company was heading toward a trial this June, his family said. </p>   <p>"He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture," the family said in a statement shared with NPR by his brother, Rodney Barnett.</p>   <p>The family says Barnett's health declined because of the stresses of taking a stand against his longtime employer.</p>   <p>"He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing," they said, "which we believe led to his death."</p>   
   <p>When John Barnett was interviewed by Ralph Nader <a href="https://www.ralphnaderradiohour.com/p/boeing-787-dreamliner-hundreds-of-fdf#details">in 2019</a>, he said health issues had persisted after he retired from the plane-maker.</p>   <p>"It's taken a serious mental and emotional toll on me," Barnett said ‚Äî but, he added, the safety of the airplanes rolling off the production line remained his main focus. </p>   <p>"That's what my story is about, is telling my story enough to where the right people get involved to make sure that these airplanes are made correctly," Barnett said. "Because the 787 carries 288 passengers plus crew. So the last thing I want to do is wake up in the morning and see a 787 has gone down" because of one of the problems he identified.  </p>   <p>"I mean, it's just, it keeps me up at night," he said.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi everyone! We're building an AI-enabled editor (<a href="https://glide.agenticlabs.com/">https://glide.agenticlabs.com</a>) that helps developers write technical design docs faster. It‚Äôs like an IDE with Copilot, but instead of directly editing your code, it helps you come up with a solid plan before implementing a change. There‚Äôs a basic demo here (<a href="https://youtu.be/5uEapdT6nYE" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/5uEapdT6nYE</a>), and we also recorded a session with one of our early users running through an unusual task (calling a Fortran algorithm from Go, <a href="https://youtu.be/ppluB0Z1OIA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/ppluB0Z1OIA</a>)</p><p>Why use design docs? Mainly because on complex software projects, if you don‚Äôt have a careful strategy, a few lines of code can lead to a ripple effect across the whole codebase. You're working on a small new feature and suddenly, your PR is touching dozens of different files in a handful of directories, and you may be questioning if it still makes sense at all.</p><p>Laying out your approach in a technical design document helps to avoid these situations, so tech companies often embed this practice in their engineering culture. Unfortunately, producing these write-ups is a manual and time-consuming process that keeps you switching between typing in Confluence, searching on GitHub, and drawing on a whiteboard.</p><p>For example, one of our early users is building a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system in Rust, and needs to rewrite their original chunking algorithm that was created in Python. A change like that involves not only porting the chunking logic but also defining new structs, choosing the Rust libraries for text parsing, re-integrating with the Rust server, and changing the endpoint on the front end. Simple-sounding changes like these can end up with many "tentacles" devs have to work through. Our product helps teams like this spec out their approach more quickly.</p><p>The need for this hit us when we were working on a product using LLMs to turn tickets into PRs. You can just assign a ticket to GPT-4 and review the PR, right? Turns out that most people (including us) don‚Äôt write very complete or specific tickets on the first pass, and when they do, that ends up being more effort than just doing the whole thing yourself.</p><p>What was missing was a fast way to iterate on goals, requirements, and implementation plans for code that could then be useful to developers (whether AI assisted or not) to implement with high confidence. Our editor, Glide, splits this process into the following stages and lets you spend as much or as little time on each stage as makes sense.</p><p>(1) We index your project code with Tree-Sitter and make it searchable, so you can add relevant parts of the codebase to the task context.</p><p>(2) AI writes the first pass for a high-level solution outline given the code and the goal. It will try to point out missing details or ambiguities about the task so far.</p><p>(3) As a developer you can easily edit the generated content‚Äîtweaks like ‚Äúchange step 3‚Äù or ‚Äúremove the part about caching‚Äù don‚Äôt require additional back-and-forth conversation.</p><p>(4) The next stage is a step-by-step plan‚Äîa pseudocode-level guide for how to complete the change. AI generates this, and again you can make adjustments in-line as needed.</p><p>(5) There is a chat mode for deeper discussions about the content‚Äîjust highlight any text and click chat. This works well for exploring alternatives, getting more specific on a particular point, or understanding why the AI wrote what it did.</p><p>(6) Once the plan looks good, you can have AI generate code edits for each step. You‚Äôre free to make additional changes here or just open the markdown doc with code edits in your local VSCode via an extension, so you have it as a reference while you implement.</p><p>This looks a lot like collaborative Chain of Thought, explicitly writing out each step in a line of reasoning, for both the developer and the LLM. Breaking down a high-level task with AI this way can work well for building consensus on the desired end state of your change.</p><p>We plan to charge companies per seat, but today, it‚Äôs free for individual use as we get more feedback on the product. One future area we‚Äôre excited for is multiplayer mode‚Äîwhere a few developers can share, edit, and leave comments on the generated docs in a shared workspace. If you have ideas for this experience, we‚Äôd love to hear them.</p><p>We would love for you to give it a try at <a href="https://glide.agenticlabs.com/">https://glide.agenticlabs.com/</a> and tell us what you think! We‚Äôre excited to discuss this with any comments you have!</p><p>P.S. We only keep the indexed code in an in-memory cache while you‚Äôre using it. We don‚Äôt store your code or use it as training data!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<h2 id="why-swift">Why Swift?</h2>

<p>Swift is widely known as the modern language for app development on Apple devices. However, over the course of its first decade, it has grown into a versatile, multi-platform language targeting use cases where you‚Äôd otherwise find C or C++.</p>

<p>Personally, I have come to appreciate Swift‚Äôs emphasis on memory safety and great ergonomics, and want these traits for embedded systems where reliability and security are critically important.</p>

<p>But embedded systems are not only found in mission-critical applications. Some are actually all fun and <em>games</em>.</p>

<h3 id="playdate-by-panic">Playdate by Panic</h3>

<p>Over the holiday season, I read about building Playdate games in C and became curious if the same was possible in Swift. For those unfamiliar with Playdate, it is a tiny handheld game system built by Panic, creators of popular apps and games like ‚ÄúTransmit,‚Äù ‚ÄúNova,‚Äù ‚ÄúFirewatch,‚Äù ‚ÄúUntitled Goose Game,‚Äù and more. It houses a Cortex M7 processor, a 400 by 240 1-bit display, and has a small runtime for hosting games. Additionally, Panic provides an <a href="https://play.date/dev/">SDK</a> for building games in both C and Lua.</p>

<p>While most Playdate games are written in Lua for ease of development, they can run into performance problems that necessitate the added complexity of using C. Swift‚Äôs combination of high-level ergonomics with low-level performance, as well as its strong support for interoperating with C, make it seem like a good match for the Playdate. However, the typical Swift application and runtime exceed the device‚Äôs tight resource constraints.</p>

<p>Regardless, I still wanted to create a game in Swift and I had good idea for the approach.</p>

<h3 id="the-embedded-language-mode">The Embedded Language Mode</h3>

<p>Recently, the Swift project began developing a new embedded language mode to support highly constrained platforms. This mode utilizes generic specialization, inlining, and dead code stripping to produce tiny binaries, while retaining the core features of Swift.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The embedded language mode is actively evolving and is helping drive the development of language features such as: <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0390-noncopyable-structs-and-enums.md">non-copyable types</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0413-typed-throws.md">typed throws</a>, etc. It is available now in <a href="https://www.swift.org/download/">nightly toolchains</a> and if you‚Äôre curious to learn more, check out the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/embedded-swift.md">Vision for Embedded Swift</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These defining characteristics make the embedded language mode a great solution for shrinking Swift to fit the Playdate‚Äôs constraints.</p>

<p>With the embedded Swift language mode in hand, I got to work.</p>

<h2 id="the-games">The Games</h2>

<p>I wrote two small games in Swift for the Playdate. The first game is a port of the Playdate SDK sample of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway‚Äôs Game of Life</a> into Swift:</p>

<p>This game is one Swift file that builds directly against the Playdate C API and does not require dynamic memory allocation. The packaged game clocks in at 788 bytes, slightly smaller than the C example, which is 904 bytes.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-c</span> &lt; <span>$REPO_ROOT</span>/Examples/Life/Life.pdx/pdex.bin

<span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-c</span> &lt; <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/Examples/GameOfLife.pdx/pdex.bin
     904
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Both versions could likely be made smaller, but I did not try to optimize code size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second game is a paddle-and-ball style game named ‚ÄúSwift Break.‚Äù</p>

<p><img src="https://www.swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/playdate-simulator-still-swiftbreak.png" alt="A screenshot of the Playdate Simulator with the Swift Break splash screen."></p>

<p>Swift Break uses the same high-level language features you‚Äôd find in desktop and server applications, such as <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/enumerations/#Associated-Values">enums with associated values</a>, <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/generics">generic types and functions</a>, and <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/memorysafety">automatic memory management</a> to simplify game development while retaining C-level performance.</p>

<p>For example, here‚Äôs the core game logic for handling ball bounces:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>moveWithCollisions</span><span>(</span><span>goalX</span><span>:</span> <span>newX</span><span>,</span> <span>goalY</span><span>:</span> <span>newY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>in</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>collision</span> <span>in</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>otherSprite</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sprite</span><span>(</span><span>borrowing</span><span>:</span> <span>collision</span><span>.</span><span>other</span><span>)</span>

    <span>// If we hit a visible brick, remove it.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>brick</span><span>,</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>isVisible</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>removeSprite</span><span>()</span>
      <span>activeGame</span><span>.</span><span>bricksRemaining</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>normal</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vector</span><span>(</span><span>collision</span><span>.</span><span>normal</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>paddle</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// Compute deflection angle (radians) for the normal in domain</span>
      <span>// -pi/6 to pi/6.</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>placement</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span><span>(</span><span>of</span><span>:</span> <span>collision</span><span>,</span> <span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>)</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>pi</span> <span>/</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span>
      <span>normal</span><span>.</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>by</span><span>:</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>activeGame</span><span>.</span><span>ballVelocity</span><span>.</span><span>reflect</span><span>(</span><span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>normal</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It calls a <code>moveWithCollisions</code> method to move the ball, iterating through a collection of objects the ball bounced off of while moving.</p>

<p>Swift Break features a splash screen, a pause menu, paddle-location-based bounce physics, infinite levels, a game over screen, and allows you to control the paddle with either the D-Pad or the Crank!</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre eager to use Swift on your Playdate, the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-playdate-examples">swift-playdate-examples</a> repository has you covered. It contains the above ready-to-use examples that demonstrate how to build Swift games for the Playdate, both for the simulator and the hardware.</p>

<p>Additionally, the repository includes detailed documentation to guide you through the setup process. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or just starting, you‚Äôll find the necessary resources to bring your ideas to life.</p>

<p>But if you‚Äôre up for a deep dive into the technical details of what it takes to bring Swift to a new platform, read on!</p>

<h2 id="deep-dive-bringing-swift-to-the-playdate">Deep Dive: Bringing Swift to the Playdate</h2>

<p>Bringing up a new platform is always fraught with challenges and infuriating bugs. Everything is broken with numerous false starts, until you clear the last bug, and then it all comes together. Getting Swift games running on the Playdate was no different.</p>

<p>My general approach was to leverage Swift‚Äôs interoperability to build on top of the Playdate C SDK. The good news is that the Swift toolchain already had all the features I needed to get this working. I just had to figure out how to put them together. Here‚Äôs an overview of the path I took:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building object files for the Playdate Simulator</li>
  <li>Importing the Playdate C API</li>
  <li>Running on the Simulator</li>
  <li>Running on the Hardware</li>
  <li>Improving the API with Swift</li>
  <li>Completing Swift Break</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let‚Äôs get started.</p>

<h3 id="building-object-files-for-the-playdate-simulator">Building object files for the Playdate Simulator</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The commands mentioned below were run with a Swift nightly toolchain installed and have the <code>TOOLCHAINS</code> environment variable set to the name of the toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first step was compiling an object file for the Playdate Simulator. The simulator works by dynamically loading host libraries, so I needed to build the object files for the host‚Äôs platform and architecture (the so-called <em>triple</em> in compiler-speak), which <code>swiftc</code> does by default. The only additional flags I needed were for enabling embedded Swift and code optimizations.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>test.swift
<span>let </span>value <span>=</span> 1

<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

<span>$ </span>swiftc <span>-c</span> test.swift <span>-o</span> build/test.o <span>\</span>
    <span>-Osize</span> <span>-wmo</span> <span>-enable-experimental-feature</span> Embedded

<span>$ </span>file build/test.o
test.o: Mach-O 64-bit object arm64
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="importing-the-playdate-c-api">Importing the Playdate C API</h3>

<p>The next step was compiling against the Playdate C API from Swift. This was straightforward due to the structure of the Playdate C header files and Swift‚Äôs native support for interoperating with C.</p>

<p>I started by locating the Playdate C header files:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
Examples     buildsupport pd_api       pd_api.h

<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
pd_api_display.h     pd_api_gfx.h         pd_api_lua.h         pd_api_sound.h       pd_api_sys.h
pd_api_file.h        pd_api_json.h        pd_api_scoreboards.h pd_api_sprite.h
</code></pre></div>

<p>And used an ‚Äúinclude search path‚Äù (<code>-I</code>) to tell the Swift compiler‚Äôs C interoperability feature where to find them. I additionally needed to pass a ‚Äúdefine‚Äù (<code>-D</code>) to tell the compiler how to parse the header files:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-I</span> <span>-Xcc</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/ <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-DTARGET_EXTENSION</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, I created a <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#module-maps">module map file</a> to wrap the headers into an importable module from Swift:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/module.modulemap
module CPlaydate <span>[</span>system] <span>{</span>
  umbrella header <span>"pd_api.h"</span>
  <span>export</span> <span>*</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And used an ‚Äúimport search path‚Äù (<code>-I</code>) to tell the Swift compiler where to find the CPlaydate module:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-I</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lastly, I made a minimal ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù using the Playdate C API from Swift and compiled using the flags above:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>test.swift
import CPlaydate
<span>let </span>pd: UnsafePointer&lt;PlaydateAPI&gt;? <span>=</span> nil

<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

<span>$ </span>swiftc <span>\</span>
    <span>-c</span> test.swift <span>\</span>
    <span>-o</span> build/test.o <span>\</span>
    <span>-Osize</span> <span>-wmo</span> <span>-enable-experimental-feature</span> Embedded <span>\</span>
    <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-I</span> <span>-Xcc</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/ <span>\</span>
    <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-DTARGET_EXTENSION</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-I</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/

<span>$ </span>file build/test.o
test.o: Mach-O 64-bit object arm64
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="running-on-the-simulator">Running on the Simulator</h3>

<p>Once I was able to use the Playdate C API from Swift, I ported the Conway‚Äôs Game of Life example included in the Playdate SDK to Swift, referencing <a href="https://sdk.play.date/2.2.0/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html">Inside Playdate with C</a> frequently to familiarize myself with the API.</p>

<p>The C implementation of Conway‚Äôs strictly operates on Playdate OS-vended frame buffers and uses the display as game state, removing the need for separate data structures and dynamic allocations. As a result, the porting process was very mechanical because the bit manipulation and pointer operations in the C example have direct Swift analogs:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>int</span> <span>val</span><span>(</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>*</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>((</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>7</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>%</span><span>8</span><span>)))</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>int</span> <span>ison</span><span>(</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>*</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>!</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>0x80</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>%</span><span>8</span><span>)));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Row</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span> <span>UnsafeMutablePointer</span><span>&lt;</span><span>UInt8</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I built the source into a dynamic library and used <code>pdc</code> (the Playdate compiler) to wrap the final <code>dylib</code> into a <code>pdx</code> (Playdate executable).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc <span>\</span>
    <span>-emit-library</span> test.swift <span>\</span>
    <span>-o</span> build/pdex.dylib <span>\</span>
    ...

<span>$ </span>file build/pdex.dylib
pdex.dylib: Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64

<span>$ $HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/bin/pdc build Test

<span>$ </span><span>ls </span>Test.pdx
pdex.dylib pdxinfo
</code></pre></div>

<p>I opened my game file <code>Test.pdx</code> using the Playdate simulator and as you might expect, it worked on the first try ‚Ä¶ just kidding, it crashed!</p>

<p>After some debugging, I realized the <code>Makefile</code> used to compile the C example included an additional file <code>setup.c</code> from the SDK containing the symbol <code>_eventHandlerShim</code> needed to bootstrap the game. If this symbol is not present in the binary, the Simulator falls back to bootstrapping the game using the symbol <code>_eventHandler</code> which my binary did contain, but meant my game skipped an important setup step.</p>

<p>So, I compiled <code>setup.c</code> into an object file using <code>clang</code>, linked it into my dynamic library, re-ran, and voila! I had Conway‚Äôs Game of Life written in Swift running on the Playdate Simulator.</p>

<h3 id="running-on-the-hardware">Running on the Hardware</h3>

<p>After successfully running on the simulator, I wanted to run the game on real hardware. A colleague graciously allowed me to borrow their Playdate and I began hacking away.</p>

<p>I started by matching the triple used by the C examples for the device and seeing what happened.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-target</span> armv7em-none-none-eabi
&lt;module-includes&gt;:1:10: note: <span>in </span>file included from &lt;module-includes&gt;:1:
<span>#include "pd_api.h"</span>
         ^
<span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/pd_api.h:13:10: error: <span>'stdlib.h'</span> file not found
<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>
         ^
</code></pre></div>

<p>These errors did not previously occur because I was targeting the host machine and used the host headers for the C standard library. I considered using the same host headers for the target device, but didn‚Äôt want to debug platform incompatibilities. Little did I know, I would have to do this regardless.</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to follow the route used by the C example programs which leverage the libc headers from a <code>gcc</code> toolchain installed with the Playdate SDK. I copied the include paths used by the C examples and re-ran the compile.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

</code></pre></div>

<p>The compile succeeded and I had an object file for the real hardware. I went through similar steps to link and package the object file into a <code>pdx</code>, using <code>clang</code> as the linker driver.</p>

<p>I deployed the game onto a Playdate, and ‚Ä¶ it crashed.</p>

<p>For some reason, when the frame-update function pointer was called, the game would crash! Debugging this issue was confusing at first, but due to past experience deploying Swift onto a Cortex M7, I realized I likely had a calling convention mismatch. I added a compiler flag <code>-Xfrontend -experimental-platform-c-calling-convention=arm_aapcs_vfp</code> to try to match the calling convention used by the Playdate OS.</p>

<p>Once again, I deployed my game to the Playdate and ‚Ä¶ it actually worked! You can see the game in action below:</p>

<video title="A video of Conway's Game of Life running on Playdate hardware mirrored to a Mac." autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
  <source src="https://swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/playdate-mirror-video-life.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>I then integrated my manual compilation steps into the Makefiles found in the Playdate SDK, going through a number of options before landing on the final solution found in <code>swift-playdate-examples</code>. The result of this effort was a single <code>make</code> command to build a <code>pdx</code> compatible with both the simulator and hardware!</p>

<h3 id="improving-the-api-with-swift">Improving the API with Swift</h3>

<p>After porting Conway‚Äôs Game of Life, I began a more ambitious project: a paddle-and-ball style game named Swift Break. However, I quickly encountered friction using the raw Playdate C API directly in Swift. In typical programming fashion, I took a detour to work on the API‚Äôs ergonomics instead of the game! At this point, I had also piqued the interest of some colleagues who contributed further improvements.</p>

<p>One hurdle was the naming conventions of the imported API. In C, enum cases are often prefixed with their type‚Äôs name to prevent programmers from inadvertently mixing unrelated enum instances and case constants. However, in Swift, such prefixes are unnecessary as the compiler type-checks comparisons to ensure the correct cases are used.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Swift already provides tools for addressing this precise issue, known as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/APINotes.html">API notes</a>. I added an API notes file to the Playdate SDK and renamed enum cases with more idiomatic Swift names:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Before</span>
<span>if</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>kEventPause</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// After</span>
<span>if</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>pause</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A bigger issue, however, was the lack of nullability annotations in the C API. This meant the generated code had redundant null checks everywhere, bloating code size and hurting performance. While I usually would have used API notes to add the missing annotations, this was not possible. The C API uses structs with function pointers as a ‚Äúvtable‚Äù, and unfortunately, these are not currently modifiable with API notes. Due to this incompatibility, I had to adopt a suboptimal solution: pervasively using <code>Optional.unsafelyUnwrapped</code> throughout the Swift code.</p>

<p>Although this approach eliminated the null checks, it dramatically hurt readability:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// C API in Swift with redundant null checks</span>
<span>let</span> <span>spritePointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>playdate_api</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>newSprite</span><span>()</span>

<span>// C API in Swift without redundant null checks</span>
<span>let</span> <span>spritePointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>playdate_api</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>newSprite</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To address the readability issues, I created a thin Swift overlay on top of the C API. I wrapped function pointer accesses into static and instance methods on Swift types and converted function get/set pairs to Swift properties. Creating a sprite became much more intuitive and introduced zero overhead on top of the equivalent imported C calls.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>sprite</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sprite</span><span>(</span><span>bitmapPath</span><span>:</span> <span>"background.png"</span><span>)</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>collisionsEnabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>zIndex</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>addSprite</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Colleagues further improved the overlay by abstracting Playdate APIs requiring manual memory management to be automatically handled. An excellent example is the C API‚Äôs <a href="https://sdk.play.date/2.2.0/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html#f-sprite.moveWithCollisions"><code>moveWithCollisions</code></a> function, which returns a buffer of <code>SpriteCollisionInfo</code> structs that must be freed by the caller. Using the overlay allowed us to avoid manually deallocating the buffer and made the API easier to use:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// moveWithCollisions without the overlay</span>
<span>var</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>var</span> <span>actualX</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>var</span> <span>actualY</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

<p>These improvements dramatically streamlined writing code for the Playdate. Additionally, as Swift‚Äôs support for ownership and non-copyable types improves, I anticipate even more ergonomic representations of the C APIs without language overhead.</p>

<h3 id="completing-swift-break">Completing Swift Break</h3>

<p>Equipped with a refined Swift Playdate API, I returned to developing Swift Break.</p>

<p>I nailed down the basics pretty quickly, but couldn‚Äôt resist adding extra features just for the fun of it. One of the highlights was implementing basic logic to deflect ball bounces based on the location where the ball and paddle collide.</p>

<p>This feature required calculating a normal vector relative to a hypothetical curve representing a rounded paddle and then reflecting the ball‚Äôs velocity about the normal. Here‚Äôs a visualization of the intended behavior:</p>

<video title="A Desmos geometric animation of Swift Break ball bouncing logic." autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
  <source src="https://swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/desmos-ball-bounce.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Making the animation for this post ironically helped me root cause a bug in the bouncing logic. Under some combinations of entry angle and normal angle, the current design can cause the ball to bounce <em>down</em> into the paddle instead of up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To turn the math into an algorithm, I had to perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check if the object the ball collided with is the paddle</li>
  <li>Compute the location of the collision along the paddle from -1 to +1</li>
  <li>Map the location into a deflection angle from from -œÄ/6 to +œÄ/6</li>
  <li>Rotate the collision normal vector by the deflection angle</li>
  <li>Reflect the ball‚Äôs velocity along the rotated normal</li>
</ol>

<p>I then directly translated this algorithm into code inside the ball collision callback:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>paddle</span> <span>{</span>                                <span>// 1</span>

<h3 id="running-on-the-hardware-again">Running on the Hardware (Again!)</h3>

<p>Throughout the development of ‚ÄúSwift Break,‚Äù I regularly deployed the game to the Playdate Simulator. However, the real challenge emerged when I decided to run the game on actual Playdate hardware. As usual, I loaded the game, and ‚Ä¶ yet again, it crashed, but this time a lot of things were going wrong.</p>

<p>To cut a long debugging story short, I found that the <code>-Xfrontend</code> flag mentioned earlier did not entirely resolve the calling convention issues. To address this, I needed to configure the compiler to match the CPU and floating-point ABI of the microcontroller in the Playdate. This aspect was overlooked when I was porting Conway‚Äôs Game of Life since I happened to both not pass structs by value and didn‚Äôt use floating-point operations.</p>

<p>The final and most confusing crash arose from a specific Playdate C API call returning an enum from the Playdate OS. After a thorough debugging process, e.g. using <code>printf</code> everywhere, I uncovered a discrepancy in the memory layout of the enum between the system built with <code>gcc</code> and the game built with <code>swiftc</code>. With further research I found the difference stemmed from <code>gcc</code> defaulting to <code>-fshort-enums</code> while <code>swiftc</code> via <code>clang</code> used <code>-fno-short-enums</code> for the <code>armv7em-none-none-eabi</code> triple.</p>

<p>I collected these new and removed flags into the following compile command:</p>

<p>With these adjustments, I attempted once more, and <em>finally</em> ‚ÄúSwift Break‚Äù successfully ran on the Playdate hardware! I‚Äôve included a brief video showcasing the game below:</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Thanks for diving into the bring-up journey with me. From refining the Swift Playdate API to tackling issues involving calling conventions, CPU configurations, and memory layout disparities, there was no shortage of challenges.</p>

<p>However, with the issues now resolved, creating Playdate games in Swift is a streamlined process. Just run <code>make</code> and enjoy a development experience with Swift that is both expressive <em>and</em> performant.</p>

<p>You can find all the code examples mentioned in this post in the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-playdate-examples">swift-playdate-examples</a> repository with accompanying ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù documentation.</p>

<p>I hope this post encourages you to explore the possibilities of using Swift in unconventional environments. Feel free to reach out with your experiences, questions, or game ideas on the <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/byte-sized-swift-building-tiny-games-for-the-playdate/70615">Swift Forums</a>!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The NYPD sent a sweeping subpoena seeking information from the social media account of the president of a New York City police accountability organization in February, records reviewed by Hell Gate show, only to withdraw its subpoena when told they would need to justify the subpoena in court.</p><p>Michael Clancy, better known to friends on and off social media as <a href="https://twitter.com/minkoff_steven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rabbi</a>, received a notice last month from X, formerly known as Twitter, alerting him to the fact that the NYPD had sent X a subpoena requesting "all records consisting but not limited to all subscriber name(s), Email address(s), Phone number(s), account creation date, IP logs with timestamps (IP address of account logins and logouts), all logs of previous messages sent and received." The subpoena also requested "all videos sent and received, including but not limited to meta-data. exit data about the messages and videos‚Äù for the account.</p><p>The notification included a copy of the subpoena, which warned X not to tell Clancy of its existence. "You are not to disclose or notify any customer or third party of the existence of this subpoena or that records were provided pursuant to this subpoena," the document read.</p><p>But X, following its own corporate policy, told Clancy anyway, and suggested he might want to get some legal representation to fight the subpoena, recommending the American Civil Liberties Union. Clancy did just that, and Kathryn Sachs of the New York Civil Liberties Union took up his case. Last Wednesday, Sachs wrote to the NYPD to challenge the administrative subpoena, which the NYPD had sent on its own authority, without any warrant or judicial approval. If the NYPD did not withdraw the subpoena, Sachs told the NYPD, Clancy would go to court with a motion to quash it. Rather than go to court to explain to a judge why the subpoena was necessary, the NYPD wrote back the same afternoon to say that it was withdrawing the subpoena altogether.</p><p>The NYPD subpoena letter cited as its empowering authority <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-25019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Section 14-137 of the New York City Administrative Code</a>, which gives the NYPD commissioner the power to issue subpoenas. But as Sachs argued in her letter to the NYPD, that doesn't mean the police department can issue warrantless subpoenas for anything they feel like. Sachs cited case law suggesting that the subpoena power is actually restricted to investigations involving current or former officers.</p><p>Under the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stored Communications Act</a>, authorities who want to subpoena electronic records from a provider either need a court-issued warrant, or, if they're using an administrative subpoena, "prior notice from the governmental entity to the subscriber or customer."</p><p>"This kind of administrative subpoena is not overseen by any court, and is not meant to target people like our client," Sachs told Hell Gate. "If it's left unchecked, it would chill speech from potentially anyone that the NYPD decided to subpoena information about."</p><p>"We don't give that kind of power to police departments without judicial review," said Marty Stolar, a lawyer who has worked on similar cases in the past. "It's got to be a process that's connected to a court if you're going to apply it to the general population. Here, the NYPD is misusing the power of subpoena to compel the production of documents as if they had the right to demand that information from any citizen. And they don't have that right. We have never given it to them."&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A copy of the NYPD subpoena supplied by X.</figcaption></figure><p>The legal status of the NYPD's use of warrantless subpoenas for social media information isn't as clear as it might be, in part because when the NYPD's use of such subpoenas is challenged, it tends to withdraw the subpoenas rather than engage in a court process that might definitively establish the legality or illegality of its practice.</p><p>In 2020, the department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/nyregion/patriot-act-subpoena-nypd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a nearly identical subpoena</a> to Twitter, seeking a broad swath of records for Tina Moore, a New York Post reporter covering the NYPD. When lawyers for the Post threatened to challenge the subpoena in court, the NYPD hastily withdrew it. The incident provoked significant backlash, with free speech advocates, the Post, and groups like the Media Law Resource Center decrying the chilling effect of the subpoena.</p><p>Clancy isn't working as a conventional journalist, but he is involved in the collection and dissemination of information about the NYPD. As president of the Brooklyn chapter of Copwatch Patrol Unit, Clancy receives tips about police conduct, and films police conduct himself. While the withdrawal of the subpoena makes it all but impossible to know what the NYPD's goal was in issuing it, he has his theories. Maybe the police are just trying to rattle him with a shot across the bow. Or maybe the NYPD is trying to find out whether NYPD officers themselves are feeding his organization information about misconduct. "That happens," Clancy told Hell Gate. "For a junior officer who sees misconduct by his superiors, if you take that to Internal Affairs, maybe your boss has a connection there and it winds up being you who gets in trouble. So some cops prefer to take it to Copwatch."</p><p>As a further wrinkle, the NYPD's subpoena letter to X was sent by Michael Yanni, a member of the office of the department's deputy commissioner for legal matters, but used the email address <a href="mailto:intelsubpoenas@nynjhidta.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intelsubpoenas@nynjhidta.org</a>, a domain affiliated with the <a href="https://www.hidtaprogram.org/ny_nj.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York and New Jersey High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area</a> office, a regional and federal joint drug task force. Similarly, the letter from the NYPD notifying NYCLU of the withdrawal of the subpoena was sent from Mallory McGee, an attorney with the NYPD Legal Bureau, using another email attached to the drug task force.</p><p>Why are NYPD lawyers sending out subpoenas for a critic's private information without a warrant? Why are they using federal task force email domains to do it? Why did they withdraw the subpoena rather than defend its legitimacy in court? How many of these warrantless subpoenas have they sent out in the last year? We asked the NYPD these questions, but did not receive a response.</p><p>Clancy, for his part,<strong> </strong>said that he's undaunted, and that the NYPD has no business rummaging through his social media content and metadata.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why would you use a shower curtain and close the bathroom door when you take a shower, if you have nothing to hide?" he asked. "Because it's none of your business, that's why. What the police might want to know and what they have a legal right to know are two different things."</p></div></div>]]></description>
