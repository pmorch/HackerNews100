<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			
<p>Thanks to Samantha Cole at 404 Media, we are now aware that <a href="https://www.404media.co/tumblr-and-wordpress-to-sell-users-data-to-train-ai-tools/">Automattic plans to sell user data from Tumblr and WordPress.com</a> (which is the host for my blog) for “AI” products.</p>



<p>In response to journalists probing this shady decision from Automattic leadership, the company said nothing but published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228025838/https://automattic.com/2024/02/27/protecting-user-choice/">a statement</a>.</p>



<p>This statement, which was presumably filtered through more lawyers than their CEO’s <a href="https://twitter.com/kthorjensen/status/1761599420330823935">recent Twitter rambling against trans users</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228022939/https://staff.tumblr.com/post/743224389484625920/a-message-from-a-few-of-the-trans-staff-at-tumblr">Automattic employees’ statement about his conduct</a> for that matter), betrays a critical misunderstanding of what consent is.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are also working directly with select AI companies as long as their plans align with what our community cares about: attribution, <strong><u>opt-outs,</u></strong> and control.</p>
<cite>Emphasis mine</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is not the tech industry’s most egregious lack of understanding of consent in recent years. That dishonor belongs to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/paqvn7/dont-fuck-anybody-who-wants-to-get-your-consent-uploaded-to-the-blockchain-legalfling-app">LegalFling</a>: A blockchain app for sexual consent.</p>



<p>However, this is still pretty stupid, and the result of an insidious trend that doesn’t get questioned enough in software engineering circles. So I’m asking that my readers shout this from the fucking rooftops.</p>



<h2>Opt-Out Is NOT Consent</h2>



<p>Opt-out is “our lawyers told us to make this an option to cover our ass, but we don’t want you to actually do it”.</p>



<p>Opt-out is “if you missed the memo, we assume we have your consent”.</p>



<p>The default state of any decision regarding user data should be opted out. Users should instead be required to opt in for your decision to take effect, and they must not be coerced into doing so.</p>



<p>If consent is not explicitly given by an informed user, you haven’t received consent at all, and to pretend otherwise is unethical.</p>



<p>Your users don’t fucking care about opt-out. We care about opt-in.</p>



<h3>“But Soatok, That’ll Hurt Our Revenue”</h3>



<p>If you <em>have to</em> make money doing unethical things, or by following dubious practices that don’t actually respect other users’ autonomy, then you should go out of business.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AaU6tI2pb3M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>End of.</p>



<h2>What Automattic Should Do</h2>



<p>If Automattic wants to make things right, they must do two things and could do a third thing (but I’m not holding my breath):</p>



<p>First, nuke the existing opt-out mechanism and replace it with an opt-in mechanism. If nobody checks it, then don’t include their data in the sale to Midjourney or OpenAI.</p>



<p>Second, they should make the permission for third-parties more granular. Some of us don’t care about third parties, but do NOT want “AI” companies using their data to enable plagiarism.</p>



<p>Third, if you want to go the extra mile, add support for a plugin that uses <a href="https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html">Nightshade</a> on all hosted media in all WordPress.com plans, including free plans, to increase your users’ protection against LLM scrapists.</p>



<p>This is my open challenge to Automattic leadership to do better.</p>



<h2>This Issue is Bigger than Automattic</h2>



<p>The tech industry has gotten very bad at respecting users’ consent lately. Your options are no longer “Yes” and “No” anymore. Instead it’s “Yes” or “Maybe Later”, without a “Never” option.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This entire goddamn thread.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>It does keep going. I’m going to skip a few, but check it out.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Yes, even Linux is affected.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, you can rarely uninstall the crapware that nags you with these consent dialogs.</p>



<p>This needs to stop. It’s a toxic mentality and it cultivates a culture that doesn’t respect humanity. (Which is kind of funny to write as a furry blogger.)</p>



<p>If you work in the tech industry, scream very loudly about properly implementing human-respecting consent controls into your software.</p>



<p>Just because it’s widespread doesn’t mean it’s inevitable. Push back against it. Your less privileged, less technical neighbors deserve better.</p>

<div id="article-body">
<div><p>We've already covered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-new-roadmap-at-ifs-direct-connect-2024-new-14a-node-clearwater-forest-taped-in-five-nodes-in-four-years-remains-on-track" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-new-roadmap-at-ifs-direct-connect-2024-new-14a-node-clearwater-forest-taped-in-five-nodes-in-four-years-remains-on-track">first major announcements from the Intel Foundry Direct Connect</a> event, but it turns out that Intel miscommunicated about a presentation that was thought to be under NDA — now Intel says the presentation is open to be reported to the public, so we have some more news to share: Intel's previously-unannounced Intel 10A (analogous to 1nm) will enter production/development in late 2027, marking the arrival of the company's first 1nm node, and its 14A (1.4nm) node will enter production in 2026. The company is also working to create fully autonomous AI-powered fabs in the future.</p><p>

Intel's Keyvan Esfarjani, the company's EVP and GM and Foundry Manufacturing and Supply, held a very insightful session that covered the company's latest developments and showed how the roadmap unfolds over the coming years.&nbsp;</p></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-3GSuLiJaMcFZDW6QXVDVcZ-1"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Intel"></p></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Here, we can see two charts, with the first outlining the company's K-WSPW (thousands of wafer starts per week) capacity for Intel's various process nodes. Notably, capacity typically indicates how many wafers can be started, but not the total output — output varies based on yields. You'll notice there isn't a label for the Y-axis, which would give us a direct read on Intel's production volumes. However, this does give us a solid idea of the proportionality of Intel's planned node production over the next several years.</p><p>

Intel did not specify the arrival date of its coming 14A node in its previous announcements, but here, the company indicates it will begin production of the Intel 14A node in 2026.</p><p>

Even more importantly, Intel will begin production/development of its as-yet-unannounced 10A node in late 2027, filling out its roster of nodes produced with EUV technology. Intel's 'A' suffix in its node naming convention represents Angstroms, and 10 Angstroms converts to 1nm, meaning this is the company's first 1nm-class node.&nbsp;</p><p>

Intel hasn't shared any details about the 10A/1nm node but has told us that it classifies a new node as at least having a double-digit power/performance improvement. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has told us the cutoff for a new node is around a 14% to 15% improvement, so we can expect that 10A will have at least that level of improvement over the 14A node. (For example, the difference between Intel 7 and Intel 4 was a 15% improvement.)</p></div><p>Capacity for the Intel 4 and Intel 3 processes doesn't build as quickly as 20A/18A, but that isn't surprising — the majority of the company's wins for its third-party foundry business have been with the 18A node, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us">Intel says is according to plan</a>. As shown, Intel will also steadily draw down its overall production of its 14nm, 10nm, Intel 7, and 12nm nodes as it transitions to the EUV-enabled nodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Intel's slide has a footnote that says, "*roadmap: Final Scale, Pace and Processes dependent on business conditions and incentives," mirroring the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intels-ohio-fabs-could-slip-to-late-2026-report" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intels-ohio-fabs-could-slip-to-late-2026-report">ongoing statements that funding from the CHIPS Act will impact its ability to scale production</a>.</p><p>Intel's 18A and 20A nodes have been in at least some form of production since 2023, which isn't too surprising — the company won a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-foundry-services-wins-us-defense-contract-for-chips-with-18a-node" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-foundry-services-wins-us-defense-contract-for-chips-with-18a-node">RAMP-C contract for 18A with the US government</a> back in 2021, and companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm">IBM</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, and Nvidia have been working on generating test chips since (Understandably, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us">Intel will not share details</a> with the public, but it has won a $1 billion award from the US Government for the program).&nbsp;</p><div><p>Additionally, Intel's 20A finds the company integrating two new technologies at once - backside power (PowerVIA) and GAA transistors (RibbonFET). To de-risk the process and avoid stumbles like it saw with 10nm, Intel announced in April of 2022 that it had run a different flavor of 18A through its fabs, an internal test node with only backside power paired with standard FinFETs, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-details-powervia-backside-power-delivery-network" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-details-powervia-backside-power-delivery-network">ensure backside power worked separately before being integrated into the final 18A node</a>. As such, we can expect that 20A wafers have been flowing through an Intel fab for quite some time.</p><p>

As shown on the right, Intel will also aggressively ramp up its advanced packaging production capacity for Foveros, EMIB, SIP (silicon photonics), and HBI (hybrid bond interconnect). Advanced packaging capacity has been a key choke point for the current shortages of AI accelerators. This increased capacity will ensure a steady supply of advanced processors with complex packaging, including HBM.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Intel's ramp of advanced packaging capacity is explosive — the company had very little production capacity for these interconnects in 2023. As an aside, Intel recently wrapped up all of its internal packaging efforts using standard packaging; it is now all-in on advanced packaging and will use OSATs (outsourced assembly and test companies) for standard packaging tasks.</p><p>

The second slide in the above album visualizes how Intel's move to operating as an external foundry will allow it to increase both the amount of production for each of its nodes and the length of time that each node is in production, thus maximizing profit from its fab and equipment expenditures as it serves its customer orders over longer periods.</p></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-3GSuLiJaMcFZDW6QXVDVcZ-5"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Intel"></p></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Esfarjani also shared details about Intel's globe-spanning operations. In addition to its existing facilities, the company plans to invest $100 billion over the next five years on expansions and new production sites.</p><p>

The slides above outline the various locations of node production, with 18A occurring in Fab 52 and 62 in Arizona. In contrast, the advanced packaging and 65nm foundry operations for Tower will occur in Fab 9 and 11X in New Mexico. Intel didn't share where it plans to produce its 10A node, and it also has ongoing expansions in Ohio, Israel, Germany, Malaysia, and Poland.</p><p>

This geographically distributed production capacity, spanning both chipmaking and packaging, allows Intel to have global redundancy in its operations while also offering its foundry customers the option of leveraging a supply chain entirely located in America.</p></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-3GSuLiJaMcFZDW6QXVDVcZ-7"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Intel"></p></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As we illustrated in our coverage of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/inside-intel-packaging-factory" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/inside-intel-packaging-factory">tour of Intel's Penang, Malaysia facilities</a>, the company leans heavily on automation in its foundries. Intel now plans to use AI in all segments of its production flows, from capacity planning and forecasting to yield improvements and actual floor-level production operations, in a '10X moonshot' effort.</p><p>

Esfarjani didn't provide a timeline for the company's moonshot effort but said it will impact every aspect of its operations in the future.&nbsp;That includes the introduction of AI "Cobots," which are collaborative robots that can work along with humans, and extensive robotic automation in the manufacturing process.</p><p>

In the meantime, Intel will continue to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-i-hope-to-build-chips-for-lisa-su-and-amd" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-i-hope-to-build-chips-for-lisa-su-and-amd">aggressively pursue any and all potential customers</a> for its operations.

So technology-friendly civilization in HD 110067, if any, may have communication relays set up on multiple planets in the system, he said. "Even if it is a negative result, that still tells us something."</p><p>When HD 110067's discovery was announced, Croft and his team used the world's largest fully steerable telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/green-bank-observatory.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/green-bank-observatory.html"><u>GBT</u></a>) in West Virginia, and searched the system for signs of alien technology. The researchers looked for signals that were continuously present when the telescope was pointed at the system and absent when directed away, the smoking gun of technosignatures local to HD 110067.</p><p>But such signals are difficult to distinguish from natural sources of radio waves and humankind's own technological signals, such as radio waves beaming from cell phones connected to Wi-Fi, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html"><u>SpaceX</u></a>'s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html"><u>Starlink</u></a> satellite network in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/low-earth-orbit" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/low-earth-orbit"><u>low Earth orbit</u></a>. This creates a haystack of signals in which researchers look for a needle of a potential extraterrestrial signal, said Croft.&nbsp;</p><p>"I should add we don't know if there are needles in the haystack," he said. "We don't really know what the needles look like."</p><p>Despite this lack of sufficient knowledge of what alien technology looks like, the team employed a few techniques to ensure a detected signal is not local interference. For instance, if one were to build a transmitter in the hopes that somebody else would pick it up, that transmitter would pump a lot of energy into a narrow range of frequencies. Natural astrophysical phenomena, by contrast, beam radio waves across a much broader range.</p><p>Signals from such a transmitter placed on a planet spinning around a foreign star would drift in time when observed from Earth, "the same as when an ambulance goes past you, the sound of it shifts from very high to very low," study lead author <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-choza-28437422b/" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-choza-28437422b/"><u>Carmen Choza</u></a>, an assistant researcher at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/33626-search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/33626-search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence.html"><u>Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</u></a> (SETI) Institute in California, told Space.com.</p><p>The search ultimately did not detect a technological signal — however, the results do not eliminate the existence of technosignatures in HD 110067, Croft said, but rather tell us that no signal was beamed in our direction at the time of the observations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the discovery team is refining the radii of the six detected planets using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/22562-european-space-agency.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/22562-european-space-agency.html"><u>European Space Agency</u></a>'s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/36144-cheops-exoplanet-satellite.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/36144-cheops-exoplanet-satellite.html"><u>CHEOPS</u></a> space telescope, and the planets' masses using HARPS-N and CARMENES instruments in Spain, Rafael Luque of the University of Chicago told Space.com.</p><p>Accurate data on sizes and masses of the planets would shed more light onto the system's chemical makeup.

Hi everyone,

This patch ports the VP9 library written by Andrzej into Rust as a
proof-of-concept. This is so that we can evaluate the Rust in V4L2 initiative
with source code in hand.

It converts rkvdec and hantro to use the Rust version of the library. These two
were chosen merely because that's the hardware I currently own. Fluster scores
remain the same when using either the Rust or C version. Please test this.

Much has been spoken at various occasions about drivers and I feel that the
consensus is to wait for now. This is why I am proposing a different approach:
porting our codec libraries to Rust.

IMHO, these components can benefit greatly from Rust, as they implement
complicated algorithms that also happen to process data received from userspace
through V4L2 controls. These algorithms use the data received from userspace in
order to index into a lot of arrays and thus benefit from Rust's memory safety.

The first thing about the code is that it does not include any layer of
bindings. This was pointed out as a blocker several times due to the need of
keeping them in sync with the C code.

The Rust code here also offers a C API for C drivers.This C API is
automatically generated by cbindgen and I have provided instructions on how to
do so. We can even use functions from both the C and Rust libraries at the same
time since the ABI is the same.

The above can come in handy because it means that we can convert a given
codebase piece by piece if need be. C drivers will work as usual through the C
API and any new Rust driver will get to benefit from a native Rust interface.

Please take note that most of the code is *not* in the media tree, so I do not
see how this can further stress our subsystem. I take responsibility for
maintaining stuff in rust/kernel/media and honestly, this library will not need
any further updates for the same reason we have never touched its C
counterpart.

I hope to convince the community that this is a feasible way to slowly
experiment with Rust code without tying us up too much to it.

Lastly, please note that this code is just a proof of concept, we can settle on
a proper patch - with all that entails - if it is well received.

Those with hardware can follow the steps below to test this patch:

a) enable Rust (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/rust/quick-start.html">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/rust/quick-start.html</a>).
Make sure CONFIG_RUST=y.

b) enable one of the converted drivers (CONFIG_VIDEO_HANTRO or
CONFIG_VIDEO_ROCKCHIP_VDEC). This will select V4L2_VP9_RS.

c) download the Fluster tool (<a href="https://github.com/fluendo/fluster">https://github.com/fluendo/fluster</a>)

d) download the VP9 test suite from libvpx (fluster.py download VP9-TEST-VECTORS)

e) make sure you have a recent version of GStreamer (`gst-inspect-1.0
v4l2codecs` must not be empty) 

f) run the test suite (fluster.py run -d GStreamer-VP9-V4L2SL-Gst1.0 -ts VP9-TEST-VECTORS)

g) results should be the same both with and without this patch

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><time datetime="2024-02-26">February 26, 2024</time></p>
<p>Questions like “Which browser should I use?” regularly come up on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/">r/browsers subreddit</a>. I sometimes respond to these posts, but my quick replies usually only contain one or two points. To be honest, until recently I wasn’t even sure myself why I use Firefox. Of course it’s a pretty good browser, but that doesn’t explain why I’ve stubbornly stayed loyal to Firefox for more than a decade. After giving it a bit more thought, I came up with the following reasons.</p>
<h2>1. The <em>about:config</em> page</h2>
<p>In Firefox, there is an internal <em>about:config</em> page with thousands (tens of thousands?) of individual configs that can be freely edited by the user. If you don’t like a particular UI element or behavior in Firefox, there’s a good chance that you can change it with a config. The <em>about:config</em> page is also used to individually enable experimental web platform features (without requiring a browser restart like in Chrome).</p>
<p>Here are some of the configs that I’ve edited or added:</p>
<dt>devtools.toolbox.zoomValue = 1.2</dt>
<dd>increases the default text size in Firefox devtools to 120%</dd>
<dt>browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab = false</dt>
<dd>prevents the entire browser window from closing when the user closes the last tab (I find this behavior annoying)</dd>
<dt>devtools.inspector.showUserAgentStyles = true</dt>
<dd>shows user-agent styles in the CSS Rules pane in Firefox devtools (why are user-agent styles hidden by default?)</dd>
<dt>browser.chrome.guess_favicon = false</dt>
<dd>stops Firefox from attempting to load the website’s favicon from the default location when an icon is <i>not</i> declared in the HTML document (I use this config to get rid of the distracting ”favicon not found” errors in the devtools console)</dd>
<dt>browser.urlbar.resultMenu.keyboardAccessible = false</dt>
<dd>removes menu buttons from the individual items in the URL bar dropdown list (those buttons make tabbing through the items slower)</dd>
<h2>2. Mozilla cannot decrypt my data on their servers</h2>
<p>All the major browsers have a feature for syncing the user’s browsing data across devices (Firefox Sync, Chrome Sync, Apple iCloud, and so on). The user’s data is stored on the browser vendor’s servers, and this data is of course encrypted. But can the browser vendor decrypt this data? Google can. Apple claims that they can’t, but they have disclosed user data to law enforcement in the past, so I don’t trust them. Mozilla says that they can’t, and I trust them.</p>
<p>It seems that Mozilla goes out of their way to make absolutely sure that they can’t access the synced browsing data of Firefox users. The encryption is strong enough that with current technology it would take trillions of years to break into this data, so it’s pretty safe. However, if I somehow managed to lose all my devices where I’ve activated Firefox Sync, my browsing data on Mozilla’s servers would be lost forever; there would be no way of recovering it. Still, I like the idea of using a browser from a company that does not <em>want</em> to access my data on their own servers. I feel like this is how it should be.</p>
<h2>3. Translating web pages is also completely private</h2>
<p>Firefox Translations is a relatively new feature that allows users to translate web pages to a different language (from a small set of supported languages) directly in the browser, without sending any data to any servers. This feature is based on machine learning and neural networks.</p>
<p>This is another example of Mozilla going the extra mile to protect the user’s privacy.</p>
<h2>4. Mozilla develops their own browser engine</h2>
<p>Firefox uses Mozilla’s Gecko browser engine. No other major browser uses Gecko. The web is my favorite platform, and since a diversity of browser engines is good for the web*, I want to support Gecko. By using Firefox and reporting Firefox and web compat bugs, I’m doing my part.</p>
<p>*Allow me to quote <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/developer-faq/#hold-up-isnt-more-browsers-sharing-webkit-better-for-compatibility">Google’s F.A.Q.</a> from 2013 when they forked WebKit:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Hold up, isn't more browsers sharing WebKit better for compatibility?</h3>
<p>It's important to remember that WebKit is already not a homogenous target for developers. For example, features like WebGL and IndexedDB are only supported in some WebKit-based browsers. Understanding WebKit for Developers helps explain the details, like why <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, fonts and 3D transforms implementations vary across WebKit browsers.</p>
<p>Today Firefox uses the Gecko engine, which isn’t based on WebKit, yet the two have a high level of compatibility. We’re adopting a similar approach to Mozilla by having a distinct yet compatible open-source engine. We will also continue to have open bug tracking and implementation status so you can see and contribute to what we’re working on at any time.</p>
<p>From a short-term perspective, monocultures seem good for developer productivity. <mark>From the long-term perspective, however, monocultures inevitably lead to stagnation. It is our firm belief that more options in rendering engines will lead to more innovation and a healthier web ecosystem.</mark></p>
<h3>How does this affect web standards?</h3>
<p>Bringing a new browser engine into the world increases diversity. Though that in itself isn't our goal, it has the beneficial effect of ensuring that multiple interoperable implementations of accepted standards exist. <mark>Each engine will approach the same problem from a different direction, meaning that web developers can be more confident in the performance and security characteristics of the end result. It also makes it less likely that one implementation's quirks become de facto standards, which is good for the open web at large.</mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t have said it better. We currently have three major browser engines—and a couple of smaller ones in development—and of those three, Gecko is the only one that may be at risk. I’m not sure what Gecko’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_status">conservation status</a> would be if it were a real animal (probably “Conservation Dependent”), but I don't plan on giving up on it anytime soon.</p>
<h2>5. The best support for extensions on Android</h2>
<p>The web has unfortunately become slower and more annoying over the past decade. Extensions that block ads and other types of problematic content have become necessary to have a normal web browsing experience. On Android, Firefox has by far the best support for browser extensions. This includes uBlock Origin (the best ad-blocker) and extensions for adding user styles and user scripts to websites. I actively use all of these extensions (uBlock Origin, <a href="https://add0n.com/stylus.html">Stylus</a>, Tampermonkey) on desktop to tweak websites to my liking. It is awesome that Firefox users on Android can do the same.</p>
<h2>6. A great picture-in-picture player</h2>
<p>I should probably finally mention an actual feature in Firefox that a regular user might find useful. I don’t really use Firefox for its general features, but if there’s one such feature that I really like, it’s the native picture-in-picture video player in desktop Firefox, which is superb. It has everything that one could ask for. It can be quickly opened via an overlay button that is shown when hovering any video. It can be resized and positioned anywhere on the screen. It has the full controls, including pause, mute, and the seek bar for skipping to any point in the video. I use it all the time.</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>I trust Mozilla more than I trust Google, Apple, Microsoft, or any other company that makes web browsers. This trust is based on the fact that Mozilla chooses the highest level of user privacy when developing services such as Firefox Sync, Firefox Translate, and others. A web browser is an integral part of a person’s online life, so it makes sense to choose a browser from a company that one trusts the most.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Firefox offers the highest level of customization, whether it’s through browser extensions or internal configs. This is important to me because I prefer websites over native apps.</p>
<p>Any great feature, such as the picture-in-picture player, is just the cherry on top. I understand that for most people it’s probably the other way around. They care about features more than they care about privacy and customization. That is fine. There is no wrong answer. Everyone should use the browser that serves them best.</p>

<h2>Why SymPy</h2>
<div>
    <p>SymPy is…</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free:</strong>  Licensed under BSD, SymPy is free both as in speech and as in beer. </li>
        <li><strong>Python-based:</strong>  SymPy is written entirely in Python and uses Python for its language. </li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> 
        SymPy only depends on <a href="http://mpmath.org/">mpmath</a>, a pure Python library for arbitrary
        floating point arithmetic, making it easy to use. </li>
        <li><strong>A library:</strong>  Beyond use as an interactive tool, SymPy can be embedded in other applications and extended with custom functions. </li>

            <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 12:05:44 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/28/eu_microsoft_mistral/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/28/eu_microsoft_mistral/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39536824">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The European Commission is investigating Microsoft's €15 million ($16.3 million) investment in French startup Mistral, which came just after the latter released a large language model to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Founded in 2023 by researchers from Google DeepMind and Meta, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/15/mistral_ai/">Mistral</a> has raised over €385 million ($417.1 million) from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed. The upstart is valued at around €1.8 billion ($2 billion) today.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mistral announced its latest and most powerful large language model, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large/" rel="nofollow">Mistral Large</a>, and released a web app netizens can use to experiment with a chatbot powered by the model. It also put out a smaller model, Mistral Small, which - as the name suggests - is optimized to be faster and more compact. Mistral has previously shared other models, such as its seven-billion parameter Mistral-7B <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/">in September</a>.</p>

    

<p>To give developers more access to its technology, Mistral also revealed it partnered with Microsoft to bring its open and commercial models to Azure.</p>

        


        

<p>In return, Microsoft will support Mistral by providing it with hardware and infrastructure from its cloud computing platform to train and run its future systems. Mistral co-founder and CEO Arthur Mensch offered enthusiastic endorsement of the deal in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-and-mistral-ai-announce-new-partnership-to-accelerate-ai-innovation-and-introduce-mistral-large-first-on-azure/">Microsoft statement</a> that outlined a shared enthusiasm for "impactful progress in the AI industry and delivering unparalleled value to our customers and partners globally."</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for cloud providers to invest in AI startups and for those deals to involve access to cloudy infrastructure. Microsoft has invested $13 billion into OpenAI, while Google and Amazon Web Services have invested heavily into Anthropic.</p>

        

<p>But Mistral's deal has attracted the attention of EU regulators</p>
<p>These deals are a win-win for both parties. Hosting the latest large language models drives more business to cloud platforms, while startups need large clusters of GPUs to develop new models. The European Commission, however, is wary that AI mergers with Big Tech could consolidate power and crush innovation, making it potentially more difficult to regulate the technology and for smaller companies to compete.</p>
<p>"The commission is looking into agreements that have been concluded between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers," European Commission spokesperson Lea Zuber <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-sets-its-sights-on-microsofts-ai-deal-with-frances-mistral/" rel="nofollow">told</a> Politico. "In this context, we have received the mentioned agreement, which we will analyze."</p>

"We are inviting businesses and experts to tell us about any competition issues that they may perceive in these industries, whilst also closely monitoring AI partnerships to ensure they do not unduly distort market dynamics," Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy for the European Commission, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/09/ec_microsoft_openai/">declared</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>The commission has agreed on the wording of an AI Act – a sweeping plan to enforce rules for AIs based on the risks each represents. Generative AI models like Mistral Large or ChatGPT are <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence" rel="nofollow">considered</a> as "high-impact general-purpose" systems that might pose "systemic risk". Developers will be required to disclose the source of their training data and design guardrails to prevent them producing worrisome content.</p>

        

<p><em>The Register</em> has asked Microsoft and Mistral for comment. ®</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One morning in January this year, marine scientist Terry Hughes opened X (formerly Twitter) and searched for tweets about the Great Barrier Reef.</p><p>"I&nbsp;keep an eye on what's being tweeted about the reef every day," Professor Hughes, a leading coral researcher at James Cook University, said.</p><p>What he found that day surprised and confused him; hundreds of bot accounts tweeting the same strange message with slightly different wording.</p><p>"Wow, I had no idea that agricultural runoff could have such a devastating impact on the Great Barrier Reef," one account, which otherwise spruiked cryptocurrencies, tweeted.</p><p>Another crypto bot wrote: "Wow, it's disheartening to hear about the water pollution challenges Australia faces."</p><p>And so on. Hundreds of crypto accounts tweeting about agricultural runoff.</p><p>A month later, it happened again. This time, bots were tweeting about "marine debris" threatening the Great Barrier Reef.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>When Professor Hughes tweeted what he'd found, some saw a disinformation conspiracy, an attempt to deflect attention from climate change.</p><p>The likely answer, however, is more mundane, but also more far-reaching in its implications.</p><p>More than a year since Elon Musk bought X with promises to get rid of the bots, the problem is worse than ever, experts say.</p><p>And this is one example of a broader problem affecting online spaces.</p><p>The internet is filling up with "zombie content" designed to game algorithms and scam humans.</p><p>It's becoming a place where bots talk to bots, and search engines crawl a lonely expanse of pages written by artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>Junk websites clog up Google search results.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>WASHINGTON, February 27, 2024 – The Federal Communications Commission is being told that its focus on speed in its proposed draft order released Thursday is obscuring other important broadband metrics, namely the time it takes for traffic to be routed.&nbsp;</p><p>Suggestions included in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400675A1.pdf?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com"><u>draft report and order</u></a> published by the FCC last week suggest that, as the agency considers increasing the national broadband speed standard, it should also look to enhance broadband criteria with regard to latency.</p><!--members-only--><p>Up for consideration by the FCC on March 14, the draft report would increase the current national broadband speed definition of 25 * 3 Megabits per second (Mbps) established in 2015, raising it to 100 * 20 Mbps. If adopted, the report would also adopt a long-term national broadband speed target of 1 Gigabit per second downstream and 500 Mbps upstream.</p><p>While the FCC's draft report doesn't specify explicit latency requirements for defining "broadband", the agency did ask for feedback on creating benchmarks for network latency reporting, which it plans to revisit in future inquiries.</p><p>The FCC’s draft report, on page 70, indicates that several respondents to the agency’s <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/fcc-is-looking-to-update-its-definition-of-broadband/"><u>initial inquiry launched in November</u></a> support incorporating service quality elements, particularly latency, into the commission's annual Section 706 report. This report evaluates whether advanced telecommunication capabilities, including broadband, are being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely manner.</p><p>For more than a decade, the commission has required its recipients of the Universal Service Fund’s high-cost funding to have 95 percent or more of all observations of network round-trip latency at or below 100 milliseconds. This is the <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/ntia-endorses-fccs-proposed-increase-of-broadband-speed-benchmark/"><u>same standard the Department of Commerce </u></a>requires Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment funding recipients to meet.</p><p>In the FCC’s draft report, the commission states the majority of commenters call for the FCC to maintain this standard, consistent with language in the Infrastructure Act.</p><p>On the other hand, some commentators, including <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1201149791872/1?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com"><u>USTelecom</u></a> and <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/121898675000/1?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com"><u>WISPA</u></a>, argue that considering service quality factors like latency would broaden the scope of the commission’s Section 706 assessment beyond its original purpose. However, the FCC rejected this assertion in its preliminary report.</p><p>Among those supporting the FCC’s proposal to investigate latency as a service attribute are <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1201796612647/1?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com"><u>ADTRAN</u></a>, whose comments are detailed on pages 15-17; <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1130062474793/1?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com"><u>ASSIA</u></a>, noted on pages 2-4; and <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/120183487017/1?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com"><u>Dr. William Hawkins, III</u></a>, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Cincinnati, whose <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/120183487017/1?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com"><u>comments</u></a> argue that “working latency must be evaluated alongside throughput when determining whether a consumer’s internet access qualifies as broadband”.</p><p>Another response, backed <a href="https://circleid.com/posts/20231211-its-the-latency-fcc?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com"><u>by 63 signatures</u></a>, suggests Congress and the FCC should not consider raising the broadband standard beyond 100 * 20 Mbps at this time without considering latency, and the technology and software that exist to mitigate it.&nbsp;</p><p>The comment submitted by <strong>Dave Taht, </strong>chief science officer of LibreQoS, argues that today’s applications are not typically bandwidth-limited, but are instead significantly limited by working latency. LibreQoS is a software tool designed to reduce the delay or lag experienced by internet users when accessing the web.</p><p>Taht argues the commission should balance its near-term efforts to increase speed and bandwidth with the goal of minimizing latency. Taht’s comment emphasizes that web page load time is almost entirely bound by latency, not by bandwidth, stating “it is rare that a typical web page will use more than 20 megabits at any instant in time.”&nbsp;</p><p>The comment references studies demonstrating that a 10 gigabit link with 50 milliseconds latency is readily outperformed by a 10 megabit link with 1 ms latency for most interactive traffic.</p><p>“Calls for further bandwidth increases are analogous to calling for cars to have top speeds of 100, 500, or 1000 miles per hour. Without calling also for better airbags, bumpers, brakes, or roads designed to minimize travel delay,” the comment reads. “Increasing the ‘speed limit’ of the link without actually making the road navigable at the higher speed is a waste of effort.”</p><p>The comment highlights that real-time applications like video conferencing, online gaming, and voice over Internet Protocol ‘VoIP’ are more sensitive to latency. High latency or variable latency (jitter) in these applications can cause delays, echoes, distortions, or freezes in video calls.</p><p>The comment further raises the question of why the federal government never inquires about the type of fiber a subrecipient plans to deploy, stating that active fiber offers considerably greater capacity for transit compared to GPON.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel from its source to its destination. It is typically measured by round-trip time in milliseconds (ms). Both upload and download processes can benefit from lower latency. And certain technologies offer lower latency than others. Fiber optic cables offer the lowest latency among wired connections, ranging from 1 to 10 ms, due to the high speed at which the light travels through the glass fiber. </p>

Nintendo of America is suing the creators behind the Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu, claiming their tech facilitates piracy.
</p>
<p>New documents filed Monday, February 26 reveal that videogame giant Nintendo is taking action against the creators of the popular emulator tool Yuzu. </p><p><a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/rhode-island/ridce/1:2024cv00082/56980?ref=overkill.wtf" rel="noreferrer">The copyright infringement filing</a>, from Nintendo of America, states that the Yuzu tool (from developer Tropic Haze LLC) illegally circumvents the software encryption and copyright protection systems of Nintendo Switch titles, and thus facilitates piracy and infringes copyright under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p><p>Nintendo alleges that Tropic Haze's free Yuzu emulator tool unlawfully allows pirated Switch games to be played on PCs and other devices, bypassing Nintendo's protection measures. </p><p>The <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/wiki/faq/?ref=overkill.wtf#how-do-i-get-games" rel="noreferrer">official Yuzu website</a> suggests that the tool is to be used with software you yourself own: "<em>You are legally required to dump your games from your Nintendo Switch</em>" —&nbsp;but it's common knowledge, that this is not how these tools are primarily used.</p><p>The legal document claims that over a million copies of last year's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were downloaded prior to the game's official retail release. </p><p>Additionally, Nintendo's filing points to the success of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yuzuteam?ref=overkill.wtf" rel="noreferrer">Yuzu's Patreon page</a>, highlighting how the project is actively supported by over 7,000 members. At time of writing, the Yuzu Patreon currently brings in close to $30,000 per month. Nintendo's filing alludes that this Patreon page has been actively engaged in promoting the emulator, and thus by extension piracy. </p><figure><img src="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2024/02/yuzu-patreon.jpg" alt="Yuzu on Patreon" loading="lazy" width="900" height="294" srcset="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/yuzu-patreon.jpg 600w, https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2024/02/yuzu-patreon.jpg 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The Yuzu project on Patreon</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a result, Nintendo is now seeking a trial by jury, damages, and is demanding that the Yuzu emulator is shut down. </p><p><em>Developing...</em></p><hr><p>Via:<em> </em><a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1762576284817768457?ref=overkill.wtf" rel="noreferrer"><em>Stephen Totilo</em></a><em> of </em><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/?ref=overkill.wtf" rel="noreferrer"><em>Game File</em></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>It's most definitely not a program 'written' by a programmer, but rather a listing of some random program segment using the disassembly command of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger" rel="noreferrer">debugger</a>.</p>
<p>Have you tried to find that code within the program?</p>
<h2>Let's See What We Got</h2>
<p>Hard to say anything definitive with only this (incomplete) section. A few details visible are:</p>
<pre><code>01: INT 21         ; An unknown (*1) call to DOS, function code would have been set prior to this line
02: JB 0103        ; Jump to address 0103h if DOS returns NO error
03: MOV AH,4D      ; Get return code from DOS (*1)
04: INT 21
05: CS:            ; (*2)
06: MOV [OBEA],AX  ; Save return information within the program code at offset 0BEAh
07: JMP 02B2       ; Continue at 02B2h
08: JMP 1451       ; Continue at 1451h (*3)
09: CS:            ; (*4)
10: TEST BYTE PTR [0C59],01 ; Test the lowest bit of the byte at 0C59h within code 
11: JZ 0150        ; Continue at 0150h if not set (*6)
12: CS:
13: TEST BYTE PTR [OC59],02 ; Test the second lowest bit 
14: JZ 014F        ; Continue at 014Fh if not set (*6)
15: IRET           ; Return from Interrupt to terminate the program(*5,*6)
16: INT 21         ; Again a an unknown DOS call (*7)
17: JB 0103        ; Continue at 0103h if no error reported (*8)
18: TEST BYTE PTR [0C59],04 ; Test the third lowest bit
19: JZ 0169        ; Continue at 0169h if not set
20: CMP AH,01      ; check AH for 01h (*7)
21: JA 014F        ; If AH was greater than 01h continue at 014Fh (*9)
</code></pre>
<p>*1 - Since the second INT 21h (L:04), made when an error is returned, asks DOS for a <a href="https://fd.lod.bz/rbil/interrup/dos_kernel/214d.html" rel="noreferrer">program's return code</a>, the previous DOS call (L:01) was most likely an <a href="https://fd.lod.bz/rbil/interrup/dos_kernel/214b.html" rel="noreferrer">EXEC call</a> to run a different program as child process. Using this function also tells that the program was written/compiled for MS-DOS 2.0 or later.</p>
<p>*2 - A hint that the debugger used was most likely the one supplied with MS-DOS.</p>
<p>*3 - Line 08  might be a target from a previous branch, one like the one on L:02. Such would be a typical compiler structure to continue from a branch to a destination more than 128 bytes away.</p>
<p>*4 - An entry point, like *2, except here operation continues</p>
<p>*5 - Using an IRET here is a strong indicator that the program may be a .COM program and this being used to terminate it.</p>
<p>DOS prepares the memory of a COM program much like CP/M, including a way that a jump at address 0000h will terminate it. This is done by placing it's original <a href="https://fd.lod.bz/rbil/interrup/dos_kernel/20.html" rel="noreferrer">termination interrupt</a> INT 20h at the start of the PSP - which is at CS:0 for COM programs - and pushing a word of 0000h onto the stack.</p>
<p>Now a simple RET NEAR can be used to terminate. This of course only works if CS doesn't get changed inbetween. A condition true for most simple programs, especially such converted from 8080 code. To still use that way of termination while possibly changing CS during program run it was common for COM programs to start by pushing CS and another word of 0000h onto the stack. Now a RETF could  used, no matter what content CS had at the moment (and as long as all stack levels were cleaned up).</p>
<p>EXE programs added a little issue as their initial CS is not pointing to the PSP. But DS is loaded in both types with the PSP address, so pushing DS instead of CS would make the code usable for both types of program.</p>
<p>Since that 'trick' would leave a a single word on stack (the one provided by DOS to start with), it became common to use an IRET instead of a RET FAR, which does take that word as well off the stack. Not that it made a difference, but it felt better :))</p>
<p>*6 - It's extreme hard to do any guess without knowing the address that code is located. But having two jumps targeted only one byte apart means that either some (for x86) unusual program trick is used, or 014Fh containing a single byte instruction. Considering that an IRET/INT combination is rather unusual and that IRET is a single byte instruction, it could quite well be that it's address is 014Fh. But then again the previous JZ wont make much sense, as either way would lead to taking the IRET.</p>
<p>*7 - Checking AH after DOS functions is rare, as the standard return code is contained in AL (AX). Get Return code (see L:03/04) in turn does use AH and AL different. AL contains the child return code, while AH contains the termination reason. Here 00h/01h are regular termination reasons, while 02h is a critical error abort. Checking for above 01h would make sense if the previous INT 21h was as well an EXEC call.</p>
<p>*7 - Note this being he same target as used on line 02, which seems to be the default good exit.</p>
<p>*8 - Note this being he same target as used on line 14</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusions From Code</h2>
<p>The code snipplet is most likely part of an exec function that starts a child program and checks if the execution went well and continues afterwards. It might thus be some menu system/framework starting overlay modules for different tasks (game sections??). It seems to be written in some High level language.</p>
<p>Also, it's most likely not from DOS or any OS level software, but user space, as it used INT 21h functions.</p>
<p>Using the IRET termination hints to some really old code with DOS 1.x origin, or a compiler using that trick to save code size if here are multiple termination points. It must be an older one, as MS discouraged use of returning via PSP:0 and INT 20h in general with DOS 3</p>
<p>Taking into account that the target for 'good' execution (L:02/L:17) points to a very low address within this code, this could be an endless loop starting around the loading and executing a child process. Together with the fact that it checks flags within its own code segment after returning from the child process to decide how to continue, I could imagine this being a loader for a larger program, whose only job is to reload that program whenever it got normally terminated, unless some flags have been set by the child before termination.</p>
<p>A program like this could be a simple solution to catch certain errors without adding lots of error checking code within the application. Any error detection would just exit the child, which then gets restarted from above code.</p>
<p>Note: These are all wild guesses, not necessary true. There is no way to tell where it's originated, unless one finds exactly that code in some program.</p>
<h2>Now, What is It?</h2>
<p>Nothing. I'd say they just started up their debugger, loaded some program, dumped a random section of 21 lines and copied them into the game text. Could be from the game or any other program.</p>

Everyone is confused. What is a trace? What is a span? Is log line a span? Do I need traces if I have logs? Why I need traces if I have great metrics? The list of questions like these goes on. Charity - together with other great folks from observability system called </span><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Honeycomb</a><span> - have been doing a great job shedding light on these questions. Yet, per my own experience it’s still extremely hard to explain what does Charity meant by “logs are thrash”, let alone the fact that logs and traces are essentially the same things. Why is everyone so confused?</span></p><p>With the risk of being spicy a little, I’m going to blame Open Telemetry. Yes, it’s powering the modern observability stack and yet I blame it for the mass confusion. Not because it’s a bad solution - it’s great! But the presentation and the whole approach of explaining what Open Telemetry is and what it does makes the observability look tricky and complex.</p><p>First, Open Telemetry from the very beginning makes a clear distinctions between traces, metrics and logs:</p><blockquote><p>OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software’s performance and behavior.</p></blockquote><p>Then it goes deeper in explaining each of these 3.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png" width="1456" height="1050" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1050,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:679568,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bae5d5-989e-4064-a2ab-4b946c67fa49_3428x2472.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This is screenshot from the part of open telemetry website introducing traces. Based on my experience talking to people who work with OpenTelemetry, this presentation has indeed become one of the main pictures being associated with observability. For some, this IS the observability. And it also sets traces apart from anything else. This is clear not a log, is it? This also doesn’t look like a metric, right? It’s something </span><em>special, </em><span>probably a bit </span><em>sacred, </em><span>and requiring learning investment. Per my experience, once people learned about traces, they only think about them in the context of this picture and the whole set of terms like spans, root spans, nested spans and the rest. OpenTelemetry site has a </span><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/glossary/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">glossary</a><span> page with more than 60 terms! This all is insanely complex!</span></p><p>But what’s more important - does this focus on “logs, metrics and traces” represent the true power of observability? It does cover some scenarios that’s true, but when it comes to the distributed systems at scale what’s more important is an ability to “dig” into data - “slice and dice” it, build and analyse various views, correlate, search for anomalies… And systems that offer all of this do exist.</p><p>When I was working at Meta, I wasn’t aware that I was privileged to be using the best observability system ever. This system is called Scuba and it’s the top 1 thing by a large margin that people miss when they leave Meta.</p><p>The basic idea of Scuba is extremely simple and doesn’t require a glossary page for people to grasp. It operates with Wide Events. Wide Event is just a collection of fields with names and values, pretty much like a json document. If you need to record some information - whether it’s the current state of the system, or an event caused by an API call, background job or whatever - you can just write some Wide Event to Scuba. For instance, if a system serves ads, the natural desire would be to record Ad Impressions - the facts that a certain ad has been seen by a user. The corresponding Wide Event might be looking like this:</p><pre><code><code>{
    "Timestamp": "1707951423",
    "AdId": "542508c92f6f47c2916691d6e8551279”,
    "UserCountry": "US",
    "Placement": "mobile_feed",
    "CampaingType": "direct_ads",
    "UserOS": "Android",
    "OSVersion": "14",
    "AppVersion": "798de3c28b074df9a24a479ce98302b6",
    ...
}</code></code></pre><p><span>Such events called wide, because it’s encouraged to dump to them all the information one can think of. Anything that might be relevant in the context of a certain data - just put it there, it might be useful later. This approach is laying the groundwork for dealing with </span><em>unknown unknowns</em><span> - something you can’t think of now that may be revealed later during an incident investigation.</span></p><p>Dealing with unknown unknowns can be better demonstrated on an example. Scuba has a nice intuitive interface which is easy to explore and play with. It has a section where one can pick a metric to look at, as well as sections for filters and groupings - and Scuba would draw a nice time series chart. Firs look for Ad Impressions dataset would simply draw a chart with impressions count:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png" width="1456" height="628" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:628,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6919861,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2b8e77d-5800-46b9-acf7-42eed73cdfa3_4466x1926.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>If we express what’s exactly is selected here in terms of SQL, then this is something like</p><pre><code><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM AdImpressions

Scuba made it simple to do the exploration because it’s fast and has a really nice easy-to-use UI. Also note that we have never mentioned anything about cardinality. Because it doesn’t matter - any field can be of any cardinality. Scuba works with raw events and doesn’t pre-aggregate anything, and so cardinality is not an issue.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes UI / Visualisation aspect doesn’t get enough attention, and observability systems offer some query language - either a proprietary (bad-bad-bad), or SQL (slightly better, but still bad). Such an interface makes it close to impossible to conduct similar investigations. One important aspect of Scuba that all the fields - function, filter, grouping, etc. - are </span><em>explorable.</em><span> Meaning that there is an easy way to see what kind of values we can pick. When the owners of a certain field are not lazy, they even included a detailed description for the given field with relevant links etc. This is huge. I have successfully investigated a lot of incidents myself, without full understanding of either the whole system, or the data available in this dataset. And boy I did learn a lot about the system during these investigations, simply via playing around with Scuba! This was amazing. This was observability paradise.</span></p><p>Now imagine my level of confusion and disbelief when I left Meta and got to know the state of observability systems outside.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png" width="1456" height="1456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1456,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5866743,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949fb3f4-e47c-4630-8dc9-8fab4c8376c2_2418x2418.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Logs?

The thing is - it’s extremely hard to advocate for this mental model when the one suggested by Open Telemetry is already learned. Which is really upsetting, because Traces, Metrics and Logs are all just special cases of Wide Events really:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Traces and Spans:</strong><span> These are just wide events having </span><strong>SpanId, TraceId and ParentSpanId</strong><span> fields. So we can filter all spans with a given TraceId, topologically sort them using SpanId → ParentSpanId relation, and draw that distributed tracing view everyone loves.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Logs:</strong><span> Honestly, I’m really confused what Open Telemetry means by Logs. Looks like </span><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/glossary/#logs" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a lot of things</a><span>, and one of them is Structured Log which is pretty much the Wide Event. Great! The problem, however, that “a log” is quite a defined concept, and usually people mean by it is what is produced by those </span><code>logger.info(…)</code><span> calls. Anyway, whatever is meant, logs can be easily mapped to wide events, of course. In the simplest case we can just get the log message, put it to the “log_message” field, add a bunch of metadata, and be happy. In a more complex case, we can try to automatically extract a template from a log message via removing tokens that looks like IDs, and get a hash of this template. This can allow to quickly get the most frequent error, for instance, via grouping by this hash. Meta has such a system, and it’s pretty cool.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Metrics:</strong><span> Metrics can be easily mapped, too. We just need to emit a Wide Event once per some interval containing the state of the system (system metrics like cpu, various counters,…). Prometheus, by the way, does exactly that with the scraping approach - takes a snapshot of the system once in a while. Unlike with prometheus, however, with Wide Events approach we don’t need to worry about cardinality.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>But Wide Events can offer much much more than these “3 pillars”. The aforementioned debugging session is already a case which is not really covered by Traces, Logs and Metrics - not naturally, at least. There could be other use cases, too - for instance, continuous profiling data can be easily represented as a Wide Event, and queried to build a </span><a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Flame Graph</a><span>. No need to have a separate system for this - a single system working with Wide Events can do it all. Imagine the possibilities for cross-correlation &amp; root cause analysis when everything in one place, stored together. Especially now, in the era of raise of AI-based tools that are pretty good in finding correlations in data.</span></p><p>I don’t know… I just wanted to express my frustration with the level of confusion and this focus on “3 pillars”.</p><p><span>I just wish that observability vendors took a stand against confusion, and offered a simple and natural way to interact with the system. </span><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Honeycomb</a><span> seems is </span><a href="https://x.com/mipsytipsy/status/1738048200630792245?s=20" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">doing that</a><span>, as well as some other systems like </span><a href="https://axiom.co/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Axiom</a><span>.

<p dir="auto">SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the
Super Mario Bros. games for the various Nintendo platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto">Run and jump through multiple worlds, fighting off enemies by jumping
on them, bumping them from below or tossing objects at them, grabbing
power-ups and other stuff on the way.</p>

<p dir="auto">Tux and Penny were out having a nice picnic on the ice fields of
Antarctica. Suddenly, a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there
was a flash, and Tux fell asleep!</p>
<p dir="auto">When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny is missing. Where she lay
before now lies a letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Tux, my arch enemy! I have captured your beautiful Penny and have
taken her to my fortress. The path to my fortress is littered with my
minions. Give up on the thought of trying to reclaim her, you haven't
got a chance!</p>
<p dir="auto">-Nolok</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Tux looks and sees Nolok's fortress in the distance. Determined to
save his beloved Penny, he begins his journey.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For major platforms, stable releases are built and available for download from
<a href="https://www.supertux.org/download.html" rel="nofollow">supertux.org</a> or alternatively directly
from <a href="https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases">GitHub</a>. You should be able
to install these using default tools provided by your platform. On macOS, when
Gatekeeper is enabled (default) it will refuse to open SuperTux. This is due to
the lack of a signature on the application. If you wish to open SuperTux anyway
without disabling the Gatekeeper feature entirely, you can open the application
from the context menu (control click on the icon). macOS will then remember your
choice the next time.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2><a id="user-content-documentation" aria-label="Permalink: Documentation" href="#documentation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Important documentation for SuperTux is contained in multiple files.

<li><code>NEWS.md</code> - Changes since the previous versions of SuperTux.</li>
<li><code>LICENSE.txt</code> - The GNU General Public License, under whose terms SuperTux is

<p dir="auto">Both keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change
the controls via the Options menu. Basically, the only keys you will
need to use in-game are to do the following actions: jump, duck,
right, left, action and 'P' to pause/unpause the game. There isn't much
to tell about the first few, but the "action" key allows you to pick
up objects and use any powerup you got. For instance, with the fire
flower, you can shoot fireballs, or with the ice flower fire ice pellets.</p>
<p dir="auto">Other useful keys include the Esc key, which is used to go to the menu
or to go up a level in the menu. The menu can be navigated using the
arrow keys or the mouse.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and Enter to
enter the current level.</p>

<p dir="auto">As of now, with the release of SuperTux 0.6.3 (December 2021), the Forest World is almost
finished, since the ghost forest section has been included. However, some levels, especially
the Ghostree Level, are considered to be placeholders, because for the next version (0.7.0) a
great overhaul is planned with new features like reworked boss fights, graphics, and worlds.
