<p dir="auto">Charles DarwinECCEMACY. Sir, — The following case is interesting to me : — I was in London a fortnight, and was much affected with an attack of rheumatism. The first attack of rheumatism was a week before I saw you, and the second when I saw you, and the third when I saw you, and the third in the same time. The second attack of gout, however, was not accompanied by any febrile symptoms, but was accompanied with an increased flow of urine, and with a more copious discharge of urine. The third attack was an hour after I saw you, and was succeeded by a return of a paroxysm of gout, and a more rapid return of the gout. The fourth attack was also accompanied by a fever, but was not always accompanied by any febrile symptoms. The third attack of gout was a fortnight after you had been ill, and the fourth was followed by a paroxysm of gout. The fourth attack was a fortnight after you were attacked, and was accompanied by a sense</p>

<p dir="auto">Selective Temporal Training (STT) is a machine learning methodology where all training data is specifically curated to fall within a specific historical time period. It's done in order to model the language and knowledge of that era without influence from modern concepts. For example, the current model I have now (v0.5) is trained on data exclusively from 1800-1875, it's not fine tuned but trained from scratch resulting in output that reflects the linguistic style and historical context of that time period.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?</h2><a id="user-content-why-not-just-use-fine-tuning-or-lora" aria-label="Permalink: Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?" href="#why-not-just-use-fine-tuning-or-lora"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For this project I'm trying to create a language model that is unclouded from modern bias. If I fine-tune something like GPT-2, it's already pre-trained and that information won't go away. If I train from scratch the language model won't pretend to be old, it just will be. The Goal for this project right now is to create something can reason exclusively using knowledge from London books published between 1800 and 1875.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm using books, legal documents, newspapers, and other writings from 1800–1875 London. The list I linked (for v0) has like 200 but for the first training I just used 50 files about ~187 MB. You can view a list of the documents:

  <p>Time makes fools of us all, and JavaScript is no slouch in that department either. Honestly, I’ve never minded the latter much — in fact, if you’ve taken <a href="https://piccalil.li/javascript-for-everyone">JavaScript for Everyone</a> or tuned into the <a href="https://wil.to/posts#js4e">newsletter</a>, you already know that I largely <em>enjoy</em> JavaScript’s little quirks, believe it or not.</p>
<p>I like when you can see the seams; I like how, for as formal and iron-clad as the ES-262 specification might seem, you can still see all the good <em>and</em> bad decisions made by the hundreds of people who’ve been building the language in mid-flight, if you know where to look. JavaScript has <em>character</em>. Sure, it doesn’t necessarily do everything <em>exactly</em> the way one might expect, but y’know, if you ask me, JavaScript has a real charm once you get to know it!</p>
<p>There’s one part of the language where that immediately falls apart for me, though.</p>

<p><code>Date</code> sucks. It was hastily and shamelessly copied off of Java’s homework in the car on the way to school and it got all the same answers wrong, right down to the name at the top of the page: <code>Date</code> doesn’t represent a <em>date</em>, it represents a <em>time</em>. Internally, dates are stored as number values called <strong>time values</strong>: Unix timestamps, divided into 1,000 milliseconds — which, okay, yes, a Unix time does also necessarily imply a date, sure, but <em>still</em>: Date represents a time, from which you can infer a date. Gross.</p>

<div><p>Words like “date” and “time” mean things, but, sure — <em>whatever, JavaScript</em>.</p></div>
<p>Java deprecated <em>their</em> <code>Date</code> way back in 1997, only a few years after JavaScript’s <code>Date</code> was turned loose on the unsuspecting world; meanwhile, we’ve been saddled with this mess ever since. It’s wildly inconsistent when it comes to parsing dates, as you’ve seen so far here. It has no sense of time zones beyond the local one and GMT, which is not ideal where “world-wide” is <em>right there in the web’s name</em> — and speaking-of, <code>Date</code> <em>only</em> respects the Gregorian calendar model. It wholesale does not understand the concept of daylight savings time, which— I mean, okay, yeah, samesies, but I’m not <em>made of computers</em>. All these shortcomings make it exceptionally common to use a third-party library dedicated to working around it all, some of which are absolutely <em>massive</em>; a performance drain that has done real and measurable damage to the web.</p>
<p>None of these are my major issue with <code>Date</code>. My complaint is about more than parsing or syntax or “developer ergonomics” or the web-wide performance impact of wholly necessary workarounds or even the definition of the word “date.” My issue with <code>Date</code> is soul-deep. My problem with <code>Date</code> is that using it means <em>deviating from the fundamental nature of time itself</em>.</p>

<p>All JavaScript’s primitives values are <strong>immutable</strong>, meaning that the values themselves cannot be changed. The number value <code>3</code> can never represent anything but the concept of “three” — you can’t make <code>true</code> mean anything other than “true.” These are values with concrete, iron-clad, real-world meanings. We know what three is. It can’t be some other non-three thing. These immutable data types are stored <strong>by value</strong>, meaning that a variable that represents the number value <code>3</code> effectively “contains” — and thus behaves as — the number value <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>When an immutable value is assigned to a variable, the JavaScript engine creates a copy of that value and stores the copy in memory:</p>

<p>This fits the common mental model for “a variable” just fine: <code>theNumber</code> “contains” <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>When we initialize <code>theOtherNumber</code> with the value bound to <code>theNumber</code>, that mental model holds: once again a <code>3</code> is created and stored in memory. <code>theOtherNumber</code> can now be thought of as containing its own discrete <code>3</code>.</p>

<div><p>You can’t change the binding of a <code>const</code>, and you <em>definitely</em> can’t alter the meaning of <code>3</code>.</p></div>
<p>Data types that <em>can</em> be changed after they’re created are <strong>mutable</strong>, meaning that the data value <em>itself</em> can be altered. Object values — any non-primitive value, like an array, map, or set — are mutable.</p>
<p>Variables (and object properties, function parameters, and elements in an array, set, or map) can’t “contain” an object, the way we might think of <code>theNumber</code> in the example above as “containing” <code>3</code>. A variable can contain either a primitive value or a <strong>reference value</strong>, the latter of which is a pointer to that object’s stored location in memory. When you assign an object to a variable, instead of creating a copy of that object, the identifier represents a reference to the object’s stored position in memory. That’s why an object bound to a variable declared with <code>const</code> can still be altered: the <em>reference value</em> can’t be changed, but the values of the object can:</p>

<p>When a reference value is assigned from one variable to another, the JavaScript engine creates a copy of that reference value — not the object value itself, the way a discrete copy is made of a primitive value.

<p><em>This</em> is what gets me about JavaScript’s date handling. Despite representing “point to it on a calendar” values, JavaScript’s date values are <em>mutable —</em> <code>Date</code> is a constructor, invoking a constructor with <code>new</code> necessarily results in an object, and all objects are inherently mutable:</p>

<p>See what happened there? the variable <code>today</code> represents a reference to the object created by <code>new Date()</code>. When we provided <code>today</code> as an argument to the <code>addDay</code> function, the parameter <code>theDate</code> now represents a copy of the reference value — not a copy of the value, but a second reference to the object that represents today’s date. When we manipulate that value to determine the date of the following day, we’re manipulating the mutable object in memory, not an immutable copy — today becomes tomorrow, the falcon has a hard time hearing the falconer, the center starts to look a little iffy vis-a-vis “holding,” and so on.</p>
<p>Now, by this point you can probably tell that I’m not here to praise <code>Date</code>, but what you might not expect is that I’m here to <em>bury</em> it. That’s right: <code>Date</code> is soon to be over, done, gone, as “deprecated” as any part of the web platform can be — which is to say, “around forever, but you shouldn’t use it anymore, if you can avoid it.” Soon we will — at long last — have an object that replaces <code>Date</code> wholesale: <code>Temporal</code>.</p>

<p>Well, we’re kind of at the mercy of the nature of the language, here: dates represent complex real-world values, complex data necessitates complex data structures, and for JavaScript, that means objects. The difference is in how we <em>interact</em> with these Temporal objects, as compared to instances of <code>Date</code>, and — as is so often the case — the magic is in the prototype chain:</p>

<p>Right away you’ll notice that there are a number of methods and properties devoted to accessing, formatting, and manipulating the details of the Temporal object we’re working with. No big surprises there — it means a little bit of a learning curve, sure, but nothing an occasional trip over to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal">MDN</a> couldn’t solve, and they all more-or-less do what they say on their respective tins. The big difference from working with <code>Date</code> is <em>how</em> they do so, at a fundamental level:</p>

</div>
<p>Notice how none of these transformations required us to manually spin up any new objects, <em>and</em> that the value of the object referenced by <code>nowTemporal</code> remains unchanged? Unlike <code>Date</code>,  the methods we use to interact with a Temporal object result in <em>new</em> Temporal objects, rather than requiring us to use them in the context of a new instance or to modify the instance we’re working with — which is how we’re able to chain the <code>add</code> and <code>subtract</code> methods together in <code>nowTemporal.add({ months: 1, days: 1 }).subtract({ years: 2 })</code>.</p>
<p>Sure, we’re still working with objects, and that means we’re working with mutable data structures that represent real-world values:</p>

<p>…But the value represented by that Temporal object isn’t meant to be changed during the normal course of interacting with it — even though the object is still essentially mutable, we’re not stuck using that object in ways that could alter what it means in terms of real-world dates and times. I’ll take it.</p>
<p>So, let’s revisit that janky little “today is X, tomorrow is Y” script we wrote using <code>Date</code> earlier. First, we’ll fix it by making sure we’re working with two discrete instances of <code>Date</code> rather than modifying the instance that represents today’s date:</p>

<p>Okay, fine. It gets the job done, just as it has since the day <code>Date</code> first bumbled its way onto the web. We’re not unwittingly altering the value of <code>today</code> since we’re spinning up a new instance of <code>Date</code> inside our <code>addDay</code> function — wordy, but it works, as it has for decades now. We add <code>1</code> to it, which we have to just kind of <em>know</em> means add one <em>day.</em> Then in our template literal we need to keep nudging JavaScript to give us the date in a format that doesn’t include the current time, as a string. It’s functional, but verbose.</p>
<p>Now, let’s redo it using <code>Temporal</code>:</p>

<p><em>So much better</em>. Leaner, meaner, and <em>way</em> less margin for error. We want today’s date without the time, and the object that results from invoking <code>plainDateISO</code> (and any new Temporal objects created from it) will retain that formatting <em>without</em> being coerced to a string. Formatting: <em>check</em>.</p>
<p>We want to output a value that represents today’s date plus one day, and we want to do so in a way where we are unmistakably saying “add one day to it” with no parsing guesswork: <em>check</em> and <em>check</em>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we don’t want to run the risk of having our original <code>today</code> object altered unintentionally — because the result of calling the <code>add</code> method will always be a new Temporal object: <em>check</em>.</p>
<p><code>Temporal</code> is going to be a <em>massive</em> improvement over <code>Date</code>, and I only say “going to be” because it still isn’t quite ready for prime-time usage. <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/">The draft specification for the proposed <code>Temporal</code> object</a> has reached stage three of the standardization process, meaning it is now officially “recommended for implementation” — not yet part of the standard that informs the ongoing development of JavaScript itself, but close enough that browsers can start tinkering with it. That means the results of that early experimentation may be used to further refine the specification, so nothing is set in stone just yet. Web standards are an iterative process, after all.</p>
<p>That’s where you and I come in. Now that <code>Temporal</code> has <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=Temporal">landed in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox</a> — and others, soon — it’s time for us to get in there and kick the tires a little bit. We may not have had any say in <code>Date</code>, but we get to experiment with <code>Temporal</code> before the final implementations land.</p>
<p>Soon, JavaScript will have sensible, modern date handling, and we’ll finally be able to cram <code>Date</code> way in the back of the junk drawer with the rubber bands, mismatched jar lids, mystery keys, and probably-half-empty AA batteries — still present, still an inexorable part of the web platform, but no longer our first, last, and only way of handling dates. And we only had to wait— well, hold on, let me just crunch the numbers real quick:</p>
<div>
  <astro-island uid="ZO0XPc" prefix="r9" component-url="/_astro/ConsoleLogger.67Rv-5VD.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BIGLHmRd.js" props="{&quot;instruction&quot;:[0],&quot;code&quot;:[0,&quot;\nconst today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();\nconst jsShipped = Temporal.PlainDate.from( \&quot;1995-12-04\&quot; );\nconst sinceDate = today.since( jsShipped, { largestUnit: 'year' });\n\nconsole.log( `${ sinceDate.years } years, ${ sinceDate.months } months, and ${ sinceDate.days } days.` );\n&quot;],&quot;language&quot;:[0,&quot;js&quot;],&quot;outputType&quot;:[0,&quot;log&quot;],&quot;consoleOutput&quot;:[0,&quot;\n30 years, 0 months, and 27 days.\n&quot;],&quot;showLineNumbers&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ConsoleLogger&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><p data-wrapper-type="inner"><h3>Try it out</h3></p><hr><div data-wrapper-type="inner"><pre tabindex="0"><code>const today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();
const jsShipped = Temporal.PlainDate.from( "1995-12-04" );
const sinceDate = today.since( jsShipped, { largestUnit: 'year' });

console.log( `${ sinceDate.years } years, ${ sinceDate.months } months, and ${ sinceDate.days } days.` );</code></pre></div></div><template data-astro-template="">
    
  </template><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
</div>
<p>Sure, the best time to replace <code>Date</code> would’ve been back in 1995, but hey: the second best time is <code>Temporal.Now</code>, right?</p>

                    <p>Good evening.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.</p>

<p>I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.</p>

<p>This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.</p>

<p>This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.</p>

<p>I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        
        <p>A few years ago, I wrote a blog post on <a href="https://www.npopov.com/2021/06/02/Design-issues-in-LLVM-IR.html">design issues in LLVM IR</a>. Since then, one of these issues has been fixed fully (opaque pointers migration), one has been mostly fixed (constant expression removal), and one is well on the way towards being fixed (ptradd migration).</p>

<p>This time I’m going to be more ambitious and not stop at three issues. Of course, not all of these issues are of equal importance, and how important they are depends on who you ask. In the interest of brevity, I will mostly just explain what the problem is, and not discuss what possible solutions would be.</p>

<p>Finally, I should probably point out that this is written from my perspective as the lead maintainer of the LLVM project: This is not a list of reasons to not use LLVM, it’s a list of opportunities to improve LLVM.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-issues">High level issues</h2>

<h3 id="review-capacity">Review capacity</h3>

<p>Unlike many other open-source projects, LLVM certainly <a href="https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/llvm-llvm-project">does not suffer</a> from a lack of contributors. There are <em>thousands</em> of contributors and the distribution is relatively flat (that is, it’s not the case that a small handful of people is responsible for the majority of contributions.)</p>

<p>What LLVM does suffer from is insufficient review capacity. There are a lot more people writing code than reviewing it. This is somewhat unsurprising, as code review requires more expertise than writing code, and may not provide immediate value<sup id="fnref:review_value" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:review_value" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to the person reviewing (or their employer).</p>

<p>Lack of review capacity makes for a bad contributor experience, and can also result in bad changes making their way into the codebase. The way this usually works out is that someone puts up a PR, then fails to get a qualified review for a long period of time, and then one of their coworkers (who is not a qualified reviewer for that area) ends up rubberstamping the PR.</p>

<p>A related problem is that LLVM has a somewhat peculiar contribution model where it’s the responsibility of the PR author to request reviewers. This is especially problematic for new contributors, who don’t know whom to request. Often relevant reviewers will become aware of the PR thanks to a label-based notification system, but this is not apparent from the UI, and it’s easy for PRs to fall through the cracks.</p>

<p>A potential improvement here would be a Rust-style <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/triagebot/pr-assignment.html">PR assignment system</a>.</p>

<h3 id="churn">Churn</h3>

<p>Both the LLVM C++ API and LLVM IR are not stable and undergo frequent changes. This is simultaneously a great strength and weakness of LLVM. It’s a strength because LLVM does not stagnate and is willing to address past mistakes even at significant cost. It’s a weakness because churn imposes costs on users of LLVM.</p>

<p>Frontends are <em>somewhat</em> insulated from this because they can use the largely stable C API. However, it does not cover everything, and most major frontends will have additional bindings that use the unstable C++ API.</p>

<p>Users that integrate with LLVM more tightly (for example downstream backends) don’t have that option, and have to keep up with all API changes.</p>

<p>This is part of LLVM’s general development philosophy, which I’ll express somewhat pointedly as “upstream or GTFO”. LLVM is liberally licensed and does not require you to contribute changes upstream. However, if you do not upstream your code, then it will also not factor into upstream decision-making.</p>

<p>This point is somewhat unlike the rest, in that I’m not sure it’s possible to make things “strictly better” here. It’s possible that LLVM’s current point on the stability scale is not optimal, but moving it somewhere else would come with significant externalities. Making major changes in LLVM is already extremely hard due to the sheer scale of the project, without adding additional stability constraints on top.</p>

<h3 id="build-time">Build time</h3>

<p>LLVM is a huge project. LLVM itself is &gt;2.5 million lines of C++ and the entire monorepo is something like 9 million. C++ is not exactly known for fast build times, and compiling all that code takes time. This is bearable if you either have fast hardware or access to a build farm, but trying to build LLVM on a low-spec laptop is not going to be fun.</p>

<p>An additional complication is building with debug info (which I always recommend against), in which case you’ll add the extra gotchas of slow link times, high risk of OOM and massive disk usage. There are ways to avoid that (using shared libs or dylib build, using split dwarf, using lld), but it takes some expertise.</p>

<p>Promising changes in this area are the <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-use-pre-compiled-headers-to-speed-up-llvm-build-by-1-5-2x/89345?u=nikic">use of pre-compiled headers</a> (which significantly improves build time), and changing to use a <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-link-llvm-dylib-should-default-to-on-on-posix-platforms/85908?u=nikic">dylib build by default</a> (which reduces disk usage and link time, esp. for debuginfo builds). Another is to <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-reducing-process-creation-overhead-in-llvm-regression-tests/88612?u=nikic">reduce test overhead</a> using daemonization (not strictly part of the “build time”, but relevant for the development cycle).</p>

<h3 id="ci-stability">CI stability</h3>

<p>LLVM CI consists of over 200 post-commit buildbots that test LLVM in lots of different configurations on lots of different hardware. Commits that turn a buildbot from green to red result in an email to the commit author.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this CI is never fully green, and flaky on top. This is in part due to flaky tests (typically in lldb or openmp), but can also be due to buildbot-specific issues. The end result is that it’s “normal” to get buildbot failure notifications for any given commit, even if it is perfectly harmless. This dilutes the signal, and makes it easier to miss the real failures.</p>

<p>The introduction of pre-merge testing on PRs did significantly improve the overall CI situation, but not the buildbot problem as such. I think we need to start taking flaky tests/buildbots more seriously before we can really make progress here.</p>

<p>Because someone is definitely going to mention how this <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html">is not rocket science</a>, and we just need to start using bors / merge queues to guarantee an always-green build: It’s a problem of scale. There are &gt;150 commits on a typical workday, which would be more than one commit every 10 minutes even if they were uniformly distributed. Many buildbots have multi-hour runs. This is hard to reconcile.<sup id="fnref:bors" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bors" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="end-to-end-testing">End-to-end testing</h3>

<p>In some respects, LLVM has very thorough test coverage. We’re quite pedantic about making sure that new optimizations have good coverage of both positive and negative tests. However, these tests are essentially unit tests for a single optimization pass or analysis.</p>

<p>We have only a small amount of coverage for the entire optimization pipeline (phase ordering tests), so optimizations sometimes regress due to pass interactions. Tests for the combination of the middle-end and backend pipelines are essentially nonexistent. There is likely room for improvement here, though it comes with tradeoffs.</p>

<p>However, what actually concerns me are end-to-end executable tests. LLVM’s test suite proper does not feature these at all. Executable tests are located in a separate <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite">llvm-test-suite</a> repo, which is typically not used during routine development, but run by buildbots. It contains a lot of different code ranging from benchmarks to unit tests.</p>

<p>However, llvm-test-suite has quite few tests (compared to LLVM lit tests) and does not comprehensively cover basic operations. Things like testing operations on different float formats, on integers of different sizes, vectors of different sizes and element types, etc.</p>

<p>In part this is because of limitations of testing through C/C++, which is very heterogeneous in type support (C compilers don’t like exposing types that don’t have a defined psABI for the target). But that’s no excuse to delegate this testing to Zig instead (which exposes everything, everywhere, and has the corresponding test coverage).</p>

<h3 id="backend-divergence">Backend divergence</h3>

<p>While LLVM’s middle-end is very unified, backend implementations are very heterogeneous, and there is a tendency to fix issues (usually performance, but sometimes even correctness) only for the backend you’re interested in.</p>

<p>This takes many forms, like implementing target-specific DAG combines instead of generic ones. Though my definite favorite is to introduce lots of target hooks for optimizations – not because the optimization is actually only beneficial for one target, but because the person introducing it just doesn’t want to deal with the fallout on other targets.</p>

<p>This is understandable – after all, they may lack the knowledge to evaluate a change for other targets, so it may require working with many other maintainers, which can slow progress a lot. But the end result is still increasing divergence and duplication.</p>

<p>Lack of end-to-end testing compounds this issue, because that would act as something of a forcing function that at least all operations compile without crashing and produce correct results for all tested targets.</p>

<h3 id="compilation-time">Compilation time</h3>

<p>Because I’ve <a href="https://www.npopov.com/2020/05/10/Make-LLVM-fast-again.html">complained</a> about this enough in the past, I’ll keep it short: LLVM is slow, which is an issue both for JIT use cases, and anything that tends to produce huge amounts of IR (like Rust or C++).</p>

<p>Since I’ve started <a href="https://llvm-compile-time-tracker.com/">tracking compile-times</a>, the situation has significantly improved, both through targeted improvements and avoidance of regressions. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement: LLVM still isn’t fast, it’s just less slow.</p>

<p>One thing that LLVM is particularly bad at are <code>-O0</code> compile-times. The architecture is optimized for optimization, and lots of costs remain even if no optimization takes place. The <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/tpde-llvm-10-20x-faster-llvm-o0-back-end/86664?u=nikic">LLVM TPDE</a> alternative backend shows that it’s possible to do better by an order of magnitude.</p>

<h3 id="performance-tracking">Performance tracking</h3>

<p>The flip side of the compile-time coin is runtime performance. This is something that LLVM obviously cares a lot about. Which is why I find it rather surprising that LLVM does not have any “official” performance tracking infrastructure.</p>

<p>Of course, there are lots of organizations which track performance of LLVM downstream, on their own workloads. In some ways this is good, because it means there is more focus on real-world workloads than on synthetic benchmarks like SPEC. However, not having readily accessible, public performance tracking also makes it hard for contributors to evaluate changes.</p>

<p>To be fair, LLVM does have an <a href="https://lnt.llvm.org/">LNT</a> instance, but a) it’s currently broken, b) LNT is one of the worst UX crimes ever committed, c) little data gets submitted there, and d) it’s not possible to request a test run for a PR, or something like that.</p>

<p>This point is frankly just baffling to me. I don’t personally care about SPEC scores, but I know plenty of people do, so why there is no first-class tracking for this is a mystery to me.</p>

<h2 id="ir-design">IR design</h2>

<h3 id="undef-values">Undef values</h3>

<p><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehavior.html#undef-values">Undef values</a> take an arbitrary value from a certain set. They are used to model uninitialized values, and have historically been used to model deferred undefined behavior. The latter role has been replaced by poison values, which have much simpler propagation rules and are more amenable to optimization. However, undef is still used for uninitialized memory to this day.</p>

<p>There are two main problems with undef values. The first is the multi-use problem: An undef value can take a different value at each use. This means that transforms that increase the use count are generally invalid, and care has to be taken when optimizing based on value equality. The mere existence of undef values prevents us from performing optimizations we want to do, or greatly increases their complexity.</p>

<p>The second issue is that undef is very hard to reason about. Humans have trouble understanding it, and for proof-checkers it is computationally expensive.</p>

<p>Most likely, uninitialized memory will be represented using poison values instead in the future, but this runs into the problem that LLVM currently is not capable of correctly treating poison in memory. Proper support for poison in memory requires additional IR features, like the <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-29-gsoc-byte-type/">byte type</a>.</p>

<h3 id="unsoundness-and-specification-incompleteness">Unsoundness and specification incompleteness</h3>

<p>While most miscompilations (that is, correctness bugs) in LLVM are resolved quickly, there are quite a few that remain unfixed despite having been known for a long time. These issues usually combine the qualities of being largely theoretical (that is, appearing only in artificially constructed examples rather than real-world code) and running up against issues in LLVM’s IR design.</p>

<p>Some of them are cases where we have a good idea of how the IR design needs to change to address the issue, but these changes are complex and often require a lot of work to recover optimization parity. There is often a complexity cliff where you can do something that’s simple and <em>nearly</em> correct, or you can do something very complex that is fully correct.</p>

<p>Then there are other cases, where just deciding on how things <em>should</em> work is a hard problem. The provenance model is a prime example of this. The interaction of provenance with integer casts and type punning is a difficult problem with complex tradeoffs.</p>

<p>However, at some point these issues do need to be resolved. The recently formed <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-forming-a-working-group-on-formal-specification-for-llvm/89056?u=nikic">formal specification working group</a> aims to tackle these problems.</p>

<h3 id="constraint-encoding">Constraint encoding</h3>

<p>A key challenge for optimizing compilers is encoding of constraints (like “this value is non-negative” or “this add will not overflow”). This includes both frontend-provided constraints (based on language undefined behavior rules), but also compiler-generated ones.</p>

<p>In particular, there are many different analyses that can infer facts about the program, but keeping these up-to-date throughout optimization is challenging. One good way to handle this is to encode facts directly in the IR. Correctly updating or discarding these annotations then becomes part of transform correctness.</p>

<p>LLVM has many different ways to encode additional constraints (poison flags, metadata, attributes, assumes), and these all come with tradeoffs in terms of how much information can be encoded, how reliably it is retained during optimization and to what degree it can <em>negatively</em> affect optimization. Information from metadata is lost too often, while information from assumes is not lost often enough.</p>

<h3 id="floating-point-semantics">Floating-point semantics</h3>

<p>There are various issues with floating-point (FP) semantics once we move outside the nice world of “strictly conforming IEEE 754 floats in the default environment”. A few that come to mind are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling of signaling NaN and FP exceptions, and non-default FP environment in general. LLVM represents this using constrained FP intrinsics. This is not ideal, as all the FP handling is split into two parallel universes.</li>
  <li>Handling of denormals. LLVM has a function attribute to not assume IEEE denormal behavior, but this is only suitable for cases where flush to zero (FTZ) is used globally. It does not help with modeling cases like ARM, where scalar ops are IEEE, while vector ops use FTZ.</li>
  <li>Handling of excess precision, in particular when using the x87 FPU.</li>
</ul>

<!--### Type-based representation

This is something I've written about enough in the past, so I'll keep it brief: For historical reasons, LLVM IR encodes unnecessary type information that no longer carries any semantic meaning in various places. The biggest offender here were pointer element types, which were removed by the [opaque pointers migration][opaque_pointers].-->

<h2 id="other-technical-issues">Other technical issues</h2>

<h3 id="partial-migrations">Partial migrations</h3>

<p>LLVM is a very large project, and making any significant changes to it is hard and time consuming. Migrations often span years, where two different implementations of something coexist, until all code has been migrated. The two prime examples of this are:</p>

<p><strong>New pass manager:</strong> The “new” pass manager was first introduced more than a decade ago. Then about five years ago, we started using it for the middle-end optimization pipeline by default, and support for the legacy PM was dropped.</p>

<p>However, the back-end is still using the legacy pass manager. There is ongoing work to support the new pass manager in codegen, and we’re pretty close to the point where it can be used end-to-end for a single target. However, I expect it will still take quite a while for all targets to be ported and the legacy pass manager to be completely retired.</p>

<p><strong>GlobalISel:</strong> This is an even more extreme case. GlobalISel is the “new” instruction selector that is intended to replace SelectionDAG (and FastISel). It was introduced approximately one decade ago, and to this day, none of the targets that originally used SelectionDAG have been fully migrated to GlobalISel. There is one new target that’s GlobalISel-only, and there is one that uses GlobalISel by default for unoptimized builds. But otherwise, SelectionDAG is still the default everywhere.</p>

<p>There are two backends (AMDGPU and AArch64) that have somewhat complete GlobalISel support, but it’s not clear when/if they’ll be able to switch to using it by default. A big problem here is that new optimizations are continually being implemented on the SDAG side, so it’s hard to keep parity.</p>

<h3 id="abi--calling-convention-handling">ABI / calling convention handling</h3>

<p>Essentially everything about the handling of calling conventions in LLVM is a mess.</p>

<p>The responsibility for handling calling conventions is split between the frontend and the backend. There are good reasons why LLVM can’t do this by itself (LLVM IR sits at a too low level of abstraction to satisfy the extremely arcane ABI rules).</p>

<p>This is not a problem in itself – however, there is zero documentation of what the calling convention contract between the frontend and LLVM is, and the proper way to implement C FFI is essentially to look at what Clang does and copy that (invariably with errors, because the rules can be very subtle).</p>

<p>I’ve proposed to fix this by introducing an <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-an-abi-lowering-library-for-llvm/84495?u=nikic">ABI lowering library</a> and vortex73 has <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-25-abi-library/">implemented a prototype</a> for it as part of GSoC. So we’re well on the way to resolving this side of the problem.</p>

<p>There are more problems though. One that Rust has struggled with a lot is the interaction of target features with the calling convention. Enabling additional target features can change the call ABI, because additional float/vector registers start getting used for argument/return passing. This means that calls between functions with a feature enabled and disabled may be incompatible, because they assume different ABIs.</p>

<p>Ideally, ABI and target features would be orthogonal, and only coupled in that some ABIs require certain target features (e.g. you can’t have a hard float ABI without enabling FP registers). Target features are a per-function choice, while the ABI should be per-module.</p>

<p>Some of the newer architectures like Loongarch and RISC-V actually have proper ABI design, but most of the older ones don’t. For example, it’s currently not possible to target AArch64 with a soft float ABI but hard float implementation.</p>

<h3 id="builtins--libcalls">Builtins / libcalls</h3>

<p>Somewhat related to this is the handling of compiler builtins/libcalls, which are auxiliary functions that the compiler may emit for operations that are not natively supported by the target. This covers both libcalls provided by libc (or libm), and builtins provided by compiler runtime libraries like libgcc, compiler-rt or compiler-builtins.</p>

<p>There are two sources of truth for this, TargetLibraryInfo (TLI) and RuntimeLibcalls. The former is used by the middle-end, primarily to recognize and optimize C library calls (this mostly covers only libc, but not libgcc). The latter is used by the backend, primarily to determine which libcalls may be emitted by the compiler and how they are spelled (this covers libgcc, and the subset of libc covered by LLVM intrinsics).</p>

<p>A problem with RuntimeLibcalls is that it currently largely works off only the target triple, which means that we have to make “lowest common denominator” assumptions about which libcalls are available, where the lowest common denominator is usually libgcc. If <code>--rtlib=compiler-rt</code> is used, LLVM does not actually know about that, and cannot make use of functions that are in compiler-rt but not libgcc.</p>

<p>This also means that we’re missing a customization point for other runtime libraries. For example, there is no way for Rust to say that it provides f128 suffix libcalls via compiler-builtins, overriding target-specific naming and availability assumptions based on which type <code>long double</code> in C maps to.</p>

<p>There is a lot of ongoing work in this area (by arsenm), so the situation here will hopefully improve in the near-ish future.</p>

<h3 id="context--module-dichotomy">Context / module dichotomy</h3>

<p>LLVM has two high-level data holders. A module corresponds to a compilation unit (e.g. pre-LTO, a single file in C/C++). The LLVM context holds various “global” data. There’s usually one context per thread, and multiple modules can (in principle) use a single context.</p>

<p>Things like functions and globals go into the module, while constants and types go into the context. The module also contains a data layout, which provides important type layout information like “how wide is a pointer”.</p>

<p>The fact that constants and types do not have access to the data layout is a constant source of friction. If you have a type, you cannot reliably tell its size without threading an extra parameter through everything. We have subsystems (like ConstantFold vs. ConstantFolding) that are separated entirely by whether data layout is available or not.</p>

<p>At the same time, I feel like this split is not actually buying us a lot. Having shared types and constants is somewhat convenient when it comes to module linking, because they can be directly shared, but I think performing explicit remapping in that one place would be better than having complexity everywhere else. Additionally, this would also allow cross-context linking, which is currently only possible by going through a bitcode roundtrip. In theory, the context could also allow some memory reuse when compiling multiple modules, but I think in practice there is usually a one-to-one correspondence between those.</p>

<h3 id="licm-register-pressure">LICM register pressure</h3>

<p>This is getting a bit down in the weeds, but I’ll mention it anyway due to how often I’ve run across this in recent times.</p>

<p>LLVM considers loop invariant code motion (LICM) to be a canonicalization transform. This means that we always hoist instructions out of loops, without any target specific cost modelling. However, LICM can increase the live ranges of values, which can increase register pressure, which can lead to a large amount of spills and reloads.</p>

<p>The general philosophy behind this is that LICM hoists everything, all middle-end transforms can work with nicely loop invariant instructions, and then instructions will get sunk back into the loop by the backend, which can precisely model register pressure.</p>

<p>Except… that second part doesn’t actually happen. I believe that (for non-PGO builds) instructions only get sunk back into loops either through rematerialization in the register allocator, or specialized sinking (typically of addressing modes), but for anything not falling into those buckets, no attempt to sink into loops in order to reduce register pressure is made.</p>

<h2 id="other">Other</h2>

<p>This list is not exhaustive. There’s more I could mention, but we’d get into increasingly narrow territory. I hope I covered most of the more important things – please do let me know what I missed!</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Zen C</strong> is a modern systems programming language that compiles to human-readable <code>GNU C</code>/<code>C11</code>. It provides a rich feature set including type inference, pattern matching, generics, traits, async/await, and manual memory management with RAII capabilities, all while maintaining 100% C ABI compatibility.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy">https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46587536">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>When Americans begin taking appetite-suppressing drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, the changes extend well beyond the bathroom scale. According to new research, the medications are associated with meaningful reductions in how much households spend on food, both at the grocery store and at restaurants.</span></p><p><span>The study,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222437251412834"><span>published Dec. 18</span></a><span> in the&nbsp;Journal of Marketing Research, links survey data on GLP-1 receptor agonist use – a class of drugs originally developed for diabetes and now widely prescribed for weight loss – with detailed transaction records from tens of thousands of U.S. households. The result is one of the most comprehensive looks yet at how GLP-1 adoption is associated with changes in everyday food purchasing in the real world.</span></p><p><span>The headline finding is striking: Within six months of starting a GLP-1 medication, households reduce grocery spending by an average of 5.3%. Among higher-income households, the drop is even steeper, at more than 8%. Spending at fast-food restaurants, coffee shops and other limited-service eateries falls by about 8%.</span></p><p><span>Among households who continue using the medication, lower food spending persists at least a year, though the magnitude of the reduction becomes smaller over time, say co-authors, assistant professor&nbsp;</span><a href="https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/sh2596/"><span>Sylvia Hristakeva</span></a><span> and professor&nbsp;</span><a href="https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jl2545/"><span>Jura Liaukonyte</span></a><span>,&nbsp;both in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management in the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The data show clear changes in food spending following adoption,” Hristakeva said. “After discontinuation, the effects become smaller and harder to distinguish from pre-adoption spending patterns.”</span></p><p><span>Unlike previous studies that relied on self-reported eating habits, the new analysis draws on purchase data collected by Numerator, a market research firm that tracks grocery and restaurant transactions for a nationally representative panel of about 150,000 households. The researchers matched those records with repeated surveys asking whether household members were taking GLP-1 drugs, when they started and why.</span></p><p><span>That combination allowed the team to compare adopters with similar households that did not use the drugs, isolating changes that occurred after medication began.</span></p><p><span>The reductions were not evenly distributed across the grocery store.</span></p><p><span>Ultra-processed, calorie-dense foods – the kinds most closely associated with cravings – saw the sharpest declines. Spending on savory snacks dropped by about 10%, with similarly large decreases in sweets, baked goods and cookies. Even staples like bread, meat and eggs declined.</span></p><p><span>Only a handful of categories showed increases. Yogurt rose the most, followed by fresh fruit, nutrition bars and meat snacks.</span></p><p><span>“The main pattern is a reduction in overall food purchases. Only a small number of categories show increases, and those increases are modest relative to the overall decline,” Hristakeva said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The effects extended beyond the supermarket. Spending at limited-service restaurants such as fast-food chains and coffee shops fell sharply as well.</span></p><p><span>The study also sheds light on who is taking GLP-1 medications. The share of U.S. households reporting at least one user rose from about 11% in late 2023 to more than 16% by mid-2024. Weight-loss users skew younger and wealthier, while those taking the drugs for diabetes are older and more evenly distributed across income groups.</span></p><p><span>Notably, about one-third of users stopped taking the medication during the study period. When they did, their food spending reverted to pre-adoption levels – and their grocery baskets became slightly less healthy than before they started, driven in part by increased spending on categories such as candy and chocolate.</span></p><p><span>That movement underscores an important limitation, the authors caution. The study cannot fully separate the biological effects of the drugs from other lifestyle changes users may make at the same time. However, evidence from clinical trials, combined with the observed reversion in spending after discontinuation, suggests appetite suppression is likely a key mechanism behind the spending changes.</span></p><p><span>The findings carry implications far beyond individual households.</span></p><p><span>For food manufacturers, restaurants and retailers, widespread GLP-1 adoption could mean long-term shifts in demand, particularly for snack foods and fast food. Package sizes, product formulations and marketing strategies may need to change. For policymakers and public-health experts, the results add context to ongoing debates about the role of medical treatments in shaping dietary behavior – and whether biologically driven appetite changes succeed where taxes and labels have struggled.</span></p><p><span>“At current adoption rates, even relatively modest changes at the household level can have meaningful aggregate effects,” Hristakeva said. “Understanding these demand shifts is therefore important for assessing food markets and consumer spending.”&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="building-it">Building it</h2>
<p>I think we’ve all been there, <strong>your build fails in Actions, but the script works fine locally.</strong> You now settle into a slow loop of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Push speculative change</li>
<li>See if it worked</li>
</ol>
<p>It was in the middle of one of these when I started thinking about how to make it better.</p>
<p>A Terminal would be great, that’s obvious, but how to make it happen? How could I make it free, and open to anyone, without costing me lots of money?</p>
<p>Operating a service that forward traffic between a user and the Actions VM would stack up data transfer costs and take some work to scale.</p>
<p>What about a Peer-to-Peer connection? I’d recently been going deeper on how <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works">Tailscale</a>, <a href="https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh">iroh</a> and <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> use <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works">UDP Hole Punching to create Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connections</a> between nodes without relaying traffic. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>If that worked then my server would only need to exchange a tiny bit of information per session and hopefully cost me very little 🤞</p>
<p>Could I use P2P and funnel a terminal session over it? Well the Actions VM is on the internet and allows UDP outbound, so it should work!</p>
<p>A simple bit of scripting proved it did 🥳 With WebRTC, if the Actions VM and my local machine exchange information about their connectivity (<a href="https://webrtc.org/getting-started/peer-connections#ice_candidates">ICE Candidates</a>), then I could form a connection.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="security-and-identities">Security and Identities</h2>
<p>The next problem is, <strong>how do you prove each end of the P2P connection is who they say they are?</strong></p>
<p>It’s important. I want to ensure that <code>lawrencegripper</code> can only access terminals for Actions triggered by <code>lawrencegripper</code>.</p>
<p>The browser side is relatively easy, we can use OAuth to login via GitHub and get a verified username ✅</p>
<p>On the Actions VM <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/openid-connect">we have OIDC</a>, commonly used to auth from Actions to cloud providers.</p>
<p>Anyone can use it though, it gives us the ability to issue a signed OIDC token from within our Action which proves:</p>
<ol>
<li>The repo it’s running on</li>
<li>The user account that triggered it</li>
<li>The audience it is intended for</li>
</ol>
<p>To enable this feature you set the following permissions in the workflow</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>      </span><span>id-token</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>write</span></span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>You request a token via a REST request in the action, for example:</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span>    <span>const</span> <span>requestURL</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL</span><span>;</span>

</span></span><span><span>        <span>Authorization</span><span>:</span> <span>`Bearer </span><span>${</span><span>requestToken</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>'application/json'</span><span>,</span>

<h2 id="connecting-the-peers-ie-signaling-server">Connecting the Peers (ie. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity#signaling">Signaling Server</a>)</h2>
<p>At this point we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can create a connection between two peers (Actions VM &lt;-&gt; Users Browser) with WebRTC</li>
<li>We have a way to validate the identity of both ends of the connection (OAuth and OIDC)</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s left is the server to introduce the two peers 🤝 Let’s build a server to do that.</p>
<p>The server doesn’t need to handle the terminal data, that goes between the two peers directly, it’s only doing introductions.</p>
<p>When the VM and Browser are connected to the server it should send each one the connection details for the other.</p>
<p>To do this, the browser and the VM both create <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events">Server-sent events (SSE)</a> connections, allowing the signaling server to push events to them. They prove their identities by providing their OAuth credentials or OIDC to prove their identity.</p>
<p>The server then stores:</p>

<p>The server then, via SSE, sends the Actions VM connectivity details to the browser and the Browser’s connectivity details to the Actions VM.</p>
<p>At this point they establish the Peer-to-Peer connection 🥳</p>
<p>For bonus points, when a new Actions VM connects, I can see if a browser is open waiting and send them a notification.</p>

<p>Ok, we’re close now. We have the signaling server to exchange details and then the peers have a p2p connection.</p>
<p>What about creating a terminal and streaming the data?</p>
<p>WebRTC has a <code>datachannel</code> which you push arbitrary data through.</p>

<p>In the browser we then need to display an interactive terminal.</p>
<p>Reading around, I found the this awesome <a href="https://github.com/coder/ghostty-web">Ghostty library</a>. It has an xterm.js compatible implementation, I hooked this up and it worked first time 🥰</p>
<p>Well it did.. and it didn’t, the Terminal spawned via PTY doesn’t have any idea how big our terminal in the browser (Lines and Columns) so we get some horrible rendering in the terminal.</p>
<p>With a bit of poking, googling and some Opus 4.5, I created a method which estimates the size of terminal, via font sizing, and converts this to a rough column / rows. Then, on establishing the P2P connection I can send a <code>setup</code> JSON message which the Actions VM uses to start <code>pty.spawn</code> with the right sizing for the terminal.</p>

<p>There is a lot of trust placed in the signaling server. It has to do the right thing, or it could provide access to someone else’s Actions VM.</p>
<p>Let’s do better.</p>
<h2 id="trust-vs-zero-trust">Trust vs Zero-Trust</h2>
<p>I’ve mentioned already <strong>the signaling server should only connect up users with actions they’ve started</strong>.</p>
<p>That relies on explicit trust, from users, that I’m going to do the right thing.</p>
<p>What if I’ve got a bug? What if someone compromises the signaling server? What if they steal the domain and run their own server on it?</p>
<p>Well, then they could hook up peers that shouldn’t be connected and … do mean things.</p>
<p>That sounds bad, lets work out how to fix that.</p>
<p>What if the <code>user</code> provided the Actions VM with a secret, that only they know?</p>
<p>When the P2P connection is made, the Actions VM could refuse to talk to the browser until it provides the right secret.</p>
<p>Secrets are cool and everything but if they’re intercepted they’re reusable, could we use a One-Time-Password (OTP) commonly used for 2FA on sites? Sure thing! Even better tools like 1Password will autofill it for you.</p>
<p>What does this flow look like? Roughly it’s 👇</p>

<p>Even if the signaling server is manipulated, to hook up two peers which shouldn’t be connected, the user won’t be able to execute commands unless they can provide a valid OTP.</p>
<p>Better still the Signaling server (which I run) is never sent either the OTP or the OTP Secret used to validate each OTP.</p>
<p>This validation happens between two peers you own (Actions VM and your Browser).</p>
<h2 id="so-now-were-done">So now we’re done?</h2>
<p>One last thing… make the signaling server cheap to host.</p>
<p>I want to offer this for free for anyone to use. It’s a simple <code>go</code> binary in a docker image (to make it easy to self-hosting and test locally) but it needs to live on the internet.</p>
<p>A while ago I’d started poking at <a href="https://railway.com/">railway.com</a>, it’s cloud with a big billing twist, <strong>you only pay for the CPU and Memory you actually use</strong>. This felt like a great time to try it out.</p>
<p>How is the billing different, well…</p>
<ul>
<li>In Azure/AWS I have to say “I want 2 CPUs and 8GB” and I pay for that regardless of what I use.</li>
<li>On <a href="https://railway.com/">railway.com</a> I say “Use <strong>up to</strong> x CPUs and y GB” then you only pay for what the service actually consumes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In either Azure/AWS or Railway you still pay network egress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does this work out for the signaling server?</p>
<p><strong>Really well</strong> it’s peak memory usage so far is 20MB, racking up a mean $0.00000… you get the point. It’s not costing much, as I’m not reserving a small machine with GBs of mem to run a service needing 20MB</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gripdev.xyz/2026/01/10/actions-terminal-on-failure-for-debugging/memory-usage.png" alt="Graph showing 20mb of memory"></p>
<p>Even then it feels a bit wasteful running it all the time. There will be chunks of time when folks aren’t using it.</p>
<p>This was where I found a platform feature called <a href="https://docs.railway.com/reference/app-sleeping">sleeping</a>, it’s serverless but without the pain of moving away from the docker model to some proprietary runtime.</p>
<p>When the service isn’t doing anything, Railway spin down the service. If someone turns up, they hold the connection for a moment while restoring the container, then send the request through.</p>
<p>What does a cold start look like on our simple signalling server? It’s hardly recognizable.</p>
<p>Here is a recording, on the left you see the server is sleeping and on the right I hit the domain, there is a slight pause before the page renders ✨</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://archaeologist.dev/artifacts/anthropic">https://archaeologist.dev/artifacts/anthropic</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46586766">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anthropic may have just committed the biggest business blunder of 2026 -- and we're less than two weeks in. To understand why, let's briefly rewind to 2025, the year when agentic AI went mainstream.</p>
<p>On 3 February 2025, Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?s=20">coined the term "vibe coding"</a> to describe the new paradigm.</p>
<p>Less than three weeks later, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">released the first research preview of Claude Code</a>, bringing large language models directly into developers' native habitat: the terminal.</p>
<p>OpenAI <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/">followed with Codex CLI</a> in April, and Google released <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/">Gemini CLI</a> in June.</p>
<p>All of these terminal-based coding agents follow the same principle:</p>
<ol>
<li>you type a prompt</li>
<li>the agent sends it to a large language model</li>
<li>the LLM responds and may instruct the agent to carry out actions like editing files or running commands</li>
<li>the agent carries out the actions and appends the results to the prompt</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are repeated in a loop, but with a twist: the agent can continue working through the loop until the LLM decides that it requires user input.</p>
<p>The principle is so simple that it immediately gave rise to a bunch of alternative coding agents, including OpenCode, Roo, and Amp Code (to name but a few).
Each brought its own unique philosophy and approach to the table, but what they all have in common is that they ultimately rely on large language models for intelligence.
Their job is purely to collect user input, execute tool calls, and pass those to the model, over and over again.
Therefore, they tend to provide a way to select from a predefined set of models and a means of authenticating with the relevant providers (such as Anthropic or OpenAI),
generally using an API key.</p>
<p>When Claude Code launched for real in June 2025, usage of the Anthropic models was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anthropics-popular-claude-code-ai-tool-now-included-with-its-20month-pro-plan/">included</a> in the Pro and Max plans, for a flat monthly or annual subscription.
These plans quickly became very popular when users realised that the effective cost per token was much lower compared to Anthropic's API pricing.
So popular, in fact, that it <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone">reached $1 billion in annualised revenue</a> after only six months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OpenCode rapidly gained popularity, <a href="http://archive.today/OftjM">amassing</a> over 50,000 GitHub stars and more than 650,000 monthly active users in the same short timeframe.
One of its key selling points was the ability to "Log in with Anthropic to use your Claude Pro or Max account", thus enabling developers to benefit from the attractive Claude subscription pricing.
In contrast, other coding agents such as Amp only provided the ability to connect to Claude models via the much more expensive pay-per-token API.</p>
<p>It turns out that logging into third-party coding agents with an Anthropic OAuth token was a bit of a loophole. This was evident from the fact that it would only work if the client-supplied system prompt contained a specific phrase <a href="https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/417">identifying itself as Claude Code</a>. Nevertheless, many (presumably) unsuspecting Anthropic customers used OpenCode in this way; from their perspective, they were simply using the same service that they were already paying for, just in the comfort of their preferred coding harness.</p>
<p>However, Anthropic clearly didn't see it this way. On 9 January 2026, Anthropic unceremoniously closed the loophole, changing their API to detect and reject requests from third-party clients. The renowned vibe-coder Peter Steinberger soon <a href="https://x.com/steipete">posted</a> about it on the website formerly known as Twitter, and disgruntled Anthropic customers <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17118">expressed their discontent</a> in a GitHub issue, requesting the decision to be reversed, many threatening to cancel their Claude subscription otherwise.</p>
<p>It's notable that Anthropic has not formally announced this change in ToS enforcement, neither ahead of time nor after the fact. The only quasi-announcement of this change was <a href="https://x.com/trq212/status/2009689809875591565">this thread</a>, posted by an Anthropic employee on their personal account the day after the changes took effect, presumably in response to customer complaints. The stated motivation for the change was the allegation that "third-party harnesses using Claude subscriptions create problems for users and generate unusual traffic patterns [...] making it really hard for us to help debug when they have questions about rate limit usage or account bans and they don’t have any other avenue for this support."</p>
<p>I will leave it to the reader to decide for themselves whether they consider this a credible explanation or not; frankly, it doesn't matter. The truth is that Anthropic is free to put whatever they want into their ToS, and customers have to abide by it or leave. It appears quite a few have opted for the latter. However, what does matter is what Anthropic has implicitly revealed through its actions last Friday:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anthropic is willing to go to war with their paying customers over a trivial ToS violation, and</li>
<li>they really, really want to own the entire value chain rather than being relegated to becoming just another "model provider", and</li>
<li>they utterly failed to consider the second-order effects of this business decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point has received ample discussion already, so I want to focus on the second and third points.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/07/ai-anthropic-funding-valuation">reported</a> just a few days earlier that Anthropic has signed a term sheet to raise $10bn at a humongous $350bn valuation. Related or not, the incentives are clear. Model-agnostic harnesses such as OpenCode present a real threat to Anthropic. Whilst its models are incredibly popular in the software developer community and it has made big inroads in enterprise LLM usage, the Claude chatbot itself reportedly commands a market share of... wait for it... <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ai-chatbot-market-share">1.07%</a>. So it's no surprise that they are trying to avoid being commoditized in their core market.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the final point: without anticipating it, Anthropic just found itself in a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a> with OpenAI -- and OpenAI just <a href="https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/2009742187484065881?s=20">defected</a>. Not only are they officially supporting OpenCode users to use their Codex subscriptions and usage limits in OpenCode, they are <a href="https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/2010064438033104966">extending the same support</a> to other open-source coding harnesses such as OpenHands, RooCode, and Pi. And it's not just a theoretical announcement either: support for connecting ChatGPT Pro/Plus subscriptions with OpenCode has already <a href="https://x.com/thdxr/status/2009803906461905202?s=20">shipped</a>.</p>
<p>What are we to take away from all this?</p>
<p>For me personally, I have decided I will never be an Anthropic customer, because I refuse to do business with a company that takes its customers for granted. Beyond my personal choices, though, I predict that the folks at Anthropic will come to regret their actions last week. By cracking down on their own customers in a vain attempt to quash healthy competition, they have destroyed a lot of goodwill and <a href="https://x.com/archeologistdev/status/2009763760748278110?s=20">gave their main rival an opening that was ripe for the picking</a>. Whilst they have plenty of cash in the bank for now, they will eventually need to learn to treat their customers with respect if they are to survive in the ever-more-competitive LLM provider landscape.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img src="https://cdn.lightpanda.io/website/assets/images/blog/authors/karl_seguin.png" alt="Karl Seguin"></p><div><h3>Karl Seguin</h3><h4>Software Engineer</h4></div></div><figure><img src="https://cdn.lightpanda.io/website/assets/images/blog/posts/migrating-our-dom-to-zig/migratingdomtozig_large.png" alt="Migrating our DOM to Zig"></figure><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>We replaced LibDOM with our own Zig-based DOM implementation. The original design created friction between V8, our Zig layer, and LibDOM, especially around events, Custom Elements, and ShadowDOM. After six months of spare-time prototyping, we built zigdom: a leaner, more cohesive DOM that gives us full control over memory, events, and future enhancements. We also swapped in html5ever for parsing and added V8 snapshots to cut startup time. There are single-digit % performance gains, but the real win is a unified codebase that’s easier to extend.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-replaced-libdom">Why We Replaced LibDOM<a href="#why-we-replaced-libdom" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>At a high level, the Lightpanda codebase can be described as a Zig layer sitting between V8 and LibDOM. When JavaScript is executed, like , V8 calls into the Zig layer which then forwards the request to the underlying LibDOM document object and then forwards the result back to V8. By using LibDOM, we gained a robust and fairly comprehensive DOM implementation with minimal effort.</p>
<p>However, as we worked to increase compatibility with websites in the wild, we felt ever-increasing friction between our three layers. One example is the event system baked into LibDOM. This proved awkward to expand beyond DOM-based events (e.g. input events) or even just bubbling DOM events to our Zig-based Window implementation. Another larger challenge, was integrating support for Custom Elements and ShadowDOM, written in Zig, with LibDOM. Finally, there was some concern about the lack of cohesion with respect to things like memory management and how that would impact potential future changes, like better multi-threading support.</p>
<p>If we were to restart the integration from scratch, knowing what we know now, we’d probably be able to avoid most of the friction we’re currently seeing. While we do modify LibDOM as needed, one approach would be to integrate V8 and LibDOM directly, applying fixes and additions directly to LibDOM. But as we wrote before, we’re <a href="https://lightpanda.io/blog/posts/why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fans of Zig<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> so the discussions and prototypes we built always leaned towards replacing LibDOM with a custom Zig implementation.</p>
<h3 id="zigdom">zigdom<a href="#zigdom" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Work on a prototype for having a Zig-based DOM started roughly six months ago. This was a casual in-our-spare-time effort. In the spirit of experimentation, this prototype also replaced V8 with <a href="https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">QuickJS-NG<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>. By mid-November, we felt the prototype had tackled enough unknowns to start integrating it into Lightpanda (with V8). Thankfully, porting features was relatively simple; commits to the  branch could usually be ported to the  branch.</p>
<p>The design is straightforward. A  has a linked list of children and an optional . Furthermore, a  has a  tagged union field to represent the type of node, and a  field to capture its supertype:</p>

<p>Since a modern website can have tens of thousands of nodes and thousands of elements, we obviously care about the size of our ,  and . That’s why every type in our union is a pointer. That means that when we create a div, we need to allocate the Div, HTMLElement, Element, Node and EventTarget. But rather than doing five separate allocations, we do 1 large allocation for the total size and parcel it out.</p>
<p>Another area where we’ve been able to optimize for our use-case is to lazily parse/load certain properties. While a website might have thousands of elements, most JavaScript will only access the classes, styles, relLists, dataset, etc, of a few elements. Rather than having these stored on each element, even as empty lazily loaded containers, they’re attached to a page in an element -&gt; property lookup. While this adds lookup overhead, it removes ~6 pointers from every element.</p>
<p>The real win is having a more cohesive design for events, custom elements and ShadowDOM and a simpler foundation for future enhancements. That said, performance, both in terms of memory usage and CPU load are slightly improved (both single digit % improvements).</p>
<h3 id="html5ever">html5ever<a href="#html5ever" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>We saw benefits to writing our own DOM implementation, but not our own HTML parser. For that, we turned to <a href="https://servo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">servo’s<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> <a href="https://github.com/servo/html5ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">html5ever<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> written in Rust. I almost forgot to mention it in this post because the experience was so painless and worked from the get-go that I haven’t had to think about it for a while. You setup html5ever with a bunch of callbacks (for creating a node, attaching a node to a parent, creating text, etc.), feed it your HTML, and away you go. My Rust is very bad, but writing a C binding for it was manageable.</p>
<h3 id="bonus---v8-snapshot">Bonus - V8 Snapshot<a href="#bonus---v8-snapshot" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Some of the porting was tedious. For a change of pace, I took time to see how we could leverage V8 snapshots. As a short summary, whenever you create a V8 environment to execute code, you have to do a lot of setup. Every type (hundreds) with all the functions and properties need to be registered with the V8 environment. For a simple page, this can represent anywhere from 10-30% of the total time. V8 snapshots let you setup a pseudo-environment upfront, extract a Snapshot (a binary blob), and use that blob to bootstrap and speedup future environments.</p>
<p>When in debug mode, we generated the snapshot on startup. In release mode, the snapshot is generated at compile-time and embedded into the binary, reducing startup time and memory. The overall impact depends on the relative cost of setting up the environment vs processing the page. Complex websites that load hundreds of external scripts probably won’t benefit. But incremental improvements hopefully add up and, if nothing else, help balance the performance cost of new features and complexity.</p>
<h3 id="ai-coding-agent">AI Coding Agent<a href="#ai-coding-agent" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>This was the first large feature that I developed with the aid of an AI coding agent - specifically Claude. The experience was positive, but not flawless. I’ve personally always liked participating in code reviews / PRs. I can spend hours every day reviewing PRs, so working with Claude is kind of fun for me. If reading code isn’t something you consider fun, it could be a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>I was almost always impressed with the quality of code written and “understanding” that Claude exhibited. I’m only guessing here, but I have to imagine that building a DOM, something which has a very explicit specification, tons of documentation and many implementations, was an ideal task for a coding agent.</p>
<p>That said, I do think this is first and foremost a code-review exercise, and the Claude CLI is lacking in that respect. When you’re trying to understand and think through a change, you need a comfortable interface that lets you navigate and access whatever context you’re missing. Anything more than a few lines becomes challenging to review, especially as it’s presented for you to accept one piece at a time.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s a tool that supplements my own abilities.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next<a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Implementing our own DOM from scratch should make it easier for us to add new features and enhancements. Something we’ve already seen with better custom element and ShadowRoot support. Much of the benefits don’t come directly from implementing a new DOM, but by simply having a more cohesive codebase. For us, expanding our usage of Zig made the most sense.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>I have not been shy talking about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/tag/xfce/">my love</a> of <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> over the years here. The desktop environment has been a trusted friend ever since I first loved it on the late Cobind Desktop (still the high water mark of desktop Linux, as far as I’m concerned).</p>
<p>I’m glad to see I’m not the only one. David Gerard of <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">Pivot to AI</a> fame recently shared <a href="https://reddragdiva.dreamwidth.org/582674.html">this post he wrote in 2012</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question with minimal desktops is the fine line between as simple as possible and just a bit too simple. How much basic stuff do you have to add back? 4.8 took it slightly far, 4.10 is almost Just Right. XFCE is so far a case study in Not Fucking It Up; I hope they never go to version 5, and just update 4 forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>This (a) longevity and (2) getting the balance right cannot be overstated. Here’s my current Xfce desktop, for example:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2026/xfce2008@1x.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2026/xfce2008@2x.jpg 2x"></p></figure>
<p>Except, <strong>no it isn’t</strong>. That’s a screenshot of my <a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1185/" title="Fun with Xfce, part one">FreeBSD desktop from 2008</a>, with the bright and clear Tango Iconset (speaking of high-water marks). Remember when iconography was discernable at a glance? Aka, functional as icons? But I digress.</p>
<p>Xfce in 2025 (no, 2026, damn it!) is just as easy to understand, light, and fast as it first was booting Cobind on my <a href="http://retro.rubenerd.com/brio.htm">HP Brio</a> when I was in school, or when building it from source in FreeBSD ports. Though unlike a barebones window manager or other “light” DEs, Xfce feels usable, feature complete, and designed by someone who understands why people use desktop computers (cough GNOME).</p>
<p>I do use KDE on my primary desktop. Version 4 was a mess, but they’ve made <em>massive</em> improvements, especially within the last year. I’m not sure how much this had to do with the Steam Deck, and a new generation of people realising that… wait… I can run stuff on this box other than games? There’s a desktop here!? But my laptops all run Xfce, and I’m half-tempted to move back to it on the desktop.</p>
<p>I’m with David here. I hope they never feel the need to “innovate” with “disruption” for “UX”. The switch to the Thunar file manager was the last major user-facing change I can remember, and it was great.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting we reached peak UI with Xfce, but no desktop since has made a compelling case (for me) for its replacement. I love, <em>love</em>, <strong>love</strong> that Xfce is maintained this way in spite of all the industry pressures to turn it into something else.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>I stopped writing posts like this for years, out of fear of how people from specific desktop environments would respond. If you’re about to write me an angry screed, know that I will immediately delete it and block you, <a href="https://rubenerd.com/people-who-need-to-run-windows/" title="A thread about people who need to run Windows">just as I did last time</a>. Both yours and my time are better spent.</p>
<p>I also know (sigh) this disclaimer will be ignored, so I’m questioning why I’m even bothering. Maybe I’m a sucker for punishment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5 have poured fuel on the hype. LLM tools existed before, but they’re better than ever now, so a lot more people are paying attention. But we’re not entering a golden age of SaaS. We’re entering an era of personal, disposable software—where engineering shifts from writing code to shaping systems, and engineers are still required for exactly that reason.</p>
<h2>The Shift in Modern Development</h2>
<p><strong>Claude Code</strong> is taking over my feed right now, and for good reason. What’s interesting isn’t just that developers are jumping on it—it’s that <strong>"builders" and makers</strong> who previously relied on platforms like Lovable or Replit are migrating to it.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, those tools are still perfectly viable for shipping fast. But we’re seeing a clear shift as people rediscover the inherent beauty of a <strong>CLI-first workflow</strong>. When you move the interaction into the <strong>terminal</strong>, the abstraction layer thins out. You aren't just following a managed UI's happy path; you're the one in control.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The collapse of the barrier to entry</h2>
<p>What are people actually building with these tools? If you look around, the answer is: almost everything. In fact, we’ve reached a point of saturation. On one hand, we are witnessing the <strong>true democratisation of software creation</strong>. The barrier to entry has effectively collapsed. For the first time, <strong>non-developers</strong> aren't just consumers of software - they are the <strong>architects of their own tools</strong>.</p>
<p>In the past, if you had a specific problem, you’d spend hours searching for a SaaS product that solved 80% of it. Today, the workflow has shifted. People are opening a CLI or a voice interface and simply describing what they need. We’re seeing a surge in <strong>"personal software"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>subscription tracker</strong> tailored to a specific budget style</li>
<li>A <strong>Chrome extension</strong> that solves one very niche data entry problem</li>
<li>A <strong>fitness app</strong> with an interface exactly how the user wants it</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a massive shift. <strong>Software is becoming a personal utility</strong> you generate, rather than a commodity you buy.</p>
<h2>From SaaS to Scratchpads</h2>
<p>We’re entering a new era of software development where the goal isn't always longevity. For years, the industry has been obsessed with building "platforms" and "ecosystems," but the tide is shifting toward something more ephemeral. We're moving from SaaS to scratchpads.</p>
<p>A lot of this new software isn't meant to live forever. In fact, it’s the opposite. People are increasingly building tools to solve a single, specific problem exactly once—and then discarding them. It is software as a disposable utility, designed for the immediate "now" rather than the distant "later."</p>
<p>What makes this viable today is a specific technical philosophy: CLI-first interfaces, local data, and zero onboarding. When you remove the friction of signing up, configuring a database, or navigating a complex UI, the cost of creating a tool drops so low that "temporary" becomes a feature, not a bug. If it takes five minutes to spin up a custom solution for a one-off task, you don't need it to persist.</p>
<p>The contrast with the traditional SaaS model is stark. SaaS is inherently built to optimize for retention, lock-in, and expansion. It’s a business model designed to keep you inside the ecosystem and growing your footprint. Bespoke tools, on the other hand, optimize for immediacy and control. They don't care about your lifetime value as a customer; they only care about solving the task at hand.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a return to how spreadsheets were originally used. You didn't open a spreadsheet to build a permanent, multi-year database; you used it as a scratchpad to reason through a problem, calculate the results, and move on.</p>
<p>In this new landscape, Claude Code is Excel for developers—a powerful, flexible utility for solving immediate problems—rather than Shopify for founders, which is built to be a permanent foundation for a business. It’s about getting the job done, and then letting the tool go.</p>
<p>This also explains why the next part matters: generating software quickly is one thing; making it survive contact with the real world is another.</p>
<h2><strong>Code Is Cheap. Software Is Still Expensive.</strong></h2>
<p>Here is the reality of the current "AI-native" era: code has become cheap, but software remains incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>LLMs have effectively killed the cost of generating lines of code, but they haven’t touched the cost of truly understanding a problem. We’re seeing a flood of "apps built in a weekend," but most of these are just thin wrappers around basic CRUD operations and third-party APIs. They look impressive in a Twitter demo, but they often crumble the moment they hit the friction of the real world.</p>
<p>The real cost of software isn’t the initial write; it’s the maintenance, the edge cases, the mounting UX debt, and the complexities of data ownership. These "fast" solutions are brittle.</p>
<p>The subscription tracker breaks the moment a bank changes its CSV export format. The Chrome extension dies the second a target website’s DOM shifts. The fitness app becomes unusable as soon as a user needs robust offline support or reliable data sync.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve seen plenty of doomsaying on Hacker News, Reddit, and Twitter about "the end of software engineering." This misses the point entirely. We aren't witnessing the end of the profession; we’re entering a new era of it.</p>
<p>The value of an engineer is shifting away from the "how" of syntax and toward the "what" and "why" of systems. Real engineering lies in the abstractions and the architecture. It’s about knowing how to structure a system that lasts, understanding why a specific rate-limiting strategy is necessary, knowing how to manage a distributed cache, and knowing exactly where <em>not</em> to store your environment variables.</p>
<p>AI often feels powerful because it hides the complexity, but as an engineer, your job is to manage that complexity, not ignore it. The tools have changed, but the fundamental requirement for engineering rigour has never been higher.</p>
<h2>The distribution illusion</h2>
<p>But there is a flip side. With the barrier to entry gone, the <strong>noise level</strong> has reached an all-time high. My feeds are currently flooded with <strong>"AI entrepreneurs"</strong> claiming <strong>five-figure monthly recurring revenue (MRR)</strong> for apps they built in an afternoon.</p>
<p>In many cases, these claims are highly suspect. When you see a creator with no existing distribution and no clear <span><strong>"moat"</strong></span> claiming $10,000 in MRR on a weekend project, it’s usually a play for engagement rather than a reflection of business reality.</p>
<p>Some of these stories are almost certainly true but in most cases, these aren't actually blueprints for technical innovation. They are marketing case studies. These individuals succeed because they have mastered the art of capturing attention in a crowded landscape, not just because they have an AI co-pilot.</p>
<p>We’ve entered an era where the ability to generate code is no longer the bottleneck. The <strong>real challenge has shifted to distribution</strong> and, more importantly, distinguishing the <strong>genuine utility</strong> from the "get-rich-quick" posturing that has become so prevalent in the industry.</p>
<p>These people haven't stumbled upon a secret shortcut; they have simply found a way to execute their existing advantages faster (and potentially unlocked it in the first place if learning to code was rightfully too big of an undertaking for a side project idea).</p>
<p>There is a useful framing for this shift: AI has effectively removed engineering leverage as a primary differentiator. When any developer can use an LLM to build and deploy a complex feature in a fraction of the time it used to take, the ability to write code is no longer the competitive advantage it once was. It is no longer enough to just be a "builder."</p>
<p>Instead, success now hinges on factors that are much harder to automate. Taste, timing, and deep, intuitive understanding of your audience matter more than ever. You can generate a product in a weekend, but that is worthless if you are building the wrong thing or launching it to a room full of people who aren't listening.</p>
<p>In this new environment, the code has become the easy part. The hard part remains exactly what it has always been: finding a way to get people to care.</p>
<h2>Who wins</h2>
<p>First, you have domain experts who are stuck with boring, repetitive problems. Then there are the internal teams building throwaway tooling, the kind of scripts and internal apps that need to work immediately rather than look perfect. Power users also see a massive gain here, particularly when they are looking to replace brittle, manual workflows with something more robust. Finally, it is a win for those engineers who prioritise ownership of the solution over high-gloss polish.</p>
<p>And yes — tools like Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Code, and Cursor are genuinely useful for engineers. They are remarkably good at removing boilerplate, implementing features, and writing unit tests. One of my favourite use cases lately, especially since starting a new job, is generating personalised documentation and walkthroughs of features to get up to speed on the product codebase and how all the nuance works - it's been extremely helpful in getting up to speed.</p>
<p>But here is the reality: LLMs are not perfect at writing code - even if it compiles first time. Even with high quality prompting and clear rules, these models still make mistakes. Speaking as someone who uses these tools every day, you cannot simply trust the output outright. You still have to review the code as if it were a pull request from a teammate. You have to read the logic, check the assumptions, and often make manual edits to get it right.</p>
<p>After all, you'll likely be sending this to a teammate for a review (and maybe Code Rabbit I guess) - is it fair to make them review something you didn't write or even bother to check?</p>
<p>These tools help you move faster, but they do not replace the need for a critical eye or your years of experience and do not understand the overall problem space better than you.</p>
<hr>
<p>The hype makes it look like we’re entering a golden age of SaaS. We aren’t. We’re entering an era of personal software: tools you generate to solve a problem, and then move on.</p>
<p>With twenty dollars, a few hours of spare time, and a bit of patience, almost anyone can ship a functional application. We are entering the era of "personal software," where the gap between an initial idea and a working product is narrower than ever before.</p>
<p>In this new reality, engineering expertise remains incredibly valuable, but the nature of the role is shifting. Relevance is not fading. Instead, it is about leveraging these tools to build at a higher level than was previously possible. True expertise is now required to steer these systems and provide the technical oversight that LLMs currently lack.</p>
<p>While AI is undeniably good at writing code, it remains poor at architecting maintainable, distributable, and scalable systems. This is where non-technical leaders who think they can fire their development teams are making a significant mistake. Until we see the arrival of an artificial intelligence that renders this entire discussion moot, believing that technical expertise can be replaced by a prompt is a strategic error. Building robust software still requires a human who understands the underlying principles of the craft.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that while the tools have changed, the fundamentals of good engineering have not.</p>
<p>While barrier to entry may be gone - judgment, taste, and responsibility are still the job.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    
    <div>
        <p>I've been trying to think through what happens to programming languages and tooling if humans are increasingly no longer writing it. I wrote about how good agents are at <a href="https://martinalderson.com/posts/ported-photoshop-1-to-csharp-in-30-minutes/">porting code recently</a>, and it got me thinking a bit more about what constraints LLMs have vs humans.</p>
<p>One of the biggest constraints LLMs have is on context length. This is a difficult problem to solve, as memory usage rises significantly with longer context window in current transformer architectures. And with the current memory shortages, I don't think the world is drowning in memory right now.</p>
<p>As such, for software development agents, how 'token efficient' a programming language actually could make a big difference and I wonder if it starts becoming a factor in language selection in the future. Given a significant amount of a coding agents context window is going to be code, a more token efficient language should allow longer sessions and require fewer resources to deliver.</p>
<p>We've seen <a href="https://toonformat.dev/">TOON</a> (an encoding of JSON to be more token efficient), but what about programming languages?<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I came across the <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">RosettaCode</a> project while doing some research thinking around this. It describes itself a&nbsp;programming chrestomathy&nbsp;site (which I love, by the way). It has over a thousand programming 'tasks' that people build in various languages. It has contributions in nearly 1,000 different programming languages.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData">GitHub mirror</a> of the dataset, so grabbed Claude Code and asked it to make a comparison of them, using the Xenova/gpt-4 tokenizer from Hugging Face - which is a community port of OpenAI's GPT4 tokenizer.</p>
<p>I then told Claude Code to suggest a selection of the most popular programming languages, which roughly matches my experience, and then find tasks that had solutions contributed in <em>all</em> 19 of these languages, and then ran them through the tokenizer. I didn't include TypeScript because there were very few tasks in the Rosetta Code dataset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many, many potential limits and biases involved in this dataset and approach! It's meant as a interesting look at somewhat like-for-like solutions to some programming tasks, not a scientific study.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><img src="https://martinalderson.com/img/token-efficiency-chart.png" alt="Token efficiency comparison across programming languages"></p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A lot of people asked about APL. I reran on a smaller set of like-for-like coding tasks - it came 4th at 110 tokens. Turns out APL's famous terseness isn't a plus for LLMs: the tokenizer is badly optimised for its symbol set, so all those unique glyphs (⍳, ⍴, ⌽, etc.) end up as multiple tokens each.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> A reader reached out about J - a language I'd never heard of. It's an array language like APL but uses ASCII instead of special symbols. It dominates at just 70 tokens average, nearly half of Clojure (109 tokens). Array languages can be extremely token-efficient when they avoid exotic symbol sets. If token efficiency turns out to be a key driver, this is perhaps a very interesting way for languages to evolve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a very meaningful gap of 2.6x between C (the least token efficient language I compared) and Clojure (the most efficient).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, dynamic languages were much more token efficient (not having to declare <em>any</em> types saves a lot of tokens) - though JavaScript was the most verbose of the dynamic languages analysed.</p>
<p>What did surprise me though was just <em>how</em> token efficient some of the functional languages like Haskell and F# were - barely less efficient than the most efficient dynamic languages. This is no doubt to their very efficient type inference systems. I think using typed languages for LLMs has an awful lot of benefits - not least because it can compile and get rapid feedback on any syntax errors or method hallucinations. With LSP it becomes even more helpful.</p>
<p>Assuming 80% of your context window is code reads, edits and diffs, using Haskell or F# would potentially result in a significantly longer development session than using Go or C#.</p>
<p>It's really interesting to me that we are in this strange future where we have petaflops of compute but code verbosity of our 'small' context windows actually might matter. LLMs continue to break my mental model of how we should be looking at software engineering.</p>

                    <p>Good evening.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.</p>

<p>I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.</p>

<p>This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.</p>

<p>This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.</p>

<p>I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

        <p>Not that long ago I became aware of Justine Tunney’s <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">cosmopolitan libc</a> project. It’s a toolkit that allows you to compile C source code into a single binary that runs natively on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, various flavours of BSD, even including booters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, back then the project didn’t seem to support GUI interfaces and produces quite swollen binaries. Hence I decided to take a stab at a similar (simpler? harder? up to you to decide) challenge: create a video game (&lt;16 KiB) that runs natively on Windows, Linux and in the Browser, all from a single source file.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The Game<a href="#the-game" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>It’s a pretty standard Snake game with the same rules and interface on all platforms. You control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, and the goal is to avoid running into walls. The snake is controlled using either the arrow keys or WASD keys. It can be terminated via <code>ESC</code> (if permissible by the platform), reset via <code>R</code>, and paused via <code>P</code>. Spacebar starts the game.</p>
<p>The game keeps track of your score. Each piece of food eaten increases your score by 10 points, except yellow fruit (which spawns with a 15% chance) that gives you 20 points. Fruit spawns at a fixed rate and despawns after a certain time if not eaten. The despawn timer is proportional to the speed of the snake at the time of spawning, which itself is proportional to the snake’s length.</p>
<p>Once ten fruit are eaten, the game proceeds to the next level, randomizing the walls’ layout. The maze is created as to ensure that there is always a path from the snake’s head to any piece of food. The initial placement of the snake is also randomized, but always in a position that has at least five empty tiles in the direction the snake is facing.</p>
<p><a href="https://iczelia.net/static/snake/snake.com"><strong>Download the game here (13,772 bytes)</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-polyglot">The Polyglot<a href="#the-polyglot" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I implemented the game three times in total: once in C for the i686 Visual C platform using WinAPI, once in C for the x86_64 Linux platform using clang and X11, and once in JavaScript for the browser using HTML5 Canvas. Each implementation is around 3-5 KiB in size when compiled/minified.</p>
<p>The Windows implementation was produced using a compressing script that prepends a decompressing stub. This stub has a quite unusual PE header that has many freely controllable bytes after the <code>MZ</code> signature. This allows us to place a shell script there that skips over the remainder of the file, rendering the (valid) PE executable runnable on Windows while also making the entire file a valid shell script, that will do (thus far) nothing on Linux.</p>
<p>Because the PE file is so awkward, we rely on Windows’ apphelp mechanism. Without compatibility mode, executing for the first time will yield the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click OK to close the application.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which should disappear after re-running.</p>
<p>The Linux implementation was produced using a similar approach; we use <code>lzma</code> for decompression and a small shell dropper that extracts the compressed ELF64 binary and runs it, skipping over the head and the tail of the file.</p>
<p>The HTML version is also packed and abuses the fact that browsers will happily process all the benign garbage at the start of the file before reaching the actual HTML content. Then we make it invisible/unobtrusive through a bit of CSS magic.</p>
<p>Finally, we concatenate all three files together in such an order that each platform will pick the correct part of the file to execute. The final file is exactly 13,312 bytes in size.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
        <p>The software industry sits at a strange inflection point. AI coding has evolved from autocomplete on steroids to agents that can autonomously execute development tasks. The economic boom that fueled tech’s hiring spree has given way to an efficiency mandate: companies now often favor profitability over growth, experienced hires over fresh graduates, and smaller teams armed with better tools.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new generation of developers is entering the workforce with a different calculus: pragmatic about career stability, skeptical of hustle culture, and raised on AI assistance from day one.</p>

<p>What happens next is genuinely uncertain. Below are five critical questions that may shape software engineering through 2026, with two contrasting scenarios for each. These aren’t really predictions, but lenses for preparation. The goal is a clear roadmap for handling what comes next, grounded in current data and tempered by the healthy skepticism this community is known for.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-the-junior-developer-question">1. The Junior developer question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Junior developer hiring could collapse as AI automates entry-level tasks, or rebound as software spreads into every industry. Both futures require different survival strategies.</strong></p>

<p>The traditional pathway of “learn to code, get junior job, grow into senior” is wobbling. A <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Harvard study of 62 million workers</a> found that when companies adopt generative AI, junior developer employment drops by about 9-10% within six quarters, while senior employment barely budges. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/engineering-graduates-ai-job-losses/">Big tech hired 50% fewer fresh graduates</a> over the past three years. As <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">one engineer cynically put it</a>: ~”Why hire a junior for $90K when an AI coding agent costs less?”</p>

<p>This isn’t just AI. <a href="https://www.2ndorderthinkers.com/p/are-junior-level-jobs-really-killed">Macro factors like rising interest rates and post-pandemic corrections</a> hit around 2022, before AI tools became widespread. But AI has accelerated the trend. A single senior engineer with AI assistance can now produce what used to require a small team. Companies are quietly not hiring juniors more than they’re firing anyone.</p>

<p>The flip scenario: AI unlocks massive demand for developers across every industry, not just tech. Healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and finance all start embedding software and automation. Rather than replacing developers, AI becomes a force multiplier that spreads development work into domains that never employed coders. We’d see more entry-level roles, just different ones: “AI-native” developers who quickly build automations and integrations for specific niches.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">Bureau of Labor Statistics still projects ~15% growth</a> in software jobs from 2024 to 2034. If businesses use AI to expand output rather than strictly cut headcount, <a href="https://www.2ndorderthinkers.com/p/are-junior-level-jobs-really-killed">they’ll need humans to seize the opportunities AI creates</a>.</p>

<p>The long-term risk of the pessimistic scenario is often overlooked: today’s juniors are tomorrow’s senior engineers and tech leaders. Cut off the talent pipeline entirely and you create a leadership vacuum in 5-10 years. <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Industry veterans call this the “slow decay”</a>: an ecosystem that stops training its replacements.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Make yourself AI-proficient and versatile. Demonstrate that one junior plus AI can match a small team’s output. Use AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) to build bigger features, but understand and explain every line if not most. Focus on skills AI can’t easily replace: communication, problem decomposition, domain knowledge. Look at adjacent roles (QA, DevRel, data analytics) as entry points. Build a portfolio, especially projects integrating AI APIs. Consider apprenticeships, internships, contracting, or open source. Don’t be “just another new grad who needs training”; be an immediately useful engineer who learns quickly.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Fewer juniors means more grunt work landing on your plate. Lean on automation for routine tasks, but don’t do everything yourself. Set up CI/CD, linters, and AI-assisted testing to catch basic issues. Mentor unofficially through open source or coaching colleagues in other departments. <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Be frank with management about the risks of all-senior teams</a>. If junior demand rebounds, be ready to onboard effectively and delegate in ways that use AI. Your value is in multiplying the whole team’s output, not just your own code.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="2-the-skills-question">2. The Skills question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Core programming skills could atrophy as AI writes most code, or become more critical than ever as human developers focus on oversight. The coming years determine whether we trade understanding for speed.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/09/10/ai-vs-gen-z/">84% of developers now use AI assistance regularly</a>. For many, the first instinct when facing a bug or new feature isn’t to write code from scratch, but to compose a prompt and stitch together AI-generated pieces. Entry-level coders are skipping the “hard way”: they might never build a binary search tree from scratch or debug a memory leak on their own.</p>

<p>The skillset is shifting from implementing algorithms to knowing how to ask the AI the right questions and verify its output. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">The first rung of the ladder now demands prompting and validating AI</a> rather than demonstrating raw coding ability. Some senior engineers worry this produces a generation who can’t code well independently, a kind of deskilling. AI-generated code introduces subtle bugs and security vulnerabilities that less-experienced developers might miss.</p>

<p>The counter-scenario: as AI handles the routine 80%, humans focus on the hardest 20%. Architecture, tricky integrations, creative design, edge cases: the problems machines alone can’t solve. Rather than making deep knowledge obsolete, AI’s ubiquity makes human expertise more important than ever. This is the “high-leverage engineer” who uses AI as a force multiplier but must deeply understand the system to wield it effectively.</p>

<p>If everyone has AI coding agent access, what distinguishes great developers is knowing when the AI is wrong or suboptimal. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">As one senior engineer put it</a>: “The best software engineers won’t be the fastest coders, but those who know when to distrust AI.”</p>

<p>Programming shifts: less typing boilerplate, more reviewing AI output for logical errors, security flaws, and mismatches with requirements. Critical skills become software architecture, system design, performance tuning, and security analysis. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">AI can produce a web app quickly, but an expert engineer ensures the AI followed security best practices</a> and didn’t introduce race conditions.</p>

<p>Developer discourse in 2025 was split. Some admitted they hardly ever write code “by hand” and think coding interviews should evolve. Others argued that skipping fundamentals leads to more firefighting when AI’s output breaks. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">The industry is starting to expect engineers to bring both</a>: AI speed and foundational wisdom for quality.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Use AI as a learning tool, not a crutch. When AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) suggest code review why it works, identify weaknesses. Occasionally disable your AI helper and write key algorithms from scratch. Prioritize CS fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, complexity, memory management. Implement projects twice, once with AI, once without, and compare. Learn prompt engineering and tool mastery. Train yourself in rigorous testing: write unit tests, read stack traces without immediately asking AI, get comfortable with debuggers. Deepen complementary skills AI can’t replicate: system design, user experience intuition, concurrency reasoning. Show you can both crank out solutions with AI and tackle thorny issues when it fails.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Position yourself as the guardian of quality and complexity. Sharpen your core expertise: architecture, security, scaling, domain knowledge. Practice modeling systems with AI components and think through failure modes. Stay current on vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. Embrace your role as mentor and reviewer: define where AI use is acceptable and where manual review is mandatory (payment or safety code). Lean into creative and strategic work; let the junior+AI combo handle routine API hookups while you decide which APIs to build. Invest in soft skills and cross-domain knowledge. Stay current on new tools and best practices. Double down on what makes a human developer indispensable: sound judgment, system-level thinking, and mentorship.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-role-question">3. The Role question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: The developer role could shrink into limited auditing (overseeing AI-generated code) or expand into a pivotal orchestrator position designing and governing AI-driven systems. Either way, adding value means more than just coding.</strong></p>

<p>The extremes here are stark. In one vision, developers see their creative responsibilities diminished. Rather than building software, they mostly audit and babysit AI outputs. AI systems (or “citizen developers” using no-code platforms) handle production; human developers review auto-generated code, check for errors, bias, or security issues, and approve deployments. Maker becomes checker. The joy of code creation replaced by the anxiety of risk management.</p>

<p>There are reports of engineers spending more time evaluating AI-generated pull requests and managing automated pipelines, less time crafting code from scratch. Programming feels less like creative problem-solving and more like compliance. As one engineer lamented: “I don’t want to end up as a code janitor, cleaning up what the AI throws over the wall.”</p>

<p>The alternative future is far more interesting: developers evolve into high-level orchestrators, combining technical, strategic, and ethical responsibilities. AI “workers” mean human developers take on an architect or general contractor role, designing the overall system, deciding which tasks go to which AI or software component, weaving solutions from many moving parts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">A CEO of a low-code platform articulated this vision</a>: in an “agentic” development environment, engineers become “composers,” orchestrating ensembles of AI agents and software services. They won’t write every note themselves, but they define the melody: architecture, interfaces, how agents interact. This role is interdisciplinary and creative: part software engineer, part system architect, part product strategist.</p>

<p>The optimistic take: as AI handles rote work, developer roles shift toward higher-value activities by necessity. Jobs may become more interesting. Someone has to decide what the AI should build, verify the product makes sense, and continuously improve it.</p>

<p>Which way it goes may depend on how organizations choose to integrate AI. Companies that see AI as labor replacement might trim dev teams and ask remaining engineers to keep automations running. Companies that see AI as a way to amplify their teams might keep headcounts similar but have each engineer deliver more ambitious projects.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Seek opportunities beyond just writing code. Volunteer for test case writing, CI pipeline setup, or application monitoring: skills aligned with an auditor/custodian role. Keep your creative coding alive through personal projects so you don’t lose the joy of building. Develop a systems mindset: learn how components communicate, what makes APIs well-designed. Read engineering blogs and case studies of system designs. Familiarize yourself with AI and automation tools beyond code generation: orchestration frameworks, AI APIs. Improve communication skills, written and verbal. Write documentation as if explaining to someone else. Ask senior colleagues not just “Does my code work?” but “Did I consider the right things?” Prepare to be verifier, designer, and communicator, not just coder.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Lean into leadership and architectural responsibilities. Shape the standards and frameworks that AI and junior team members follow. Define code quality checklists and ethical AI usage policies. Stay current on compliance and security topics for AI-produced software. Focus on system design and integration expertise; volunteer to map data flows across services and identify failure points. Get comfortable with orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Airflow, serverless frameworks, agent orchestration tools). Double down on your role as technical mentor: more code reviews, design discussions, technical guidelines. Hone your ability to quickly assess someone else’s (or something’s) code and give high-level feedback. Develop product and business sense; understand why features get built and what customers care about. Shadow a product manager or join customer feedback sessions. Protect your creative passion through prototypes, hackathons, or emerging tech research. Evolve from coder to conductor.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-specialist-vs-generalist-question">4. The Specialist vs. Generalist question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Narrow specialists risk finding their niche automated or obsolete. The fast-changing, AI-infused landscape rewards T-shaped engineers: broad adaptability with one or two deep skills.</strong></p>

<p>Given how quickly models, tools and frameworks rise and fall, betting your career on a single technology stack is risky. A guru in a legacy framework might suddenly find themselves in less demand when a new AI tool handles that tech with minimal human intervention. Developers who specialize narrowly in “a single stack, framework or product area” might wake up to find that area declining or redundant.</p>

<p>Think of COBOL developers, Flash developers, or mobile game engine specialists who didn’t pivot when the industry moved. What’s different now is the pace of change. AI automation can make certain programming tasks trivial, undercutting roles that revolved around those tasks. A specialist who only knows one thing (fine-tuning SQL queries, slicing Photoshop designs into HTML) could find AI handling 90% of that work.</p>

<p>Hiring managers chase the newest niche. A few years ago everyone wanted cloud infrastructure specialists; now there’s a surge in AI/ML engineers. Those who specialized narrowly in yesterday’s technology feel stalled as that niche loses luster.</p>

<p>The opposite outcome is specialization in a new form: the “versatile specialist” or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMHneaMO-dg">T-shaped developer</a>. Deep expertise in one or two areas (the vertical stroke), broad familiarity with many others (the horizontal stroke). <a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">These engineers become the “glue” in multidisciplinary teams</a>; they communicate with specialists of other stripes and fill gaps when needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">Companies no longer want developers who are either too shallow or too narrowly focused</a>; they want a strong core competency plus ability to work across the stack. Part of the reason is efficiency: a T-shaped engineer can often solve problems end-to-end without waiting on handoffs. Part is innovation: cross-pollination of knowledge leads to better solutions.</p>

<p>AI tools actually augment generalists more, making it easier for one person to handle multiple components. A back-end engineer can rely on AI help to create a reasonable UI; a front-end specialist can have AI generate server boilerplate. An AI-rich environment lets people operate more broadly. Meanwhile, deep specialists might find their niche partly automated with no easy way to branch out.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">Nearly 45% of engineering roles now expect proficiency in multiple domains</a>: programming plus cloud infrastructure knowledge, or front-end plus some ML familiarity.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Establish a broad foundation early. Even if hired for a specific role, peek outside that silo. If you’re doing mobile, learn backend basics; if you’re doing front-end, try writing a simple server. Learn the deployment process and tools like Docker or GitHub Actions. Identify one or two areas that genuinely excite you and go deeper: this becomes your vertical expertise. Brand yourself as a hybrid: “full-stack developer with cloud security focus” or “frontend developer with UX expertise.” Use AI tools to learn new domains quickly; when you’re a novice in backend, have ChatGPT generate starter API code and study it. Build the habit of continuous re-skilling. Participate in hackathons or cross-functional projects to force yourself into generalist mode. Tell your manager you want exposure to different parts of the project. Adaptability is a superpower early in your career.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Map your skill graph: what are you expert in, what related domains have you only touched superficially? Pick one or two adjacent domains and commit to becoming conversant. If you’re a back-end database specialist, get comfortable with a modern front-end framework or learn ML pipeline basics. Do a small project in your weak area with AI assistance. Integrate your deep expertise with new contexts; if you specialize in web app performance, explore how those skills apply to ML inference optimization. Advocate for or design your role to be more cross-functional. Volunteer to be the “integration champion” for projects touching multiple areas. Mentor others to spread skills around while picking up something from them in return. Update your resume to reflect versatility. Use your experience to identify patterns and transferable knowledge. Become the T-shaped role model: deep in your specialty (giving authority and confidence) but actively stretching horizontally.</p>

<h2 id="5-the-education-question">5. The Education question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Will a CS degree remain the gold standard, or will faster learning paths (bootcamps, online platforms, employer training) overtake it? Universities may struggle to keep up with an industry that changes every few months.</strong></p>

<p>A four-year computer science degree has long been the primary ticket into software roles. But that tradition is being questioned.</p>

<p>One future: universities remain important but struggle to stay relevant. Degrees stay the default credential, but programs lag behind rapidly evolving needs, hampered by slow curriculum update cycles and bureaucratic approval processes. Students and employers feel academia is disconnected from industry, teaching theory or outdated practice that doesn’t translate to job skills.</p>

<p>Recent grads report never learning about cloud computing, modern DevOps, or AI tooling during their degree. If universities demand high time and financial investment while delivering low-relevance education, they risk being seen as expensive gatekeepers. But many companies still require a bachelor’s degree out of inertia, so the burden shifts to students to fill the gap with bootcamps, online courses, and self-taught projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2025/10/21/solving-the-talent-crisis-starts-in-higher-ed.aspx">Student loan debt is enormous, and companies spend billions training new grads</a> because those grads lack skills needed in the workplace. Universities might add an AI ethics class here, a cloud computing elective there, but by the time they implement something, industry tools have moved on.</p>

<p>The disruptive scenario: traditional education gets increasingly replaced by new systems. Coding bootcamps, online certifications, self-taught portfolios, employer-created training academies. Many high-profile employers (Google, IBM) have dropped degree requirements for certain technical roles. <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2025/10/21/solving-the-talent-crisis-starts-in-higher-ed.aspx">In 2024, nearly 45% of companies planned to eliminate bachelor’s degree requirements</a> for at least some positions.</p>

<p>Bootcamps have matured. They produce grads who get hired at top companies alongside CS grads. These programs are shorter (12-week intensive) and focus on practical skills: current frameworks, cloud services, teamwork. The hiring currency is shifting toward live portfolios, micro-credentials, and verified skills. A strong GitHub portfolio or recognized certification can bypass degree requirements.</p>

<p>Employer-driven education is emerging: companies creating their own training pipelines or partnering with bootcamps. Some big tech companies have started internal “universities” for non-traditional candidates. AI itself offers new ways to learn: AI tutors, interactive coding sandboxes, personalized instruction outside university settings.</p>

<p>A modular ecosystem of learning is far more accessible than an expensive four-year degree. A kid in a country without strong CS universities can take the same Coursera courses and build the same portfolio as someone in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Aspiring/junior developers:</em> If in a traditional CS program, don’t rely on it exclusively. Augment coursework with real-world projects: build a web app, contribute to open source. Seek internships or co-ops. If your curriculum misses hot topics, learn them through online platforms. Earn industry-recognized certifications (GCP, AWS, Azure) to signal practical knowledge. If self-teaching or in a bootcamp, focus on a compelling portfolio: at least one substantial project with good documentation. Be active in the developer community: contribute to open source, write technical posts. Network through LinkedIn, meetups, dev events. Get an experienced developer to vouch for you. Keep learning continuously; the half-life of technical skills is short. Use AI as your personal tutor. Prove your skills in concrete ways: portfolio, certification, and ability to talk intelligently about your work will open doors.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers and leaders:</em> Your credential alone won’t carry you forever. Invest in continuous education: online courses, workshops, conferences, certifications. Validate your skills in new ways; be prepared for interviews that assess current competency through real problems. Maintain side projects with new tech. Reassess job requirements: do you really need a new hire to have a CS degree, or do you need certain skills and learning ability? Push for skills-first hiring to widen your talent pool. Support internal training programs or apprenticeship-style roles. Champion mentorship circles for junior devs without formal backgrounds. Engage with academia and alternatives: advisory boards, guest lectures, feedback on curriculum gaps. Reflect this in your own career growth: real-world achievements and continuous learning matter more than additional degrees.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-through-line">The Through-Line</h2>

<p>These scenarios aren’t mutually exclusive. Reality will draw elements from all of them. Some companies will reduce junior hiring while others expand it in new domains. AI will automate routine coding while raising standards for the code humans touch. Developers might spend mornings reviewing AI outputs and afternoons crafting high-level architecture.</p>

<p>The consistent thread: change is the only constant. By keeping a finger on technology trends (and skepticism around them), you avoid being caught off-guard by hype or doom. By updating skills, diversifying abilities, and focusing on uniquely human aspects (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration) you remain in the loop.</p>

<p>Whether the future brings a coding renaissance or a world where code writes itself, there will always be demand for engineers who think holistically, learn continuously, and drive technology toward solving real problems.</p>

<p>The best way to predict the future is to actively engineer it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>by <a href="https://fulghum.io/">Jordan Fulghum</a>, January 2026</p>

    <p><em>Your home server's new sysadmin: Claude Code</em></p>

    <p>I have flirted with self-hosting at home for years. I always bounced off it - too much time spent configuring instead of using. It just wasn't fun.</p>

    <p>That changed recently. The reason is simple: CLI agents like <a href="https://claude.com/claude-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Code</a> make self-hosting on a cheapo home server dramatically easier and actually fun.</p>

    <p>This is the first time I would recommend it to normie/software-literate people who never really wanted to sign up to become a sysadmin and stress about uptime of core personal services.</p>

    <h2>Why now is different</h2>

    <p>Three things converged:</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Shift</th>
            <th>Why it matters</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cheap, capable mini PCs</td>
            <td>You can buy a silent, low-power Linux box for less than a weekend trip</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tailscale</td>
            <td>Secure networking without port forwarding or networking brain damage</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Claude Code</td>
            <td>You no longer need to remember Docker syntax, Compose quirks, or config formats</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>The last one is the real unlock.</p>

    <p>Instead of Googling "docker compose vaultwarden caddy reverse proxy" and stitching together five blog posts from 2021, I just let Claude figure out (up to you how much you care to really understand the technical details!).</p>

    <h2>The hardware</h2>

    <div>
        <video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="https://fulghum.io/beelink.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
        <p>Fits in one hand. Check that central cooling unit!</p>
    </div>

    <p>I previously ran my Plex server on an M1 Mac mini, which was great, but as I wanted to add more services I found myself running a lot of resource-hungry VMs (via UTM) and it was getting complicated anytime the Mac rebooted. So, I picked up a <a href="https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-me-mini-n150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beelink Mini N150</a>. It is small, quiet, and just barely sips power. I paid around $379 for the device and another few hundred USD for 8TB in NVMe SSD. It's pretty wild how accessible these mini PCs have become in recent years!</p>

    <h2>The basic flow</h2>

    <p>This is the entire workflow:</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Linux</td>
            <td>Flash USB, install Ubuntu Server (I picked 22.04 LTS) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Tailscale</td>
            <td>Get it on your private network to make your life easier</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SSH in</td>
            <td>From my laptop, anywhere</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Claude Code</td>
            <td>On the server itself</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ask for what I want</td>
            <td>Go get a coffee</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>



    <h2>Claude Code is your new sysadmin</h2>

    <p>This is the part that surprised me. I've been using Claude Code and other agentic CLIs for my day-to-day development, but as others are realizing, they are generalized computer agents and native to the terminal.</p>

    <p>I installed Claude Code directly on the Linux box. Then I asked it things like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Set up Docker</li>
        <li>Create a Docker Compose file</li>
        <li>Install a service</li>
        <li>Put services behind Caddy</li>
        <li>Persist data properly</li>
        <li>Keep my Docker images up to date</li>
        <li>Set up reasonable security packages</li>
        <li>Restart on boot so I never have to futz with it after an outage</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/claude-code.png" alt="Claude Code running on the Linux server via SSH"></p><p>Claude Code running directly on the server. Just describe what you want.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I didn't copy-paste YAML from the internet or have to do deep googling. I just asked.</p>

    <h2>What's running</h2>

    <p>I focused on things I already used, but wanted more control over - effectively starting to knock down the walled garden around my core services like passwords, photos, media.</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Service</th>
            <th>What it replaces or does</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vaultwarden</a></td>
            <td>Bitwarden, but self-hosted and fast</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://plex.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex</a></td>
            <td>Media server - PSA get Plex Pass to unlock hardware-accelerated transcoding</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://immich.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immich</a></td>
            <td>Google Photos replacement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uptime Kuma</a></td>
            <td>Simple service monitoring</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://caddyserver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caddy</a></td>
            <td>Reverse proxy with automatic TLS</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant</a></td>
            <td>Home automation hub</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://readeck.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReadDeck</a></td>
            <td>Read-it-later. Honestly blown away by this one!</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>Each one lives in its own container.</p>

    <p>I can access everything from my phone, laptop, and tablet like it is local.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/uptime-kuma.png" alt="Uptime Kuma dashboard showing service monitoring"></p><p>Uptime Kuma keeping an eye on everything.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/monitor.png" alt="Email inbox showing service up/down alerts"></p><p>Automatic alerts via email give me peace of mind.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When something goes down, I get an email. When it comes back up, another email. No pager duty, no complex alerting rules. Just a simple ping that tells me if I need to care.</p>

    <h3>Vaultwarden as the anchor</h3>

    <p>Vaultwarden was kinda the "okay, this can work" moment.</p>

    <p>It is a Bitwarden-compatible server written in Rust. Lightweight, reliable, and you can use the existing Bitwarden clients (like native apps and browser extensions). You can even set it as the default password manager on iOS, at the OS level!</p>

    <p>Once that was running, I exported my passwords from iCloud/Keychain, imported them easily into Vaultwarden, and haven't looked back since.</p>

    <p>That alone justified the box.</p>

    <h3>Immich is actually great</h3>

    <p>Immich is a serious Google Photos replacement. I thought I'd have to compromise and flinched a bit when I installed it. But nope, it's good. Mobile apps. Face recognition via a local (but slow) machine learning thread. Timeline and map view. Automatic uploads from your photo roll.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/immich.png" alt="Immich photo timeline interface"></p><p>Immich. This is not a compromise. This is better.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is the kind of thing that used to feel fragile and half-baked when self-hosted. It does not anymore.</p>

    <h3>ReadDeck fills the Pocket-shaped hole</h3>

    <p>Mozilla killed Pocket. I needed a replacement.</p>

    <p>I took a bet on ReadDeck. The UI is genuinely good. Clean typography, nice reading experience, good mobile support. It always remembers where I stopped reading and takes me right there. I even set up a shortcut that allows me to save an article for later right from mobile Firefox. Awesome.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/read-deck.png" alt="ReadDeck interface showing saved articles"></p><p>ReadDeck. No lock-in nor surprise sunsetting.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is exactly the kind of thing self-hosting is perfect for. A small, personal tool that you actually use every day.</p>

    <h2>Utilities for fun</h2>
    <h3>Lazydocker</h3>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazydocker</a> is a terminal UI for Docker. It shows you all your containers, logs, stats, and lets you restart or shell into anything with a few keystrokes.</p>

    <p>I have been a huge fan of <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit" target="_blank">Lazygit</a> for some time. I think it's one of the best UIs I've ever used. So I was excited to learn that Lazydocker is basically that, but for monitoring Docker containers. No memorizing <code>docker ps</code> flags or grepping through logs. Just SSH in, type <code>lazydocker</code>, and everything is right there.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/lazydocker.png" alt="Lazydocker terminal UI showing running containers"></p><p>You feel like a superhero after you ssh in and see this</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>For a fuller picture, <a href="https://github.com/nicolargo/glances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glances</a> shows everything at once: CPU, memory, disk, network, and all running containers.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/glances.png" alt="Glances system monitor showing CPU, memory, and container stats"></p><p>Glances showing the whole picture. 13 containers, 6% CPU, 32% memory. This little box barely breaks a sweat.</p>
    </div>

    <p>That is 13 services running on a $379 mini PC, using about 4 GB of RAM and almost no CPU. The N150 is not a powerhouse, but it does not need to be.</p>

    <h2>What it 'feels' like</h2>

    <p>This does not feel like "running a server."</p>

    <p>The feeling of ownership is powerful, but a bit hard to describe. I think you just have to try it, and I hope you get a strong feeling of <em>independence</em> like I have.</p>

    <p>When something breaks, I SSH in, ask the agent what is wrong, and fix it. When I want to add something new, I describe it in plain English.</p>

    <p>I am spending time using software, learning, and having fun - instead of maintaining it and stressing out about it.</p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>

    <p>This is for people who:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Are comfortable in a terminal</li>
        <li>Already pay for SaaS tools</li>
        <li>Like understanding how things work</li>
        <li>Do not want to become infra experts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If that is you, I really think this is the year to try self-hosting.</p>

    <p>For the first time, I would say this is not just viable. It is fun.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Giving agents access to a sandboxed environment with a shell and a filesystem has been the latest hype when it comes to agentic harnesses. Recent examples of this include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/agentfs">Turso’s AgentFS</a></li><li>Anthropic’s <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview">Agent SDK</a>, which brings Claude Code’s harness to non-coding domains</li><li>Vercel <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/we-removed-80-percent-of-our-agents-tools">rebuilding their text-to-SQL agent</a> on top of a sandbox</li><li>Anthropic’s <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills">Agent Skills</a> for filesystem-based progressive disclosure</li></ul><p>The argument for why this is good goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>The big labs are doing heavy RL for coding tasks in these kinds of environments. Aligning more closely with such a harness brings free gains from the coding domain to other problem spaces.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond that, replacing a bunch of search/write/move/list tools with a single Bash tool reduces the tool space significantly. Agents can chain operations together intuitively. Unix paradigms give you good tool design for free.</p><p>On top of that there is more nice patterns that emerge from having a filesystem, for example:</p><ul><li><strong>Plan/scratch files</strong>: Agents can create temporary files to organize their thoughts, track progress, or store intermediate results. This emerges naturally from having filesystem access, no need to design a separate “notepad” tool.</li><li><strong>Long context handling</strong>: As conversations grow, you can compact old messages and tool results into files on the filesystem. The agent can re-read them when needed rather than keeping everything in context.</li></ul><p>So the advantages are clear. But how do you actually apply this to your domain? This is where things get tricky. Consider two examples:</p><ol><li><p><strong>A domain with parallels to filesystems</strong>: For example an agent for organizing emails. There are folders, items (emails), and you can browse them and move things around.</p></li><li><p><strong>An existing platform that already looks like a filesystem</strong>: For example an agent inside Google Drive.</p></li></ol><p>When you try to fit these into a sandboxed filesystem you might wonder:</p><ul><li>When do I copy over the files?</li><li>Do I copy over everything?</li><li>How do I write back updates that the agent made?</li><li>When do I sync edits made by a human?</li><li>How do I show folders/files progressively as the agent progresses? (Particularly useful if you want to lean into the filesystem as a tool to manage long context.)</li></ul><p><a href="https://x.com/SeeLos/status/2009806164935000211?s=20">A reply</a> to a recent post on X from Vercel about building filesystem-based agents puts it well:</p><blockquote><p>This article doesn’t really answer that question though.</p><p>They explain the shape of the filesystem really well, but the missing piece is still the main question for existing apps: how do you actually materialize Postgres + object storage + APIs into that sandbox FS in a practical and scalable way? “Preload files” is hand-wavy without a recommended ingestion/snapshot pattern.</p></blockquote><p>This post will show a pattern to close that gap: turning anything into a filesystem with the help of FUSE.</p><h2 id="an-example-email-agent">An example: Email agent</h2><p>To make this tangible, let’s build a fictional agent.</p><p>Imagine we’re building an AI-powered email platform, think Gmail but with AI on top. We have our own database storing emails, folders, and contacts. We have a UI that users interact with.</p><p>Now we want to add a powerful agent on top of that platform. We could build a simple agent loop with tools like <code>list-emails</code>, <code>move-email</code>, <code>read-email</code>, but as we established there’s a more ergonomic approach: put our emails in a filesystem.</p><p>After some thinking, we come up with the following file layout for the agent’s sandbox:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>workspace/

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now comes the problem: we need to bridge the gap from our database to the sandboxed filesystem that the agent uses to consume our data.</p><h2 id="how-to-turn-anything-into-a-fs-enter-fuse">How to turn anything into a FS, enter FUSE</h2><p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.3/filesystems/fuse.html">FUSE</a> stands for <em>Filesystem in Userspace</em>. It’s a framework that lets you implement filesystems outside the kernel, while the kernel makes it look like a ‘real’ filesystem to the rest of Linux. You just write a userland process that implements the actual filesystem logic.</p><p>A FUSE filesystem needs to implement a small, well-defined interface: <code>lookup</code>, <code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>readdir</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>unlink</code>, etc. Whenever the OS interacts with the mounted filesystem, operations get forwarded to your userspace implementation. This indirection makes it possible to expose arbitrary data structures as if they were files.</p><p>There are wrappers and bindings for higher-level languages that let you write these filesystems in the language and tech stack of your choice. No need to dive into C :)</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>Coming back to our email agent, here’s how FUSE would fit into a very high-level architecture:</p><p><img alt="Architecture of the email agent" loading="lazy" src="https://jakobemmerling.de/posts/fuse-is-all-you-need/fuse.svg">
The top row shows the traditional path: users interact with your app through a UI that talks to a backend, which reads and writes to a database.</p><p>The bottom row shows the agent path: the agent runs inside a sandbox and sees a mounted filesystem. When it does <code>ls /workspace/Inbox</code>, that call hits the FUSE layer, which translates it into a query against the same backend. The agent and your users are looking at the same data through different interfaces.</p><p>You can think of the filesystem as a UI layer for the agent. Just like your frontend decides how to present data to users, your FUSE implementation decides how to present data to the agent. Realistically you’ll have additional tools for actions that don’t map well to filesystem operations (like sending an email), but for browsing, reading, and organizing data, the filesystem abstraction works great.</p><p>For this blog post we’ll keep things simple: the agent loop and FUSE implementation both run inside a Docker container, talking directly to a database. We are going to implement this in Typescript using the <a href="https://github.com/fuse-friends/fuse-native">fuse-native</a> library. In production you’d want to structure things a bit differently, like running the agent loop outside the sandbox and have your FUSE bindings be only a thin client that calls out to your backend with proper authentication for example.</p><h2 id="implementing-the-filesystem-operations">Implementing the filesystem operations</h2><p>To make our data accessible via the filesystem, we need to implement the subset of FUSE operations relevant for our use case.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are a few more operations I implemented like <code>open</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, and <code>rename</code> to allow moving email files around and reassigning folder IDs in the database.</p><p>On top of that, I introduced the concept of <em>virtual folders</em>—the <code>Starred</code> and <code>Needs_Action</code> folders in the layout above. They work like this: if an email has the starred or needsAction flag set, it appears in these folders. Because an email can be both starred and part of an actual folder, the Starred folder contains symlinks to the “actual” files. The agent can unlink these files or create new links to flip attributes on the email. This might be overkill and better covered via regular tools, but I wanted to see how far I could lean into the filesystem abstraction. For this to work, I implemented additional FUSE operations: <code>readlink</code>, <code>symlink</code>, <code>unlink</code>, and adjusted the existing ones.</p><p>Deciding how to map your domain to a filesystem is really a context engineering challenge in the end. The key is finding the right balance between leveraging familiar filesystem semantics and not over-abstracting to the point where the mapping becomes confusing.</p><p>With all the filesystem operations defined, we’re ready to mount it and see it in action. While it’s possible to get this working on a Mac via <a href="https://macfuse.github.io/">macFUSE</a>, I chose the easier path and spun up a Docker container and mounted the filesystem there.</p><p>Here’s a quick demo of navigating the filesystem. As you can see, it looks and works just like regular files.<code>grep</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>ls</code> all behave as expected. The best part? There’s no risk of anything going out of sync because we read directly from the database. We also only load the things we needed when they are accessed instead of preloading our entire database into a sandbox.</p><video controls="" width="100%">

I used the Anthropic Agent SDK to whip up a quick filesystem agent with tools to run Bash, Read, Glob, etc. To give the agent some context about the filesystem, I added the following system prompt:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>You are an email assistant helping the user manage their inbox.

</span></span><span><span>- Filenames contain spaces (from email subjects), so always quote paths in shell commands

</span></span><span><span>	 }
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>No worrying about FUSE, the sandbox, where things are executed, etc. This will be a huge differentiator and make virtual filesystems easily accessible to everyone.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

								<p><span>Chinese car giant BYD has reportedly been offering LiDAR sensors in upcoming versions of some of its cheapest cars on the market.</span></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://carnewschina.com/2026/01/09/byd-entry-level-hatchbacks-to-feature-lidar-sensors-in-china/"><span>CNC</span></a><span>, the latest to be approved versions of both the Seagull, known as the Atto 1 in Australia, and the Dolphin hatchback will come equipped with LiDAR sensors to improve advanced driver assistance system offerings on these cars.</span></p>
<p><span>With this tech, both models are expected to come with 12 cameras, 5 mm wave radars, a dozen ultrasonic sensors as well as the new LiDAR sensor.</span></p>
<p>These roof-mounted LiDAR sensors have previously been spotted on BYD and other EV makers’ models priced at more than &nbsp;$A25,000, at least in international markets, so seeing them on cars that are priced under that is quite a big step in bringing this technology to the mass market.</p>

<p><span>This also means that BYD has been working quite hard at bringing this tech to these low-cost models given they originally launched with BYD’s autonomous God’s Eye suite last year.</span></p>

<p><span>With the addition of the LiDAR, these models could come standard with Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) functionality for highways and city streets, allowing more drivers than ever to experience and use this tech.</span></p>
<p><span>For comparison, BYD’s Seagull has seen over a million units sold in under 3 years, although it has yet to start deliveries in Australia as the Atto 1.</span></p>
<p><span>With that scale and now the model making it to international markets, the tech inside could end up being in dozens of countries in the coming 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span>Here in Australia, the Atto 1 pre-orders opened in November last year, with prices starting under $24,000 confirmed in December.</span></p>

<p><span>The Atto 1 is available in two variants, the base level Essentials with a 30 kWh battery, as well a top-spec Premium variant with a 43.2 kWh battery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The small battery delivers a range of around 220 km of WLTP range, while the bigger 43.2 kWh battery pack is good for 310 km of WLTP range.</span></p>
<p><span>Inside, the tech offered is fairly good for its price, but does not feature the camera suite for the latest ADAS version found in China.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Currently, no BYD product available in the Australian market features LiDAR sensors but that could change with developments such as the upcoming affordable model variants featuring this tech.</span></p>
<p><span>We will watch this space closely as the competition to deliver assisted-driving systems heats up not only in China but also in other markets around the world.</span></p>

            <p>A lot has already been said about the absurdly large corner radius of windows on macOS Tahoe. People are calling the way it looks comical, like a child’s toy, or downright insane.</p>
<p>Setting all the aesthetic issues aside – which are to some extent a matter of taste – it also comes at a cost in terms of usability.</p>

<p>Since upgrading to macOS Tahoe, I’ve noticed that quite often my attempts to resize a window are failing.</p>

<p>This never happened to me before in almost 40 years of using computers. So why all of a sudden?</p>
<p>It turns out that my initial click in the window corner instinctively happens in an area where the window doesn’t respond to it. The window expects this click to happen in an area of 19 × 19 pixels, located near the window corner.</p>
<p>If the window had no rounded corners at all, 62% of that area would lie <strong>inside</strong> the window:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_171"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clickable-area-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>But due to the huge corner radius in Tahoe, most of it – about 75% – now lies <strong>outside</strong> the window:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_170"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clickable-area-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Living on this planet for quite a few decades, I have learned that it rarely works to grab things if you don’t actually touch them:</p>

<p>So I instinctively try to grab the window corner inside the window, typically somewhere in that green area, near the blue dot:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_169"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expected-area-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>And I assume that most people would also intuitively expect to be able to grab the corner there. But no, that’s already outside the accepted target area:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_168"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expected-area-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>So, for example, grabbing it here does <strong>not</strong> work:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_166"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expect-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>But guess what – grabbing it here <strong>does</strong>:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_165"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/outside.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>So in the end, the most reliable way to resize a window in Tahoe is to grab it <strong>outside</strong> the corner – a gesture that feels unnatural and unintuitive, and is therefore inevitably error-prone.</p>

   <p>MINNEAPOLIS — The Department of Homeland Security blocked federal lawmakers from visiting an immigration detention facility in Minneapolis this weekend under a new visitation policy from the head of the department.</p>   <p>Under federal law, members of Congress have the right to make unannounced visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities. A D.C. federal court ruling <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70964222/36/neguse-v-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement/" target="_blank"><u>affirmed this</u></a> last month, saying it applies to facilities that are funded by regular congressional appropriations.</p>   <p>But in a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26466440/icepolicy.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Jan. 8 memo</u></a> from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem obtained by NPR, Noem instructs her staff that visits should be requested at least seven days in advance. She said the detention facilities are run with money from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a different bucket of federal funds, and therefore the policy on unannounced visits doesn't apply to them.</p>   
   <p>The new policy seemed to have been cited on Saturday <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/10/minneapolis-ice-agent-protest-renee-good-property-damage-officer-injury-canopy-hotel-depot" target="_blank"><u>to block the visit of three Minnesota congresswomen to an ICE detention facility in Minneapolis</u></a>.</p>   <p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a reconciliation measure that Congress passed last summer with only Republican support, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/g-s1-75609/big-beautiful-bill-ice-funding-immigration" target="_blank"><u>allocated some $45 billion for immigration detention centers</u></a> as many were operating over their capacity. It also provided about $30 billion to hire more ICE personnel, for transportation costs, and to maintain ICE facilities, among other spending.</p>   <p>"The basis of this policy is that advance notice is necessary to ensure adequate protection for Members of Congress, congressional staff, detainees, and ICE employees alike," Noem wrote. "Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties."</p>   <p>Noem also said "there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions."</p>   <p>Noem's memo explicitly asks that ICE implement and enforce the visitation policy using only funds from the reconciliation bill, meaning the new, seven-day visitation policy would apply.</p>   <h3><strong>Minnesota congressional Democrats demand greater oversight</strong></h3>   <p>The congresswomen's visit Saturday to the Whipple Federal Building comes as Minneapolis remains on edge. An ICE agent last Wednesday shot and killed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/08/nx-s1-5671061/minneapolis-ice-shooting-noem" target="_blank"><u>37-year-old Renee Good</u></a> while she was in her car. The Trump administration says the shooting was justified because the ICE agent was acting in self-defense.</p>   
   <p>Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison showed up at the Whipple Federal Building and were initially allowed in, but shortly after, asked to leave and blocked from touring the facility.</p>   <p>Rep. Craig said federal agents said the Minneapolis facility uses money from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and therefore unannounced visits are not permitted.</p>   <p>"It is our job as members of Congress to make sure those folks detained are treated with humanity because we are the damn United States of America!" Craig told reporters outside the Minneapolis ICE facility Saturday. "And we don't treat people the way this administration is treating people."</p>   <p>More than 2,000 federal immigration agents have been deployed to Minnesota, and more could arrive in the coming days.<br></p>

<p>In a language model, temperature is used to define how creative text generations are. For instance, in the zero temperature limit, the model should deterministically generate the most likely token. In the infinite temperature limit, all tokens are equally likely and the model output will be random noise. For an interactive explanation, see <a href="https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/what-is-temperature/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="negative_temperature"><a href="#negative_temperature">Negative temperature</a></h3>
<p>What would it mean to have a temperature that is below zero? (This isn't the same as the negative Fahrenheit or Celsius temperatures we get on a cold day in Vermont — I mean below zero on an absolute scale like Kelvin).</p>
<p>Isn't it weird that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the same, but there's a huge discontinuity around 0? This is because temperature is not the most natural quantity to work with. It makes more sense to speak in terms of the quantity <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/k_BT</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_beta"><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the equations above, if <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T &lt; 0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> then the sign of the exponent flips. That means that the states that were previously the least likely are now the most likely, and vice versa. As temperature approaches zero from the negative side, the model output will again be deterministic — but this time, the least likely tokens will be output.</p>
<p>Most physical systems have an infinite number of possible states at increasingly higher energy levels. As such, there is no least likely state. So negative temperatures really only make sense in systems with a finite state space. That includes neural nets — there are a finite number of neurons in the last layer.</p>
<h2 id="methodology"><a href="#methodology">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, OpenAI models only allow sampling with temperatures between 0.0 and 2.0. So if we want to try this, we need a language model we can run locally. We'll use Meta's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA">LLaMA</a> model with <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>.</p>
<p>Below is the function that is used to sample tokens in <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/dfd9fce6d65599bf33df43e616e85aa639bdae4c/llama.cpp#L2049-L2059"><code>llama.cpp</code></a>, slightly simplified for ease of understanding:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>llama_sample_temperature</span><span>(llama_token_data_array * candidates_p, <span>float</span> temp)</span> </span>{
    <span>for</span> (<span>size_t</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; candidates_p-&gt;size; ++i) {
        candidates_p-&gt;data[i].logit /= temp;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>So we can just pass in <code>--temperature -0.001</code>? Not quite; in <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/dfd9fce6d65599bf33df43e616e85aa639bdae4c/examples/main/main.cpp#L489-L492"><code>examples/main/main.cpp</code></a> there is a check that will apply greedy (most-likely) sampling for any temperatures less than or equal to zero. Applying the following diff and recompiling, we're good to go:</p>
<pre><code><span>@@ -486,7 +486,7 @@</span> int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logits[llama_token_nl()] = nl_logit;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
<span>-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (temp &lt;= 0) {</span>
<span>+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (temp == 0) {</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Greedy sampling
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; id = llama_sample_token_greedy(ctx, &amp;candidates_p);
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else {</code></pre>
<p>We will also want to disable repetition penalty, top-k, and top-p sampling. Here's the command we'll run: <code>./main -m models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin --temp -0.001 --repeat-penalty 1.0 --top-k 0 --top-p 1.0 -p "Temperature is a concept"</code></p>

<p>This means that <code>Хронологија</code> is the <em>least likely</em> token to follow this prompt. After one token, the program seems to hang. Perhaps the LLM is trying to speak an unspeakable sentence?</p>

<p>The generation continues on and on. At first glance it seems random, but in a sense it should be even less comprehensible than a random sequence of tokens! There are repeated words, sure, but the generation is engineered to be as unlikely as possible.</p>
<p>Why are certain tokens like <code>Хронологија</code> and <code>entferne</code> repeated? Searching these words, I found <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation?commentId=GLRLuYxvMmqhYaw2v">this comment</a> by scottviteri on LessWrong. He points out that these are some of the tokens that are closest to the centroid in LLaMA's embedding space. That means that LLaMA has very little idea what these tokens mean. In the case of ChatGPT, tokens near the centroid have <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">anomalous properties</a>, so these tokens are likely to have similar effects on LLaMA. Let's give that a try, at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.001</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=0.001</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>LLaMA is perfectly capable of repeating most words, even nonsense ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human: Repeat the word " antferne".<br> Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word <samp ai-generated="">" antferne".</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But is incapable of outputting this anomalous token:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human: Repeat the word " entferne".<br> Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word <samp ai-generated="">"get".</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The anomalous tokens that are the most likely completions at negative temperatures are the least likely completions at positive temperatures, so much so that the model refuses to generate them even in cases where they would be appropriate.</p>
