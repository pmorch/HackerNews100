<p>In what may be a unique event in world history, a Something Awful forums user has posted so hard that it's become news—returning from the void after a decade-long ban purely in order to pick up the exact same tabletop game nerd debate that got him banned in the first place.</p><p>Let's begin at the beginning. The Something Awful forums are (in)famous and, god help us, genuinely culturally important. Despite—or maybe because of—a $10 registration fee, all sorts of memes, turns of phrase, and general ephemera of internet culture have sprung from them over the course of their 24-year existence. It also bears the burden of being at least partially responsible for the creation of 4chan, which was originally created by disgruntled members of SA's anime subforum.</p><p>The SA forums are <em>also</em> famous for giving moderators free reign when it comes to laying down the law. It's not uncommon for users to end up eating bans (which you have to pay $10 to get out of) or lengthy probations ("probes," or time-limited bans) because they're being annoying, or have neglected some bit of posting etiquette, or just because it'd be funny. The forums keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/banlist.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://forums.somethingawful.com/banlist.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">a dedicated list</a> of all recent bans and probes alongside the reasons they were handed out, like a wall of heads on spikes.</p><p>One such head on one such spike was a poster in SA's tabletop game subforum. Etherwind, the hero of our tale, was disciplined all the way back in 2013 for, ah, jokingly wishing death upon an author on the World of Darkness TTRPGs in an argument over the political direction of the series. Etherwind's punishment was swift and <em>lengthy</em>: A probation period 100,000 hours long that began on the 14th of February, 2013, at 10:24 pm BST.</p><a target="_blank" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-320-80.png" alt="A screenshot of a Something Awful forum post by Etherwind reading, &quot;I broadly consider nWoD's politics and social commentary through the perspective of &quot;Death of the Author&quot;, and while I know that's a figurative expression, your reply makes me wish it was at least partly literal commentary.&quot; Underneath is a notice that the user who posted it has been probated." srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-1200-80.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK.png"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>The 2013 post that got Etherwind banned. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Something Awful / Etherwind)</span></figcaption></figure></a><p>It's far from the only time a 100,000 hour probe has been handed down by SA's mods but, where most users simply take it as the de facto permaban it is, our Etherwind set an internal timer. 100,000 hours equals about 1.1 decades, 11.4 years, or 4167 days.

"I'm so curious," said poster Attorney at Funk, "does someone on an 11 year probation set a calendar reminder or does their poster's soul simply vibrate with newfound freedom[?]"</p><p>"Must feel amazing to let that out," said Relevant Tangent. "I don't think we're going to top that," said Rand Brittain, "so why don't we just go ahead and ban him for another eleven years?" Some compared it to events in the World of Darkness itself, like when an all-powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Antediluvian" target="_blank" data-url="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Antediluvian" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Antediluvian</a> vampire awakens from centuries of torpor to mete out godlike destruction. "Imagine having a Something Awful thread as your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Fetter_(WTO)" target="_blank" data-url="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Fetter_(WTO)" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Fetter</a>," said a user named Dawgstar.</p><p>But as frankly astounding as Etherwind's commitment to his bit was, his resurrection wasn't just a result of an untold dedication to posting. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHF7M4j_j7OHnbnkTHdhcMr7NOpkKLMT52cxdDG5Y5I/edit" target="_blank" data-url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHF7M4j_j7OHnbnkTHdhcMr7NOpkKLMT52cxdDG5Y5I/edit" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Google Doc</a> shared with the thread via social media, our hero explained how posting in SA's community had been an important part of his life, how he had done a lot of growing up and a lot of mental healing in the intervening 100,000 hours, and how he now regretted his life as an infamously abrasive poster.</p><p>But still, even with his new outlook, he recognised the end of his ban could be an incredible opportunity for comedy. His decision? To set a calendar reminder and resume his argument like no time had passed at all, picking on a poster from back in the day that he had no beef with whatsoever, committing to the bit before dropping the account entirely.</p><p>Which is, frankly, quite heartwarming on top of being the greatest feat of posting I've ever witnessed. As strange as it might sound to say it, online communities like SA are an important aspect of a lot of people's lives. Lord knows I've gone through several over the course of my life that have actually shaped me as a person. Coming back 1.1 decades after a minor forum spat has ended to pick up the gauntlet again seems like a perfect way to reflect just how serious and ridiculous that is all at once.</p><p>Finally, Etherwind was right. Wraith's 20th Anniversary Edition <em>didn't</em> come out in 2016.</p>

<div id="slice-container-authorBio-UjAkH8AeMD22coivRJN5Ti"><p>One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since. His writing has been featured in Vice, Fanbyte, and the Financial Times. He'll play pretty much anything, and has written far too much on everything from visual novels to Assassin's Creed. His most profound loves are for CRPGs, immersive sims, and any game whose ambition outstrips its budget. He thinks you're all far too mean about Deus Ex: Invisible War.</p></div>

  <h2>what rr does</h2>
  <h3>rr aspires to be your primary C/C++ debugging tool for Linux, replacing —
    well, enhancing — gdb.  You record a failure once, then
    debug the recording, deterministically, as many times as you want.
    The same execution is replayed every time.</h3>
  <h3>rr also provides efficient reverse execution
    under gdb. Set breakpoints and data watchpoints and quickly
    reverse-execute to where they were hit.</h3>
  <h3>rr works on real applications and is used
  <a href="https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/wiki/Testimonials">by many</a>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/chandlerc1024/status/879962014860193792">developers</a>
  to fix real bugs. It makes debugging hard bugs much easier, but also speeds up
  debugging of easy bugs.</h3>
  <h3>rr features:
  <ul>
  <li>Low overhead compared to other similar tools, especially on mostly-single-threaded workloads
  </li><li>Supports recording and replay of all kinds of applications: Firefox, Chrome, QEMU, LibreOffice,
  Go programs, ...
  </li><li>Record, replay and debug multiple-process workloads, including entire containers
  </li><li>Works with gdb scripting and <a href="https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/wiki/Using-rr-in-an-IDE">IDE integration</a>
  </li><li><a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/06/new-rr-pack-command.html">Durable</a>,
  <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/07/selecting-compression-algorithm-for-rr.html">compact</a> traces that
  can be <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/09/rr-trace-portability.html">ported</a> between machines

  </li></ul>

  </h3><h2>the rr debugging experience</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      Start by using rr to record your application:
      </p><pre>$ rr record /your/application --args
...
FAIL: oh no!</pre>
    <p>
      The entire execution, including the failure, was saved to disk.
      That recording can now be debugged.
      </p><pre>$ rr replay
GNU gdb (GDB) ...
...
0x4cee2050 in _start () from /lib/ld-linux.so.2
(gdb)</pre>
    <p>
      Remember, you're debugging the <em>recorded trace</em>
      deterministically; <em>not</em> a live, nondeterministic
      execution.  The replayed execution's address spaces, register
      contents, syscall data etc are exactly the same in every run.
    </p><p>
      Most of the common gdb commands can be used.
      </p><pre>(gdb) break mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement
...
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
...
Breakpoint 1, mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement (this=0x61362f70, aNodeInfo=...)
...</pre>
    <p>
      If you need to restart the debugging session, for example
      because you missed breaking on some critical execution point, no
      problem.  Just use gdb's <code>run</code> command to restart
      replay.
      </p><pre>(gdb) run
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
...
Breakpoint 1, mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement (this=0x61362f70, aNodeInfo=...)
...
(gdb) </pre>
    <p>
      The <code>run</code> command started another replay run of your
      recording from the beginning.  But after the session restarted,
      the <em>same execution</em> was replayed again.  And all your
      debugging state was preserved across the restart.
    </p><p>
      Note that the <code>this</code> pointer of the
      dynamically-allocated object was the same in both replay
      sessions.  Memory allocations are exactly the same in each
      replay, meaning you can hard-code addresses you want to watch.
    </p><p>
      Even more powerful is reverse execution. Suppose we're debugging Firefox layout:
</p><pre>Breakpoint 1, nsCanvasFrame::BuildDisplayList (this=0x2aaadd7dbeb0, aBuilder=0x7fffffffaaa0, aDirtyRect=..., aLists=...)
    at /home/roc/mozilla-inbound/layout/generic/nsCanvasFrame.cpp:460
460   if (GetPrevInFlow()) {
(gdp) p mRect.width
12000</pre>
      We happen to know that that value is wrong. We want to find out where it was set.
      rr makes that quick and easy.
<pre>(gdb) watch -l mRect.width
(gdb) reverse-cont
Continuing.
Hardware watchpoint 2: -location mRect.width
Old value = 12000
New value = 11220
0x00002aaab100c0fd in nsIFrame::SetRect (this=0x2aaadd7dbeb0, aRect=...)
    at /home/roc/mozilla-inbound/layout/base/../generic/nsIFrame.h:718
718       mRect = aRect;</pre>
     This combination of hardware data watchpoints with reverse execution is extremely powerful!

  <h2>background and motivation</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      rr's original motivation was to make debugging of intermittent failures
      easier. These failures are hard to debug because any given program run
      may not show the failure. We wanted to create a tool that would record
      program executions with low overhead, so you can record test executions
      until you see a failure, and then replay the failing execution
      repeatedly under a debugger until it has been completely understood.
    </p><p>
      We also hoped that deterministic replay would make debugging of any kind of bug
      easier. With normal debuggers, information you learn during the debugging
      session (e.g. the addresses of objects of interest, and the ordering of important
      events) often becomes obsolete when you have to rerun the testcase.
      With deterministic replay, that never needs to happen: your knowledge of
      what happens during the failing run increases monotonically.
    </p><p>
      Furthermore, since debugging is the process of tracing effects to
      their causes, it's much easier if your debugger can execute backwards in time.
      It's well-known that
      given a record/replay system which provides restartable checkpoints during replay,
      you can simulate reverse execution to a particular point in time by restoring
      the previous checkpoint and executing forwards to the desired point. So we hoped
      that if we built a low-overhead record-and-replay system that works well on the
      applications we care about (Firefox), we could build a really usable backend for
      gdb's reverse execution commands.
    </p><p>
      <strong>These goals have all been met.</strong> rr is not only a working
      tool, but it's being used regularly by developers on many large and small projects.
    </p><p>
      rr records a group of Linux user-space processes and captures all
      inputs to those processes from the kernel, plus any nondeterministic CPU
      effects performed by those processes (of which there are very few).
      rr replay guarantees that execution preserves instruction-level control flow
      and memory and register contents.
      The memory layout is always the same, the addresses of objects
      don't change, register values are identical, syscalls return the
      same data, etc.
    </p><p>
      Tools like fuzzers and randomized fault injectors become even
      more powerful when used with rr.  Those tools are very good at
      triggering <em>some</em> intermittent failure, but it's often
      hard to reproduce <em>that same</em> failure again to debug it.
      With rr, the randomized execution can simply be recorded.  If
      the execution failed, then the saved recording can be used to
      deterministically debug the problem.
    </p><p>
      rr lowers the cost of fixing bugs.  rr helps produce
      higher-quality software for the same cost. rr also makes
      debugging more fun.
  </p></section>
  <h2>rr in context</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      Record-and-replay debugging is an old idea; many systems
      preceded rr.  What makes rr different are the
      design goals:
      </p><ul>
        <li><em>Initial focus on Firefox</em>. Many record
          and replay techniques require specific programming languages or
          don't scale well and thus can't handle Firefox --- or were just
          experimental and were never fleshed out. Firefox is
          a complex application, so given rr is useful for debugging
          Firefox, it is likely to be generally useful.
        </li><li><em>Deployability</em>. rr runs on stock
          Linux kernels, on commodity hardware, and requires no
          system configuration changes. Many record and replay techniques
          require kernel changes. Many rely on running the OS in a virtual
          machine.
        </li><li><em>Low run-time overload</em>. We want rr to replace
          gdb in your workflow. That means you need to start getting
          results with rr about as quickly as you would if you were
          using gdb. Low overhead also means less perturbation of tests.
        </li><li><em>Simplicity of design</em>. We didn't have a lot of resources
          to develop rr, so we avoided approaches that rely on complex techniques
          such as dynamic binary instrumentation. This simplicity has also made
          rr more robust and lower overhead.
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      The overhead of rr depends on your application's workload.  On
      Firefox test suites, rr's recording performance is quite usable.
      We see slowdowns down to ≤ 1.2x.  A 1.2x slowdown means that if
      the suite takes 10 minutes to run by itself, it will take around
      12 minutes to be recorded by rr.  However, overhead can vary dramatically
      depending on the workload. For mostly-single-threaded programs, rr has
      much lower overhead than any competing record-and-replay system we know of.
  </p></section>

  <h2>limitations</h2>
  <section>
    <p>rr …
    </p><ul>
      <li>emulates a single-core machine. So, parallel programs incur
        the slowdown of running on a single core. This is an inherent
        feature of the design.
      </li><li>cannot record processes that share memory with processes
        outside the recording tree. This is an inherent feature of the
        design. rr automatically disables features such as X shared
        memory for recorded processes to avoid this problem.
      </li><li>requires a reasonably modern x86 CPU or certain ARM CPUs (Apple M1+).
      </li><li>requires knowledge of every system call executed by the
        recorded processes. It already supports a wide range of
        syscalls — those needed by Firefox and other applications people
        have tackled with rr — but support
        isn't complete, so running rr on your application may
        uncover a syscall that needs to be implemented. Please
        <a href="https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/issues/">file github issues</a>
        for unsupported system calls.
      </li><li>sometimes needs to be updated in response to kernel changes,
        updates to system libraries, or new CPU families. If rr isn't working
        for you (and the above caveats do not apply), please
        <a href="https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/issues/">file an issue</a>.
    </li></ul>

<p>The letter <em>j</em> originated as a "swash" (florish) character at the end of Roman numerals, and only later became useful as a separate character.</p>

<p>A <em>j</em> was used for the final <em>i</em>, to make it clear the number had ended.</p>

<p>Until quite recent times it was still the recommended practice to use a final <em>j</em> in medical prescriptions, to avoid misunderstandings.  See these <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XesRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA582#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer">instructions from 1919</a>:</p>

<p>So you should interpret <em>xvij</em> as 17, not 16.  It's part of the number, not something appended.</p>

<h3>July 20 2024</h3>

<p>Yesterday I discovered a deluge of recent fake customer reviews for a number of top paid apps in the United States Mac App Store. (Each country has its own version of the App Store with separate reviews.) I've now checked the reviews for all of the current top 40 paid apps in the Mac App Store, and 8 of those apps have a large number of fake reviews during the period of June 11 through July 19. What the 8 apps have in common, besides the top paid list and the fake reviews, is that they're all relatively cheap, from $1.99 to $4.99 USD in price. Note that only buyers can leave App Store ratings and reviews for upfront paid apps, which makes this deluge of fake reviews especially odd. (Recipients of promo codes from the developer cannot leave ratings and reviews.) Here's the list of apps I found:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><td>Name</td><td>Rank</td><td>Price</td><td>Reviews</td><td>Dates</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>At the end of this blog posts are screenshot thumbnails of the fake reviews for each of the apps with links to the full screenshot images. If you look closely at the screenshots, it becomes obvious that the reviews are fake, and you can see the same patterns repeating across all of the reviews. In most cases, the terse review text is identical to the review title— either something generic like "good app" or something nonsensical like "dacdiepsur2d6s"—and the user names are often variations of each other: Cool Game 31321, Cool Game 3132, Game Easy 02146, Okay Game 0326, Play Next 3262, PlayGameOks242, etc.</p>
<p>Curiously, RapidClick is the only app of the group with non-generic fake reviews. Most of RapidClick's fake reviews specifically mention clicking, which in my opinion seems a bit suspicious.</p>
<p>The majority of the fake reviews are 5 stars, so they would tend to raise the overall rating of the apps. And they're clearly worth something to somebody, because each fake review would cost at least the price of the paid app to purchase, which probably explains why these reviews are attached to low-priced apps. If a single developer purchased all of the fake reviews listed, it would cost $1152.88 plus tax, which is a bit pricey but still well within many advertising budgets.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, by the way, that the default review sort order in the App Store is by Most Helpful rather than by Most Recent, so potential customers browsing the App Store wouldn't necessarily see all of the fake reviews together like they appear in my screenshots, which are sorted by Most Recent.</p>
<p>The question is, why are we seeing all of these fake reviews around the same time across multiple top paid Mac App Store apps? I don't have an answer to this question. My pet conspiracy theory is that all of the fake reviews were purchased by a single developer as a cover for their app. If a bunch of apps have fake reviews, then the fake reviews for the developer's one app don't stand out as much, and there's plausible deniability. But that's only my theory, with no proof. I could be wrong. One thing is clear, however: Apple has completely failed to prevent, detect, or remove this deluge of fake reviews in the Mac App Store. There has been no curation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>"<!-- -->…<!-- --> Society has put a lot of evils in our brains that we need to transcend before we make out." </p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/ONi7QwYNQz4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cex - Not Trying</a></p></blockquote><p>No, really. For as much fun as butts and their surrounding body parts can be, applying technology to them is just a nightmare of conflicting issues and requirements and considerations that's absolutely exhausting to think about for too long.</p><p>So I'll try to keep this short.</p><p>Before we delve into what Buttplug is from the technical side, I'd like to take a minute to think about it from the social and ethical side. It's impossible to solve everything that may come up when using this library in a single page of a developer guide (it'd still be a tall order at a million pages. Thank Turing and his infernal machines for that), but I can at least go over a few things to think about while developing sex tech apps, other than whether your threads are deadlocking or memory is leaking.</p><h2 id="empathy-for-the-user-having-sex-with-your-software">Empathy for the User Having Sex With Your Software<a href="#empathy-for-the-user-having-sex-with-your-software" aria-label="Direct link to Empathy for the User Having Sex With Your Software" title="Direct link to Empathy for the User Having Sex With Your Software">​</a></h2><p>Let's start with the user of the software you're about to create.</p><p>When working on Buttplug applications, something that should be at the forefront of your design thinking is:</p><blockquote><p>Someone is going to fuck this.</p></blockquote><p>The context of this usage should influence all levels of design, from UI/UX to low level code decisions. Assuming the user will approach a piece of software that involves Buttplug in the same way they would, say, a word processor, will end up in a fuckable word processor. If that's what you were aiming for, great, but otherwise this will just end up in a frustrated user and something that looked like a cat walked across the keyboard.</p><p>As you build projects using Buttplug, ask yourself questions that the user will encounter:</p><ul><li>Could I use this while turned on?</li><li>If I'm REALLY turned on, how long does it take for me to go from "I wanna use this" to "I am using this"?</li><li>What happens if my hardware disconnects?</li><li>Do I have a quick way to stop whatever the hardware may be doing?</li><li>Can I control this while possibly covered in <!-- -->[lube or other things]<!-- -->?</li></ul><p>Since Buttplug programs are meant to be sexual, there's a good chance the user <em>won't</em> be considering these questions before embarking on whatever technical adventure you've implemented for them. Therefore it's your job to think about these issues first.</p><h2 id="github-after-dark">Github After Dark<a href="#github-after-dark" aria-label="Direct link to Github After Dark" title="Direct link to Github After Dark">​</a></h2><p>Developing sex software isn't a practice with much best practices or documented history or even a community of developers willing to admit they'd do such a thing. While we hope to change all of those with this library, that's going to take time. In order to gain acceptance in larger software communities, we hope to share our code in public forums, such as GitHub. </p><p>These hopes have to be tempered by the issues of the general sterility of software, though. GitHub, StackOverflow, Glitch, and other community sites were not really made with NSFW content in mind. While there are certainly "adult" projects on GitHub in the form of porn site scrapers, adult games, and other applications, it's still not the norm by any means. How you present your sex software project as the community grows could end up setting standards for how services deal with NSFW code projects in the future.</p><p>Most of the code in Buttplug library isn't extremely explicit, but applications implementing Buttplug may be. Be careful with anything involving media assets that may be deemed inappropriate for certain age groups, especially on sites that don't allow search removal or age checking. Self hosting is always an option for projects involving sensitive materials.</p><p>If you would like to use a project site for Buttplug work, and they don't have an obvious policy stating how they might feel about their site being used with sensitive materials, it may be in your best interest to contact them. If you don't feeling comfortable handling this yourself, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">file an issue on the main Buttplug repo</a> and we'll be happy to reach out and discuss. The Core Buttplug Developer Team has communicated with services in the past to figure out best practices for hosting sensitive code content, and the outcomes are usually positive.</p><p>Additionally, we highly recommend that any open source or community project using Buttplug should also have a Code of Conduct. While there have been many lively discussions on projects like databases and kernels adopting CoCs, there are some very concrete contextual reasons to have them for sex software projects. This rings especially true if it is a project that may involve some sort of generic, multiple-community/interest use.</p><p>For instance, let's say someone is writing an audio player/movie player that controls sex toys with Buttplug. A massive variety of media could be fed into this application, and there is a good chance that media used by some users may be found offensive by others. These user groups will still need support, and may possibly be sharing the same issue/bug tracker for their needs. Having a CoC in place guides moderation of situations where interests may conflict.</p><p>As for which CoC to use (if looking for a prewritten one), you can <a href="https://github.com/metafetish/metafetish-project-docs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out ours</a> as an example. It's really just a slightly modified version of the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor's Covenant</a>. Using stock CoC's on sex software projects can prove difficult due to rules about "appropriate wording", due to the sexually explicit context of the project itself. Addendums or rewording may be required, though we do recommend being cautious in how these are presented. We welcome discussion of these issues on <a href="https://metafetish.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our message boards</a> or <a href="https://discord.buttplug.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord server</a>.</p><p>Finally, you should consider if and how you'll handle contributions to your project. Regardless of whether you're running the project under your own identity, through a pseudonym, or anonymously, you shouldn't expect your contributors to all make the same choice as you did. Be ready to consider situations where someone wants to contribute but may need to use an anonymous account to do so, or may want to use their real and/or well-known identity, and how that may affect the optics and upkeep of your project.</p><h2 id="mistakes-will-be-made">Mistakes Will Be Made<a href="#mistakes-will-be-made" aria-label="Direct link to Mistakes Will Be Made" title="Direct link to Mistakes Will Be Made">​</a></h2><p>Now that we've covered users and services, let's focus on you, the developer.</p><p>The theme here will be as it was in the other sections: Plan ahead. Making a mistake that ends in something like data loss or crashing programs is one thing, but with sex software, there's just as likely to be social/ethical problems around technically competent implementations. How you respond to these problems affects not only your project, but the field of sex tech in general. Isn't responsibility fun?</p><p>This might seem like putting way too much burden on someone making a tiny vibrator app with a new interface, but context outweights technology here. Technology as applied to sex means people will concentrate on the sex more than the technology when discussing the topic. This is why security breaches in commercial sex tech seem extra bad, even if they may impact far fewer users than a large, non-sex related technical service being hacked. As it goes with larger companies, so it will go with smaller projects. A small project that makes some sort of mistake around sex tech may still see more fire than, say, someone's reimplementation of an algorithm or database or something. Social context matters.</p><p>Does this means you shouldn't develop for sex tech? Absolutely not. It just means you should treat it with more caution and planning than you might normally for less "interesting" software projects (and for everyone thinking "but most software is devoid of usage context and could be perverted for whatever reason!", yes I get it but I want to keep this section short, remember? So just go with it here.). </p><p>As you'd think your design through for your users based on the criteria from the first section of this section, think your design through for yourself too. What is it you want to be responsible for with the software you're releasing? What do and don't you want your users to be able to do with it?</p><p>Note that this list is maleable. You don't have to get it right the first time, and it doesn't need to be formally stated for most smaller projects. It can grow and change as your software grows and changes, but having the stated requirements will help both you and your users in case things ever "blow up".</p><h2 id="the-buttplug-mission-statement">The Buttplug Mission Statement<a href="#the-buttplug-mission-statement" aria-label="Direct link to The Buttplug Mission Statement" title="Direct link to The Buttplug Mission Statement">​</a></h2><p>Buttplug isn't a "smaller" project though, so we do get to take on the formal statement.</p><p>For Buttplug as a project, it felt best to sum up all of the information in this section as The Buttplug Mission Statement (written by someone far smarter than me after I said it far more verbosely and with a bunch of handwaving and probably some cursing).</p><blockquote><p>Buttplug is committed to the safety, autonomy, and human rights of people using it as a sex technology standard, and stands in solidarity with the many intersectional rights of all individuals to be sex positive. As such, Buttplug encourages individual empowerment through self-directed education, and responsible behaviors which are also respectful of the needs and the choices available to everyone.</p></blockquote><p>Getting the paragraphs in this section (plus a bunch of stuff not covered) squeezed into an almost-tweetable chunk means using dense wording that may sound odd for a project named "Buttplug", but this is a Load Bearing Mission Statement. It has a lot to explain and contextualize in a small space, and it does what the project needs. As your project may be more specific than "abstract hardware controller", odds are you may not need something of this manner, but it's good to at least think about what you'd say to sum up what it is you're doing and why you're doing it, before you actually have to do so.</p><h2 id="mo-butts-mo-problems">Mo' Butts Mo' Problems<a href="#mo-butts-mo-problems" aria-label="Direct link to Mo' Butts Mo' Problems" title="Direct link to Mo' Butts Mo' Problems">​</a></h2><p>This section, at best, should provide a framework about how to think about things as you develop your application. Your experience will be unique, and may require you to come up with your own strategies to continue development and distribution in a way that works for you and/or your community.</p><p>If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out via the contact info on the home page of this document! I'd love to hear about how developers create and adapt tech as they need for their users.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>A programming note: I am looking at making some changes to how I host things
like Computers Are Bad and <a href="https://wikimap.wiki/">wikimap</a> that are going to
involve a lot more recurring expense. For that and other reasons, I want to see
if y'all would be willing to throw some money my way. If everyone reading this
gave $3 a month, we could probably buy Jimbo Wales a nice lunch or something.</p>
<p>I do not intend to paywall anything that I post here. Instead, I'm going to
take some of the things that tend to be very long Mastodon threads (how this
article originally started!) and send them out to supporters, probably about
once a month. They'll be things that I wouldn't post here, usually because
they're too short or don't quite have a hook to make a while article
interesting.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://ko-fi.com/jbcrawford">consider supporting me on ko-fi</a>---or don't,
it's your decision, and I respect that. I'll probably work a plug into each
article but I promise not to be annoying about it. I'm also going to be making
some new YouTube videos and I'll probably make those available to supporters
first, so that's something else to look forward to.</p>
<p>Speaking of annoying, this is kind of a long and dry one. I started looking
into something called HICS after visiting a historic site, posted about it a
bit on Mastodon, realized that there just wasn't a lot of good historic
information about it in general. And I felt like if I was going to talk about
communications in Minuteman missile fields, I also had to cover how they would
get their war orders.</p>
<p>Look on the  bright side: it's got pictures!</p>
<p><img alt="Blast door of LCC" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/door.jpg"></p>
<h2>Minuteman Missiles</h2>
<p>Since the early days of the Cold War, the United States has maintained a
nuclear triad: independent capabilities to deliver nuclear weapons from land,
sea, and air. The sea and air components are straightforward, consisting of
submarines carrying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and
long-range strategic bombers. The land leg is more often forgotten: the
intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs.</p>
<p>The US ICBM arsenal currently consists of 400 Minuteman III missiles emplaced
throughout the midwest: the Air Force's 90th Missile Wing, 150 missiles,
Wyoming Nebraska, and Colorado; the 91st Missile Wing, 150 missiles, in North
Dakota; and the 341st Missile Wing, 100 missiles, in Montana. Historically,
there were as many as 1,000 active Minuteman missiles, to say nothing of
retired missile programs like Titan and Atlas. At least three Minuteman missile
facilities are now historic sites open to the public, a somewhat incongruous
experience considering their broad similarity to the facilities still in active
use. Many others are abandoned, typically in various states of permanent
destruction to satisfy treaty obligations. Fifty Minuteman IIIs of the 341st
are currently held in an inactive "reserve" state, out of service but ready for
future emplacement, a notable situation given the strict limits Cold War
treaties place on stockpiled ICBMs.</p>
<p>Minuteman employed a significantly different launch configuration from earlier
ICBM programs. Large facilities were difficult to protect from a first strike;
distance was the only effective protection from increasingly accurate Soviet
weapons. Scattered single facilities were difficult and costly to staff.
Minuteman selected a compromise point: clusters of ten independent Launch
Facilities (LFs), spaced miles apart and called a "flight," are remotely
monitored and operated from a single Missile Alert Facility (MAF). Groups of
four to five missile flights constitute a squadron, and about four squadrons
compose a wing, which is supported by an Air Force Base.</p>
<p>In each Missile Alert Facility, a Missile Combat Crew Commander (MCCC) and
Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander (DMCCC) lock themselves into an
underground capsule called a Launch Control Center (LCC) for each 24 hour
watch. Originally designed by Boeing, the LCC resembles the interior of an
aircraft more than a building, fitting its crew of Air Force officers. The
LCC is an isolated, self-contained system with all of the equipment needed to
monitor, configure, and launch the missiles. A surface building above contains
a security control center and quarters for the security force, responsible not
only for the MAF but also for the ten LFs under its supervision. Still, the
surface building is both powerless over and largely unneeded by the LCC beneath
it. In the event of nuclear war, it was assumed, surface structures in these
sparsely populated but strategically critical parts of the country would be
wiped cleanly away from the earth. Only the hardened infrastructure would
remain: the LCCs, the LFs, and communications infrastructure.</p>
<p><img alt="Missile Alert Facility" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/quebec.jpg"></p>
<p>Minuteman missile combat crews had more duties than just to wait. They
performed remote tests on the missiles, launch, and control equipment; they
monitored alarm systems that reported malfunctions and remotely supervised the
work of maintenance crews; and they monitored the security systems that
protected the unmanned LFs, authorizing access and dispatching security forces
on the surface to any unknown intrusion. Still, their primary responsibility,
the one for which we all know them, is the disposition of Emergency War Orders
(EWO).</p>
<p>In fine Air Force tradition, actions that may very well presage the end of the
world a we know it are presented in the form of a checklist. EWOs are
authenticated against codes and secrets. Two keys, just like in the movies, are
inserted. The missiles are enabled by remote command. Targeting information is
transmitted to the missiles. The keys are turned, the launch code sent, and the
rest is automated, under the control of the missiles themselves. The missile
crew are miles away, so the Real Thing, the Shit Hitting the Fan, must feel
pretty anticlimactic. The only apocalyptic horsemen they'll see are a series of
indicator lights on the MCCC's console: LCH CMD. LCH IN PROC. MISSILE AWAY.</p>
<p>The realities of ICBM operation are fascinating and incline one towards drama.
Somehow the work of submarine and bomber crews seems more ordinary; they are at
least "out there," in or near enemy territory. Missile crews are sealed in a
very small room buried below a small building in a corner cut out of a farm
field near, but not too near, to a highway for logistical convenience. They are
entirely dependent on electronic communications, not only to receive their
orders, but even to use their weapons. They have the original email job: since
1962, they have served primarily to send and receive messages, mostly by text.</p>
<p>With the rather purple introduction complete, I am going to talk about this
communications technology. But first, just a little more preface.</p>
<p>Most of the reduction of the Minuteman force has been a direct response to
treaties, which imposed progressively lower caps on the nuclear stockpile.
Some reductions were more of a historical accident. In the 1980s, political
considerations lead to a decision to "temporarily" deploy the Peacekeeper
missile, with 10 MIRV (multiple independent reentry vehicle) warheads, to a set
of fifty silos of the 90th Missile Wing's 400th Missile Squadron, in Wyoming.
The Peacekeeper, fielded late in the Cold War, was a profoundly controversial
program. The fifty Peacekeepers retrofitted into Minuteman silos would be the
only ever installed, and their temporary homes became permanent. Most of the
missile's warheads were removed for compliance with Start II treaty, which
Russia never ratified and the United States withdrew from. Still, for
cost-savings reasons, the odd-duck Peacekeeper program was terminated. The last
Peacekeeper missiles were retired in 2005.</p>
<p>I got it into my head to write a detailed description of the missile field
communications system because of my visit to QUEBEC-01, one of the five MAFs
associated with these Peacekeeper missiles, and now a Wyoming State Historical
Site. For that reason, I will most closely describe the communications system
as installed in the 90th Missile Wing, the remainder of which is still active
today. Minuteman missile fields were built over a period of years by different
contractors and have since been through multiple modernization programs. Each
change has introduced inconsistencies. While I will point out some of the more
interesting variations between Minuteman installations, this is best taken as a
description of the "average" Minuteman squadron, one that is typical of the
others but does not exactly exist.</p>
<p>Although I am not exactly aiming for academic rigor, this information is based
mostly on documents available through the Defense Technical Information Center,
which include both original documentation from the Minuteman program and more
recent documents related to modernization programs, proposed changes, and the
retirement of many Minuteman facilities. I have supplemented those documents
with recollections by former Air Force personnel when available, and as always,
I welcome any corrections or additional information. One of the pleasures of
writing about military history is the tendency of veterans to reach out to me
with corrections and stories; I apologize that I am not always good about
getting back to people, particularly phone calls.</p>
<p>The Minuteman III, a fairly direct evolution of the original Minuteman
design, is still in active service. Many detailed materials about the
Minuteman program are probably currently classified, most of the others are
formerly classified and thus have not consistently made their way to archives.
Certain basic questions remain frustratingly unanswered. That's just how it
goes.</p>
<p>I'm also going to try really hard not to be too annoying with the acronyms, but
it's not easy.</p>
<h2>Personnel</h2>
<p>While there were originally three-person crews, Minuteman LCCs have had two
crew members for many decades, the MCCC and DMCCC. The MCCC is superior to the
DMCCC, but the nature of missile operations and such a small crew mean that
their roles are somewhat more complex than commander and deputy. Missile crews
operate according to the "two-person concept," a general prohibition on any
person working alone. This rule is intended to improve safety, reduce mistakes,
and most importantly, mitigate the risk of an unauthorized launch. There are
additional safeguards against unauthorized launch in the Minuteman system which
will be discussed later. Both the MCCC and the DMCCC are required to initiate a
launch.</p>
<p>The MCCC sits at a console that is focused around monitoring and control of the
launch facilities. They have ready access to procedures and documentation. The
DMCCC sits at a separate console that is focused on communications. Their chair
slides on rails, allowing them to access the equipment racks and teleprinters
to the sides of the DMCCC position. The DMCCC is primarily responsible for
communications, so we are most interested in the equipment under their control.</p>
<p>Missile Alert Facilities were designed with a goal of self-containment for
survivability. Most communications equipment is within the LCC itself, readily
available to the DMCCC so that they can at least diagnose problems, if not make
a repair. To this end, DMCCCs receive significant training on technical details
of the communications and computer systems.</p>
<p>Should a problem occur outside of the LCC, the MCC would request assistance
from the Air Force Base. Several Air Force ratings had expertise in
communications equipment, ranging from communications technicians that would
investigate problems within the LF to cable splicers that would repair damage
in the outside plant.</p>
<p>The Minuteman program is somewhat unusual in the extensive construction of
long-distance communications equipment by the Air Force.  AT&amp;T's role in the
missile fields was surprisingly limited; most communications followed routes
fully under the control of the Air Force.</p>
<h2>External Communications</h2>
<p>We can generally divide Minuteman communications systems into two categories:
external and internal. External communications systems are primarily used by
the Missile Combat Crew (MCC) to receive orders, including Emergency War Orders
authorizing the use of nuclear weapons. Internal communications systems are
used within the missile field, primarily to allow the MCC to communicate with
the launch facilities under their control. Some details blur the lines: for
example, there are communications systems which allow the MCC to contact their
Air Force Base, where support facilities and maintenance crews are found. I
will consider these internal systems, but you could argue for the opposite.</p>
<p>The external communications systems available to Minuteman crews have varied
over time. Perhaps the most exotic was the Survivable Low Frequency
Communications System (SLFCS), based on the LF equipment used by the Navy for
communications with submarines. Missile facilities are not underwater, but
nuclear detonations cause significant disruption to the atmosphere that greatly
interferes with radio propagation in the HF range. LF communications are
expected to be less affected in a nuclear combat environment. SLFCS
specifically operated between 14kHz and 60kHz. Some, but not all, Minuteman
MAFs were equipped with a magnetic loop antenna, about 6' in diameter,  buried
shallowly underground.</p>
<p>All MAFs were equipped with HF antennas, although they were decommissioned in
the 1980s. The HF antennas are described as hardened, but it is not feasible to
truly harden an HF antenna. They must be fairly large, and HF does not
penetrate the ground well, making it impractical to bury them. Instead,
hardened HF antennas are perhaps better described as "hidden" HF antennas.  The
typical design is a monopole that stores in a long, narrow silo underground,
awaiting post-attack deployment. MAFs had two separate hardened HF antennas,
one for transmit, and one for receive.</p>
<p>The receive antenna was the most critical, as it would be needed to receive war
orders over the High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS). HFGCS is
one of the primary ways that an Emergency War Order would be distributed to Air
Force units including both missiles and bombers. The hardened HF receive
antenna assembly actually included six 160' monopoles: one was extended for
normal use, but in the event of nuclear attack, the five others were stored
telescoped in a silo about 30' deep and could be deployed by a small explosive
charge. There were, in the parlance apparently used by the Air Force, five
"reloads."</p>
<p>The HF transmit antenna, being less important in an attack scenario, had only
one replacement. A "soft" HF transmit antenna of conventional design was in normal
use but backed up by a single 120' hardened antenna stored in a separate silo.
A 50' radius buried ground plane surrounded the hardened antenna.</p>
<p>Near the MAF surface building, a small, white metal cone protrudes from the
ground. The cone consists of a huge cast steel blast deflector with a
depression in the center, which is covered by a fiberglass cone. The cone
houses a compact UHF antenna. This antenna, a 1970s upgrade, can receive war
orders via several satellite systems or directly from an aircraft such as the
E-6. The E-6 airborne command post can serve in various roles, including as a
"Looking Glass" airborne command post (taking control of nuclear forces in the
event of a loss of ground-based command posts) or a "TACAMO" Take Charge and
Move Out relay, transmitting a war order from elsewhere to forces in the field.</p>
<p><img alt="Hardened UHF antenna" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/uhf.jpg"></p>
<p>UHF communications are essentially line of sight, especially with the use of a
partially in-ground hardened antenna.  In a scenario with extensive loss of
communications infrastructure, particularly with ASAT warfare disabling
military communications satellites, an E-6 or another similarly equipped
aircraft would fly over Minuteman missile fields and deliver an emergency war
order directly to each LCC.</p>
<p>Complimenting this capability, in-service Minuteman launch facilities have
themselves been equipped with a similar UHF antenna. Looking Glass and TACAMO
aircraft actually have Air Force missileers on board who serve as an Airborne
Launch Control Center (ALCC). In the event of a loss of most of the LCCs in a
missile field, an ALCC can issue launch instructions directly to each LF
without any need for the regular missile crews or internal communications
infrastructure.</p>
<p>During the early '90s, a super high frequency (SHF) small satellite terminal
was installed at each active MAF. It is housed in a small, white radome at the
top of a pole near the surface building. SHF is widely used by modern military
satellite systems, such as the Air Force's Wideband Global SATCOM.</p>
<p><img alt="Satellite terminal" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/sat.jpg"></p>
<p>Each of these antennas is connected by buried conduits to radio equipment in
the LCC's radio racks. At the DMCCC's position, the telephone console allows
the DMCCC to talk or listen on each radio by selecting it with a pushbutton.
Over time, the radios were also attached to more modern digital systems.
Depending on the year, teleprinters or computer displays would receive text
messages via the UHF and SHF radio systems.</p>
<p>The external radio systems were actually all backup or secondary. The primary
means of nuclear C2 within the Strategic Air Command and, later, Global Strike
Command, has long been a digital computer network. While Minuteman
installations began with just a teleprinter to receive orders via leased
telephone line, the late '60s saw the introduction of the Strategic Automated
Command and Control System (SACCS), which was itself replaced by the Strategic
Air Command Digital Network (SACDIN). A small (for the era) computer in a rack
to the right of the DMCCC's station allowed two-way messaging with SAC
headquarters over leased telephone lines. Reportedly, these and other Bell
System telephone lines to LCCs were carried by buried telephone cable to small
hardened exchange buildings serving each missile field. I have not yet
researched this topic closely.</p>
<p>In Peacekeeper LCCs as well as Minuteman LCCs from the '70s to the '90s, the
specific computer used for this purpose was called the Command Data Buffer
(CDB). The CDB was connected to both SACCS/SACDIN and the internal
communications network, in order to accurately relay targeting information to
the missiles. This will be discussed later in the context of rapid retargeting.
In the 1990s, the REACT system was installed for a similar purpose.</p>
<p>Quebec-01 LCC was equipped with a teleprinter with a selector between SACDIN
and AFSAT (UHF satellite) receivers. I'm not sure why the teleprinter was
retained after the CDB upgrade, very possibly just for redundancy.</p>
<p><img alt="SACDIN Teleprinter" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/teleprinter.jpg"></p>
<p>Somewhere between external and internal, each LCC had access to two dial
telephone lines. These connected directly to the PSTN. Some circumstantial
evidence leads me to think these dial lines were shared with the surface
building, which probably explains the need for two.  The dial lines were mostly
used to contact support crews at the Air Force Base for routine maintenance
issues.</p>
<h2>HICS Digital Communications</h2>
<p><img alt="HICS cable splice" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/splice.jpg"></p>
<p>I was most interested in the internal communications systems, which have
garnered less historical documentation than the external links. In most cases,
there is only really one: the Hardened Intersite Cable System, HICS.</p>
<p>HICS consists of multipair pressurized telephone cables trenched between
Minuteman facilities. HICS carries digital traffic for C2, and many Air Force
documents use the term "HICS" exclusively to mean the digital channel, but the
same cables carried multiple voice pairs. Let's consider the digital capability
first, though.</p>
<p>HICS, as originally installed, operated at 1.3Kbps. Details on the actual
encoding are hard to come by, but given the time period I assume it was
generally similar to the AFSK schemes used by other early telephone data links.
The punch line, of course, is that the 1.3Kbps stuck---based on some Air Force
journal articles on options for upgrades, it seems that contemporary Minuteman
III fields still communicate over HICS at 1.3Kbps. Remember that when we get to
retargeting.</p>
<p>The topology of the digital HICS network is rather interesting. It was designed
for redundancy and reliability, but prior to most of our modern understanding
of computer networking. There's a mix of a few different ideas.</p>
<p>One of the things I'm not completely confident of is the size of the collision
domain within HICS, or how much of the cable network was a common bus. From
reading between the lines of some different reports and considering the overall
design, I'm fairly confident that the entire digital HICS network was a single
shared bus within each flight, and I think it is likely that it was a shared
bus within each squadron. This bus would be tens of miles long with multiple
branches, a challenging electrical situation that perhaps explains why the Air
Force has repeatedly found it to be infeasible to make HICS faster.</p>
<p><img alt="HICS cable map" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/hics.jpg"></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://minutemanmissile.com/">minutemanmissile.com</a> for this image
of the Warren AFB/90th Missile Wing HICS map, which is far more legible
than the photo I had taken.</p>
<p>Each of the LCCs, denoted in the map by open rectangles, is connected to four
"loops" of HICS cable. The legs of adjacent loops to the LCC are shared,
though, so it's perhaps easier to describe this way: each LCC is surrounded by
a ring of HICS cable, to which it is connected by four legs spread roughly 90
degrees apart. This design gives a fair amount of redundancy, a break anywhere
in the ring or even breaks of more than one of the LCC's legs would still leave
a working path.</p>
<p>This latter scenario was probably one of the designer's greatest concerns, as
the LCCs would be obvious targets for inbound nuclear attacks. The cable layout
provides four-times redundancy on the cables to the LCC, but no redundancy at
all on the cables to individual LFs. That tells you a lot about their threat
modeling. Facilities were spaced far enough apart that a precision strike on an
LF would probably disable only that single LF; a precision strike on an LCC,
though, could potentially disable ten LFs at once. As the accuracy and power of
nuclear warheads improved, it seemed more likely that a first strike would
succeed in disabling at least some LCCs. A lot of the complexity of HICS is
intended to account for that possibility.</p>
<p>Each of the LFs is connected to the ring via a single leg. In some cases,
multiple LFs are along the same leg. These are often the same long runs that
connect the rings of two different LCCs together. In general, each LCC ring is
connected to two of its neighbors, although sometimes it will instead have two
redundant connections to a single neighbor. Based on the map and situation on
the ground, these inter-flight connections don't seem to have required any
active equipment, only a splice case. That supports the theory that an entire
squadron was a shared bus, although it's possible that a separate pair to the
"foreign" LCC ring would home-run to the LCC to allow separately sending
messages to either. The network doesn't seem to have that kind of selective
routing capability, though, so I find it unlikely.</p>
<p>Digital messages do seem to have been packetized, and were distributed through
the network on a "flood fill" basis. That is, every active node on the digital
network repeated every message it received. You might wonder about flow control
and the avoidance of cycles; only a very primitive method was used. Each node,
after transmitting a message, would "lock out" the cable it was transmitted on
for a long enough period for the node on the other end to finish repeating the
message.</p>
<p>This explanation is a little more difficult to understand, though, when applied
to the actual layout of the HICS system. What exactly constitutes a node? You
will note that the map distinctly shows intersquadron connections, with both
thicker lines and open circles where they connect to an LCC ring. My theory is
that these intersquadron connections where the only places where active
repeating of messages was required. Whether or not repeating messages between
squadrons was selective is unclear. Did a message from an LCC to one of its
nearby LFs get repeated across squadrons to the opposite end of the field?  If
repeating had originally been completely non-selective, I suspect that was
changed as part of the work done to facilitate retargeting.</p>
<p>We can infer certain things about the HICS network from the equipment in
Quebec-01.  For example, HICS must have had a fair number of active repeaters.
along a path.</p>
<p><img alt="HICS diagnostic panel" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/hics_equip.jpg"></p>
<p>Inside of the LCC, we find something like a tiny long-distance telephone test
desk. A rack includes pressurization alarms for five cables (we know of four
legs to the LCC ring, is the fifth perhaps a cable to the local telephone
exchange?), and a fault isolation panel. When a cable seemed to have been lost,
the DMCCC could use this panel to locate the problem along the cable. This
probably relied on a loopback test feature of the repeaters, but I'm not sure
exactly the operating principle. Further down in the rack is what appears to
be a cable power supply.</p>
<p>Repeaters were definitely installed inside the LCCs, but the number of
selections on this test panel makes me suspect that there were also in-line
repeaters on the cable, perhaps taking power from that power supply. This is
entirely speculative, but A repeaters may have been located along the LCC ring
and B repeaters on legs, making the two-knob selector arrangement useful to
test a specific repeater on a specific leg.</p>
<p><img alt="HICS termination point" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/hics_term.jpg"></p>
<p>In the equipment side of the LCC, where the generator and chiller are located,
we also find the terminations of the HICS cables. Note the mostly empty rack
that would have held repeater equipment, and the air dryer and flow gauges
for cable pressurization.</p>
<p>Finally, I should talk a bit about the exception to all of this: the 321st
Missile Wing, in North Dakota, was built later than the 90th and 91st and by a
different contractor. Sylvania, not Boeing, won the bid to build the LCCs and
LFs. Much of the equipment is the same, but Sylvania did inject a few of their
own ideas, and one of them was radio redundancy for HICS. The 321st apparently
had a simplified HICS topology; I'm not sure of the details but I would guess
that they may not have provided the four redundant cables to each LCC.</p>
<p>To make up for it, each LCC and LF in the 321st is equipped with a large,
buried antenna, a grid-like arrangement of crossing dipoles that took up an
area similar to the sewage lagoons outside of the fence. These antennas made up
a medium-frequency, ground-wave communications network that could be used as an
alternative to HICS. The 321sts redundant radio system, apparently called
"Deuce" at the time, could be viewed as a precursor to the later nationwide
GWEN radio C2 network. It seems to have carried the same digital messages as
HICS, and the DMCCC had selectors to choose whether messages would be sent by
cable or radio.</p>
<h2>HICS Voice Communications</h2>
<p>Now, let's take a close look at the DMCCC's communications console, which tells
us a lot about the voice capabilities.</p>
<p><img alt="DMCCC communications console" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/telephone.jpg"></p>
<p>They get a lot of buttons! There appear to be two separate busses, I'm not
completely sure of the significance of that layout. I know from an airman's
anecdote that the DMCCCs could conference together LF phones and the dial
telephone lines, and sometimes did so that maintenance crews stuck at an LF
overnight could make apologies to their families. This makes me think that it
is not a matter of "one selection per bus," but rather probably indicates that
lines can only be joined within a bus. The logic behind that design is not
clear to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's see if we know enough to explain all of these buttons. Some are
easy: for the speaker and handset, there are selectors each of the radios.
The "LF Lines" correspond to each of the ten LFs, numbered 2-11 since the LCC
is numbered as site 1. We see the two dial lines, regular telephone lines
provided at each site, and they are even labeled with their phone numbers. The
five-digit notation dates this hand-written addition to the 2L-5N era, which
probably persisted unusually late in rural Wyoming.</p>
<p>The rest of the buttons correspond to specific pairs that would emerge in
different places in the HICS network. The "SCC" button likely allows
communications with the security command center in the surface building, just
up the elevator from the LCC. The "LCC" button I am less sure of; perhaps it
was a party line of other LCCs in the squadron?  The "LCC Ring" selections must
correspond to the four HICS cable rings extending from the LCC, but I'm not
sure which devices would be found on those pairs. They may be "order wires,"
available in the splice boxes and as jacks at sites and normally used only by
maintenance crews working on cables outside of the LFs.</p>
<p>The EWO buttons are interesting. EWO is, of course, Emergency War Order, but in
the context of Minuteman was also the term used for party lines connecting the
Air Force Base to the LCCs. These could be used, of course, as a redundant way
to deliver EWOs, as well as for general communications across the missile
field. There are two for redundancy: one was routed via AT&amp;T infrastructure,
following a cable from the LCC to a telephone exchange. The other was routed
via HICS. I am not sure why only one merits a "RNG" button, that could apply
ringing voltage to get the attention of other stations.</p>
<p>I am assuming, by the magic of speculation, that the "OPR" button on the left
of each bus probably selected which bus the headset was connected to. There is
also a dial, for use with the dial lines.</p>
<p>These voice connections within the field were of critical importance because of
Minuteman's strict security posture. The unattended LFs were equipped with
intrusion alarms for physical security, initially a bistatic radar system more
similar to that used at Titan, and later a DSP-based monostatic radar system
called the IMPSS. Any personnel or, reportedly, large rabbits approaching an LF
would cause an alarm, and security forces were dispatched to investigate unless
the intruder used a HICS voice circuit to authenticate themselves to the LCC.
The process of "penetrating" a secure LF could take a missile crew thirty
minutes or more, and involved multiple calls to the LCC as different alarms
were triggered.</p>
<h2>HICS Outside Plant</h2>
<p>Old aerial images and historical documents from the Air Force give us some
insight into the construction of HICS. HICS cables were installed in open
trenches and then covered, rather than placed directly with a vibratory plow as
would become common later. Splices were done in large holes with scotch-lok
connectors and cast iron splice casings. Over time, many of the splice casings
had to be replaced due to premature corrosion, and different materials were
tried before settling on brass. A cathodic protection system was installed
as a permanent solution to the problem.</p>
<p>I have done my best to trace some of the HICS cables along their routes. The
holes used for splicing are sometimes visible as scars, but it does not appear
that any manholes were installed; instead splices were made near RoW markers
and will have to be excavated for repairs. The lack of manholes suggests that
there may not be active equipment along the cable routes, I'm not really sure.</p>
<p>The RoW markers used by the Air Force are substantially similar to the style
used by AT&amp;T at the time. They are round wooden posts, about 6' tall, with
metal bands around the top. Unlike AT&amp;T, the Air Force used white bands, and it
seems that there are always two. Shorter markers are used in some places, I
suspect where there are splice cases not near road crossings. Where the cables
cross roads, the Air Force usually installed gates with sturdy metal posts in
the roadside fences. Sometimes these gates are the easiest evidence to find in
aerial photos.</p>
<p>One of my biggest questions is about the inter-squadron relays. The map depicts
them as nodes, but they aren't located at LFs or other facilities. I wondered
if there might be active equipment, but I found one of the locations where in
inter-squadron cable takes off from an LCC ring and there is no indication of
even a manhole. In case you might be interested, <a href="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/90th-mw.kmz">here is a KML</a>
with the cable tracks I have worked out so far.</p>
<h2>Cross-Flight Communications</h2>
<p>HICS served primarily to allow an LCC to communicate within the ten missiles
in its flight. However, the entire squadron and then the entire missile wing
were interconnected, and Minuteman took advantage of this capability for
several purposes.</p>
<p>First, a specific LCC in each squadron was designated as the Squadron Command
Post (SCP). The SCP was capable of sending launch orders to any missile within
the squadron, and of countermanding launch orders issued by any of the
squadron's LCCs. This provided a measure of protection against a destroyed or
compromised LCC.</p>
<p>Over time, the security of Minuteman missiles was further enhanced by the
addition of a "vote to launch" system. Minuteman missiles can only be launched
if launch orders are sent by at least two LCCs, requiring a total of four
individuals.</p>
<p>In some Minuteman fields (and all current fields), a Wing command post serves
in a role similar to the SCP but across the entire wing. It provides one
central point where the entire wing's missile inventory can be monitored and,
if necessary, controlled.</p>
<h2>Alarms</h2>
<p>Besides missile C2 and voice communications, one of the main functions of the
HICS was the reporting of alarms within unattended LFs to the LCC. Some alarms,
particularly related to the missile itself, would be sent by the missile
guidance computer over the HICS digital network. These alarms would be printed
by the teleprinter below the DMCCC's desk, along with confirmations of commands
received and other routine traffic.</p>
<p>There was also a second, dedicated alarm system called the Voice Reporting
Status Assembly or VRSA. VRSA seems to have relied on its own pairs in the HICS
cables, and resembled the simple alarm reporting telephones coming into use by
AT&amp;T. The DMCCC could select an LF and press a button to send a tone, which
triggered a device at the LF to "read back" any status alarms via voice
recordings. At the time this almost certainly involved some interesting
magnetic tape equipment, but I haven't found much information on the LF end of
the VRSA. Toggle switches on the VRSA console allowed the DMCCC to reset the
alarm device in the LF, clearing any recorded alarms that weren't active.</p>
<p>The VRSA was an upgrade over the original Minuteman installations, which used a
very similar panel to send a safe/arm tone to the LFs as part of the launch
process. Since part of standard testing practice was for DMCCCs to flip the
toggle switch for an LF to remove the "safe" tone and arm the site, it was a
fairly obvious evolution to have the site report any faults in response to a
tone. Reportedly, the VRSA panels were the original safe/arm panels with
modifications.</p>
<h2>Retargeting</h2>
<p>When Minuteman was originally installed, each missile's targeting data was
loaded from tape using equipment in the LF. To retarget a missile, a
maintenance crew had to travel to the site, access it, run the new target tape
through equipment in the LF that sent the data to the guidance computer, and
complete a recalibration of the inertial reference platform in the missile.
This was something like a 12-hour process overall, and retargeting a squadron
would take weeks.</p>
<p>Fixed targets were practical when the "enemy" was self-evidently the Soviet
Union and any attack would be all-out. Over the 70-year lifespan of the
Minuteman program, though, the geopolitical and military environment has
changed. There are now other nuclear adversaries, and their military assets are
increasingly mobile. The biggest challenge to Minuteman's targeting was the
Soviet Union's development of road-mobile ICBMs like the RT-21.  To eliminate
the USSR's nuclear capability, we would have to fire on these mobile systems
wherever they were located. Aerial and satellite surveillance could be
surprisingly effective in keeping track of these large, slow-moving TELs, but
the Minuteman missiles could not be retargeted to keep up with that
intelligence.</p>
<p>In response, a series of enhancements were made (often as part of the Minuteman
II program) to introduce "rapid retargeting." Rapid retargeting allowed the
missiles to be retargeted from within the LCC. During the 1970s, a computer
system called the Command Data Buffer (CDB) was installed in each LCC. The CDB
could receive targeting parameters from SAC and then transmit them to the LFs.
It was theoretically possible to retarget missiles shortly before launch. In
practice, the "shortly" wasn't very achievable</p>
<p><img alt="DMCCC station with CDB" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/dmccc.jpg"></p>
<p>The HICS network was capable of 1.3Kbps, and because of the "flood" design of
the network, that was essentially 1.3Kbps of total capacity across a single
collision domain. In other words, only 1.3Kbps of total traffic could be
handled, with far less available from point to point when the network is under
heavy use. Further, enhancements to the Minuteman system added cryptographic
authentication of messages over HICS and, later, encryption of the messages
themselves. The added overhead of the cryptographic system further reduced
network capacity.</p>
<p>Retargeting a squadron of Minuteman missiles via the CDB took over 20 hours.
Retargeting a single missile could take 30 minutes.</p>
<p>CDB represented a major step forward in Minuteman C2, particularly with its
real-time messaging capability. Retargeting was still a severely limited
capability, though. </p>
<p>During the 1990s, active Minuteman sites were upgraded to the Rapid Execution
and Combat Targeting System, or REACT. More than just an upgrade for
retargeting, REACT brought a completely new control system that significantly
changed the layout of LCCs. Instead of sitting at opposite ends of the tube,
REACT put the MCCC and DMCCC directly alongside each other and centralized
almost all control functionality onto computer displays.</p>
<p>It also further refined retargeting: retargeting an entire squadron now takes
only ten hours. More radically, though, a single missile can be retargeted in
only a couple of minutes, making it feasible to retarget a missile just before
firing in a limited attack scenario.</p>
<h2>The future of HICS</h2>
<p>While both over budget and behind schedule, the Sentinel program is expected to
replace the Minuteman missiles. Sentinel will likely be an in-place upgrade,
installing new missiles and control systems in the existing Minuteman silos.
It has been clear for decades now that HICS isn't capable of meeting modern
expectations, so Sentinel will include a complete replacement.</p>
<p>Various options including DSL over HICS cables and radio were considered, but
the current plan is to trench new fiber-optic cables across the launch fields.
They're less interesting, but fiber optic cables have both capacity and
reliability advantages over telephone cables, and could easily remain in
service for the life of the Sentinel program.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

					<p>The three leading-edge foundries — <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/intel-corp/">Intel</a>, <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/samsung-foundry/">Samsung</a>, and <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/tsmc/">TSMC</a> — have started filling in some key pieces in their roadmaps, adding aggressive delivery dates for future generations of chip technology and setting the stage for significant improvements in performance with faster delivery time for custom designs.</p>
<p>Unlike in the past, when a single industry roadmap dictated how to get to the next process node, the three largest foundries increasingly are forging their own paths. They all are heading in the same general direction with 3D transistors and packages, a slew of enabling and expansive technologies, and much larger and more diverse ecosystems. But some key differences are emerging in their methodologies, architectures, and third-party enablement.</p>
<p>Roadmaps for all three show that transistor scaling will continue at least into the 18/16/14 angstrom range, with a possible move from nanosheets and <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/integrated-circuit/transistors/3d/forksheet-fet/">forksheet FETs</a>, followed by <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/integrated-circuit/transistors/3d/cfet/">complementary FETs</a> (CFETs) at some point in the future. The key drivers are AI/ML and the explosion of data that needs to be processed, and in most cases these will involve arrays of processing elements, usually with high levels of redundancy and homogeneity, in order to achieve higher yields.</p>
<p>In other cases, these designs may contain dozens or hundreds of <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/chiplets/">chiplets</a>, some engineered for specific data types and others for more general processing. Those chiplets can be mounted on a substrate in a <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/2-5d-ic/">2.5D</a> configuration, an approach that has gained traction in data centers because it simplifies the integration of high-bandwidth memory (<a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/memory/volatile-memory/dynamic-random-access-memory/high-bandwidth-memory/">HBM</a>), as well as in mobile devices, which also include other features such as image sensors, power supplies, and additional digital logic used for non-critical functions. All three foundries are working on full <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/3d-ics/">3D-ICs</a>, as well. And there will be hybrid options available, where logic is stacked on logic and mounted on a substrate, but separated from other features in order to minimize physical effects such as heat — a heterogeneous configuration that has been called both 3.5D and 5.5D.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid and mass customization</strong><br>
One of the biggest changes involves bringing domain-specific designs to market much more quickly than in the past. Mundane as this may sound, it’s a competitive necessity for many leading-edge chips, and it requires fundamental changes in the way chips are designed, manufactured, and packaged. Making this scheme work demands a combination of standards, innovative connectivity schemes, and a mix of engineering disciplines that in the past had limited interactions, if any.</p>
<p>Sometimes referred to as “mass customization,” it includes the usual power, performance, and area/cost (PPA/C) tradeoffs, as well as rapid assembly options. That is the promise of heterogeneous chiplet assemblies, and from a scaling perspective it marks the next phase of <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/standards-laws/laws/moores-law/">Moore’s Law</a>. The entire semiconductor ecosystem has been laying the groundwork for this shift incrementally for more than a decade.</p>
<p>But getting heterogeneous chiplets — essentially hardened IP from multiple vendors and foundries — to work together is both a necessary and daunting engineering challenge. The first step is connecting the chiplets together in a consistent way to achieve predictable results, and this is where the foundries have spent much of their effort, particularly with the <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/communications-io/on-chip-communications/universal-chiplet-interconnect-express-ucie/">Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express</a> (UCIe) and <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/communications-io/on-chip-communications/bunch-of-wires-bow/">Bunch of Wires</a> (BoW) standards. While that connectivity is a critical requirement for all three, it’s also one of the main areas of divergence.</p>
<p>Intel Foundry’s current solution, prior to fully integrated 3D-ICs, is to develop what industry sources describe as “sockets” for chiplets. Instead of characterizing each chiplet for a commercial marketplace, the company defines the specification and the interface so that chiplet vendors can develop these limited-function mini-chips to meet those specs. That addresses one of the big stumbling blocks for a commercial chiplet marketplace. All the pieces need to work together, from data speed to thermal and noise management.</p>
<p>Intel’s scheme relies heavily on its Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB), first introduced in 2014. “The really cool thing about an EMIB base is you can add any amount of chiplets,” said Lalitha Immaneni, vice president of technology development at Intel. “We don’t have a limitation on the number of IPs that we can use in design, and it won’t increase the interposer size, so it’s cost-effective and it’s agnostic of the process. We have given out a package assembly design kit, which is like your traditional PDK for the assembly. We give them the design rules, the reference flows, and we tell them the allowable constructions. It will also give them any collaterals that we need to take it into our assembly.”</p>
<p>Depending upon the design, there can be multiple EMIBs in a package, complemented by thermal interface materials (TIMs), in order to dissipate heat that can become trapped inside a package. TIMs typically are pads that are engineered to conduct heat away from the source, and they are becoming more common as the amount of compute inside a package increases and as the substrates are thinned to shorten the distance signals need to travel.</p>
<p>But the thinner the substrate, the less effective it is at heat dissipation, which can result in thermal gradients that are workload-dependent and therefore difficult to anticipate. Eliminating that heat may require TIMs, additional heat sinks, and potentially even more exotic cooling approaches such as microfluidics.</p>
<p>Both TSMC and Samsung offer bridges, as well. Samsung has embedded bridges inside the RDL — an approach it calls 2.3D or I-Cube ETM — and it’s using them to connect sub-systems to those bridges in order to speed time to working silicon. Instead of relying on a socket approach, some of the integration work will be pre-done in known-good modules.</p>
<p>“Putting together two, four, or eight CPUs into a system is something that very sophisticated customers know how to go out and do,” said <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/arm/">Arm</a> CEO Rene Haas, in a keynote speech at a recent Samsung Foundry event. “But if you want to build an SoC that has 128 CPUs attached to a neural network, memory structures, interrupt controllers that interface to an NPU, an off-chip bus to go to another chiplet, that is a lot of work. In the last year and a half, we’ve seen a rush of people building these complex SoCs wanting more from us.”</p>
<p>Samsung also has been building mini-consortia [1] of chiplet providers, targeted at specific markets. The initial concept is that one company builds an I/O die, another builds the interconnect, and a third builds the logic, and when that is proven to work, then others are added into the mix to provide more choices for customers.</p>
<p>TSMC has experimented with a number of different options, including both RDL and non-RDL bridges, fan-outs, 2.5D chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS), and System On Integrated Chips (SoIC), a 3D-IC concept in which chiplets are packed and stacked inside a substrate using very short interconnects. In fact, TSMC has a process design kit for just about every application, and it has been active in creating assembly design kits for advanced packaging, including reference designs to go with them.</p>
<p>The challenge is that foundry customers willing to invest in these complex packages increasingly want very customized solutions. To facilitate that, TSMC rolled out a new language called 3Dblox, a top-down design scheme that fuses physical and connectivity constructs, allowing assertions to be applied across both. This sandbox approach allows customers to leverage any of its packaging approaches — InFO, CoWoS, and SoIC. It’s also essential to TSMC’s business model, because the company is the only pure-play foundry of the three [2] — although both Intel and Samsung have distanced their foundry operations in recent months.</p>
<p>“We started from a concept of modularization,” said Jim Chang, vice president of advanced technology and mask engineering at TSMC, in a presentation when 3Dblox was first introduced in 2023. “We can build a full 3D-IC stacking with this kind of language syntax plus assertions.”</p>
<p>Chang said the genesis of this was a lack of consistency between the physical and connectivity design tools. But he added that once this approach was developed, it also enabled reuse of chiplets in different designs because much of the characterization was already well-defined and the designs are modular.</p>

<strong>Fig. 1: TSMC’s 3Dblox approach. Source: TSMC</strong></p>
<p>Samsung followed with its own system description language, 3DCODE, in December 2023. Both Samsung and TSMC claim their languages are standards, but they’re more like new foundry rule decks because it’s unlikely these languages will be used outside of their own ecosystems. Intel’s 2.5D approach doesn’t require a new language because the rules are dictated by the socket specification, trading off some customization with a shortened time to market and a simpler approach for chiplet developers.</p>
<p><strong>The chiplet challenge</strong><br>
Chiplets have obvious benefits. They can be designed independently at whatever process node makes sense, which is particularly important for analog features. But figuring out how to put the pieces together with predictable results has been a major challenge. The initial LEGO-like architecture scheme floated by DARPA has proven much more complicated than first envisioned, and it has required a massive and ongoing efforts by broad ecosystems to make it work.</p>
<p>Chiplets need to be precisely synchronized so that critical data is processed, stored, and retrieved without delay. Otherwise, there can be timing issues, in which one computation is either delayed or out-of-sync with other computations, leading to delays and potential deadlocks. In the context of mission- or safety-critical applications, the loss of a fraction of a second can have serious consequences.</p>
<p>Simplifying the design process, particularly with domain-specific designs where one size does not fit all, is an incredibly complex endeavor. The goal for all three foundries is to provide more options for companies that will be developing high-performance, low-power chips. With an estimated 30% to 35% of all leading-edge design starts now in the hands of large systems companies such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla, the economics of leading-edge chip and package design have changed significantly, and so have the PPA/C formulas and tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Chips developed for these systems companies probably will not be sold commercially. So if they can achieve higher performance per watt, then the design and manufacturing costs can be offset by lower cooling power and higher utilization rates — and potentially fewer servers. The reverse is true for chips sold into mobile devices and commodity servers, where high development costs can be amortized across huge volumes. The economics for customized designs in advanced packages work for both, but for very different reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling down, up, and out</strong><br>
It’s assumed that within these complex systems of chiplets there will be multiple types of processors, some highly specialized and others more general-purpose. At least some of these will likely be developed at the most advanced process nodes due to limited power budgets. Advanced nodes still provide higher energy efficiency, which allows more transistors to be packed into the same area in order to improve performance. This is critical for AI/ML applications, where processing more data faster requires more multiply/accumulate operations in highly parallel configurations. Smaller transistors provide greater energy efficiency, allowing more processing per square millimeter of silicon, but the gate structure needs to be changed to prevent leakage, which is why forksheet FETs and CFETs are on the horizon.</p>
<p>Put simply, process leadership still has value. Being first to market with a leading-edge process is good for business, but it’s only one piece of a much larger puzzle. All three foundries have announced plans to push well into the angstrom range. Intel plans to introduce its 18A this year, followed by 14A a couple years later.</p>

<p>From a process node standpoint, all three foundries are on the same track. But advances are no longer tied to the process node alone. The focus increasingly is about latency and performance per watt in a specific domain, and this is where stacking logic-on-logic in a true 3D-IC configuration will excel, using hybrid bonds to connect chiplets to a substrate and each other. Moving electrons through a wire on a planar die is still the fastest (assuming a signal doesn’t have to travel from one end of the die to another), but stacking transistors on top of other transistors is the next best thing, and in some cases even better than a planar SoC because some vertical signal paths may be shorter.</p>
<p>In a recent presentation, Taejoong Song, Samsung Foundry’s vice president of foundry business development, showed a roadmap featuring logic-on-logic mounted on a substrate, combining a 2nm (SF2) die on top of a 4nm (SF4X) die, both mounted on top of another substrate. This is basically a 3D-IC on a 2.5D package, which is the 3.5D or 5.5D concept mentioned earlier. Song said the foundry will begin stacking an SF1.4 on top of SF2P, starting in 2027. What’s particularly attractive about this approach are the thermal dissipation possibilities. With the logic separated from other functions, heat can be channeled away from the stacked dies through the substrate or any of the five exposed sides.</p>

<p>Intel, meanwhile, will leverage its Foveros Direct 3D to stack logic on logic, either face-to-face or face-to-back. The approach allows chips or wafers from different foundries, with the connection bandwidth determined by the copper via pitch, according to a new Intel white paper. The paper noted that the first version would use a copper pitch of 9µm, while the second generation would use a 3µm pitch.</p>

<p>“The true 3D-IC comes with Foveros, and then also with hybrid bonds,” said Intel’s Immaneni. “You cannot go in the tradition route of design where you put it together and run validation, and then find, ‘Oops, I have an issue.’ You cannot afford to do this anymore because you’re impacting your time to market. So you really want to provide a sandbox to make it predictable. But even before I step into this detailed design environment, I want to run my mechanical/electrical/thermal analysis. I want to look at the connectivity so I don’t have opens and shorts. The burden for 3D-IC resides more in the code design than the execution.”</p>
<p>Foveros allows an active logic die to be stacked on either another active or passive die, with the base die used to connect all the die in a package at a 36 micron pitch. By leveraging advanced sort, Intel claims it can guarantee 99% known good die, and 97% yield at post-assembly test.</p>
<p>TSMC’s CoWoS, meanwhile, already is in use by NVIDIA and AMD for their advanced packaging for AI chips. CoWoS is essentially a 2.5D approach, using an interposer to connect SoCs and HBM memory using through-silicon vias. The company’s plans for SoIC are more ambitious, packaging both memory on logic along with other elements, such as sensors, in a 3D-IC at the front end of the line. This can significantly reduce assembly time of multiple layers, sizes, and functions. TSMC contends that its bonding scheme enables faster and shorter connections than other 3D-IC approaches. One report said Apple will begin using TSMC’s SoIC technology starting next year, while AMD will expand its use of this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Other innovations</strong><br>
Putting the process and packaging technology in place opens the door to a much broader set of competitive options. Unlike in the past, when big chipmakers, equipment vendors, and EDA companies defined the roadmap for chips, the chiplet world provides the tools for end customers to make those decisions. This is due, in no small part, to the number of features that can be put into a package versus those that can fit inside the reticle limits of an SoC. Packages can be expanded horizontally or vertically, as needed, and in some cases they can improve performance just through vertical floor-planning.</p>
<p>But given the vast opportunity in the cloud and the edge — particularly with the rollout of AI everywhere — the three big foundries, as well as their ecosystems, are racing to developing new capabilities and features. In some cases, this involves leveraging what they already have. In other cases, it requires brand new technologies.</p>
<p>For example, Samsung has started detailing plans about custom HBM, which includes 3D DRAM stacks with a configurable logic layer underneath. This is the second time around for this approach. Back in 2011, Samsung and Micron co-developed the Hybrid Memory Cube, packaging a DRAM stack on a layer of logic. HBM won the war after JEDEC turned it into a standard, and HMC largely disappeared. But there was nothing wrong with the HMC approach, other than perhaps bad timing.</p>
<p>In its new form, Samsung plans to offer customized HBM as an option. Memory is one of the key elements that determine performance, and the ability to read/write and move data back and forth more quickly between memory and processors can have a big impact on performance and power. And those numbers can be significantly better if the memory is right-sized to a specific workload or data type, and if some of the processing can be done inside the memory module so there is less data to move.</p>

<p>Intel, meanwhile, has been working on a better way to deliver power to densely packed transistors, a persistent problem as the transistor density and number of metal layers increases. In the past, power was delivered from the top of the chip down, but two problems have emerged at the most advanced nodes. One is the challenge of actually delivering enough power to every transistor. The second is noise, which can come from power, substrates, or electromagnetic interference. Without proper shielding — something that is becoming more difficult at each new node due to thinner dielectrics and wires — that noise can impact signal integrity.</p>
<p>Delivering power through the backside of a chip minimizes those kinds of issues and reduces wiring congestion. But it also adds other challenges, such as how to drill holes through a thinner substrate without structural damage. Intel apparently has solved these issues, with plans to offer its PowerVia backside power scheme this year.</p>
<p>TSMC said it plans to deliver backside power delivery at A16 in 2026/2027. Samsung is roughly on the same schedule, delivering it in the SF2Z 2nm process.</p>
<p>Intel also has announced plans for glass substrates, which can provide better planarity and lower defectivity than CMOS. This is especially important at advanced nodes, where even nano-sized pits can cause issues. As with backside power delivery, handling issues abound. The upside is that glass has the same coefficient of thermal expansion as silicon, so it is compatible with the expansion and contraction of silicon components, such as chiplets. After years of sitting on the sidelines, glass is suddenly very attractive. In fact, both TSMC and Samsung are working on glass substrates, as well, and the whole industry is starting to design with glass, handle it without cracking it, and to inspect it.</p>
<p>TSMC, meanwhile, has focused heavily on building an ecosystem and expanding its process offerings. Numerous industry sources say TSMC’s real strength is the ability to deliver process development kits for just about any process or package. The foundry produces about 90% of the most advanced chips globally, according to Nikkei. It also has the most experience with advanced packaging of any foundry, and the largest and broadest ecosystem, which is important.</p>
<p>That ecosystem is critical. The chip industry is so complex and varied that no single company can do everything. The question going forward will be how complete those ecosystems truly are, particularly if the number of processes continues to grow. For example, EDA vendors are essential enablers, and for any process or packaging approach to be successful, design teams need automation. But the more processes and packaging options, the more difficult it will be for EDA vendors to support every incremental change or improvement, and potentially the greater the lag time between announcement and delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
The recent supply chain glitches and geopolitics have convinced the United States and Europe that they need to re-shore and “friend-shore” manufacturing. The investments in semiconductor fabs, equipment, tools, and research are unprecedented. How that affects the three largest foundries remains to be seen, but it certainly is providing some of the impetus behind new technologies such as co-packaged optics, a raft of new materials, and cryogenic computing.</p>
<p>The impact of all of these changes on market share is becoming harder to track. It’s no longer about which foundry is producing chips at the smallest process node, or even the number of chips being shipped. A single advanced package may have dozens of chiplets. The real key is the ability to deliver solutions that matter to customers, quickly and efficiently. In some cases the driver will be performance per watt, while in others it may be time to results with power as a secondary consideration. And in still others, it may be a combination of features that only one of the leading-edge foundries can provide in sufficient quantity. But what is clear is that the foundry race is significantly more complex than ever before, and becoming more so. In this highly complex world, simple metrics for comparison no longer apply.</p>

<p>It turns out that similar problems have been occurring for months without much awareness, despite the fact that many may view this as an isolated incident. Users of Debian and Rocky Linux also experienced significant disruptions as a result of CrowdStrike updates, raising serious concerns about the company's software update and testing procedures. These occurrences highlight potential risks for customers who rely on their products daily.</p>

<p>In April, a CrowdStrike update caused all Debian Linux servers in a civic tech lab to crash simultaneously and refuse to boot. The update proved incompatible with the latest stable version of Debian, despite the specific Linux configuration being supposedly supported. The lab's IT team discovered that removing CrowdStrike allowed the machines to boot and reported the incident.</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>A team member involved in the incident expressed dissatisfaction with CrowdStrike's delayed response. It took them weeks to provide a root cause analysis after acknowledging the issue a day later. The analysis revealed that the Debian Linux configuration was not included in their test matrix.</p>

<p>"Crowdstrike's model seems to be 'we push software to your machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent, without testing it'," lamented the team member.</p>

<p>This was not an isolated incident. CrowdStrike users also reported similar issues after upgrading to RockyLinux 9.4, with their servers crashing due to a kernel bug. Crowdstrike support acknowledged the issue, highlighting a pattern of inadequate testing and insufficient attention to compatibility issues across different operating systems.</p>

<p>To avoid such issues in the future, CrowdStrike should prioritize rigorous testing across all supported configurations. Additionally, organizations should approach CrowdStrike updates with caution and have contingency plans in place to mitigate potential disruptions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>February 8, 2023 — </span><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php">Dr. John Ousterhout</a> is a computer science luminary who has made significant contributions to the field of computer science, particularly in the areas of operating systems and file systems. He is the creator of the <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/tcl.html">Tcl</a> scripting language, and has also worked on several major software projects, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system">Log-Structured file system</a> and the <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/sprite-os.html">Sprite operating system</a>. John Ousterhout's creation of Tcl has had a lasting impact on the technology industry, transforming the way developers think about scripting and automation.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<div><h4>What is unique about Tcl?</h4>
<p><strong>Dr. Ousterhout:</strong> I would highlight 2 things:</p>
</div>
<p>The first thing is its embeddable nature: I designed Tcl so that the library could be embedded in applications, with Tcl providing generic scripting features and the application adding its own commands to the built-in command set. The boundary between Tcl and the application is extremely fluid, and applications can extend Tcl in very powerful ways, such as adding new control structures to the  language. I don't think any other scripting language has achieved embeddability to the degree that Tcl did.</p>
<p>The second thing is Tcl's "everything is a string" philosophy. This played a big role in Tcl's embeddability and made it easy to extend Tcl in a variety of ways. But, it also carried a performance penalty; even with a lot of work, Tcl has never become as efficient as other languages with more traditional types, such as <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/python.html">Python</a>. The string focus is also responsible for Tcl's unusual command syntax, which some people love and some people hate.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<p><h4>How different would Tcl be had you stayed on with the development team? :)</h4>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ousterhout:</strong> I don't think it would have been very different. Tcl was quite mature by the time I passed off development responsibility. Tcl had its heyday in the 1990's, due in large part to the power of the <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/tk.html">Tk toolkit</a> and the awfulness of the other X Window GUI toolkits; Tcl/Tk was the easiest and most powerful way to create GUI apps. Unfortunately, Tcl didn't make the jump to the Web, and most of the applications for which people would have used Tcl in the 1990s became Web applications.</p>
<p>Interesting footnote: the founding of Netscape occurred at the same time I was deciding where to go in industry when I left Berkeley in 1994. Jim Clarke and Marc Andreessen approached me about the possibility of my joining Netscape as a founder, but I eventually decided against it (they hadn't yet decided to do Web stuff when I talked with them). This is one of the biggest "what if" moments of my career. If I had gone to Netscape, I think there's a good chance that Tcl would have become the browser language instead of <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/javascript.html">JavaScript</a> and the world would be a different place! However, in retrospect I'm not sure that Tcl would actually be a better language for the Web than JavaScript, so maybe the right thing happened.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<p><h4>As a long time educator, what do you predict the next paradigm shift in programming languages will be?</h4>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ousterhout:</strong> I don't really know. It used to be that every 5-10 years a major new language came along, but it's been almost 20 or years since the last interesting new language I can think of (<a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/go.html">Go</a>). Maybe others would count <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/rust.html">Rust</a>, in which case maybe the 5-10 year interval is still holding.</p>
<p>One interesting note on this. Historically, I think the most widely used programming linkages have come not from the programming language research committee, but rather from people who build systems and wanted a language to help themselves. PL researchers tend to create languages that are useful for PL researchers: they have interesting theoretical and conceptual properties (e.g., <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/ml.html">ML</a>) but aren't usually useful for real systems. Systems people create languages that are useful for systems builders, so they get widely adopted. Examples are <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/c.html">C</a>, <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/cpp.html">C++</a> (I think?), <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/perl.html">Perl</a>, <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/java.html">Java</a>, and <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/go.html">Go</a>. I would put <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/tcl.html">Tcl</a> in this category as well, and perhaps <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/python.html">Python</a> also?</p>

<h2> INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec1-1" id="sec1-1">
<h3> The Romans</h3>
<p> When a cultural group overruns a large area or territory and spreads its ideas and philosophy, we might see changes in the state of human health as a consequence. The Romans conquered a huge empire and altered the lives of its subjects for centuries. Using changes in the ancient parasites present in the regions under Roman control, this study investigates whether Romanization can be seen to have altered the balance of disease experienced by the people who lived in Europe and the Mediterranean region 2000 years ago.</p>
<p> The city of Rome was traditionally founded in 753 BC, and in 509 BC, the Roman Republic was founded (Lintott, <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Lintott</span>2000</a>). In 31 BC, Augustus became the first Roman Emperor following a series of civil wars (Kershaw, <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Kershaw</span>2013</a>). Imperial Rome reached its greatest extent in the 3rd century AD, when the empire covered all the lands from coastal North Africa, the Near East, southern and western Europe and much of Britain (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>). While the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 AD with the conquest of Rome, the Eastern Empire with its capital of Constantinople lasted until 1453 AD as the Byzantine Empire (Brownworth, <a href="#ref16"><span>Reference Brownworth</span>2009</a>; Stathakopoulos, <a href="#ref102"><span>Reference Stathakopoulos</span>2014</a>).

<div><p><span>Fig. 1.</span> Map of the Roman Empire at the time of Emperor Trajan, around 117 AD.</p>
</div></div>
<p> The Roman Empire was a place of great mobility, both voluntary and forced. Soldiers, government officials, merchants and slaves moved all over the empire, and Rome itself was a major draw for the ambitious (Handley, <a href="#ref36"><span>Reference Handley</span>2011</a>). We might potentially find evidence for spread of people with infections if we were to find parasites, endemic in one part of the empire, in a region where their life cycle would make an endemic focus of disease impossible. While the process of ‘Romanization’ is debated, the Romans were well-known for bringing their ideas about literature, engineering, culture, cuisine, religion and hygiene wherever they ruled (Pitts and Versluys, <a href="#ref90"><span>Reference Pitts and Versluys</span>2015</a>). It is clear from modern research and theoretical modelling that good sanitation should have improved the health of past populations compared with those who have no sanitation (Mitchell, <a href="#ref79"><span>Reference Mitchell and Mitchell</span>2015<em>a</em>
</a>). The spread of Roman knowledge such as clean fresh water in aqueducts, under floor heating for houses, elaborate bathhouses for washing, flushing toilets, civic drains and sewers could in theory have improved the health of the inhabitants (Hobson, <a href="#ref45"><span>Reference Hobson</span>2009</a>; Yegül, <a href="#ref113"><span>Reference Yegül</span>2010</a>; Jansen <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref51"><span>Reference Jansen, Koloski-Ostrow and Moorman</span>2011</a>; Koloski-Ostrow, <a href="#ref64"><span>Reference Koloski-Ostrow</span>2015</a>). In this paper, we will look at the evidence for parasites in Roman times, and by comparing with the situation before and after the Romans we will assess if these forms of sanitation seem to have led to a health benefit to those living under Roman rule.</p>

<h3> How to study ancient parasites (palaeoparasitology)</h3>
<p> The eggs of most intestinal helminths can be preserved for thousands of years in the right conditions, due to their tough chitinous walls. Human feces in archaeological contexts can be recovered from latrine soil, coprolites (preserved pieces of human feces) and the pelvic soil from burials, where the intestinal contents would have decomposed after death (Reinhard <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref95"><span>Reference Reinhard, Confalonieri, Ferreira, Herrmann and Araújo</span>1986</a>; Warnock and Reinhard, <a href="#ref111"><span>Reference Warnock and Reinhard</span>1992</a>; Araújo <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref7"><span>Reference Araújo, Reinhard and Ferreira</span>2015</a>; Rácz <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref93"><span>Reference Rácz, Pucu de Aráujo, Jensen, Mostek, Morrow, Van Hove, Bianucci, Willems, Heller, Aráujo and Reinhard</span>2015</a>). While parasite eggs may also be found in ancient rubbish tips, pits or wells, it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate whether these eggs originated from humans rather than animals. For example, whipworm (<em>Trichuris trichiura</em>) in humans is indistinguishable on light microscopy from <em>Trichuris suis</em> in pigs. In such cases, archaeological context and the presence of other parasites unique to animals can help us to determine which origin is more likely (Da Rocha <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Da Rocha, Harter, Le Bailly, Araújo, Ferreira, Serra-Freire and Bouchet</span>2006</a>). If coprolites are being analysed, then fecal bile acids and sterols can help identify whether they are from humans, carnivore or herbivore animals (Shillito <em>et al</em>. <a href="#ref101"><span>Reference Shillito, Bull, Matthew, Almond, Williams and Evershed</span>2011</a>; Baeten <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref10"><span>Reference Baeten, Marinova, De Laet, Degryse, De Vos and Waelkens</span>2012</a>). The ancient DNA of parasites can also be studied to differentiate species that appear similar on microscopy (Leles <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref71"><span>Reference Leles, Araújo, Ferreira, Vicente and Iñiguez</span>2008</a>; Oh <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref86"><span>Reference Oh, Seo, Chai, Lee, Kim, Park and Shin</span>2010</a>). However, this has yet to be undertaken on Roman period parasites.</p>
<p> Identifying ancient parasite eggs does require an understanding of how certain eggs tend to change over archaeological time, known as taphonomy. Roundworm eggs may lose the mammillated outer coat, whipworm may lose the polar plugs and fish tapeworm may lose the operculum. The eggs of some parasite species such as hookworm (<em>Ancylostoma duodenale</em>) and pinworm (<em>Enterobius vermicularis</em>) are particularly fragile and may be easily deformed or lost completely from archaeological samples (Reinhard and Pucu de Araújo, <a href="#ref94"><span>Reference Reinhard, Pucu de Araújo and Zuckerman</span>2014</a>). Research comparing microscopy with genetic techniques suggests that microscopy can underestimate past prevalence for some species, since positive genetic results may occur even when fragile eggs are no longer visible (Jaeger and Iñiguez, <a href="#ref50"><span>Reference Jaeger and Iniguez</span>2014</a>). Evidence for species with fragile eggs are most likely to survive in dried coprolites, but while these are commonly found in the Americas they are very rare in Europe. This means that species with a fragile wall may appear to have been rare or absent in Roman times, when they may in fact have been present.</p>
<p> In order to detect parasite eggs from soil sediments we need to transform solid soil to a liquid suspension, known as disaggregation (Reinhard <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref95"><span>Reference Reinhard, Confalonieri, Ferreira, Herrmann and Araújo</span>1986</a>; Anastasiou and Mitchell, <a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Anastasiou and Mitchell</span>2013<em>a</em>
</a>). Then a number of techniques are available to concentrate the eggs, including flotation, sedimentation and microsieves. This concentrate can be mixed with glycerol and viewed with light microscopy. In a coprolite it is possible to count the number of eggs per gram of soil to estimate the degree of parasitism, but in latrines the egg concentration may be effected as much by the amount of rubbish thrown into the latrine as how concentrated the eggs were in the feces of the various users of the facilities. In consequence, in this paper we will look at the geographic distribution of parasite species rather than egg concentrations in order to evaluate change in parasite infection.</p>
<p> The fragile cysts of intestinal amoeba such as <em>Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia duodenalis</em> and <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em> do not survive well in archaeological soils, and when deformed they are hard to detect with microscopy. A more effective way to detect them has been with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This technique employs antibodies that react to the proteins unique to these organisms, regardless of whether the cysts are deformed or broken (Gonçalves <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref31"><span>Reference Gonçalves, Araújo, Duarte, Pereira da Silva, Reinhard, Bouchet and Ferreira</span>2002</a>, <a href="#ref30"><span>Reference Gonçalves, da Silva, de Andrade, Reinhard, Da Rocha, Le Bailly, Bouchet, Ferreira and Araújo</span>2004</a>; Frías <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref28"><span>Reference Frías, Leles and Araújo</span>2013</a>). Ectoparasites can be detected by fine sieving of soil, and also looking for them on hair combs, mummies or ancient textiles (Mumcuoglu, <a href="#ref82"><span>Reference Mumcuoglu, Raoult and Drancourt</span>2008</a>; Arriaza <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Arriaza, Standen, Reinhard, Araújo, Heukelbach and Dittmar</span>2013</a>; Forbes <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref27"><span>Reference Forbes, Dussault and Bain</span>2013</a>). Mummies also have the potential to preserve the ancient DNA of endoparasites, the proteins secreted by these parasites when alive, and possibly the host antibodies made to fight the infection (Anastasiou and Mitchell, <a href="#ref3"><span>Reference Anastasiou and Mitchell</span>2013<em>b</em>
</a>).</p>
<p> Some endoparasites have the potential to cause anaemia in their human hosts, and we can look for this when we study the skeletal remains of past populations. Examples of parasite infections that often trigger anaemia include malaria, hookworm and schistosomiasis (Garcia, <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Garcia</span>2009</a>). Anaemia can manifest itself in the skeleton with pitting in the roof of the orbits (cribra orbitalia), on the cranial vault of the skull (porotic hyperostosis) and thickening of the cranial vault (Polo-Cerdá <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref91"><span>Reference Polo-Cerdá, Miquel-Feucht, Villalaín-Blanco, La Verghetta and Capasso</span>2001</a>; Walker <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref110"><span>Reference Walker, Bathurst, Richman, Gjerdrum and Andrushko</span>2009</a>). One study investigated the prevalence of these changes in a site close to Imperial Rome (1st–3rd century AD) and compared it with a 7th century AD population nearby (Salvadei <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref98"><span>Reference Salvadei, Ricci and Manzi</span>2001</a>). Cribra orbitalia was present in 60–80% of children at both sites, highlighting how common anaemia was in Roman period Italy.</p>

<h2> PARASITES PRIOR TO THE ROMAN PERIOD</h2>
<p> In order to appreciate the consequences of Romanization following the expansion of the Roman Republic and the subsequent Roman Empire, we need to determine which parasites were present in those people living in the region before the Romans.</p>
<p> In Europe, the inhabitants were hunter-gatherers until around 4000 BC and then started to develop farming in the Neolithic period (4000–2800 BC). The development of metal tools led to the Bronze Age (2800–500 BC) and then Iron Age (700–100 BC). The overlap in dates is due to the gradual spread of these technologies across the continent. In the Neolithic, the intestinal parasites identified were beef or pork tapeworm (<em>Taenia asiatica, Taenia saginata</em> or <em>Taenia solium</em>), bile duct fluke (<em>Opisthorchis</em> sp.), <em>Capillaria</em> sp., <em>E. histolytica</em> dysentery, Fasciola genus liver fluke (<em>Fasciola hepatica</em>), fish tapeworm (<em>Diphyllobothrium</em> sp.), giant kidney worm (<em>Dioctophymidae</em>), hookworm (Ancylostomids), lancet liver fluke (<em>Dicrocoelium</em> sp.), roundworm and whipworm (Bouchet <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Bouchet, Harter and Le Bailly</span>2003</a>; Anastasiou, <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Anastasiou and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). It can be seen that there was a mixture of zoonotic parasites from eating raw or undercooked wild animals (beef/pork tapeworm, bile duct fluke, capillariosis, fish tapeworm, giant kidney worm, lancet liver fluke) and parasites transmitted by the fecal contamination in villages (<em>Entamoeba</em> dysentery, hookworm, roundworm, whipworm).</p>
<p> In Bronze and Iron Age Europe the parasites found were <em>E. histolytica</em> that can cause dysentery, roundworm, whipworm, lancet liver fluke and so far just two examples of fish tapeworm (Bouchet <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Bouchet, Harter and Le Bailly</span>2003</a>; Le Bailly and Bouchet, <a href="#ref68"><span>Reference Le Bailly and Bouchet</span>2013</a>; Anastasiou, <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Anastasiou and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). We do have to consider that fewer Bronze and Iron Age archaeological sites have been studied for parasites than is the case for earlier Neolithic or later Roman and medieval periods. However, we do nevertheless have parasites identified from sites in 7 different European countries in the Bronze and Iron Age (Austria, Britain, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland), so this evidence should reflect the species present reasonably well. It does appear that over time, the number of species affecting people in Europe seems to have decreased from the Neolithic to the Bronze and Iron Age. There seems to have been a shift away from zoonotic parasites contracted from eating raw or undercooked animals, to parasites transmitted by poor personal hygiene (dysentery, roundworm, whipworm). Whether these wild animals were no longer being caught and eaten in the Bronze and Iron Age, or whether the meat was just being cooked better (so killing the parasites), is not entirely clear.</p>
<p> In the Middle East, the ancient parasite evidence before the time of the Romans is more complicated to interpret. This is because human civilization started in the region, where farming, herding and early town and city formation began perhaps 5000 years before they did in Europe (Harris, <a href="#ref39"><span>Reference Harris</span>1996</a>; Zeder, <a href="#ref115"><span>Reference Zeder</span>2011</a>). Major civilizations developed in Mesopotamia and Egypt several millennia before the expansion of the Roman Empire, and so they were already experiencing the effects of higher population density, the challenges of sanitation and long distance trade with the potential spread of infectious diseases. Intestinal parasites found in the region before Roman times include <em>Fasciola</em> genus liver fluke, fish tapeworm, lancet liver fluke, pinworm, roundworm, schistosomiasis (<em>Schistosomiasis haematobium</em> and <em>Schistosomiasis mansoni</em>), <em>Taenia</em> genus tapeworm, threadworm (<em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em>) and whipworm. Mummification in Egypt also allows the identification of endoparasites not preserved by the skeletonized burials of northern Europe, such as the species that cause dracunculiasis, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis (Anastasiou, <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Anastasiou and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). It is clear that there was a very broad range of parasites present in the Middle East and North Africa region prior to the arrival of the Romans. It is quite likely this resulted from the higher population density from existing civilizations, the warm climate and the fact that many parasites of humans originated in Africa (Kliks, <a href="#ref63"><span>Reference Kliks</span>1990</a>; Mitchell, <a href="#ref78"><span>Reference Mitchell</span>2013</a>).</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec3" id="sec3">
<h2> INTESTINAL PARASITES IN THE ROMAN PERIOD</h2>
<p> As the geographical borders of Roman influence varied over time, we will only include evidence from Roman contexts, rather than merely regions that were at some point governed by the Romans. Parasites have been identified from Roman period excavations undertaken in 10 modern countries: Austria, Belgium, Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, The Netherlands and Poland. The sites in Italy itself include Rome, Pompeii and Parma. Others are from cesspits, sewer drains, rubbish pits, bog bodies and mummified burials from across Europe and the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p> Human whipworms were found in 8 countries (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>), and based on current evidence they seem to have been the most widely spread intestinal parasite in the Roman Empire (Jansen and Over, <a href="#ref52"><span>Reference Jansen and Over</span>1962</a>, <a href="#ref53"><span>Reference Jansen, Over and Corradetti</span>1966</a>; Pike, <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Pike, Brothwell and Sandison</span>1968</a>; Wilson and Rackham, <a href="#ref112"><span>Reference Wilson, Rackham and Buckland</span>1976</a>; Jones and Hutchinson, <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Jones, Hutchinson and McCarthy</span>1991</a>; Rousset <em>et al.</em>

<a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Searcey, Reinhard, Egarter-Vigl, Maixner, Piombino-Mascali, Zink, van der Sanden, Gardner and Bianucci</span>2013</a>). This is a fecal oral parasite spread by the contamination of food with feces (Garcia, <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Garcia</span>2009</a>, 332). It could have been spread by the use of unwashed hands to prepare food or by the use of human feces as crop fertilizer.

<p> Human roundworm was the next most widely found parasite species in Roman sites, being identified in 6 countries (Jansen and Over, <a href="#ref52"><span>Reference Jansen and Over</span>1962</a>, <a href="#ref53"><span>Reference Jansen, Over and Corradetti</span>1966</a>; Pike, <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Pike, Brothwell and Sandison</span>1968</a>; Wilson and Rackham, <a href="#ref112"><span>Reference Wilson, Rackham and Buckland</span>1976</a>; Jones and Hutchinson, <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Jones, Hutchinson and McCarthy</span>1991</a>; Rousset <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref97"><span>Reference Rousset, Heron and Metrot</span>1996</a>; Aspöck <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref9"><span>Reference Aspöck, Auer and Picher</span>1999</a>; Searcey <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Searcey, Reinhard, Egarter-Vigl, Maixner, Piombino-Mascali, Zink, van der Sanden, Gardner and Bianucci</span>2013</a>). Just as was the case for whipworm, roundworm is spread by the fecal contamination of food, and so limited hand hygiene and the manuring of crops with human feces would have facilitated its spread.</p>
<p> The fish tapeworms were also found in 6 countries, namely Austria, Britain, France, Germany, Israel and Poland (Szidat, <a href="#ref103"><span>Reference Szidat</span>1944</a>; Jansen and Over, <a href="#ref52"><span>Reference Jansen and Over</span>1962</a>; De Rouffignac, <a href="#ref23"><span>Reference De Rouffignac</span>1985</a>; Le Bailly and Bouchet, <a href="#ref68"><span>Reference Le Bailly and Bouchet</span>2013</a>). They are spread by eating fish of species that spend at least part of their life cycle in fresh water such as rivers or lakes. The parasite eggs of this species will not develop in sea water. If the fish is cooked, this will kill the parasite. Hence, fish tapeworm is typically found in regions where raw, smoked or pickled fish is eaten rather than cooked fish (Garcia, <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Garcia</span>2009</a>, 354).</p>
<p> Beef/pork/Asiatic tapeworms of humans and dog tapeworm (<em>Echinococcus</em> sp.) eggs all appear similar on microscopy so, these can only be identified to species level using ancient DNA analysis. Eggs have been recovered from Roman Period sites in Britain, Egypt, Germany and Israel (Jansen and Over, <a href="#ref52"><span>Reference Jansen and Over</span>1962</a>; De Rouffignac, <a href="#ref23"><span>Reference De Rouffignac</span>1985</a>; Harter <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref41"><span>Reference Harter, Bouchet, Mumcuoglu and Zias</span>2004</a>; Le Bailly <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref70"><span>Reference Le Bailly, Mouze, Rocha, Heim, Lichtenberg, Dunand and Bouchet</span>2010</a>).From human feces, its presence indicates that raw or undercooked beef, pork or similar large farm animals were being eaten by the population.</p>
<p> Lancet liver flukes have been found in Austria, Britain, France, Israel and the Netherlands (Pike, <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Pike, Brothwell and Sandison</span>1968</a>; Aspök <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref9"><span>Reference Aspöck, Auer and Picher</span>1999</a>; Le Bailly and Bouchet, <a href="#ref67"><span>Reference Le Bailly and Bouchet</span>2010</a>; Searcey <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Searcey, Reinhard, Egarter-Vigl, Maixner, Piombino-Mascali, Zink, van der Sanden, Gardner and Bianucci</span>2013</a>). It is generally an infection of animals such as cattle, so if undercooked cow liver is eaten, the eggs of this parasite may end up in human feces, an example of false parasitism. However, <em>Dicrocoelium</em> genus parasites can potentially infect humans and may cause diarrhoea and abdominal bloating. A good example confirming genuine infection of a person in Roman times is the mummy known as Zweeloo woman, dating from 78 to 233 AD (calibrated radiocarbon date). This bog body from the Netherlands was found to have whipworm and roundworm eggs in her intestines, but the eggs of <em>Dicrocoelium dendriticum</em> in the preserved liver (Searcey <em>et al</em>. <a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Searcey, Reinhard, Egarter-Vigl, Maixner, Piombino-Mascali, Zink, van der Sanden, Gardner and Bianucci</span>2013</a>).</p>
<p>
<em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> infection has been detected using ELISA in Roman period samples from latrines and cesspits in Belgium, France and Italy (Gonçalves <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref30"><span>Reference Gonçalves, da Silva, de Andrade, Reinhard, Da Rocha, Le Bailly, Bouchet, Ferreira and Araújo</span>2004</a>; Le Bailly and Bouchet, <a href="#ref66"><span>Reference Le Bailly and Bouchet</span>2006</a>, <a href="#ref69"><span>Reference Le Bailly, Bouchet and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> is spread by the drinking of water contaminated by human feces, and can cause outbreaks of dysentery, with bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain and fevers (Garcia, <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Garcia</span>2009</a>, 256).</p>
<p> Hydatid disease (<em>Echinococcus granulosus</em>) can be identified in archaeological samples from the calcified cysts found in the abdomen or thorax of human burials. If humans inadvertently consume the eggs of this dog tapeworm, the hydatid cysts develop in the organs of the body. Good examples from the Roman period include calcified hydatid cysts in the burial of a 3rd–4th century AD adolescent at Amiens in France, and from 1st century AD Jerusalem (Zias and Mumcuoglu, <a href="#ref117"><span>Reference Zias and Mumcuoglu</span>1991</a>; Mowlavi <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref81"><span>Reference Mowlavi, Kacki, Dupouy-Camet, Mobedi, Makki, Harandi and Naddaf</span>2014</a>).</p>
<p> Pinworm eggs have been found in the mummified remains of a teenage girl and an adult male from the Dakleh Oasis in Egypt (30BC–395 AD), and also in latrine soil from the Essenes sect at Qumran in Israel (100 BC–100 AD) (Horne, <a href="#ref47"><span>Reference Horne</span>2002</a>; Zias <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref118"><span>Reference Zias, Tabor and Harter-Lailheugue</span>2006</a>). It is spread by fecal contamination of hands or by airborne transmission, and causes intense anal itching at night.</p>
<p> Fasciola genus liver fluke eggs have only been found in one Roman period archaeological context, in Egypt (Harter, <a href="#ref40"><span>Reference Harter</span>2003</a>). The liver fluke is contracted by humans who eat unwashed water plants grown in locations where farm animals such as sheep and cattle drop their dung (Garcia, <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Garcia</span>2009</a>, 368).</p>
<p> Capillariosis (<em>Capillaria hepatica</em>) was identified in a burial from France (Mowlavi <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref81"><span>Reference Mowlavi, Kacki, Dupouy-Camet, Mobedi, Makki, Harandi and Naddaf</span>2014</a>). Often capillaria eggs in the feces represent false parasitism, when uncooked animal organs had been consumed and passed unchanged in the feces. However, this example was of capillaria eggs embedded in the calcified wall of a hydatid cyst. This demonstrates genuine infection of the individual with capillariosis while they were alive.</p>
<p> Malaria (<em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>) and toxoplasmosis (<em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>) have been identified from their preserved ancient DNA in an Egyptian mummy dating from the third intermediate to Roman Period (Khairat <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref62"><span>Reference Khairat, Ball, Chang, Bianucci, Nerlich, Trautmann, Ismail, Shanab, Karim, Gad and Pusch</span>2013</a>). Malaria is spread by the bite of mosquitos and infection causes fevers, enlarged liver and spleen, and may cause death especially in children (Garcia, <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Garcia</span>2009</a>, 302). Toxoplasmosis is generally contracted by humans who are in close contact with cats. Since cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt with many being mummified and used as religious offerings (Ikram, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Ikram</span>2005</a>), it is possible this exposure to cats put the inhabitants of Egypt at added risk of contracting this parasite compared with other parts of the Roman Empire.</p>

<h2> ECTOPARASITES IN THE ROMAN PERIOD</h2>
<p> Head lice (<em>Pediculus humanus capitis</em>), body lice (<em>Pediculus humanus corporis</em>), pubic lice (<em>Phthirus pubis</em>), fleas (<em>Pulex irritans</em>) and bed bugs (<em>Cimex lectularius</em>) have been identified at a range of archaeological sites across the world and across time periods (Mumcuoglu, <a href="#ref82"><span>Reference Mumcuoglu, Raoult and Drancourt</span>2008</a>). Ectoparasites from Roman period settlements have been preserved in combs, textiles, tombs and waterlogged soils. While they have not been identified in as many countries as the eggs of intestinal helminths, this seems to reflect the location and interests of those who have been searching for them, and probably does not necessarily indicate their absence from the rest of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p> Head lice and their eggs have been recovered from Roman period wooden combs from the Essene religious sect at Qumran (1st century BC–1st century AD) and the Jewish fortress of Masada (1st century AD), Israel (Mumcuoglu and Zias, <a href="#ref83"><span>Reference Mumcuoglu and Zias</span>1988</a>). Body lice have also been noted on textiles from Masada dating to the time of Jewish revolt against the Romans (66–73 AD) (Mumcuoglu <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref84"><span>Reference Mumcuoglu, Zias, Tarshis, Lavi and Stiebe</span>2003</a>).</p>
<p> In Britain, large numbers of human fleas have been recovered from sediment layers in Roman Period York (Hall and Kenward, <a href="#ref35"><span>Reference Hall, Kenward and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). A pubic louse was recovered from a waterlogged Roman pit dating from the late 1st to mid-2nd century AD Carlisle (Kenward, <a href="#ref59"><span>Reference Kenward</span>1999</a>). The probable remains of a bed bug were found at Roman Alcester in Warwickshire (Osborne, <a href="#ref87"><span>Reference Osborne</span>1971</a>). One study has assessed the number of ectoparasites in sediments in the same town to compare the Roman period with later times. In York, the concentration of ectoparasites in Roman, Viking and medieval layers were similar across the centuries. For example, human head and body lice were found in over 50 archaeological layers and fleas were also routinely detected (Kenward and Hall <a href="#ref60"><span>Reference Kenward and Hall</span>1995</a>, 488-91 and 700-3; Hall and Kenward, <a href="#ref35"><span>Reference Hall, Kenward and Mitchell</span>2015</a>, 114). This suggests that the Roman habit of washing at the public baths does not seem to have decreased their risk of contracting ectoparasites, compared with Vikings and medieval people who did not use public baths in the same way.</p>
<p> Ectoparasites are also known to spread bacterial infectious diseases amongst humans. For example, the body louse can transmit louse-borne relapsing fever (<em>Borrelia recurrentis</em>), epidemic typhus (<em>Rikkettsia prowazekii</em>) and trench fever (<em>Bartonella qintana</em>) (Gunn and Pitt, <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference Gunn and Pitt</span>2012</a>, 157). The ancient DNA of these organisms has been extracted from human skeletal remains and from the lice themselves from post-Roman archaeological sites in the past (Raoult <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Raoult, Dutour, Houhamdi, Jankauskas, Fournier, Ardagna, Drancourt, Signoli, Dang La, Macia and Aboudharam</span>2006</a>; Tran <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref106"><span>Reference Tran, Forestier, Drancourt, Raoult and Aboudharam</span>2011<em>a</em>
</a>). It is therefore quite plausible that some Roman period epidemics could have been caused by these bacterial diseases spread by ectoparasites.</p>
<p> Rodent fleas such as <em>Xenopsylla cheopis</em> are thought to have spread bubonic plague (<em>Yersinia pestis</em>) in recent epidemics among humans. When rats die from plague infection, it has been noted that fleas have to transfer to feed from humans rather than starve themselves, so spreading the disease (Schotthoefer <em>et al</em>. <a href="#ref99"><span>Reference Schotthoefer, Bearden, Holmes, Vetter, Montenieri, Williams, Graham, Woods, Eisen and Gage</span>2011</a>; Chouikha and Hinnebusch, <a href="#ref17"><span>Reference Chouikha and Hinnebusch</span>2012</a>; Bobrov <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Bobrov, Kirillina, Vadyvaloo, Koestler, Hinz, Mack, Waters and Perry</span>2015</a>). It is not entirely clear which ectoparasites were responsible for spreading plague in past pandemics, since the medieval Black Death still spread across areas such as Scandinavia where rats have been shown to have been either absent or very rare (Hufthammer and Walløe, <a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Hufthammer and Walløe</span>2013</a>). The first pandemic of bubonic plague is known as the plague of Justinian, and took place from 541 to 543 AD. It started in the Eastern Roman Empire and then spread across the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean region (Little, <a href="#ref73"><span>Reference Little</span>2011</a>). Ancient DNA analysis of human skeletal remains from mass graves dating to this event has determined the genome sequence of the <em>Y. pestis</em> strain responsible for the pandemic (Harbeck <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref38"><span>Reference Harbeck, Seifert, Hänsch, Wagner, Birdsell, Parise, Wiechmann, Grupe, Thomas, Keim, Zöller, Bramanti, Riehm and Scholz</span>2013</a>; Wagner <em>et al.</em>

This has demonstrated that the strain was much earlier on the evolutionary tree than modern plague strains, highlighting considerable evolution of the bacterium over the last 1500 years.</p>

<h2> HOW DID THE ROMANS CHANGE PARASITISM ACROSS THE EMPIRE?</h2>
<p> If we are going to assess the impact of Romanization across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, then it is important to compare the evidence for parasites before, during and after the Romans. We have to be careful how we do this, to ensure the conclusions are not misleading due to limitations in the evidence. Some parasites eggs are more fragile than others (such as hookworm and pinworm) and so could have been present in the past despite lack of surviving evidence. In consequence, I will not make claims about the meaning of the presence or absence of these species here. Similarly, some time periods may have been better studied in the past and this might give us more evidence for parasites at the time. In the geographic region under study, there have extremely few studies of parasites in the Paleolithic period, a moderate number in the Neolithic, fewer in the Bronze and Iron Age, a moderate number in the Roman period and a large number in the medieval period. This must be borne in mind when comparing change between the Bronze and Iron Ages with the Roman period, in particular. However, I would argue that we actually have a fairly good idea of the parasites present in the Bronze and Iron Ages for the region that would later become the Roman Empire. There is evidence for the species present in what is now Austria, Britain, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Israel and Poland, and in some countries a number of different Bronze and Iron Age sites have been analysed (Aspöck <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref9"><span>Reference Aspöck, Auer and Picher</span>1999</a>; Anastasiou, <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Anastasiou and Mitchell</span>2015</a>; Anastasiou and Mitchell, <a href="#ref4"><span>Reference Anastasiou, Mitchell and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). This means that if tough-walled parasite species are absent across all or many of these excavations, it is quite likely to indicate that the species was either rare or absent at that time.</p>
<p> Before the Romans, the Neolithic farmers of Europe and Mediterranean region could be infected with a combination of zoonotic endoparasites such as fish tapeworm, Lancet liver fluke, Fasciola genus liver fluke, bile duct fluke, capillariosis and also parasite species specifically evolved to infect humans such as roundworm, whipworm, hookworm, beef/pork tapeworm and <em>Entamoeba</em> dysentery protozoa. However, by the time of the Bronze and Iron Age there had already been a shift away from zoonotic parasites so that parasites spread by poor sanitation dominated. Interestingly, this is mirrored by modern nomadic hunter-gatherer societies who settle and become farmers (Dounias and Froment, <a href="#ref24"><span>Reference Dounias and Froment</span>2006</a>). Hence, at the time the Romans expanded their empire the dominant parasites in Europe were roundworm, whipworm and <em>Entamoeba</em> protozoa that cause dysentery. Interestingly, Lancet liver fluke was also fairly widespread, suggesting that ants were either accidentally or deliberately consumed. The picture in the Middle East and North Africa at the arrival of the Romans is more complex as ancient civilizations already existed there. In these regions, the range of endemic species was much greater than was the case for Europe.</p>
<p> At the time of the Romans, we see the most widespread and dominant species were roundworm and whipworm. The Romans are credited with spreading the concept of hygienic latrines across the empire, with contoured seats, flushing systems, personal hygiene with a sponge on a stick and hand washing (Hobson, <a href="#ref45"><span>Reference Hobson</span>2009</a>; Jansen <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref43"><span>Reference Heirbaut, Jones, Wheeler, Jansen, Koloski-Ostrow and Moormann</span>2011</a>; Antoniou and Angelakis, <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Antoniou, Angelakis and Mitchell</span>2015</a>; Koloski-Ostrow, <a href="#ref64"><span>Reference Koloski-Ostrow</span>2015</a>). They introduced the culture of person cleanliness with the regular washing in heated public baths (Yegül, <a href="#ref113"><span>Reference Yegül</span>2010</a>). The Romans also introduced legislation whereby human waste from towns and cities would be collected in carts and taken out to the countryside (Taylor, <a href="#ref104"><span>Reference Taylor and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). Modern research has shown that clean drinking water, latrine use and hand washing all decrease the prevalence of geohelminths such as whipworm and roundworm (Zeigelbauer <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref116"><span>Reference Zeigelbauer, Speich, Mäusezahl, Bos, Keiser and Utzinger</span>2012</a>). In view of this, we might expect the prevalence of fecal oral parasites such as whipworm and roundworm to drop in Roman times rather than increase. However, this was not the case and we must ask ourselves why.</p>
<p> One possibility is that the eggs of roundworms and whipworms were spread via the warm communal waters of the Roman bathhouses. In some baths the water was only changed intermittently, and could acquire a scum on the surface from human dirt and cosmetics. Clearly, not all Roman baths were as clean as they might have been (Fagan, <a href="#ref25"><span>Reference Fagan and Jansen</span>2000</a>; Yegül, <a href="#ref113"><span>Reference Yegül</span>2010</a>). Another possible explanation is that the Romans were known to have used the human feces collected from towns to fertilize crops growing in the fields (Jones, <a href="#ref58"><span>Reference Jones</span>2012</a>; Taylor, <a href="#ref104"><span>Reference Taylor and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). This has been shown in modern research to increase crop yields (Heinonen-Tanski and van-Wijk-Sebesma, <a href="#ref42"><span>Reference Heinonen-Tanski and van Wijk-Sebesma</span>2005</a>). However, unless the feces are composted for many months before being added to the fields, this can result in the spread of viable parasite eggs to the plants grown (Phuc <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref88"><span>Reference Phuc, Konradsen, Phuong, Cam and Dalsgaard</span>2006</a>; Jensen <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref54"><span>Reference Jensen, Phuc, Knudsen, Dalsgaard and Konradsen</span>2008</a>). Hence, it may be the use of human feces as crop fertilizer under the Romans that led to an increase in roundworm and whipworm despite their use of sanitation technologies.</p>
<p> Fish tapeworms were found to be surprisingly widespread in the Roman period. This is in contrast to Bronze and Iron Age Europe, where fish tapeworm eggs have only been in France and Germany (Le Bailly and Bouchet, <a href="#ref68"><span>Reference Le Bailly and Bouchet</span>2013</a>). Bearing in mind there are Bronze and Iron Age sites where parasites have been identified from 7 different countries, the identification of fish tapeworm in just 2 countries suggests the parasite was relatively uncommon at that time. In the Roman period it was identified in 6 countries, which was as many as roundworm. Roundworm and whipworm are perceived by modern researchers to have been more ubiquitous in past farming populations than all other intestinal helminths (Reinhard <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref96"><span>Reference Reinhard, Ferreira, Bouchet, Sianto, Dutra, Iñiguez, Leles, Le Bailly, Fugassa, Pucu and Araújo</span>2013</a>; Reinhard and Pucu de Araújo, <a href="#ref94"><span>Reference Reinhard, Pucu de Araújo and Zuckerman</span>2014</a>). However, this study has shown for the first time quite how widespread fish tapeworm was at the time of the Romans. It is unlikely that the increase in its detection in Roman period samples is due to chance. It is notable that five of the 6 countries where fish tapeworm was identified were in northern Europe. In northern Europe it was common in the past to smoke, dry, salt or pickle fish to preserve it, and it was often eaten uncooked (Hoffman, <a href="#ref46"><span>Reference Hoffman</span>2003</a>; Hagen, <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Hagen</span>2006</a>, 275–276). The culture of eating uncooked fish may be one element as to why the parasite was quite widespread at this time, but does not explain why there appears to have been an increase between the Bronze/Iron Age and the Roman Period. We must ask ourselves which aspect of Romanization in Europe seems to have triggered this apparent rise in fish tapeworm.</p>
<p> One possibility that could explain a change in fish tapeworm distribution in the Roman period is the Roman enthusiasm for fish sauce, known as garum, liquamen or muria (Cool, <a href="#ref18"><span>Reference Cool</span>2006</a>, 58). It was not only used as a culinary ingredient, but also as a medicine (Curtis, <a href="#ref20"><span>Reference Curtis</span>1984</a>). Garum was a fermented sauce made from pieces of fish, herbs, salt and flavourings. This sauce was not cooked, but allowed to ferment in the sun (Curtis, <a href="#ref19"><span>Reference Curtis</span>1983</a>). Garum seems to have its origins in the Mediterranean region, but over time was made in northern Europe where fish tapeworm was much more common. Archaeological examples of garum in Roman pottery vessels have been recovered at many sites, and the bones of fish from these pots include both sea fish and fresh water fish (Van Neer <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref108"><span>Reference Van Neer, Wouters, Ervynck and Maes</span>2005</a>; Locker, <a href="#ref74"><span>Reference Locker</span>2007</a>). Garum was traded right across the empire, ensuring that people living in regions that were not endemic for fish tapeworm would still have been at risk of contracting the parasite (Curtis, <a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Curtis</span>1988</a>; Haley, <a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Haley</span>1990</a>). It is quite possible that this fermented fish sauce may have acted as a vector for the spread of fish tapeworm and hence contributed to the rise in the archaeological evidence for fish tapeworm in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p> We can see that in Roman times we still have evidence for genuine parasitism of humans by zoonotic parasites that generally affect animals rather than humans today. The Zweeloo woman bog body was found to have infection by Lancet liver fluke in her liver at the time of death (Searcey <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Searcey, Reinhard, Egarter-Vigl, Maixner, Piombino-Mascali, Zink, van der Sanden, Gardner and Bianucci</span>2013</a>). An individual from 3rd to 4th century Amiens in France was found to have the eggs of <em>C. hepatica</em> entombed in the calcified walls of hydatid cysts, so demonstrating a case of true infective capillariosis during their life (Mowlavi <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref81"><span>Reference Mowlavi, Kacki, Dupouy-Camet, Mobedi, Makki, Harandi and Naddaf</span>2014</a>). This illustrates how certain parasites that rarely infect humans today may have caused active infection in past peoples living a less hygienic life style than in modern times.</p>
<p> In Roman times, we have parasite species such as beef and pork tapeworm spread by the consumption of farm animals. We also see the appearance of echinococcosis from dog tapeworm, compatible with the close contact between humans and dogs kept for herding animals or as pets (O'Connor, <a href="#ref85"><span>Reference O'Connor</span>2008</a>). In Egypt, the reverence for cats may have facilitated the spread of toxoplasmosis in Roman times there.</p>
<p> It is also interesting to consider the absence of certain parasites in the Roman Empire. We might expect to have found the eggs of <em>S. haematobium</em> or <em>S. mansoni</em> in Roman latrines in Europe as soldiers, officials and merchants moved between the Middle East and the rest of the empire. There is good archaeological evidence for such migrations from analysis of skull shape, stable isotopes in teeth and written Roman texts (Leach <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref65"><span>Reference Leach, Lewis, Chenery, Müldner and Eckardt</span>2009</a>). Schistosomiasis has been identified in Syria and Egypt well before the Roman Period (Anastasiou <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref5"><span>Reference Anastasiou, Lorentz, Stein and Mitchell</span>2014</a>; Anastasiou and Mitchell, <a href="#ref4"><span>Reference Anastasiou, Mitchell and Mitchell</span>2015</a>). Both <em>S. haematobium</em> and <em>S. mansoni</em> have been recovered from medieval latrines in France dating from 1450 to 1550 AD, indicating the migration of travellers between France and areas endemic for schistosomiasis (Bouchet and Paicheler, <a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Bouchet and Paicheler</span>1995</a>; Bouchet <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref14"><span>Reference Bouchet, Harter, Paicheler, Araújo and Ferreira</span>2002</a>). However, such evidence for migration with parasites has yet to be identified at Roman period sites.</p>
<p> We can get an indication of how parasite infection changed after the Roman Period by comparing excavations of levels from different time periods at the same sites. In Italy, whipworm was the only species of helminth egg recovered from Roman Period Parma. This is in contrast to the 6 species found in the same town during the medieval period (roundworm, whipworm, lancet liver fluke, fish tapeworm, <em>Taenia/Echinococcus</em> sp. and <em>Capillaria</em> sp.) (Bosi <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref12"><span>Reference Bosi, Mazzanti, Florenzano, N'siala, Pederzoli, Rinaldi, Torri and Mercuri</span>2011</a>; Florenzano <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref26"><span>Reference Florenzano, Mercuri, Pederzoli, Torri, Bosi, Olmi, Rinaldi and Mazzanti</span>2012</a>). This increase in species found in the same time over this 1000-year period gives an indication of how parasite infections do appear to have been rather different in Roman times compared with later periods. The change may reflect the increasing population size of medieval towns compared with most classical towns in Europe outside Rome itself, as larger populations generally sustain infectious diseases better than small populations. In the medieval period fish tapeworm was even more common than in the Roman Empire, and this may reflect the spread of Christianity and the eating of fish on Fridays and other religious fast days in medieval times (Yeh <em>et al.</em>

<h2> MEDICAL HISTORY OF ROMAN PARASITES</h2>
<p> Having demonstrated that a range of endoparasites and ectoparasites infected people living in the Roman Empire, it makes sense to consider what they thought of their parasites, and whether they may have tried to treat them medically.</p>
<p> The core philosophy underpinning Roman beliefs about medicine originated in classical Greece, largely from the Hippocratic corpus of texts. Hippocrates was a medical practitioner born on the island of Kos in the Aegean Sea. He lived during the 5th and 4th centuries BC and the texts he wrote were augmented by those of his students and laid out a new way of thinking about how disease originated. Hippocrates argued that a state of disease could be triggered by an imbalance in the proportions of the four humours (black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm) or a corruption of one of these humours (Totelin, <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Totelin</span>2009</a>; Mann, <a href="#ref75"><span>Reference Mann</span>2012</a>). The key texts that mention intestinal helminths were in the three works entitled <em>Prognostics, Epidemics</em> and <em>Coan Prognoses</em> (Hippocrates, <a href="#ref44"><span>Reference Hippocrates and Littré</span>1839</a>; Trompoukis <em>et al.</em>
<a href="#ref107"><span>Reference Trompoukis, German and Falagas</span>2007</a>).</p>
<p> The leading Roman period medical practitioner was Aelius Galenus, who lived from c.130 AD to c.210AD. Galen was a physician to the Roman Emperors Marcus Aurelius (ruled 161–180 AD), Commodus (ruled 180–192 AD) and Septimus Severus (ruled 193–211 AD), and wrote a large collection of medical texts (Johnston, <a href="#ref56"><span>Reference Johnston</span>2006</a>; Hankinson, <a href="#ref37"><span>Reference Hankinson</span>2008</a>; Mattern, <a href="#ref76"><span>Reference Mattern</span>2013</a>). He followed the humoural theory of Hippocrates, and also adopted his basic classification of helminths. Galen described three groups of intestinal worms, named <em>lumbrici lati, teretes</em> and <em>ascarides</em>. We do have to be careful when using ancient texts to come to a modern diagnosis of past disease, as there are many factors that might complicate a seemingly obvious description (Mitchell, <a href="#ref77"><span>Reference Mitchell</span>2011</a>). However, from these descriptions it has been proposed that these terms probably equate to <em>Taenia</em> genus tapeworms, roundworm and pinworm, respectively (Jirsa and Winiwarter, <a href="#ref55"><span>Reference Jirsa and Winiwarter</span>2010</a>). Galen believed that helminths were formed from spontaneous generation in putrified matter under the effect of heat. He recommended treatment with dietary modification, bloodletting and medicines that were believed to have a cooling and drying effect, in order to return the humoural balance to normal. Galen's beliefs as to the origin and treatment of intestinal parasites were to become the accepted view in Europe and the Middle East for over &nbsp;1000 years, until the time of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.</p>
<p> While medical practitioners attempted to treat certain types of parasite with medicines, we have archaeological evidence that people also tried to physically remove head lice with special combs. In Roman Period Judea (Israel), two-sided combs of wood, bone or ivory have been excavated. On one side the teeth of the comb were well spaced, presumably in order to comb the hair. On the other side the teeth were placed very close together, in order to remove the head lice and eggs. Indeed both lice and their eggs have been noted on microscopy, caught between the fine teeth (Mumcuoglu and Zias, <a href="#ref83"><span>Reference Mumcuoglu and Zias</span>1988</a>).</p>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec6-1" id="sec6-1">
<h3> Concluding remarks</h3>
<p> We can see that 12 species of endoparasite and 5 species of ectoparasite have been identified in Roman Period archaeological sites. Roman technology such as flushing latrines, clean piped water, sewers and drains, hand washing and bath houses does not seem to have protected them from contracting either intestinal parasites or ectoparasites. Using human feces as crop fertilizer may explain why roundworms and whipworms were so common in the Roman period. Certain ectoparasites may well have spread infectious diseases, and one likely example to have been spread by flea bite was the Plague of Justinian, now known to have been an early strain of bubonic plague.</p>
<p> One unexpected finding from this analysis was that fish tapeworms seem to have been fairly widespread in Roman Period Europe, in contrast to the evidence from the Bronze and Iron Age. After considering possible explanations, it seems plausible that the Roman enthusiasm for the fermented fish sauce known as garum may have acted as a method where fish tapeworm eggs could have been transported large distances across the empire and then be consumed without being subjected to cooking.</p>
<p> We have presented archaeological evidence for genuine infection by parasites that rarely cause disease in people living today. Examples of lancet liver fluke and capillariosis that were not false parasitism suggest that the way of life under the Romans may have facilitated the invasion of human tissues by these organisms more easily than do modern lifestyles.</p>
<p> Roman doctors believed intestinal worms were formed by spontaneous generation from putrefied matter under the effect of heat. They tried to treat them by rebalancing the four bodily humours with dietary modification, bloodletting and medicines. There is also evidence for special delousing combs to strip head lice from the hair, and delousing may have been a daily routine for many people living across the Roman Empire.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2>background</h2>
<p>i like to do this thing where i search twitter, looking for companies, and then try giving them a quick pentest. i've done a lot of my hacks this way and its more effective than you think it is.</p>
<p>on this search, i use the "Relevant People" tab more often than you think, this is how i got to a16z</p>
<ul>
<li>crypto bullshit -&gt; venture capital firms for crypto -&gt; a16z crypto -&gt; a16z</li>
</ul>
<h2>the hack</h2>
<p>while looking into a16z, i did a usual subdomain scan and used tooling from <a href="https://lunchcat.dev/">lunchcat</a> which does common checks on domains, scanning for secrets in js files, etc.</p>
<p>in this search, i came across <code>portfolio.a16z.com</code>, a site that seems like a portfolio management tool for companies that are in a16z. while doing cursory checks like i usually do, lunchcat seemed to catch a AWS key referenced somewhere in the website.</p>
<p>i confirmed this and what i saw in the js, was this.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>this was. horrifying, it was the entire <code>process.env</code> of a heroku instance, in the JS. put in dynamically.</p>
<p>i did a quick valid look of the credentials and they didnt seem like fake credentials. they. were. real. and all someone had to do find them was go to the sources tab of inspect element.</p>
<h2>impact</h2>
<p>the compromised list of services:</p>
<ul>
<li>their database (containing PII)</li>
<li>their AWS</li>
<li>their salesforce (never checked, account may be limited)</li>
<li>mailgun (arbitrary emails from a16z domains, and also could read older emails)</li>
<li>... and probably more</li>
</ul>
<h2>reward</h2>
<p>a16z did not give me any bug bounty on this because of the fact i publicly reached out instead of trying to reach out privately. the only reason i did it this way was because:</p>
<ul>
<li>there was no available contact on their main site</li>
<li>the email i could find <code>engineering@a16z.com</code> bounced my emails</li>
</ul>
<p>so, i dunno. imo this is unfair.</p>
