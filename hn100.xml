<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1. Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-1-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: 1. Introduction" href="#1-introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.
DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.
With RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.
However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,
we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.
DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.
To support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.
We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.</li>
<li>Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>Do you have a phone, tablet, or laptop (or, well, any device‚Ä¶) which will only take a physical SIM, but with which you‚Äôd like to use eSIMs?</p>
<p>Then this is a blogpost for you, as that‚Äôs exactly what this is: a physical SIM, onto which one can provision eSIMs, using software to swap between them.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-bought-from-9esim">What I bought from 9eSIM</h2>
<p>I bought the bundle - SIM and smartcard reader - from <a href="https://www.9esim.com/">9eSIM</a>.</p>
<p>The first shipment from China got lost but, after a bit of waiting, they posted another one without complaint. That was shipped by a different delivery company, and it arrived in just over a week.</p>
<p>In the box, I got:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A SIM card, with the usual push-out sections to change it from normal to micro to nano.</p>
<ul>
<li>The SIM was in a blue envelope, not attached to the cardboard saying ‚Äú9eSIM v2‚Äù - at first, I thought ‚Äúthey‚Äôve forgotten to put in the SIM card‚Äù.</li>
<li>If you want to use the smartcard reader, <em>do not discard the SIM‚Äôs packaging</em>. You will need it to make the smartcard reader work reliably.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A SIM card adapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A USB smartcard reader, and a USB-A to USB-C adapter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Including delivery, it came to about ¬£30.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-sims-packaging-to-make-it-fit-in-the-smartcard-reader">Use the SIM‚Äôs packaging to make it fit in the smartcard reader</h2>
<p>I spent a <em>lot</em> of time trying to get the SIM and smartcard reader working.</p>
<p>The solution was a frustratingly simple one: the best way to use the supplied smartcard reader is to use the original packaging for the SIM.</p>
<p>This packaging is the right size to slide into the reader while positioning the SIM‚Äôs contacts over the contact points on the reader. I will keep that together with the smartcard reader.</p>
<p>When I realised that - rather than trying to slide the popped-out SIM into the right place and keep it there - it Just Worked.</p>
<h2 id="adding-and-switching-esims">Adding and switching eSIMs</h2>
<p>The SIM card is advertised as have ‚Äúa memory capacity of 1.6M, [which] can store up to 50 groups of eSIM profile data‚Äù.</p>
<p>To make use of it, one needs to download one or more eSIMs to the SIM.</p>
<p>To do this, and to switch between profiles, one needs to use a ‚ÄúLocal Profile Agent‚Äù (or ‚ÄúLPA‚Äù).</p>
<p>I tested the process for this using both Android and Linux, and both worked just fine.</p>
<h2 id="test-esim-profiles-you-can-try-to-for-free">Test eSIM profiles you can try to for free</h2>
<p>While I was getting used to how it worked, I didn‚Äôt want to buy an actual eSIM.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a couple of options.</p>
<p>First, there are four official <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/esim-test-profiles">Android test eSIM profiles</a></p>
<p>While I could start to provision these, I could not download them, with what appears to be a TLS error.</p>
<p>Second, osmocom has a <a href="https://euicc-manual.osmocom.org/docs/rsp/known-test-profile/">very useful page of other test profiles</a>.</p>
<p>I was able to install test eSIM profiles for <a href="https://qr.esim.tf/1$rsp.truphone.com$QR-G-5C-1LS-1W1Z9P7">TruPhone</a> and <a href="https://qr.esim.tf/1$rsp.truphone.com$QRF-SPEEDTEST">TruPhone / Speedtest</a>.</p>
<p>These provisioned correctly onto the SIM. I could not use them to make or receive calls or start a data session - which was fine - but they did show up in Android‚Äôs SIM card manager as available eSIMs.</p>
<h2 id="adding-and-switching-esims-via-android">Adding and switching eSIMs via Android</h2>
<p>There is an .apk from the 9eSIM site.</p>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt too keen on using this but, well, it worked, and is probably the simplest option.</p>
<p>I tested it first by putting the SIM into my phone, replacing my main physical SIM. This was recognised by the app immediately.</p>
<p>Once I had worked out how to correctly seat the SIM in the reader, I tried that too, using a USB-C hub to connect the smartcard reader to my phone. That worked fine too.</p>
<p>Provisioning eSIMs using the Android application was easy as long as the QR code was on a different screen, since I could just scan the QR code for the eSIM using the camera. I‚Äôve not looked to see if there is a way to use Android to import a QR code on its own screen.</p>
<p>Using the 9eSIM application, one can enable and disable eSIMs, and swap between them. Once enabled, they appeared in Android‚Äôs own SIM management settings. I did not need to reboot.</p>
<p>Deleting an eSIM is also easy. One needs to type a security phrase - the name of the eSIM - to trigger deletion, which is a simple means of avoiding accidental deletion.</p>
<h2 id="adding-and-switching-esims-via-linux">Adding and switching eSIMs via Linux</h2>
<p>Since I want to use the SIM with the integrated WWAN modem of a laptop running Linux, I was keen to see if I could get this all to work using Linux and Free software.</p>
<p>So far, I have not found a way of writing profiles to the SIM while it is in the laptop - I need to take it out and put it in the smartcard reader.</p>
<p>And, if I‚Äôm going to do that then, from a practical point of view, it is little more effort to hook it up to my phone and swap and provisions eSIMs from there.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to get it working within Linux and FOSS just because.</p>

</code></pre><p>I spent quite a long time trying to work out why it would not detect the SIM in the smartcard reader (which, as above, was solved by using the supplied packaging material).</p>
<p>I have not reproduced all my troubleshooting here, but it was reasonably obvious from the error messages that, while my laptop recognised and could talk to the smartcard reader, the SIM was not recognised.</p>

  }
}
</code></pre><p>To check this was not just an issue with the test profiles, I bought a <a href="https://www.lycamobile.co.uk/en/bundles/sim-only-deals/#30-day-plans">30 day, ¬£2.50 LycaMobile eSIM</a> for testing, so that I could try it with an ‚Äúactual‚Äù eSIM, rather than a test eSIM.</p>
<p>Lyca‚Äôs email gave me a QR code, but did not specify (explicitly) the SM-DP+ address or matching ID.</p>
<p>The image‚Äôs alt-text was just my order number with Lyca.</p>
<p>I used GNOME‚Äôs <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en-GB/Decoder/">‚ÄúDecoder‚Äù</a>, which lets one scan a QR card either from the device‚Äôs camera or from a screenshot.</p>
<p>That gave me the full activation code, which looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>LPA:1$dp-plus-par07-01.oasis-smartsim.com$XHY48-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx$x.x.x.x.x.x.xxxxx.x.x.x.x
</code></pre><p>(I don‚Äôt know how much of it is sensitive!)</p>
<p>This too failed using <code>lpac</code>.</p>
<p>I have not dug into <em>why</em> it failed.</p>
<p>I missed the opportunity to test extracting the parameters and pushing them manually into <code>lpac</code> via <code>-s</code> and <code>-m</code> as I had already used EasyLPAC at that point. I suspect that that would have worked.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: doh, it is just a matter of quoting the string, with single quotes. So:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>lpac profile download -a 'LPA:1$rsp.truphone.com$QRF-BETTERROAMING-PMRDGIR2EARDEIT5'
</code></pre><p>How embarrassing.</p>
<p>I tried to update the <code>lpac</code> documentation to make this more obvious, but <a href="https://github.com/estkme-group/lpac/pull/183#issuecomment-2602304507">the maintainer decided that it wasn‚Äôt needed</a>. So I guess this blogpost will have to do :)</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://toot.wales/@tswsl">Tom</a> for that :)</p>
<h3 id="linux-gui-easylpac">Linux GUI: EasyLPAC</h3>
<p>There is a GUI for <code>lpac</code>, called <a href="https://github.com/creamlike1024/EasyLPAC">EasyLPAC</a>.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/creamlike1024/EasyLPAC/releases/tag/0.7.7.2">the latest Github release</a>, with the version of <code>lpac</code> that I had already installed.</p>
<p>I did not install it; I just ran it, and it worked.</p>
<p>I tested, on a different machine, the version of EasyLPAC which comes with <code>lpac</code> included, but I could not get this to work. I did not pursue this.</p>
<p>I was able to download an eSIM using EasyLPAC in a few different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>having an LPA:1 activation code on the system clipboard</li>
<li>having a QR code image on the system clipboard</li>
<li>‚Äúscanning an image file‚Äù, which consisted of opening a QR code saved as an image file on my computer</li>
</ul>
<p>It was really quite straightforward.</p>
<p>I noted that the instructions say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Reading LPA activation code and QRCode from clipboard not working in Wayland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they did work for me, using Wayland.</p>
<p>Importing the LycaMobile eSIM, using the details extracted from the QR code, worked.</p>
<h2 id="connectivity-worked-fine-via-linux">Connectivity worked fine via Linux</h2>
<p>I put the 9eSIM into my laptop‚Äôs SIM slot, and booted it.</p>
<p>In GNOME‚Äôs ‚ÄúMobile Network‚Äù settings, it was recognised as a LycaMobile SIM.</p>
<p>I had to set the APN manually.</p>
<p>It took a couple of minutes for the eSIM to activate and, once activated, I was able to browse the Internet.</p>
<p>So there we go: an eSIM on a physical SIM on a laptop running Debian, with very little effort.</p>
<h2 id="other-options">Other options</h2>
<p>I quite like the look of <a href="https://shop.sysmocom.de/sysmoEUICC1-eUICC-for-consumer-eSIM-RSP/sysmoEUICC1">this Sysmocom SIM</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd be interested in giving that a try some point.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>supports DRM functions and may not be fully accessible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's an extension of the ATA protocol (the "language" spoken between your mainboard and your SATA SSDs), which allows for the storage device to reply differently, depending on whether a request was signed by the trusted platform module on the mainboard. That way, things like video player devices that only give access to the stored data when the software has proven itself to be unmodified can be implemented. (I can find much more interesting use cases, but digital rights management seems to be what the kernel authors saw as the application for this when they implemented that warning.) That also means that Linux might simply get an "incomplete" view of the SSD, hence it warns you about that, in case you wonder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>uff, this just tells you that the device has a read cache: the computer fetches some smaller unit of data, and the device keeps that (and potentially more of its surroundings) around in a smaller, faster "transparent" piece of memory. That makes sense, because it's more common that data that was recently read is read again than some data that nobody cared about for a long time.</p>
<p>DPO and FUA are just really old techniques to tell SCSI (and consequently, ATAPI) devices to bypass that cache (FUA was supposed to force reading from the spinning platter without using what's in the cache, whereas DPO was meant to say, hey, this is probably a one-off read; don't care to start caching what I read here). Makes no sense for an SSD in how they were thought out in the early 1990s, so these extensions are not available for your SSD.</p>

				<p><em>How surveillance capitalism and DRM turned home tech from friend to foe.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/choke_hero_4.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/choke_hero_4-450x253.jpg" alt="An illustration of Darth Vader choking someone on a retro TV set." width="450" height="253"></a></p>
<p>For a while‚Äîin the ‚Äô80s, ‚Äô90s, and early 2000s‚Äîit <a href="https://www2.itif.org/2017-why-so-sad.pdf">felt like</a> nerds were making the world a better place. Now, it feels like the most successful tech companies are making it worse.</p>
<p>Internet surveillance, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121295499/facebook-twitter-youtube-instagram-tiktok-social-media">algorithmic polarization</a> of social media, <a href="http://<a href=" https:="" techcrunch.com="" 2018="" 10="" 15="" sneaky-subscriptions-are-plaguing-the-app-store="" "="">predatory app stores</a>, and extractive business models have eroded the freedoms the personal computer once promised, effectively ending the PC era for most tech consumers.</p>
<p>The ‚Äúpersonal computer‚Äù was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines">once a radical idea</a>‚Äîa computer an individual could own and control completely. The concept emerged in the early 1970s when microprocessors made it economical and practical for a person to own their very own computer, in contrast to the rise of data processing mainframes in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>At its core, the PC movement was about a kind of tech liberty‚Äî‚Äìwhich I‚Äôll define as the freedom to explore new ideas, control your own creative works, and make mistakes without punishment.</p>
<p>The personal computer era bloomed in the late 1970s and continued into the 1980s and 90s. But over the past decade in particular, the Internet and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">digital rights management</a> (DRM) have been steadily pulling that control away from us and putting it into the hands of huge corporations. We need to take back control of our digital lives and make computing personal again.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I‚Äôm not calling the tech industry evil. I‚Äôm a huge fan of technology. The industry is full of great people, and this is not a personal attack on anyone. I just think runaway market forces and a handful of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/the-copyright-rule-we-need-to-repeal-if-we-want-to-preserve-our-cultural-heritage/274049/">poorly-crafted US laws</a> like section 1201 of the DMCA have put all of us onto the wrong track (more on that below).</p>
<p>To some extent, tech companies were always predatory. To some extent, all companies are predatory. It‚Äôs a matter of degrees. But I believe there‚Äôs a fundamental truth that we‚Äôve charted a deeply unhealthy path ahead with consumer technology at the moment.</p>
<p>Tech critic Ed Zitron calls this phenomenon ‚Äú<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/">The Rot Economy</a>,‚Äù where companies are more obsessed with continuous growth than with providing useful products. ‚ÄúOur economy isn‚Äôt one that produces things to be used, but things that increase usage,‚Äù Zitron <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-anti-economy/">wrote</a> in another piece, bringing focus to ideas I‚Äôve been mulling for the past half-decade.</p>
<p>This post started as a 2022 <a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1541029918783311873">Twitter thread</a>, and I‚Äôve offered to write editorials about my frustrations with increasingly predatory tech business practices since 2020 for my last two employers, but both declined to publish them. I understand why. These are uncomfortable truths to face. But if you love technology like I do, we have to accept what we‚Äôre doing wrong if we are going to make it better.</p>

<h3>Learning From the Past</h3>
<p>While consumer and computer tech today is more powerful than ever before‚Äîand in some ways far more convenient‚Äîsome of the structural ways we used to interface with technology companies were arguably healthier in the past.</p>
<p>For example, which part of the Apple II was predatory? It promised productivity, education, and entertainment. You could program it yourself, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/809799/45-years-later-the-apple-ii-still-has-lessons-to-teach-us/">repair or expand it</a> without restriction. No subscriptions, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/a-new-jailbreak-for-john-deere-tractors-rides-the-right-to-repair-wave/">no hardware DRM</a> (though there was software <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/174/old-school-copy-protection-schemes">copy protection</a>), no tracking. No need for <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/03/08/apple-given-an-f-by-us-pirg-for-difficult-iphone-repairs">special tools</a> to repair it either. In fact, Apple <a href="https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/hardware/io/Apple%20II%20Hobby%20and%20Prototyping%20Board%20Manual.pdf">openly encouraged</a> experimentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/apple_II.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/apple_II-450x345.jpg" alt="A man in a kitchen using an Apple II from a 1977 advertisement." width="450" height="345"></a></p>
<p>Further, what percentage of your income had to go towards annual <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/apple-one-billion-paid-subscriptions-services-earnings-june-2023-1235686807/">software subscriptions</a> on a 20th century Windows PC (like this Sony VAIO)? You bought an application and you owned an indefinite license to use it. If there was an upgrade, you bought that too. And if you liked an older version of the software, you could keep using it without having it vanish in an automatic update.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sony_vaio2.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sony_vaio2-450x339.jpg" alt="A Sony VAIO computer." width="450" height="339"></a></p>
<p>How many Nintendo Entertainment System games sustained themselves with <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/13/kid-spends-16k-on-in-app-purchases-for-ipad-game-sonic-forces">in-app purchases</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/znpaau/i_worked_in_the_mobile_industry_for_10_years_loot/">microtransactions</a>? What more did the console ask of you after you bought a cartridge? Maybe to buy another one later if it was fun?</p>

<h2>The Extractive Model</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-pit_mining#/media/File:Twincreeksblast.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/strip_mining.jpg" alt="Strip Mining Wikipedia photo by Geomartin" width="420"></a></p>
<p>Americans have allowed runaway business models, empowered by tech, to subvert privacy and individual liberty on the road to making money. Our default tech business model has become extractive, like part of a strip-mining operation. Consumers‚Äîand now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/have-ai-image-generators-assimilated-your-art-new-tool-lets-you-check/">creative works</a> (used for training AI)‚Äîare treated as a natural resource to be milked and exploited.</p>
<p>The extractive model may end up being self-destructive for the tech industry itself. In the physical world, resource extraction needs limits and regulations to be sustainable. It can be wildly profitable until a resource becomes over-harvested, or the harvesting process corrupts the environment that lets the industry exist in the first place.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also the drive to lock consumers into an ecosystem, powered by DRM. You should buy tech products and get direct value fairly, not unleash a secret vampire to track you, manipulate you, and attempt to extract money from you forever. Just because companies have unlocked this ‚Äúeverything as a service‚Äù endless money hack does not mean they should do it.</p>
<p>And there‚Äôs another problem. Very soon, we might be <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90549441/how-to-prevent-deepfakes">threatening the continuity of history itself</a> with technologies that pollute the historical record with AI-generated noise. It sounds dramatic, but that could eventually undermine the shared cultural bonds that hold cultural groups together.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs important because history is what makes this type of criticism possible. History is how we know if we‚Äôre being abused because we can rely on written records of people who came before (even 15 minutes ago) and make comparisons. If technology takes history away from us, there may be no hope of recovery.</p>
<h2>How We Can Reclaim Control</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/pcworld/ibm_pc_30_small.jpg" alt="Benj's IBM PC 5150"></p>
<p>Every generation <a href="https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1669113362058444800?s=20">looks back</a> and says, ‚ÄúThings used to be better,‚Äù whether they are accurate or not.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm not suggesting we live in the past. It is possible to learn from history and integrate the best of today‚Äôs technology with fair business practices that are more sustainable and healthy for everyone in the long run.</p>
<p>In the short term, we can do things like support open projects like Linux, support non-predatory and open source software, and run apps and store data locally as much as possible. But some bigger structural changes are necessary if we really want to launch the era of Personal Computer 2.0.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve shown this editorial to friends, and some people felt that I did not emphasize the benefits of current technology enough. But I argue that my criticism is less about the actual technology and more about how we use it‚Äîand how companies make money from it.</p>
<p>Since I originally wrote my thoughts in a <a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1541029918783311873?s=20">viral Twitter thread</a> in June 2022, others have expanded on these ideas with far more eloquence. Five months after my thread, Cory Doctorow wrote <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456">his first</a> post on ‚Äúenshittification,‚Äù a hallmark piece identifying a tendency for online platforms to decay over time.</p>
<p>A common thread between many of the issues hinted at above and in both Doctorow and Zitron‚Äôs work has been the rise of the ubiquitous Internet, which has allowed content owners and device makers to keep an eye on (and influence) consumer habits remotely, pulling our strings like puppeteers and putting a drip feed on our wallets.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-circumvention">section 1201</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">DMCA</a> made it illegal to circumvent DRM, allowing manufacturers to lock down platforms in a way that challenges the traditional concept of ownership, enables predatory app stores, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/the-copyright-rule-we-need-to-repeal-if-we-want-to-preserve-our-cultural-heritage/274049/">threatens our cultural history</a>.</p>
<p>We need <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/us-data-privacy-laws-enter-new-era-2023-2023-01-12/">comprehensive privacy legislation</a> in the United States that enshrines individual privacy as a fundamental right. We need <a href="https://www.repair.org/stand-up">Right to Repair legislation</a> that puts control of our devices back into our hands‚Äîand also DRM reform, especially <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/the-copyright-rule-we-need-to-repeal-if-we-want-to-preserve-our-cultural-heritage/274049/">repealing Section 1201 of the DMCA</a> so we can control the goods we own and historians can preserve our cultural heritage without <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2012/01/23/why-history-needs-software-piracy/">the need for piracy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/13/03/the-copyright-rule-we-need-to-repeal-if-we-want-to-preserve-our-cultural-heritage/274049/" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/mickeymouse_small.jpg" alt="Mickey Mouse Copyright Blur"></a></p>
<p>Tech monopolies must be held to account, the outsized influence of some tech billionaires must be held in check, and competition must be allowed to thrive. We may also need to consider the protection of both consumers themselves and human-created works (including our history) as part of a conservation effort before extractive models permanently pollute our shared cultural resources.</p>
<p>The way the political winds are blowing right now in the US, significant legal reform seems unlikely for now. Things may need to get much worse before they get better. But the kind of extractive lock-in we‚Äôre seeing with technology is fundamentally incompatible with freedom in my opinion, so something needs to change if we still value the kind of personal liberty the PC once promised‚Äîthat freedom to explore, create, and make mistakes without surveillance or punishment.</p>
<p>Sure, things will never be perfect in the United States. Profits will always be chased, and there will be collateral damage. And yes, some parts of technology today are better than ever (computing power, screen resolutions, and bandwidth to name a few).</p>
<p>The Internet has brought amazing things, including Wikipedia, The Internet Archive, multiplayer online gaming, <em>VC&amp;G</em>, and work-from-home jobs. But the urge to exploit users to the maximum extent through digital locks and surveillance should be held in check so that we can earnestly and honestly make the tech industry a beacon of optimism once more.</p>
<p>The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1970s. There is no ‚Äúlogging off,‚Äù nearly everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, and the digital world increasingly overlaps with every aspect of our lives. That means digital freedom is now equivalent to actual legal and personal freedom, and we must be allowed to control our own destinies.</p>
<p>Whether through purposeful reform or the eventual collapse of digital strip mining, I believe the personal computer will eventually rise again‚Äî‚Äìalong with our chance to reclaim control of our digital lives.</p>

This week we ask: </span><strong>How do interruptions impact software engineers‚Äô productivity and stress, and what can leaders do to mitigate their effects?</strong></p><p>Software engineers juggle numerous complex cognitive tasks like writing code, understanding complex algorithms, and reviewing others‚Äô work. These activities demand deep focus, while interruptions‚Äîranging from a coworker's quick question to a pop-up notification‚Äîbreak that flow. However, not all interruptions are created equal. Factors like the urgency of the interruption or the authority of the person interrupting can affect how disruptive the interruption feels.</p><p>Remote work has introduced additional layers of complexity. With more on-screen notifications and fewer in-person interactions, engineers are experiencing interruptions in new ways. Understanding how different types of interruptions impact productivity and stress is critical to fostering better work environments.</p><p><span>Researchers at Duke and Vanderbilt </span><a href="https://kjl.name/papers/icse24.pdf" rel="">analyzed</a><span> how interruptions influence three common engineering tasks: code writing, code comprehension, and code review. Twenty participants performed these tasks while experiencing six types of interruptions‚Äîboth in-person and on-screen.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://iamvishnu.com/posts/please-dont-force-dark-mode">https://iamvishnu.com/posts/please-dont-force-dark-mode</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762054">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
  <p>Dear website designers,</p>

  <p>Please don‚Äôt force dark mode on your users. If dark mode is a characteristic of your brand, please ensure you choose a comfortable contrast ratio for the text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I regularly see many websites including personal blogs that are designed exclusively in dark mode. I find this incredibly frustrating as I can‚Äôt even read a single paragraph on these sites before my eyes start watering. While dark mode can be beneficial on some occasions, forcing it on users is a terrible user experience.</p>

<h2 id="my-eyes-my-eyes-">My Eyes! My Eyes! üòµ‚Äçüí´</h2>

<p>Reading in dark mode doesn‚Äôt just mess with my eyes while I‚Äôm at it ‚Äî it sticks around afterward too. Every time I finish a long article, I end up seeing horizontal stripes everywhere I look, like my eyes just won‚Äôt let it go.</p>

<p><strong>This is what my eyes see before reading a dark-mode article:</strong>
<img src="https://iamvishnu.com/images/dark-mode/before-reading-dark-mode.jpeg" alt="what I see before reading dark mode - a normal sight"></p>

<p><strong>And this is what my eyes see after reading a full-length dark-mode article:</strong>
<img src="https://iamvishnu.com/images/dark-mode/after-reading-dark-mode.jpeg" alt="what I see after reading in dark mode - full of horizontal stripes everywhere for a considerable amount of time"></p>

<h2 id="whats-the-real-problem-with-the-dark-mode">What‚Äôs the real problem with the dark mode?</h2>

<p>The real problem is the <strong>contrast ratio</strong> between the text and the background when using dark mode.</p>

<p>For example, pure white text on a pitch black background can strain my eyes and be very difficult to read. The contrast ratio of this combination is <strong>21:1.</strong> Here‚Äôs an example paragraph:</p>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>

<p>However, light gray text on a dark gray background is easy on my eyes. Here the background is <code>#666</code> and the text is <code>#E0E0E0</code> which creates a contrast ratio of <strong>4.34:1</strong>.</p>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>

<p>In summary, higher contrast ratios in dark mode cause discomfort for my eyes. But when I say ‚Äòhigher‚Äô, just how high can it go?</p>

<h2 id="isnt-there-a-guidelines-for-this">Isn‚Äôt there a guidelines for this?</h2>

<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 recommends a <strong>minimum</strong> contrast ratio of <strong>4.5:1</strong> for normal texts <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">(SC 1.4.3)</a> <strong>but not a maximum.</strong> The current guidelines makes pure white text on pitch black background completely accessible, even if the contrast ratio is an unbearable 21:1. But the more comfortable contrast ratio of 4.34:1 from the above example fails according to the guidelines. That means, currently, there are no standards or guidelines that address contrast ratios in dark mode.</p>

<p>Upcoming WCAG 3.0 adds a new exploratory requirement for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#maximum-text-contrast">‚ÄúMaximum text contrast‚Äù</a> and I hope the working committee will address the issue of high contrast text in dark mode and provide suitable recommendations.</p>

<p>Until then, if I must read an important article that forces dark mode, I will use the browser‚Äôs developer tools to override the CSS and invert the colors until a better solution is available. I don‚Äôt want to use a plugin just for this.</p>

<hr>

<p>That being said, I absolutely enjoy dark mode when‚Ä¶:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‚Ä¶reading on an OLED screen in a unlit room, for example reading articles on my phone before bedtime. Dark mode works best on LED-type displays when used in dark environments.</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶writing code. Almost every IDE has a dark mode with very comfortable contrast ratio out of the box.</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶the website has comfortable contrast ratio in the dark mode.</li>
</ul>

to ask why Twitter is such a big deal.</p><p>The reason is that it's a new messaging 
protocol, where you don't specify the recipients.
New protocols are rare.  Or more precisely, new
protocols that take off are.
There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP 
(the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on.  So any
new protocol is a big deal.  But Twitter is a protocol owned
by a private company.  That's even rarer.</p><p>Curiously, the fact that the founders of Twitter 
have been slow to monetize it may in the long run
prove to be an advantage.  Because they haven't tried
to control it too much, Twitter feels to everyone like
previous protocols.  One forgets it's owned by a
private company.  That must have made it easier for
Twitter to spread.</p></span></td></tr></tbody></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This repository describes general status on the topic and a possible solution to allow you to use your device as an access card in UID-based access systems (<strong>without cloning, consent on behalf of maintainer will be required</strong>).<br>
In case you've already tried researching this topic, feel free to skip the <strong>Introduction</strong> section straight to <strong>The Solution</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Many people have been beating their heads against the wall trying to use their Apple device as an access card.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sadly, due to closed NFC and Wallet ecosystem, such a thing is not possibe to do on your own without any explicit support on the behalf of Apple and access system provider.<br>
Thankfuly, as of now this market request is starting to be fulfilled by the likes of Google, Apple with cooperation of access system manufacturers and providers like HID, Brivo, Salto, WaveLynx, Nedap, Kisi, Assa Abloy, but ubiquitous support is far from reality, moreover those official solutions require manual approval, incur additional (in some cases absolutely cuckoo $$$) fees.</p>
<p dir="auto">The search for a potential bypass had lead some people into the topics of <a href="https://github.com/kormax/apple-vas">VAS</a>, <a href="http://github.com/kormax/apple-enhanced-contactless-polling">ECP</a> and HCE API (which actually exists in IOS, but is private, used by VAS), but those solutions don't work with existing reader infrastructures.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The solution</h2><a id="user-content-the-solution" aria-label="Permalink: The solution" href="#the-solution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">May be deemed more elegant than some people could expect.<br>
It lies in one of the Chinese transit card brands, called "China T-Union", that is officially supported by Apple Wallet.</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/kormax/apple-device-as-access-card/blob/main/assets/WALLET.INFO.TUNION.webp"><img src="https://github.com/kormax/apple-device-as-access-card/raw/main/assets/WALLET.INFO.TUNION.webp" alt="![T-Union card in wallet]" width="250px"></a>
</p>  
<p dir="auto">At first look there's nothing special about this card type, it has the same charachteristics as any transit card in Wallet:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It has a viewable balance;</li>
<li>It has configurable express mode;</li>
<li>It can be freely moved between devices.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">What makes this card powerful, lies in the way it changes how NFC behaves on your device when it's set as a default transit card:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Your device stops randomizing the UID on each tap;</li>
<li>Your device begins responding to all NFC readers as if they were express-transit enabled, just like on Android;</li>
<li>Also this card does not change its serial number and UID when moving to other devices, unlike most other ones.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All those properties are unique to this card type and cannot be replicated with any other card type, and coincidentally <strong>they make it ideal for usage in access systems that use the UID of the card as the only means of authentication</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, it's time to talk about the downsides. This is a point that might break the hopes for a lot of people:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Thing is, UID-only authentication is deemed <strong>very unsecure</strong>, and thus is uncommon in real-life installations. Some installations allow UID auth in a fallback/compatability mode, which is more common.</li>
<li>You cannot control the UID of the card that will be generated for you, this means that you'll still need to ask permission of the system owner to add your UID into it, a chance of getting a collision would be too little and too expensive to verify.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Following systems are known to have UID-based authentication:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://wiki.ui.com/2-0/docs/ua-nfc-cards" rel="nofollow">UniFi Access</a> with the "UniFi Access Credentials Only" setting disabled;</li>
<li>[Needs expanding].</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In case the stars align in your case, a next question would be how to aquire such a card. Next section tries to answer that question.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The solution for solution</h2><a id="user-content-the-solution-for-solution" aria-label="Permalink: The solution for solution" href="#the-solution-for-solution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">China T-Union cards are quite hard to get, as if you've tried adding one straight from Wallet, you've probably encountered an error message telling you that you have to have a Chinese UnionPay card. Emphasis on Chinese, as global variants aren't accepted too.</p>
<p dir="auto">To overcome this problem, you have to have following prerequisites:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport" rel="nofollow">A Biometric travel document</a>;</li>
<li>A valid Mastercard or Visa.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">(NOTE) Google says that many people are having issues with SMS verification, so this method might not be working now. In this case the only thing left is to wait for this issue to resolve.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have everything, follow the next steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Install the AliPay app;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Register inside the AliPay app:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Verify your mobile phone;</li>
<li>When asked, set up the PIN. <strong>Warning</strong> it is very important not to forget any of the codes, as you'll irreversibly lose access to your account;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Verify your identity:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Select "Account" tab;</li>
<li>Tap on the profile avatar;</li>
<li>Select "My Namecard";</li>
<li>Press "Verify identity";</li>
<li>Choose "Complete verification".</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">After that, you'll be presented with a couple of possible age verification methods.<br>
Depending on your country one of them may work for you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="link_wrapped_content">




<p>For more than three decades, the TrackPoint‚Äôs iconic red rubbery nub has been a staple of IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. But now, no longer. Lenovo has removed its famous TrackPoint from its latest ThinkPad laptops, calling it time for a change.</p>



<p>Does that mean the TrackPoint is dead? No, thankfully. It will still appear in the other ThinkPads made by Lenovo, said a company spokesman. But for the 14- and 15-inch ThinkPad X9 Aura Editions launched at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, the TrackPoint has been removed entirely.</p>



<p>The idea is that certain laptops ‚Äî let‚Äôs say the Dell XPS ‚Äî have managed to transcend the consumer, prosumer, and small business markets, and the TrackPoint is a legacy design, according to Lenovo. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt resonate with all demographics, so to speak,‚Äù said the company‚Äôs spokesman. ‚ÄúThat was cutting-edge technology at one time. But clearly, it‚Äôs a touchpad world.‚Äù</p>



<p>In the past, Lenovo had defended the TrackPoint as a reason to avoid using the trackpad itself. The TrackPoint debuted with the IBM ThinkPad 700, which launched in 1992. Then, in a 2017 TechRadar <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.techradar.com/news/why-the-thinkpad-trackpoint-still-a-thing-according-to-lenovos-chief-designer&amp;xcust=2-1-2566195-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2566195/lenovo-has-removed-its-iconic-trackpoint-nub-from-new-thinkpad-laptops.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2566195-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="techradar" target="_blank">interview</a>, Lenovo‚Äôs chief design officer David Hill described the TrackPoint as a way for a user to access a pointing device without the need for the user‚Äôs hands to leave the keyboard‚Äôs home row.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>But he also foreshadowed Lenovo‚Äôs choice to remove the TrackPoint, too. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little bit like an automatic transmission versus a stick shift. If you know how to drive a stick, you don‚Äôt want an automatic transmission,‚Äù Hill said back then in the interview. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt drive a stick shift, you‚Äôre not going to buy a car that‚Äôs got one.‚Äù</p>



<h2 id="features-and-specs-for-lenovos-new-thinkpad-aura-editions">Features and specs for Lenovo‚Äôs new ThinkPad Aura Editions</h2>



<p>Lenovo‚Äôs new ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition ($1,399 and up, shipping in Feb. 2025) and the ThinkPad X9 15 Aura Edition ($1,549 and up, shipping in Feb. 2025 as well) are both laptops built around the vPro versions of the Intel Core Series 2 ‚ÄúLunar Lake‚Äù mobile processor. Neither ships with discrete graphics, relying on Intel‚Äôs Arc Xe integrated GPU.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2568494&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Lenovo ThinkPad Aura 14&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Lenovo ThinkPad Aura 14&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250105_132931.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Aura 14" width="1200" height="900" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>However, it‚Äôs lovely to see that Lenovo is moving premium display technologies mainstream. The 14-inch offers a choice between a 1920√ó1200 400-nit 60Hz OLED or a 14-inch 2880√ó1800 500-nit 120Hz OLED. The 15-inch model offers just the latter option, with an average HDR600 capability on top. Up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory and 2TB of a PCIe Gen 4 SSD are also included.</p>



<p>These are Thunderbolt 4 laptops with two ports, as Intel doesn‚Äôt offer integrated Thunderbolt 5 solutions quite yet. Underneath the laptop is what Lenovo calls an ‚Äúengine hub‚Äù that houses the critical components, with the Thunderbolt ports sprouting from both sides. Lenovo says that this engine hub will be serviceable by a trained repairperson. Wi-Fi 7 is also included and the laptop is also MIL-SPEC 810H qualified.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2566206&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/16_ThinkPad_x9_14_Front_facing_B_C_cover.png?w=1200" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition" width="1200" height="1200" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo isn‚Äôt specifying battery life quite yet, though with a battery-sipping Lunar Lake processor inside, it should be fantastic. The 14-inch model includes a 55Wh customer-replaceable battery, for a total weight of 2.74 pounds. The 15-inch includes a whopping 80Wh battery, for a total weight of 3.19 pounds. Lenovo used over 50 percent recycled aluminum in the aluminum chassis and various levels of recaptured plastics in other components.</p>



<p>By contrast, the similar <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2493146/asus-zenbook-s-14-review.html">Asus ZenBook S 14</a> includes a Lunar Lake processor alongside a 72Wh battery and a 14-inch 2880√ó1800 touchscreen 120Hz OLED, which yielded over 17 hours of simulated work in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2236466/how-we-test-laptops-pcworld.html">our laptop battery tests</a>.</p>



<h2 id="lenovos-ai-now-adds-smart-modes">Lenovo‚Äôs AI Now adds smart modes</h2>



<p>We‚Äôre always on the lookout for applications that can take advantage of localized AI. With the Aura Edition laptops, Lenovo has provided two sets of such features: the Lenovo Aura Edition features on the one hand, and what Lenovo is calling Lenovo AI Now on the other.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2566208&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: lenovo ces 2025 ai now &quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;lenovo ces 2025 ai now &quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lenovo-ces-2025-ai-now_1.png" alt="lenovo ces 2025 ai now " width="720" height="500" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Lenovo‚Äôs AI Now offers both local and cloud-based AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo Aura Edition includes ‚Äúsmart modes‚Äù that allow users to switch between optimized device configurations like ‚ÄúAttention,‚Äù ‚ÄúPower,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWellness.‚Äù They sound like they‚Äôre designed a bit like the optional Windows configurations, emphasizing entertainment, for example. Smart Care connects users to device diagnostics and 24/7 live agent support. Smart Share is a Lenovo-branded version of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2168557/intel-beefs-up-intel-unison-app-with-cross-platform-controls.html">Intel‚Äôs Unison technology</a> for sharing information between Android and iOS devices.</p>



<p>Lenovo AI Now is an optional LLM that‚Äôs based on Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.0, which processes all data locally using the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2457268/what-the-heck-is-an-npu-anyway-everything-you-need-to-know.html">integrated Lunar Lake NPU</a>. Lenovo also promises new features coming soon: multilingual support, searching across the PC as well as the tablet, plus improved capabilities to extract data from documents, images, or even portions of the two.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2566209&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: 10 65W USB C Travel Dock Floating left&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;10 65W USB C Travel Dock Floating left&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/10_65W_USB_C_Travel_Dock_Floating_left.png?w=1200" alt="10 65W USB C Travel Dock Floating left" width="1200" height="1200" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Lenovo‚Äôs USB-C travel dock.</figcaption></figure><p>Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo also promises new peripherals to go along with the new laptops, including $49 TWS Earbuds (X9 Edition) with Bluetooth 5.3; a 65W GaN Nano Adapter; a $99 X9 Charging GaN Dock with a 4K60 HDMI port, SD card reader, and USB-A/C ports; and a $59.99 X9 Edition of a wireless mouse that includes a dedicated AI Now button. The earbuds and adapter are available now and the dock will ship in June 2025.</p>
