<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><!-- Article Start--><p>A 21-year-old Norwegian tourist claims he was denied entry to the United States and harassed by ICE agents after they discovered a JD Vance meme on his phone.</p> <p>Mads Mikkelsen arrived at New Jersey's Newark Airport on June 11 when he was pulled aside by border control and placed in a cell, he told Norwegian outlet Nordlys. Mads was travelling to the States to visit friends, first in New York and then in Austin, Texas, but suffered "harassment and abuse of power" at the hands of US immigration authorities.</p> <p>"I felt prejudiced, suspected and simply humiliated even then, in front of many other people at the airport," The Tromsø native recounted. "They took me to a room with several armed guards, where I had to hand over my shoes, mobile phone and backpack."</p> <p>Officers quizzed Mads about his visit, and his plans, before adopting a personal line of questioning. "They asked direct questions about drug smuggling, terrorist plans and right-wing extremism, completely without reason," he claimed.</p> <p>"They demanded full information about everyone I was going to meet in the US, including name, address, phone number and what they did for work." Mads' mother was due to meet up with him a few weeks into his stay and the pair had planned to travel to several national parks.</p> <p>"I had travelled for twelve hours, slept poorly, and was physically and mentally completely exhausted even before they started the questioning," he continued. A strenuous crackdown by U.S. Customs and Border Protection has followed President Donald Trump's return to office, with the service being allowed to search phones.</p> <p>A French scientist was denied entry at the border earlier this year, in March, after officers unearthed messages criticising Trump on his phone. Mikkelsen explained: "They threatened me with a minimum fine of $5,000 or five years in prison if I refused to provide the password to my phone."</p> <p>After handing over his password, Mads was told he would not be allowed to go through with his planned vacation after two images were not to the officers' liking. One image was of a meme showcasing JD Vance with a bald, egg-shaped head. Variations of the image were shared endlessly in March on social media, with the Vice President himself posting his own version.</p> <p>The other picture showed Mads with a wooden pipe which he had made years prior. "Both pictures had been automatically saved to my camera roll from a chat app, but I really didn't think that these innocent pictures would put a stop to my entry into the country," the 21-year-old admitted.</p> <p>Mads told Nordlys he tried to explain the images as being harmless and meant as jokes but the immigration authorities ignored his pleas. He claims he was then strip-searched, forced to give blood samples, a facial scan and fingerprints.</p> <p>"Later I was taken back in, and the situation got even worse. I was pushed up against a wall and was strip-searched with a lot of force. They were incredibly harsh and used physical force the whole time," he claimed.</p> <p>"I felt completely devastated and broke down, and was close to crying several times. I was on the verge of panic. It felt like I was a terrorist suspect where I was sitting. I tried to pull myself together several times, but in the end, I just wanted to get home again."</p> <p>The Norwegian adds he was placed in a cell for a further five hours, refused food or water and placed on a plane back to Oslo the same day he arrived for the holiday of a lifetime. "I don't feel there is any point in contacting the State Department, nor do I think they have any power against such a powerful and strict country as the United States," Mads conceded.</p> <p>Mathias Rongved, a spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned fellow Norwegians that it is their duty to be clued up on US regulations before entering the country. "Most trips to the US go without any particular problems," he said.</p> <p>"Entry regulations can change at short notice, and it is the traveller's responsibility to have valid documents and be familiar with the current entry regulations. It is the immigration authorities upon arrival who decide whether you are rejected at the border. Norwegian authorities cannot intervene in this decision.</p> <p>"It is also not necessarily the case that we receive a message either from other countries' border authorities or the Norwegian traveller if the person in question is not allowed to enter a country."</p>   <p><b>Join our Dublin Live breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click</b><a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/DJTiyHweTeJHu5aLKRIiPc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <b>this link</b> </a><b>to receive your daily dose of Dublin Live content.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/iphone-customers-upset-by-apple-wallet-ad-pushing-f1-movie/">https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/iphone-customers-upset-by-apple-wallet-ad-pushing-f1-movie/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44368854">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Apple customers aren’t thrilled they’re getting an ad from the Apple Wallet app promoting the tech giant’s Original Film, “F1 the Movie.” <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1937551035825807545">Across</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWallet/comments/1ljbjrs/how_do_i_turn_this_off">social</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1ljd94e/disable_fandango_ad_from_apple_pay/">media</a>, iPhone owners are complaining that their Wallet app sent out a push notification offering a $10 discount at Fandango for anyone buying two or more tickets to the film. </p>

<p>The feature film, starring Brad Pitt, explores the world of Formula 1 and was shot at actual Grand Prix races. It also showcases the use of Apple technology, from the <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/cameras/articles/apple-converted-iphone-action-camera-200227072.html">custom-made cameras</a> made of iPhone parts used to film inside the cars, to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/f1-the-movie-review-a-shameless-apple-ad-that-will-blow-your-socks-off-144808364.html">AirPods Max that Pitt’s character</a>, F1 driver Sonny Hayes, sleeps in.</p>







<p>However <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt-damson-idris-joseph-kosinski-1236291870/">well-received</a> the film may be, iPhone users don’t necessarily want their built-in utilities, like their digital wallet, marketing to them. </p>

<figure></figure>

<p>“I did not pay over $1000 for an iPhone to get advertised at,” <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1ljd94e/disable_fandango_ad_from_apple_pay/">complains</a> one Reddit user (u/captain42d). Another recent post, already with dozens of replies, wants to know <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWallet/comments/1ljbjrs/how_do_i_turn_this_off">how to turn off Apple Pay ads</a>. </p>

<p>As it turns out, there’s a new option in iOS 26’s beta build to disable “Offers &amp; Promotions” from Apple Wallet that isn’t available in the current release. Instead, users not on the new beta build only have the option to disable notifications or to turn off seeing card benefits within Wallet during checkout. They can’t opt out of offers.</p>

<p>The addition of the new control toggle in iOS 26 suggests that Apple plans to push more marketing messages and promotions through the Wallet app in the future — something many iPhone users won’t appreciate. </p>

<p>Apple customers are generally averse to advertisements and marketing efforts pushed to their devices without their consent. In the past, they’ve pushed back at ads for Apple’s services <a rel="nofollow" href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/ios_adware">in their iOS Settings</a>, for example. And over 10 years later, people are still complaining about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.stereogum.com/2279219/u2-songs-of-innocence-apple-iphones/columns/sounding-board/">U2 album</a> that automatically appeared in their iTunes music library.</p>


<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All these F1 movie notifications from Apple is the equivalent of when they put that U2 album on everyone’s iTunes back in the day no one asked for. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://t.co/ukNLzwtuFD">pic.twitter.com/ukNLzwtuFD</a></p>— John Vezmar (@johnvezmar) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/johnvezmar/status/1937526455556039031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>Recalling that marketing debacle, one Reddit user writes of the new Wallet push notification for the F1 film, “I am getting Bono flashbacks.” </p>

<p>Apple has been heavily promoting the F1 film along with its distribution partner, Warner Bros., which has included the launch of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91350375/f1-the-movie-trailer-apple-haptic-feel-cars-moving-brad-pitt">haptic trailer with vibration feedback</a>. The company even kicked off its recent WWDC 2025 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_DjDdfqtUE&amp;t=5404s">keynote</a> this month with a preview of the film’s action, with participation from Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, as a race car driver.</p>

<p>We reached out to Apple for comment and did not immediately hear back.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>Why you should write more toy programs</p>
                <hr>
                
            </div><div>
                <p>I am a huge fan of Richard Feyman’s famous quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What I cannot create, I do not understand”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s brilliant, and it remains true across many fields (if you’re willing to be a little creative with the
definition of ‘create’). It is to this principle that I believe I owe everything I’m truly good at. Some will tell you
to avoid reinventing the wheel, but they’re wrong: you <em>should</em> build your own wheel, because it’ll teach you more about
how they work than reading a thousand books on them ever will.</p>
<p>In 2025, the beauty and craft of writing software is being eroded. AI is threatening to replace us (or, at least, the
most joyful aspects of our craft) and software development is being increasingly commodified, measured, packaged, and
industrialised. Software development needs more simple joy, and I’ve found that creating toy programs is a great way to
remember why I started working with computers again.</p>
<h2>Keep it simple</h2>
<p>Toy programs follow the 80:20 rule: 20% of the work, 80% of the functionality. The point is <em>not</em> to build
production-worthy software (although it is true that some of the best production software began life as a toy).
Aggressively avoid over-engineering, restrict yourself to only whatever code is necessary to achieve your goal. Have
every code path panic/crash until you’re forced to implement it to make progress. You might be surprised by just how
easy it is to build toy versions of software you might previously have considered to be insummountably difficult to
create.</p>
<h2>Other benefits</h2>
<p>I’ve been consistently surprised by just how often some arcane nugget of knowledge I’ve acquired when working on a toy
project has turned out to be immensely valuable in my day job, either by giving me a head-start on tracking down a
problem in a tool or library, or by recognising mistakes before they’re made.</p>
<p>Understanding the constraints that define the shape of software is vital for working with it, and there’s no better way
to gain insight into those constraints than by running into them head-first. You might even come up with some novel
solutions!</p>
<h2>The list</h2>
<p>Here is a list of toy programs I’ve attempted over the past 15 years, rated by difficulty and time required. These
ratings are estimates and assume that you’re already comfortable with at least one general-purpose programming language
and that, like me, you tend to only have an hour or two per day free to write code. Also included are some suggested
resources that I found useful.</p>
<h3>Regex engine (difficulty = 4/10, time = 5 days)</h3>
<p>A regex engine that can read a POSIX-style regex program and recognise strings that match it. Regex is simple yet
shockingly expressive, and writing a competent regex engine will teach you everything you need to know about using the
language too.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Syntax">Wikipedia: Regex</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>x86 OS kernel (difficulty = 7/10, time = 2 months)</h3>
<p>A multiboot-compatible OS kernel with a simple CLI, keyboard/mouse driver, ANSI escape sequence support, memory manager,
scheduler, etc. Additional challenges include writing an in-memory filesystem, user mode and process isolation, loading
ELF executables, and supporting enough video hardware to render a GUI.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/">OS Dev Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/zesterer/tupai"><img src="https://gitlab.com/zesterer/tupai/-/raw/master/doc/images/tupai-0-5-0.png" alt="Tupai"></a></p>
<h3>GameBoy/NES emulator (difficulty = 6/10, time = 3 weeks)</h3>
<p>A crude emulator for the simplest GameBoy or NES games. The GB and the NES are classics, and both have relatively simple
instruction sets and peripheral hardware. Additional challenges include writing competent PPU (video) and PSG (audio)
implementations, along with dealing with some of the more exotic cartridge formats.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gbdev.io/">GB Dev</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki">NES Dev Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>GameBoy Advance game (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2 weeks)</h3>
<p>A sprite-based game (top-down or side-on platform). The GBA is a beautiful little console to write code for and there’s
an active and dedicated development community for the console. I truly believe that the GBA is one of the last game
consoles that can be fully and completely understood by a single developer, right down to instruction timings.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">Tonc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm">GBATEK</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Physics engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>A 2D rigid body physics engine that implements Newtonian physics with support for rectangles, circles, etc. On the
simplest end, just spheres that push away from one-another is quite simple to implement. Things start to get complex
when you introduce more complex shapes, angular momentum, and the like. Additional challenges include making collision
resolution fast and scaleable, having complex interactions move toward a steady state over time, soft-body interactions,
etc.</p>
<h3>Dynamic interpreter (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)</h3>
<p>A tree-walking interpreter for a JavaScript-like language with basic flow control. There’s an unbounded list of extra
things to add to this one, but being able to write programs in my own language still gives me child-like elation. It
feels like a sort of techno-genesis: once you’ve got your own language, you can start building the universe within it.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zesterer/forge"><img src="https://blog.jsbarretto.com/img/forge.webp" alt="Forge"></a></p>
<h3>Compiler for a C-like (difficulty = 8/10, time = 3 months)</h3>
<p>A compiler for a simply-typed C-like programming language with support for at least one target archtecture. Extra
challenges include implementing some of the most common optimisations (inlining, const folding, loop-invariant code
motion, etc.) and designing an intermediate representation (IR) that’s general enough to support multiple backends.</p>
<h3>Text editor (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-4 weeks)</h3>
<p>This one has a lot of variability. At the blunt end, simply reading and writing a file can be done in a few lines of
Python. But building something that’s closer to a daily driver gets more complex. You could choose to implement the UI
using a toolkit like QT or GTK, but I personally favour an editor that works in the console. Properly handling unicode,
syntax highlighting, cursor movement, multi-buffer support, panes/windows, tabs, search/find functionality, LSP support,
etc. can all add between a week or a month to the project. But if you persist, you might join the elite company of those
developers who use an editor of their own creation.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zesterer/zte"><img src="https://github.com/zesterer/zte/raw/master/misc/screenshot.png" alt="ZTE"></a></p>
<h3>Async runtime (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of language-specific variability as to what ‘async’ actually means. In Rust, at least, this means a
library that can ingest <code>impl Future</code> tasks and poll them concurrently until completion. Adding support for I/O waking
makes for a fun challenge.</p>
<h3>Hash map (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)</h3>
<p>Hash maps (or sets/dictionaries, as a higher-level language might call them) are a programmer’s bread &amp; butter. And yet,
surprisingly few of us understand how they really work under the bonnet. There are a plethora of techniques to throw
into the mix too: closed or open addressing, tombstones, the robin hood rule, etc. You’ll gain an appreciation for when
and why they’re fast, and also when you should just use a vector + linear search.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sebastiansylvan.com/post/robin-hood-hashing-should-be-your-default-hash-table-implementation/">Robin Hood Hashing should be your default Hash Table implementation</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Rasteriser / texture-mapper (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2 weeks)</h3>
<p>Most of us have played with simple 3D graphics at some point, but how many of us truly understand how the graphics
pipeline works and, more to the point, how to fix it when it doesn’t work? Writing your own software rasteriser will
give you that knowledge, along with a new-found appreciation for the beauty of vector maths and half-spaces that have
applications across many other fields. Additional complexity involves properly implementing clipping, a Z-buffer, N-gon
rasterisation, perspective-correct texture-mapping, Phong or Gouraud shading, shadow-mapping, etc.</p>

<h3>SDF Rendering (difficulty = 5/10, time = 3 days)</h3>
<p>Signed Distance Fields are a beautifully simple way to render 3D spaces defined through mathematics, and are perfectly
suited to demoscene shaders. With relatively little work you can build yourself a cute little visualisation or some
moving shapes like the graphics demos of the 80s. You’ll also gain an appreciation for shader languages and vector
maths.</p>

<h3>Voxel engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2 weeks)</h3>
<p>I doubt there are many reading this that haven’t played Minecraft. It’s surprisingly easy to build your own toy voxel
engine cut from a similar cloth, especially if you’ve got some knowledge of 3D graphics or game development already. The
simplicity of a voxel engine, combined with the near-limitless creativity that can be expressed with them, never ceases
to fill me with joy. Additional complexity can be added by tackling textures, more complex procedural generation,
floodfill lighting, collisions, dynamic fluids, sending voxel data over the network, etc.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Threaded Virtual Machine (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>Writing interpreters is great fun. What’s more fun? <em>Faster interpreters</em>. If you keep pushing interpreters as far as
they can go without doing architecture-specific codegen (like AOT or JIT), you’ll eventually wind up (re)discovering
<em>threaded code</em> (not to be confused with multi-threading, which is a very different beast). It’s a beautiful way of
weaving programs together out highly-optimised miniature programs, and a decent implementation can even give an AOT
compiler a run for its money in the performance department.</p>

</ul>
<h3>GUI Toolkit (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2-3 weeks)</h3>
<p>Most of us have probably cobbled together a GUI program using tkinter, GTK, QT, or WinForms. But why not try writing
your GUI toolkit? Additional complexity involves implementing a competent layout engine, good text shaping (inc.
unicode support), accessibility support, and more. Fair warning: do not encourage people to use your tool unless it’s
<em>battle-tested</em> - the world has enough GUIs with little-to-no accessibility or localisation support.</p>

<h3>Orbital Mechanics Sim (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>A simple simulation of Newtonian gravity can be cobbled together in a fairly short time. Infamously, gravitational
systems with more than two bodies cannot be solved analytically, so you’ll have to get familiar with iterative
<em>integration</em> methods. Additional complexity comes with implementing more precise and faster integration methods,
accounting for relativistic effects, and writing a visualiser. If you’ve got the maths right, you can even try plugging
in real numbers from NASA to predict the next high tide or full moon.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Bitwise Challenge (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2-3 days)</h3>
<p>Here’s one I came up with for myself, but I think it would make for a great game jam: write a game that only persists 64
bits of state between subsequent frames. That’s 64 bits for everything: the entire frame-for-frame game state should be
reproducible using only 64 bits of data. It sounds simple, but it forces you to get incredibly creative with your game
state management. Details about the rules can be found on the GitHub page below.</p>

<h3>An ECS Framework (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)</h3>
<p>For all those game devs out there: try building your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS</a>
framework. It’s not as hard as you might think (you might have accidentally done it already!). Extra points if you can
build in safety and correctness features, as well as good integration with your programming language of choice’s type
system features.</p>
<p>I built a custom ECS for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS5rj80L-pk">Super Mario 64 on the GBA</a> project due to the
unique performance and memory constraints of the platform, and enjoyed it a lot.</p>

<h3>CHIP-8 Emulator (difficulty = 3/10, time = 3-6 days)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is a beautifully simple virtual machine from the 70s. You can write
a fully compliant emulator in a day or two, and there are an enormous plethora of fan-made games that run on it.

<h3>Chess engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-5 days)</h3>
<p>Writing a chess engine is great fun. You’ll start off with every move it makes being illegal, but over time it’ll get
smart and smarter. Experiencing a loss to your own chess engine really is a rite of passage, and it feels magical.</p>

<h3>POSIX shell (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)</h3>
<p>We interact with shells every day, and building one will teach you can incredible amount about POSIX - how it works, and
how it doesn’t. A simple one can be built in a day, but compliance with an existing shell language will take time and
teach you more than you ever wanted to know about its quirks.</p>

<h2>A note on learning and LLMs</h2>
<p>Perhaps you’re a user of LLMs. I get it, they’re neat tools. They’re useful for certain kinds of learning. But I might
suggest resisting the temptation to use them for projects like this. Knowledge is not supposed to be fed to you on a
plate. If you want that sort of learning, read a book - the joy in building toy projects like this comes from an
exploration of the unknown, without polluting one’s mind with an existing solution. If you’ve been using LLMs for a
while, this cold-turkey approach might even be painful at first, but persist. There is no joy without pain.</p>
<p>The runner’s high doesn’t come to those that take the bus.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I was recently poking around inside the original Power Macintosh G3’s ROM and accidentally discovered an easter egg that nobody has documented until now.</p>



<p>This story starts with me on a lazy Sunday using <a href="https://hexfiend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hex Fiend</a> in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/eharmon/rom_fiend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Harmon’s Mac ROM template (ROM Fiend)</a> to look through the resources stored in the Power Mac G3’s ROM. This ROM was used in the beige desktop, minitower, and all-in-one G3 models from 1997 through 1999.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="487" height="466" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12.png 487w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12-300x287.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px"></a></figure>



<p>As I write this post in mid-2025, I’m having a really difficult time accepting the fact that the Power Mac G3 is now over 27 years old. Wow!</p>



<p>While I was browsing through the ROM, two things caught my eye:</p>



<p>First, there was a resource of type <code>HPOE</code> which contained a JPEG image of a bunch of people, presumably people who worked on these Mac models.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/G3Picture.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/G3Picture.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/G3Picture.jpg 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/G3Picture-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>This wasn’t anything new; <a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/2014/08/19/easter-egg-les-images-cachees-dans-les-roms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pierre Dandumont wrote about it back in 2014</a>. However, in his post, he mentioned that he hadn’t figured out how to display this particular hidden image on the actual machine. Several older Macs have secret keypress combinations to show similar pictures, but the mechanism for displaying this one was a complete mystery.</p>



<p>The second thing I found was a big clue: I kept looking for other interesting information in the ROM, and eventually I stumbled upon <code>nitt</code> resource ID 43, named “Native 4.3”. Thanks to <a href="https://blitter.net/blog/2021/02/09/pippin-kickstart-1-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Kaisershot’s earlier Pippin research</a>, I was quickly able to conclude that this was the PowerPC-native SCSI Manager 4.3 code. The SCSI Manager wasn’t what piqued my interest about this resource though. At the very end of the data, I found some interesting Pascal strings:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="460" height="104" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png 460w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-300x68.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a></figure>



<p>These strings were definitely intriguing:</p>



<ul>
<li>.Edisk</li>



<li>secret ROM image</li>



<li>The Team</li>
</ul>



<p>The “secret ROM image” text in particular seemed like it could be related to the picture shown above. I decided to dive deeper to see if I could figure out why the SCSI Manager contained these strings, in the hopes that I could solve the mystery. Would this be the clue I needed in order to figure out how to instruct the Power Mac G3 to display this picture?</p>



<p>Some quick Internet searching for the phrase “secret ROM image” revealed that <a href="https://www.mackido.com/EasterEggs/HW-PCIROM.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had been used for easter eggs with earlier PowerPC Macs</a>. On those machines, you just had to type the text, select it, and drag it to the desktop. Then, the picture would appear. That approach didn’t work on the G3.</p>



<p>I suspected there was some similar way to access this hidden image, but nobody had documented it, at least not as far as I could find. So I had no choice but to disassemble the code and see where this text was used. What is it with me and all these crazy rabbit holes?</p>



<p>I extracted the entire <code>nitt</code> resource ID 43 to a file and inspected it:</p>



<pre>$ file nitt43<br>nitt43: header for PowerPC PEF executable</pre>



<p>That wasn’t too surprising, considering that the first twelve bytes were “Joy!peffpwpc”. I fed this entire file into <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghidra</a>, which immediately recognized it as a PEF file and had no trouble loading it. Although I’m pretty familiar with reading x86 and ARM assembly, I know essentially nothing about PowerPC assembly code. Thankfully, Ghidra’s decompiler worked very well with this file.</p>



<p>There was one problem, though: it didn’t detect any references to the “secret ROM image” string, other than inside of a huge list of pointers to variables. After scratching my head a little bit, I realized that Ghidra wasn’t doing a great job of finding references to several variables. Luckily, running Auto Analyze a second time after the initial analysis seemed to help it find several more references to things, including all of the strings I was interested in! I didn’t change any options with the analyzer; it just found more stuff on the second run.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="765" height="317" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png 765w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2-300x124.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px"></a></figure>



<p>The function that used all of these strings was definitely doing something with the .EDisk driver, which I already knew was the RAM disk driver because of past hackery. It seemed to be using <code>strncmp()</code> to see if a string was equal to “secret ROM image”, and if so, it would create/open/write a file named “The Team”.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="816" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png 704w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3-259x300.png 259w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"></a></figure>



<p>I cleaned up this decompilation quite a bit by giving names to variables and figuring out data types. Fortunately, a lot of the functions like <code>PBGetVInfoSync()</code> had lots of public documentation, so I just had to tell Ghidra about the various Mac Toolbox structs being used.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="661" height="831" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png 661w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4-239x300.png 239w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px"></a></figure>



<p>Okay, that’s a lot easier to understand!</p>



<p>I couldn’t figure out how to format the 32-bit function arguments such as 0x48504f45 into four-letter codes like <code>HPOE</code>, so that’s what the comments are. Ghidra simply wouldn’t let me display them as ASCII in the decompilation no matter what I did, even though hovering over the constant showed a tooltip with the equivalent text. This is easy to do in IDA, but I couldn’t figure out how to convince Ghidra to do it. I tried Set Equate, but it didn’t change anything. If someone knows how to make it work, I’d love to hear how!</p>



<p>Anyway, the decompiled code shown above makes sense, and here’s a summary of what it does:</p>



<ul>
<li>It looks for a driver called .Edisk. (The driver is really named .EDisk, but I guess Mac OS doesn’t care about case sensitivity for this.)</li>



<li>It finds a disk associated with that driver (the RAM disk).</li>



<li>It looks for a volume associated with that disk.</li>



<li>If the volume is named “secret ROM image”:
<ul>
<li>It loads <code>HPOE</code> resource ID 1, which contains the JPEG image data.</li>



<li>It creates a file of creator <code>ttxt</code> and type <code>JPEG</code> called “The Team”.</li>



<li>It opens the file, writes the JPEG data to it, and closes it.</li>



<li>Then it does something with the driver control entry that I didn’t bother trying to understand further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Okay, interesting! So this code was clearly looking for the RAM disk to be named “secret ROM image”, but I wasn’t sure exactly how to trigger it. This function was only ever called in one other place: another function, which was checking to see if its first argument was equal to the value 0x3DA (decimal 986).</p>



<p>I didn’t have my beige G3 handy for tinkering, so instead, I mentioned what I had discovered in #mac68k on Libera. <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@atax1a/114729277160021527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">^alex came to the rescue</a> after playing around in Infinite Mac with the hints I had given. They quickly figured out that the trick was to format the RAM disk, and type the special text into the format dialog:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5-300x225.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>I got out my desktop G3, tested it out on real hardware, and sure enough, it worked! If you want to try it for yourself just like ^alex did, you can <a href="https://infinitemac.org/1998/Mac%20OS%208.1?infinite_hd=false&amp;saved_hd=false&amp;machine=Power+Macintosh+G3+%28Beige%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run Infinite Mac in your browser using this link, which sets up an emulated beige G3 running Mac OS 8.1</a> using DingusPPC. There’s a quirk that causes it to fail to resolve an alias at startup. I intentionally disabled it; just click Stop when the error pops up. Here are instructions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enable the RAM Disk in the Memory control panel.</li>



<li>Choose Restart from the Special menu.</li>



<li>After the desktop comes back up, select the RAM Disk icon.</li>



<li>Choose Erase Disk from the Special menu.</li>



<li>Type the <em>secret ROM image</em> text exactly as depicted above.</li>



<li>Click Erase.</li>
</ul>



<p>When you open the newly-formatted RAM disk, you should see a file named “The Team”:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6-300x225.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>If you double-click the file, SimpleText will open it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-8.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-8.png 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-8-300x225.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>Based on various people’s tests, including my own, it sounds like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/eaglebtc.bsky.social/post/3lsaz3jqsds2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this trick works all the way up through Mac OS 9.0.4</a>, but 9.1 may have been the first version where it finally stopped working.</p>



<p>As far as I have been able to determine, this particular secret was undiscovered until now. People definitely knew the image was there in the ROM, but nobody had figured out how to actually activate it. This is probably one of the last easter eggs that existed in the Mac prior to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-easter-eggs-are-back-in-os-x-and-this-one-is-insane-5929286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Jobs reportedly banning them in 1997 when he returned to Apple</a>. I wonder if he ever knew about this one?</p>



<p>Special thanks to ^alex for figuring out that the RAM Disk needed to be erased in order to activate the easter egg! I’m not sure I would have thought to try that, and it would have taken a lot more work to trace through the rest of the code to figure it out.</p>



<p>If you are reading this post and you were on “The Team”, I’d love to hear about it! I’m curious if anyone who worked at Apple in the era remembers this little secret.</p>

<h2 id="compute-and-memory-hierarchy">Compute and memory hierarchy</h2>

<p>A GPU’s design creates an imbalance since it can compute much faster than it can access its main memory. An NVIDIA A100 GPU, for example, can perform 19.5 trillion 32-bit floating-point operations per second (TFLOPS), but its memory bandwidth is only about 1.5 terabytes per second (TB/s). In the time it takes to read a single 4-byte number, the GPU could have performed over 50 calculations.</p>

<p>Below is a diagram of the compute and memory hierarchy for an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The numbers I quote for flops/s and TB/s are exclusive to A100s.</p>

<p>This diagram shows the performance hierarchy.<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <strong>Global Memory (VRAM)</strong> is the large, slow, off-chip memory pool where all data initially lives. A <strong>Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)</strong> is the GPU’s unit of computation. To work, it must fetch data over the slow bus. To mitigate this, each SM has fast, on-chip <strong>Shared Memory</strong> (SRAM) with a bandwidth of 19.5 TB/s.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Programmers use this as a manually-managed cache.</p>

<p>A <strong>thread</strong> is the smallest unit of execution. Each thread has a private set of <strong>Registers</strong> to hold values for immediate computation, with access speeds over ?? TB/s.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> The hardware groups threads into <strong>Warps</strong> of 32. This post analyzes performance using the simplified model of <strong>lockstep execution</strong>, where all 32 threads in a warp execute the same instruction at the same time.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> On an A100, an SM has an upper limit of 64 warps. A programmer groups threads into a <strong>Block</strong>, a grid of threads that is guaranteed to run on a single SM. A block can be one, two, or three-dimensional. For simplicity, this post will focus on square two-dimensional blocks of <code>BLOCK_DIM x BLOCK_DIM</code> threads, where the total number of threads cannot exceed the hardware limit of 1024. All threads in a block share access to the same on-chip Shared Memory.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-performance-regimes">The Two Performance Regimes</h2>

<p>We analyze the performance of a <strong>kernel</strong>, which is a function launched by the host (CPU) to be executed in parallel by many GPU threads. A kernel’s performance is limited by either its memory bandwidth or its compute throughput. These two limits define the performance regimes.</p>

<p>An operation is <strong>memory-bound</strong> if its runtime is dictated by the speed of transferring data from Global Memory to the SM. For an operation like element-wise addition <code>y = x + 1</code>, the SM performs a trivial number of FLOPs for each element it reads. The SM spends most of its time idle, waiting for data.</p>

<p>An operation is <strong>compute-bound</strong> if its runtime is dictated by the SM’s arithmetic speed. A large matrix multiplication is the canonical example. Once data is loaded into the SM, a massive number of computations are performed. The memory bus is idle while the SM is busy.</p>

<p><strong>Arithmetic Intensity (AI)</strong> is the formal metric that determines the regime. It is the ratio of work to memory traffic.</p>

<p><code>Arithmetic Intensity = Total FLOPs / Total Bytes Accessed</code></p>

<p>For the Roofline model, <code>Total Bytes Accessed</code> specifically counts the data transferred between Global Memory (HBM) and the on-chip SM. This is because the model evaluates a kernel’s performance against the primary bottleneck: the slow off-chip memory bus. On-chip traffic, such as from Shared Memory to registers, is not included in this calculation.</p>

<p>The Roofline Model plots a kernel’s achievable performance (in FLOPs per second) against its AI. The two “roofs” are the hard physical limits of the GPU.</p>

<div><pre><code>  ^ Performance (TFLOPS)

</code></pre></div>

<p>The performance of a kernel is determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When memory-bound, the SMs are stalled waiting for data. The runtime is the time it takes to move that data: <code>Runtime = Bytes_Accessed / Memory_Bandwidth</code>. The kernel’s performance is therefore <code>Performance = Total_FLOPs / Runtime = AI * Memory_Bandwidth</code>. On the log-log plot, this is the diagonal line.</li>
  <li>When compute-bound, the SMs are fully utilized. The performance is limited by their peak arithmetic throughput: <code>Performance = Peak_Compute_FLOPs</code>. This is the horizontal line.</li>
</ul>

<p>A kernel’s actual performance is the minimum of these two values. The <strong>ridge point</strong> is the AI where the two performance ceilings intersect. For the A100, this is <code>19.5 TFLOPS / 1.5 TB/s ≈ 13 FLOPs/Byte</code>. A kernel must exceed this AI to become compute-bound.  A kernel with AI lower than 13 operates in the memory-bound region; a kernel with AI higher than 13 operates in the compute-bound region. The goal of optimization is to increase AI to move the kernel’s operating point to the right, pushing its performance up until it hits the compute roof.</p>

<p>The “Peak Compute” roof of 19.5 TFLOPS is an ideal, achievable only with highly optimized instructions like Tensor Core matrix multiplications and high enough power limits. An operation can be compute-bound but still perform far below this peak. For example, a kernel with high AI that is dominated by scalar arithmetic or complex transcendental functions (<code>sin</code>, <code>exp</code>) will be limited by the throughput of those specific, slower instructions. This creates a lower effective “roof” for that kernel, as shown in the diagram. Increasing AI is necessary, but not sufficient; the FLOPs must also be efficient.</p>

<p>The primary strategy to increase AI is to maximize the reuse of data once it has been loaded into the SM’s fast on-chip memory. The following is a simplified model where a thread reads data from Global Memory directly into its private registers. This analysis calculates the <em>minimum required</em> data transfer; actual memory traffic depends on access patterns, which we will discuss later.</p>

<p>Consider computing <code>C = A@B</code>, where all matrices are <code>N x N</code> and use 4-byte floats.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 1: One thread computes one element <code>C[i,j]</code></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FLOPs:</strong> To compute <code>C[i,j]</code>, the thread performs N multiply-add operations. This is <code>2*N</code> FLOPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Bytes Accessed:</strong> The thread must read row <code>i</code> of A (N floats) and column <code>j</code> of B (N floats). This is a total of <code>2*N</code> floats, or <code>8*N</code> bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Arithmetic Intensity:</strong> <code>(2*N FLOPs) / (8*N Bytes) = 0.25 FLOPs/Byte</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This AI is low. The kernel will be memory-bound.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 2: One thread computes a <code>2x2</code> tile of C</strong>
To compute a <code>2x2</code> tile (<code>C[i,j]</code>, <code>C[i,j+1]</code>, <code>C[i+1,j]</code>, <code>C[i+1,j+1]</code>), the thread must perform the computation for all four elements.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FLOPs:</strong> <code>4 elements * 2*N FLOPs/element = 8*N</code> FLOPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Bytes Accessed:</strong> The thread must read two rows from A (<code>A[i,:]</code>, <code>A[i+1,:]</code>) and two columns from B (<code>B[:,j]</code>, <code>B[:,j+1]</code>). This is <code>2*N + 2*N = 4*N</code> floats, or <code>16*N</code> bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Arithmetic Intensity:</strong> <code>(8*N FLOPs) / (16*N Bytes) = 0.5 FLOPs/Byte</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These AI values are far below the A100’s ridge point of ~13 FLOPs/Byte. This simple register-only model is insufficient to make matrix multiplication compute-bound.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The key to achieving high AI is for threads within a block to cooperate by loading a much larger tile of A and B into the shared, on-chip SRAM. By working together on this shared data, a block of 1024 threads can achieve an AI greater than 13. We will detail the mechanics of this in the section on Shared Memory.</p>

<h2 id="the-third-regime-overhead">The Third Regime: Overhead</h2>

<p>Performance can also be limited by host-side overhead. This is time the CPU (the host) spends preparing work for the GPU, for example, in the Python interpreter or a framework’s dispatch system.</p>

<p>An application is overhead-bound if its GPU kernels are too small or numerous. The GPU executes each small task quickly and then waits, idle, for the CPU to issue the next command. The runtime is dominated by the CPU’s inability to feed the GPU fast enough.</p>

<p>Modern frameworks use asynchronous execution to mitigate this. The host can queue a stream of commands for the GPU without waiting for each one to complete. If the individual GPU operations are sufficiently large, the host can “run ahead,” and the overhead of launching one kernel is hidden by the execution of the previous one.</p>

<p>For the remainder of this post, we assume our kernels are large enough that overhead is not the primary limiter, and focus instead on memory and compute.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="two-basic-strategies-for-increasing-performance-fusion-and-tiling">Two basic strategies for increasing performance: Fusion and Tiling</h2>

<p>With the kernel large enough to make launch overhead negligible, performance is governed by the two physical limits of the GPU: memory bandwidth and compute throughput. Increasing the performance of a kernel, therefore, means pushing its operating point on the Roofline model up and to the right. There are two basic strategies for achieving this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a sequence of individually memory-bound operations, the strategy is to <strong>fuse</strong> them into a single kernel to eliminate intermediate memory traffic.</li>
  <li>For a single, complex operation with high potential arithmetic intensity (like matrix multiplication), the strategy is to use <strong>tiling</strong> to maximize data reuse within the SM’s fast memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will address each strategy in turn.</p>

<h3 id="operator-fusion">Operator Fusion</h3>

<p>Chains of simple operations like <code>y = relu(x + 1)</code> are common. Each operation (<code>add</code>, <code>relu</code>) has a very low arithmetic intensity and is memory-bound. Executing them as separate, sequential GPU kernels is inefficient. The primary strategy to optimize these sequences is <strong>operator fusion</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem is the intermediate memory traffic. Consider the unfused execution of <code>y = relu(x + 1)</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Kernel 1 (<code>add</code>):</strong> Reads the entire tensor <code>x</code> from global memory. Computes <code>tmp = x + 1</code>. Writes the entire intermediate tensor <code>tmp</code> back to global memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Kernel 2 (<code>relu</code>):</strong> Reads the entire tensor <code>tmp</code> from global memory. Computes <code>y = relu(tmp)</code>. Writes the final tensor <code>y</code> back to global memory.</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is wasteful. It involves two separate kernel launch overheads and forces a round-trip to slow global memory for the intermediate <code>tmp</code> tensor.</p>

<p>Fusion combines these steps into a single, more efficient GPU kernel. A JIT compiler like Triton or <code>torch.compile</code>’s Inductor backend can perform this transformation automatically.</p>

<p>In the fused kernel:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A single thread reads one element of <code>x</code> from global memory into its private registers.</li>
  <li>It performs all computations, i.e., <code>tmp = x + 1</code>, then <code>y = relu(tmp)</code>, entirely within those fast registers.</li>
  <li>It writes only the final result <code>y</code> back to global memory.</li>
</ol>

<p>The intermediate tensor <code>tmp</code> becomes ephemeral, never materializing in global memory. This cuts the memory traffic in half (one read of <code>x</code>, one write of <code>y</code>) and eliminates the launch overhead of the second kernel.</p>

<h3 id="tiling-strategy-for-compute-bound-kernels">Tiling: Strategy for Compute-Bound Kernels</h3>

<p>Our register-only model for <code>C=A@B</code> yielded an arithmetic intensity of 0.25 FLOPs/Byte, far below the A100’s ridge point of ~13. This is because a single thread reads <code>2*N</code> values to perform <code>2*N</code> FLOPs; the data is used once and then discarded. To increase data reuse and become compute-bound, threads within a block must cooperate to load large tiles of the input matrices into the SM’s fast, on-chip Shared Memory.</p>

<p>The logic of this cooperation is based on decomposing the matrix product. The calculation for a single element <code>C[i,j]</code> is a sum over the <code>k</code> dimension: <code>C[i,j] = sum_k A[i,k] B[k,j]</code>. This sum can be partitioned into a sum of partial sums over tiles. For square tiles, the inner <code>k</code> dimension is broken into tiles of size <code>BLOCK_DIM</code>, matching the outer dimensions. The formula becomes:`</p><p>

\[C[i,j] = \sum_{t=0}^{\text{NUM_K_TILES}-1} \left( \sum_{k=t \cdot \text{BLOCK_DIM}}^{(t+1) \cdot \text{BLOCK_DIM} - 1} A[i,k] B[k,j] \right)\]

</p><p>The tiling algorithm computes one term from the outer sum (one partial product) per iteration. A block of threads computes one output <code>C_tile</code> by iterating through the <code>k</code> dimension, loading tiles of A and B, computing their product on-chip, and accumulating the result. This is achieved with a three-phase pattern: <strong>Load, Synchronize, and Compute</strong>.</p>

<p>We now examine the mechanics of the three-phase <strong>Load, Synchronize, Compute</strong> pattern.</p>

<h3 id="the-coalesced-load-hbm-to-sram">The Coalesced Load: HBM to SRAM</h3>

<p>The first phase loads tiles of A and B from slow global memory (HBM) into fast on-chip Shared Memory (SRAM). The goal is to perform this transfer with the maximum possible memory bandwidth. This requires <strong>coalesced memory access</strong>. A memory access is coalesced when all 32 threads in a warp access a single, contiguous 128-byte block of HBM in one transaction.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the kernel maps thread indices to memory addresses. For a <code>BLOCK_DIM x BLOCK_DIM</code> block of threads loading a data tile of the same size, a common mapping is for thread <code>(tx, ty)</code> to be responsible for loading <code>A[global_row + ty, global_k + tx]</code> into <code>A_tile[ty, tx]</code> in Shared Memory. In this example, <code>BLOCK_DIM</code> is 32.</p>

<p>Consider a single warp of threads where <code>ty</code> is fixed and <code>tx</code> ranges from 0 to 31.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thread <code>(0, ty)</code> reads <code>A[global_row + ty, global_k + 0]</code>.</li>
  <li>Thread <code>(1, ty)</code> reads <code>A[global_row + ty, global_k + 1]</code>.</li>
  <li>…</li>
  <li>Thread <code>(31, ty)</code> reads <code>A[global_row + ty, global_k + 31]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming row-major storage, these threads access 32 consecutive 4-byte floats, a contiguous 128-byte segment. This is a perfect coalesced read. The entire <code>32x32</code> tile is loaded in 32 such coalesced reads, one for each warp in the block.</p>

<div><pre><code>   Thread Block (32x32)          Global Memory (HBM)
                                 (One row of A's tile)
   +--------------------+
   | Warp 0 (ty=0)      | ----&gt; [A_ij, A_i,j+1, ..., A_i,j+31]  (128 bytes)
   | (tx = 0..31)       |       (One coalesced memory transaction)
   +--------------------+
   | Warp 1 (ty=1)      | ----&gt; [A_i+1,j, ..., A_i+1,j+31] (128 bytes)
   +--------------------+
   | ...                |
   +--------------------+
   | Warp 31 (ty=31)    | ----&gt; [A_i+31,j, ..., A_i+31,j+31] (128 bytes)
   +--------------------+
</code></pre></div>

<p>This load can be made more efficient with <strong>vectorized access</strong>. The physical memory transaction for a coalesced read fetches the full 128 bytes from HBM regardless. The difference is how the SM requests this data.</p>

<p>With scalar loads, the warp must issue 32 separate 32-bit load instructions. With vectorized loads, it issues only 8 wider 128-bit load instructions. This is more efficient because the SM has a limited number of instruction issue slots per clock cycle. Requesting the data with 8 wide instructions consumes fewer of these hardware resources than requesting it with 32 narrow instructions. This ensures the memory controller is kept busy with a continuous stream of full-width requests, increasing the <em>utilized</em> memory bandwidth by reducing SM-side bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Vectorized access is enabled by casting pointers in device code (e.g., from <code>float*</code> to <code>float4*</code>), promising the compiler that the memory is aligned to the vector size.</p>

<p>The efficiency of these vectorized loads relies on <strong>memory alignment</strong>. A single <code>float4</code> instruction loads a 16-byte vector. For a matrix of 4-byte floats, this vector contains 4 elements. The hardware executes this instruction efficiently only if the memory address is a multiple of 16. This means the matrix’s inner dimension <code>K</code> (the number of columns) must be a multiple of 4. If <code>K</code> is not a multiple of 4, the rows become misaligned with the 16-byte memory segments.</p>

<p>Consider a matrix of 4-byte floats and a memory system with 16-byte segments.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> This row-wise strategy provides coalesced access for matrix A. For matrix B, the required access patterns are in opposition.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>HBM Requirement:</strong> To maintain coalescing, the B tile must be read from HBM row-by-row.</li>
  <li><strong>Compute Requirement:</strong> The matrix multiplication itself requires access to columns of the B tile.</li>
</ol>

<p>Loading columns directly from a row-major matrix is an uncoalesced, strided access that serializes HBM transactions. The solution is therefore to load the B tile using coalesced row-reads, but then rearrange the data as it is written into Shared Memory. The structure of this rearrangement is dictated by the physical, banked architecture of Shared Memory.</p>

<h3 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h3>

<p>The <code>__syncthreads()</code> call acts as a barrier. No thread in the block proceeds until all threads have reached this point. This ensures the <code>A_tile</code> and <code>B_tile</code> are fully loaded into Shared Memory before the compute phase begins.<sup id="fnref:sync" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sync" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>:</p>

<h3 id="the-on-chip-hardware-banks-and-warps">The On-Chip Hardware: Banks and Warps</h3>

<p>Shared Memory is a physical resource located on the Streaming Multiprocessor (SM). When a thread block is scheduled to run on an SM, it is allocated a portion of that SM’s total Shared Memory for its exclusive use.</p>

<p>The Shared Memory is physically partitioned into 32 independent memory modules of equal size, called <strong>banks</strong>. These banks can service memory requests in parallel. This number is not arbitrary; it is matched to the <strong>warp size</strong>. Recall that a warp consists of 32 threads that execute instructions in lockstep, and it is the fundamental unit of memory access. The 32 banks are designed to serve, in parallel, the 32 memory requests from a single warp in one clock cycle, provided those requests target different banks.</p>

<p>Addresses, representing 4-byte words, are interleaved across the banks.</p>
<div><pre><code>bank 0:  [word 0, word 32, word 64, ...]
bank 1:  [word 1, word 33, word 65, ...]
...
bank 31: [word 31, word 63, word 95, ...]
</code></pre></div>
<p>The bank for a given word address is determined by <code>bank_id = address % 32</code>.</p>

<h3 id="the-bank-conflict-problem">The Bank Conflict Problem</h3>

<p>To achieve the full bandwidth of Shared Memory, the 32 threads of a warp must access words that fall into 32 different banks. A <strong>bank conflict</strong> occurs when multiple threads access different addresses that map to the same bank. The hardware resolves this by serializing the requests, reducing bandwidth. A <strong>broadcast</strong>, where all threads read the <em>same</em> address, is a fast, conflict-free operation.</p>

<p>This creates a problem for matrix multiplication. Consider a <code>BLOCK_DIM x BLOCK_DIM</code> tile stored in Shared Memory in a row-major layout, where <code>BLOCK_DIM=32</code>. The address of <code>tile[row, col]</code> is <code>row * 32 + col</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Row Access (A_tile):</strong> A warp accesses <code>A_tile[fixed_row, t]</code> for <code>t = 0..31</code>. The addresses are <code>fixed_row * 32 + t</code>. The bank for each thread <code>t</code> is <code>(fixed_row * 32 + t) % 32 = t % 32</code>. Since <code>t</code> is unique for each thread, the threads access 32 unique banks. This is a conflict-free, full-bandwidth access.</li>
  <li><strong>Column Access (B_tile):</strong> A warp accesses <code>B_tile[t, fixed_col]</code> for <code>t = 0..31</code>. The addresses are <code>t * 32 + fixed_col</code>. The bank for each thread <code>t</code> is <code>(t * 32 + fixed_col) % 32 = fixed_col % 32</code>. All 32 threads target the same bank. This causes a 32-way bank conflict, serializing the memory access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution is to store the <code>B_tile</code> in a transposed layout within Shared Memory.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># Action for thread (tx, ty) during the load phase

<p>This “load-and-transpose” maneuver alters the on-chip computation. The calculation for an element of the partial product is no longer a dot product between a row of <code>A_tile</code> and a column of <code>B_tile</code>. Instead, using the transposed on-chip <code>B_tile</code>, the formula becomes:</p><p>

\[C_{\text{partial}}[i,j] = \sum_{k} A_{\text{tile}}[i,k] \cdot B_{\text{tile}}[j,k]\]

</p><p>In this formulation, a warp of threads computing different <code>j</code> values for a fixed <code>i</code> will access a row from <code>A_tile</code> and a row from the on-chip <code>B_tile</code>. Both are conflict-free access patterns. This single strategy solves both the HBM coalescing requirement and the SRAM bank conflict problem.</p>

<div><pre><code>   Load-and-Transpose Operation (Thread tx, ty)

<h3 id="e-the-on-chip-compute-phase-increasing-arithmetic-intensity">E. The On-Chip Compute Phase: Increasing Arithmetic Intensity</h3>

<p>With data staged in Shared Memory, the block performs the computation. The goal is to maximize data reuse from this fast on-chip memory. We will analyze two strategies for structuring this on-chip computation.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 1: One thread computes one output</strong></p>

<p>The simplest approach maps one output element to one thread. A <code>BLOCK_DIM x BLOCK_DIM</code> thread block computes a <code>TILE_DIM x TILE_DIM</code> data tile, where <code>BLOCK_DIM</code> and <code>TILE_DIM</code> are equal. This strategy is conceptually similar to <strong>Kernel 3</strong> in <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM" target="_blank">Boehm’s post</a>, which introduces Shared Memory caching.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> The hardware limit of 1024 threads per block constrains <code>BLOCK_DIM</code> to be at most 32. Thread <code>(tx, ty)</code> is responsible for a single output element <code>C_partial[ty, tx]</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># Action for a single thread (tx, ty) where BLOCK_DIM = TILE_DIM
</span><span>c_accumulator</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span>
<span>for</span> <span>k</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>TILE_DIM</span><span>):</span>
    <span>c_accumulator</span> <span>+=</span> <span>A_tile</span><span>[</span><span>ty</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>B_tile</span><span>[</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The arithmetic intensity for this strategy is <code>TILE_DIM / 4</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Total FLOPs:</strong> The block performs <code>2 * TILE_DIM^3</code> FLOPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Total Bytes Accessed (HBM):</strong> The block loads two data tiles, totaling <code>8 * TILE_DIM^2</code> bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Arithmetic Intensity (AI):</strong> <code>(2 * TILE_DIM^3) / (8 * TILE_DIM^2) = TILE_DIM / 4</code> FLOPs/Byte.</li>
</ul>

<p>With <code>TILE_DIM</code> limited to 32, the maximum AI is <code>32 / 4 = 8</code>. This is insufficient to cross the A100’s ridge point of ~13. The kernel remains memory-bound.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 2: One thread computes multiple outputs</strong></p>

<p>To increase AI, we must increase <code>TILE_DIM</code> without increasing the number of threads. This requires decoupling the data tile size from the thread block size. We assign more work to each thread. This strategy corresponds to the goal of <strong>Kernel 5</strong> in <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM" target="_blank">Boehm’s post.</a></p>

<p>A <code>16x16</code> thread block (<code>BLOCK_DIM = 16</code>, 256 threads) can compute a <code>64x64</code> data tile (<code>TILE_DIM = 64</code>). Each thread now computes a <code>4x4</code> sub-tile of the output. This requires <code>TILE_DIM=64</code> to not exceed Shared Memory capacity.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>The AI calculation remains <code>TILE_DIM / 4</code>. With <code>TILE_DIM = 64</code>, the AI is <code>64 / 4 = 16</code> FLOPs/Byte. This exceeds the A100’s ridge point. The kernel is now <strong>compute-bound</strong>.</p>

<p>A compute-bound kernel’s runtime is limited by the SM’s arithmetic throughput. This does not guarantee high absolute performance. A kernel can be compute-bound but still be slow if its FLOPs are inefficient (e.g., using scalar FP32 math instead of specialized hardware like Tensor Cores<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>) or if the GPU operates below its peak clock speed due to power limits.</p>

<p>The inner loop in the code above can be further optimized. A thread loads four separate <code>float</code> values from <code>A_tile</code> into <code>a_regs</code>. It can instead issue a single instruction to load a 16-byte <code>float4</code> vector. This vectorized load from Shared Memory reduces the number of instructions issued for on-chip data movement, improving the efficiency of the compute phase. This corresponds to the on-chip vectorization refinement used in <strong>Kernel 6</strong> of <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM" target="_blank">Boehm’s post.</a></p>

<p><strong>A Final Consideration: Tile Quantization</strong></p>

<p>If matrix dimensions are not multiples of the tile size, the kernel launches extra blocks that perform wasted computation.</p>

<p>To cover an <code>M x N</code> matrix with <code>TILE_M x TILE_N</code> tiles, the GPU launches a grid of <code>ceil(M/TILE_M) x ceil(N/TILE_N)</code> thread blocks. Tiling a 65x65 matrix with 32x32 tiles requires a <code>ceil(65/32) x ceil(65/32)</code> = 3x3 grid of blocks. The kernel’s logic is fixed; each block is programmed to perform the arithmetic for a full 32x32 tile.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html#tile-quant" target="_blank">According to NVIDIA</a>, “While libraries ensure that invalid memory accesses are not performed by any of the tiles, all tiles will perform the same amount of math.” My understanding of why this happens (I’m happy to be corrected): Boundary blocks perform wasted work because the kernel explicitly pads the data. Threads assigned to load elements from outside the matrix bounds are prevented from doing so by a guard condition. Instead, they write zero to their location in the on-chip Shared Memory tile. The arithmetic loops are not shortened. The kernel’s logic is uniform across the tile. All threads in a warp execute the same multiply-add instructions. A thread whose data corresponds to a padded zero still executes the instruction; it just performs a useless computation, such as <code>C += A * 0</code>. The hardware resources are used, but the  work is discarded.</p>

<h2 id="additional-performance-considerations">Additional Performance Considerations</h2>

<p>We have made our kernel compute-bound. Its performance is now limited by the speed of its on-chip arithmetic. However, the kernel can still be made faster by managing additional aspects of the hardware. The following are three such considerations. There are others, but I’m not quite advanced enough to write about them, yet. See <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM" target="_blank">Boehm’s post</a> for others.</p>

<h3 id="occupancy-and-latency-hiding">Occupancy and Latency Hiding</h3>

<p>A warp <strong>stalls</strong> when it executes a long-latency instruction, such as a read from Global Memory. It cannot execute its next instruction until the data arrives, which can take hundreds of clock cycles. During this time, the SM’s compute units would be idle if the stalled warp were the only work available.</p>

<p>The SM hides this latency by executing other work. It can hold multiple thread blocks concurrently, creating a pool of resident warps. When one warp stalls, the SM’s hardware scheduler instantly switches to a different warp from this pool that is ready to run. This mechanism is called <strong>latency hiding</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Occupancy</strong> is the ratio of active warps on an SM to the maximum number it can support. High occupancy gives the scheduler a larger pool of warps to choose from. This increases the likelihood that it can find a ready warp to execute at any given cycle, keeping the compute units active.</p>

<p>This leads to a trade-off between the resources used per block and the number of blocks that can reside on an SM. The two extremes can be visualized as follows:</p>

<p>We tune the kernel’s resource usage to balance the benefit of high AI against the necessity of sufficient occupancy.

<p>This serialization doubles the execution time of the divergent code, halving the warp’s effective throughput. We avoid this cost by writing branchless code in performance-critical sections, using primitives like <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> instead of <code>if-else</code>.</p>

<h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>

<p>Quantization reduces precision of elements of our tensor, from, say FP32 to FP16 or BFP16. This has two effects. First, it reduces the memory needed to store each element, for example, by 2. Thus, we can transfer twice as many elements per second from global memory to shared memory. This increases AI by 2.</p>

<p>Second, GPUs, such as the A100, can operate faster on lower precision elements. For example, on an A100, 312 TFLOPS are achievable for certain FP16 operations, whereas FP32 operations are limited to 19.5 TFLOPS. Thus, theoretically we can speedup computation by a factor of 16.</p>

<p>Quantization can therefore move us up and to the right on the Roofline plot.</p>

            Ripping the plastic wrap from the meat or prepackaged fruit and veggies you purchased at the grocery store may contaminate your food with micro- and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/health/bottled-water-nanoplastics-study-wellness">nanoplastics</a>, according to new research.
    </p>

            Plastic contamination may also occur when you’re unwrapping deli meat and cheese, steeping a tea bag in hot water, or opening cartons of milk or orange juice. Glass bottles and jars with a plastic-coated metal closure may also shed microscopic bits of plastic, the study found.

            In fact, the abrasion from repeatedly opening and closing the caps on glass and plastic bottles can release an untold amount of micro- and nanoplastics into the beverage, said Lisa Zimmermann, lead author of the study published Tuesday in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3" target="_blank">journal NPJ Science of Food</a>.

            “The research shows the number of microplastics increases with each bottle opening, so therefore we can say it’s the usage of the food contact article which leads to micro- and nanoplastic release,” said Zimmermann, scientific communication officer at the Food Packaging Forum, a nonprofit foundation based in Zurich, Switzerland, that studies chemicals in food contact materials.

            “This is the first systematic evidence of how normal and intended use of foodstuffs packaged in plastics can be contaminated with micro- and nanoplastics,” Zimmermann said. “We found food packaging is actually a direct source of the micro- and nanoplastics measured in food.”

            And while scientists have long known about potentially toxic chemicals from plastics leaching into food, “what’s less clear, and deeply concerning, is just how significant food packaging is as a source of exposure to plastic particles and what that means for our health,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a Washington, DC-based health and environmental advocacy organization, in an email.

            At 1,000th the average width of a human hair, experts say nanoplastics are so teeny they can migrate through the tissues of the digestive tract or lungs into the bloodstream.

            Microplastic research is quite new, and studies so far often use different methods of microplastic identification and measurement. The lack of standard protocol can make it difficult to adequately compare findings, said senior study author Jane Muncke, managing director and chief scientific officer at the Food Packaging Forum.

            “The novel aspect of our analysis is we didn’t just collect all the studies, but we also examined the scientific reliability of their methods. We included a critical appraisal step,” Muncke said. “That left us with seven highly reliable studies — more high-quality research is definitely needed.”
    </p>

            According to that research, ultraprocessed foods contain significantly more microplastics than minimally processed foods.

            “There’s a higher number of manufacturing steps with ultraprocessed foods, which can increase the contact time with plastic food processing equipment,” Muncke said, “thus increasing the chance of micro- and nanoplastic migration.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9l31wz00123b6mws7kn09d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Migration into food also increased when the plastic packaging was heated, washed for reuse, exposed to sunlight and subjected to mechanical stress — such as the twist used to open a bottle cap, according to the review. That sort of repeated stress could lead to higher abrasion than opening a plastic container, so future research should consider how plastic is used as well as the types of plastics, Muncke said.

            “This is a rigorous, detailed and critical study that applies robust systematic methods to review the existing literature on microplastics and food contact materials,” said Megan Deeney, a research fellow and doctoral student in plastics and global health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine at the University of London, in an email.

            “What is particularly important is that the authors take the time to extract and evaluate evidence on whether the presence of microplastics changed over time in these studies — this can help to identify the food contact material itself as a direct source of food contamination by microplastics,” said Deeney, who was not involved with the new research.

            One of the studies included in the new review found 1 liter of water — the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters bought at the store — contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles from seven types of plastics, of which 90% were identified as nanoplastics and the rest were microplastics.

            Another example involved <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/economically-motivated-adulteration-food-fraud/melamine-tableware-questions-and-answers" target="_blank">melamine</a>, which is used to make bowls, plates, cups and other plastic tableware.

            “In one study, researchers washed a melamine bowl 10 times, 20 times, 50 times, 100 times and measured the amount of microplastic it released each time,” Zimmermann said. “Then they put something in the bowl and tested it and found more microplastic release after increased washing.”

Here is it <a href="#demo-video">on YouTube</a>.</strong></p><p>I was surprised at how painless it was to switch things over. You can see the
git diffs to make the change for both of my example
<a href="https://github.com/nickjj/docker-flask-example/commit/8972f04c7724ad1ea5bfec6d18b2ca111575ab28" target="_blank">Flask</a>

projects. In this post we’ll go into more detail about these changes and how to
use a few <code>uv</code> commands.</p><h3 id="pyprojecttoml-vs-requirementstxt"><a href="#pyprojecttoml-vs-requirementstxt">#</a>
pyproject.toml vs requirements.txt</h3><p>Let’s start with defining our project’s dependencies.</p><p>You can create a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file and delete your <code>requirements.txt</code> after
you’ve entered your project’s dependencies and their versions into
<code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p><p>You only need to add your top level dependencies, uv will make a lock file for
you automatically which is somewhat comparable to what <code>pip freeze</code> would
produce except uv’s lock file has proper dependency trees and is way better.</p><p>Here’s a very small diff that shows an example of what to do, adjust it as
needed:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span># pyproject.toml
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>+[project]
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+dependencies = [
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+  "redis==5.2.1",
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+]
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span># requirements.txt
</span></span><span><span><span>-redis==5.2.1
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="dockerfile"><a href="#dockerfile">#</a>
Dockerfile</h3><p>It’s important that these steps happen in order. For example you’ll want the
environment variables defined before you install your dependencies.</p><h4>Install uv</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>+COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.7.13 /uv /uvx /usr/local/bin/
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li>Ensure both <code>uv</code> and <code>uvx</code> binaries are installed on your system’s path<ul><li>Since uv is a compiled Rust tool we only need statically compiled binaries</li><li>You can find the latest release here: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases</a></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Dependency Files</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>-COPY --chown=python:python requirements*.txt ./
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>+COPY --chown=python:python pyproject.toml uv.lock* ./
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li>Reference uv’s dependency related files instead<ul><li>That trailing <code>*</code> is important because it makes the lock file optional<ul><li>The first time you build your project the lock file might not exist</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Environment Variables</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>+ENV \
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+  UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1 \
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+  UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT="/home/python/.local" \
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li><code>UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE</code><ul><li>Python source files will be compiled to bytecode<ul><li>This is preferred since all bytecode gets compiled once at build time<ul><li>Your app doesn’t need to do this at run-time when the container starts</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> instructs uv to not make a virtual environment (venv)<ul><li>My example apps run things as a non-root <code>python</code> user</li><li>Ultimately all Python dependencies will be installed in this path</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Dependency Install Commands</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>-RUN chmod 0755 bin/* &amp;&amp; bin/pip3-install
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>+RUN chmod 0755 bin/* &amp;&amp; bin/uv-install
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In both cases I extracted their install commands to a separate script so it’s
easy to either run at build time in the Dockerfile (as seen above), or by
running it as a command at run-time to make sure your lock file gets updated
on your host machine through a volume.</p><p>In any case, both solutions are just shell scripts. Here’s the one for uv with
comments:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>set</span> -o errexit
</span></span><span><span><span>set</span> -o pipefail
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Ensure we always have an up to date lock file.</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>if</span> ! <span>test</span> -f uv.lock <span>||</span> ! uv lock --check 2&gt;/dev/null<span>;</span> <span>then</span>
</span></span><span><span>  uv lock
</span></span><span><span><span>fi</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Use the existing lock file exactly how it is defined.</span>
</span></span><span><span>uv sync --frozen --no-install-project
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>There’s a few ways to use uv, such as using its pip sub-command but I like
using sync since it’s the “uv way” of doing things. The pip sub-command is
there to help create a mental model of how uv works, or continue using pip’s
commands through uv if you prefer.</em></p><p>The <code>--frozen</code> flag ensures the lock file doesn’t get updated. That’s exactly
what we want because we expect the lock file to have a complete list of exact
versions we want to use for all dependencies that get installed.</p><p>The <code>--no-install-project</code> flag skips installing your code as a Python package.
Since we have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> with a project defined the default behavior
is to install it as a package.</p><p>For a typical web app, you usually have your project’s dependencies and that’s
it. Your project isn’t an installable project in itself. However, if you do
have that use case feel free to remove this flag! You can think of this as
using <code>--editable .</code> with pip.</p><h3 id="add-update-or-delete-your-dependencies"><a href="#add-update-or-delete-your-dependencies">#</a>
Add, Update or Delete Your Dependencies</h3><p>If you’re using my example starter app, it comes with a few <a href="https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/replacing-make-with-a-shell-script-for-running-your-projects-tasks">run script</a> shortcuts. They’re shortcut shell scripts to run certain commands in a
container:</p><ul><li><code>./run deps:install</code><ul><li>Build a new image and volume mount out a new lock file</li><li>It’s mainly doing <code>docker compose build</code> and running <code>bin/uv-install</code> inside of a container which has a volume mount so your host’s lock file gets updated</li></ul></li><li><code>./run deps:install --no-build</code><ul><li>The same as above except it skips building but still mounts out a new lock file</li></ul></li><li><code>./run uv [...]</code><ul><li>It’s doing <code>docker compose exec web uv [...]</code></li><li>Execute any <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/" target="_blank"><code>uv</code> commands</a> you want, for example:<ul><li><code>uv add mypackage --no-sync</code><ul><li>Updates your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file and lock file but doesn’t install it<ul><li>Then you can run <code>./run deps:install</code></li></ul></li><li>This will either add a new dependency OR update an existing one<ul><li>For adding, if you omit <code>==X.X.X</code> it will add the current latest version as <code>&gt;=X.X.X</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code></li><li>For updating, include <code>==X.X.X</code> so <code>pyproject.toml</code> gets updated</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>uv remove mypackage --no-sync</code><ul><li>The same as above except it removes the package</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>./run uv:outdated</code><ul><li>It’s doing <code>docker compose exec web uv tree --outdated --depth 1</code></li><li>Show a list of outdated dependencies so you know what to update</li></ul></li></ul><p>The video below goes over the diffs together and runs some of the above commands.</p><h3 id="demo-video"><a href="#demo-video">#</a>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p>A bill purporting to target the issue of misinformation and defamation caused by generative AI has mutated into something that could change the internet forever, harming speech and innovation from here on out.</p>
<p>The Nurture Originals, Foster Art and Keep Entertainment Safe (NO FAKES) Act aims to address understandable concerns about generative AI-created “replicas” by creating a broad new intellectual property right. That approach was <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/04/congress-should-just-say-no-no-fakes">the first mistake</a>: rather than giving people targeted tools to protect against harmful misrepresentations<span data-huuid="17382269887519388031">—</span>balanced against the need to protect legitimate speech such as parodies and satires<span data-huuid="17382269887519388031">—</span>the original NO FAKES just federalized an image-licensing system.</p>
<p><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-throw-out-the-no-fakes-act-and-start-over">Take Action</a></p>
<p><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-throw-out-the-no-fakes-act-and-start-over">Tell Congress to Say No to NO FAKES</a></p>
<p>The updated bill doubles down on that initial mistaken approach by mandating a whole new censorship infrastructure for that system, encompassing not just images but the products and services used to create them, with few safeguards against abuse.</p>
<p>The new version of NO FAKES requires almost every internet gatekeeper to create a system that will a) take down speech upon receipt of a notice; b) keep down any recurring instance<span data-huuid="17382269887519388031">—</span>meaning, adopt inevitably overbroad replica filters on top of the already deeply flawed copyright filters; &nbsp;c) take down and filter tools that might have been used to make the image; and d) unmask the user who uploaded the material based on nothing more than the say so of person who was allegedly “replicated.”</p>
<p>This bill would be a disaster for internet speech and innovation.</p>
<h4><strong>Targeting Tools</strong></h4>
<p>The first version of NO FAKES focused on digital replicas. The new version goes further, targeting tools that can be used to produce images that aren’t authorized by the individual, anyone who owns the rights in that individual’s image, or the law. Anyone who makes, markets, or hosts such tools is on the hook. There are some limits<span data-huuid="17382269887519388031">—</span>the tools must be primarily designed for, or have only limited commercial uses other than making unauthorized images<span data-huuid="17382269887519388031">—</span>but those limits will offer cold comfort to developers given that they can be targeted based on nothing more than a bare allegation. These provisions effectively give rights-holders the veto power on innovation they’ve long sought in the copyright wars, based on the same tech panics.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Takedown Notices and Filter Mandate</strong></h4>
<p>The first version of NO FAKES set up a notice and takedown system patterned on the DMCA, with even fewer safeguards. NO FAKES expands it to cover more service providers and require those providers to not only take down targeted materials (or tools) but keep them from being uploaded in the future. &nbsp;In other words, adopt broad filters or lose the safe harbor.</p>
<p>Filters are already a huge problem <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unfiltered-how-youtubes-content-id-discourages-fair-use-and-dictates-what-we-see-online">when it comes to copyright</a>, and at least in that instance all it <em>should </em>be doing is flagging for human review if an upload appears to be a whole copy of a work. The reality is that these systems often flag things that are <em>similar </em>but not the same (like two different people playing the same piece of <a href="https://www.eff.org/takedowns/sony-finally-admits-it-doesnt-own-bach-and-it-only-took-public-pressure">public domain music</a>). They also flag things for infringement based on <a href="https://www.eff.org/takedowns/mistake-so-bad-even-youtube-says-its-copyright-bot-really-blew-it">mere seconds of a match</a>, and they frequently do not take into account <a href="https://www.eff.org/takedowns">context that would make the use authorized by law</a>.</p>
<p>But copyright filters are not yet required by law. NO FAKES would create a legal mandate that will inevitably lead to hecklers’ vetoes and other forms of over-censorship.</p>
<p>The bill does contain carve outs for parody, satire, and commentary, but those will also be cold comfort for those who cannot afford to litigate the question.</p>
<h4><strong>Threats to Anonymous Speech</strong></h4>
<p>As currently written, NO FAKES also allows anyone to get a subpoena from a court clerk—not a judge, and without any form of proof—forcing a service to hand over identifying information about a user.</p>
<p>We've already seen abuse of a similar system in action. In copyright cases, those unhappy with the criticisms being made against them get such subpoenas to silence critics. Often that the criticism includes the complainant's own words as proof of the criticism, an ur-example of fair use. But the subpoena is issued anyway and, unless the service is incredibly on the ball, the user can be unmasked.</p>
<p>Not only does this chill further speech, the unmasking itself can cause harm to users. Either reputationally or in their personal life.</p>
<h4><strong>Threats to Innovation</strong></h4>
<p>Most of us are very unhappy with the state of Big Tech. It seems like not only are we increasingly forced to use the tech giants, but that the quality of their services is actively degrading. By increasing the sheer amount of infrastructure a new service would need to comply with the law, NO FAKES makes it harder for any new service to challenge Big Tech. It is probably not a coincidence that some of these very giants are okay with this new version of NO FAKES.</p>
<p>Requiring removal of tools, apps, and services could likewise stymie innovation. For one, it would harm people using such services for otherwise lawful creativity. &nbsp;For another, it would discourage innovators from developing new tools. Who wants to invest in a tool or service that can be forced offline by nothing more than an allegation?</p>
<p>This bill is a solution in search of a problem. Just a few months ago, Congress passed Take It Down, which targeted images involving intimate or sexual content. That deeply flawed bill pressures platforms to actively monitor online speech, including speech that is presently encrypted. But if Congress is really worried about privacy harms, it should at least wait to see the effects of the last piece of&nbsp;internet regulation before going further into a new one. Its failure to do so makes clear that this is not about protecting victims of harmful digital replicas.</p>
<p>NO FAKES is designed to consolidate control over the commercial exploitation of digital images, not prevent it. Along the way, it will cause collateral damage to all of us.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Emojis are great. They're particularly useful to put in the output of scripts
and get some eye catching output. At least provided they aren't overused, just
like colour.</p>
<pre><code>$ important-command
Lots of output...
‼️  Something went wrong!
Some more output...
</code></pre>
<p>But bigger emojis are better, right?</p>
<p>The VT100, introduced in 1978 has a way to do bigger text. You can even play
with this due to the wonderful <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/machines/dec/vt100/dual/">PCjs VT100
implementation</a>.</p>
<p>The way it works is you use the
<a href="https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECDHL.html">DECDHL</a> (DEC Double-Height Line)
escapes, to change the "style" of the whole line, it then uses a bigger font of
which one line is the top half, the next line is the bottom half. (Based on how
pixelated it is I think the VT100 just scales up the normal font.)</p>
<p>You can see if your own terminal supports this with:</p>
<pre><code>printf '\e#3Hello world 👋\n\e#4Hello world 👋\n'
</code></pre>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/machines/dec/vt100/dual/">PCjs dual VT100s</a> you can
type that manually. Select the top terminal and blindly type [Esc], #, 3, Hello world, Ctrl-M, Ctrl-J, then
[Esc], #, 4 and repeat the rest.</p>
<p>If you did it right in the bottom terminal you'll see:</p>
<p><img src="https://dgl.cx/2025/06/pcjs-decdhl.png" alt="An emulated VT100 displaying text, including a larger 'Hello world'">
</p>
<p>(If you get it wrong you can just use the cursor keys to move around.)</p>
<p>There's evidence a VT100 from 1978 can definitely do this. Can your terminal?</p>
<p>For extra fun when this is implemented correctly, combined with full Unicode
support, you can "slice and dice" emojis, so for example:</p>
<pre><code>printf '\e#3😑\n\e#4😶\n'
</code></pre>
<p>Renders on Apple Terminal and Windows Terminal as:</p>
<p><img src="https://dgl.cx/2025/06/emoji-apple.png" alt="Big emojis in Apple Terminal">
  <img src="https://dgl.cx/2025/06/emoji-windows.png" alt="Big emojis in Windows Terminal">
</p>
<p>This is combining Expressionless Face (U+1F611) and Face Without Mouth
(U+1F636), which results in an emoji that doesn't normally exist.</p>
<p>We can obviously make less compatible combinations of emojis. How about Mars Attacks?</p>
<pre><code>printf '\e#3🧠\n\e#4👽\n'
</code></pre>
<p>Or just further general silliness:</p>
<p><img src="https://dgl.cx/2025/06/emoji-silly.png"></p><p>Not all terminals can do emoji and DECDHL, but it's fun to play with and very
easy to add to scripts. Because it is just two lines repeated it also
relatively nicely downgrades to just repeated text (this has been in the output
of <code>curl -i ip.wtf</code> for a while, a few people have noticed that easter egg).
There's <a href="https://gist.github.com/dgl/cfa357ab9f77818e28465e3c9e2435f3">a gist
here</a> that
attempts to detect if your terminal supports DECDHL by testing for the feature
rather than the terminal itself.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might not want to use literal 1970s technology and be
interested that Kitty recently introduced a <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/blob/master/docs/text-sizing-protocol.rst">more modern
way</a>
to get different sized text in a terminal.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://plus.excalidraw.com/blog"> All posts</a></p><h2>Excalidraw+ is SOC 2 compliant</h2><ul><li>Published <!-- -->June 18, 2025</li><li>by <a href="https://x.com/milosvete">Milos Vetesnik</a></li></ul><div><h2>TL;DR: Our SOC 2 Journey</h2><p>We got tired of endless security questionnaires, so we got SOC 2 certified to make things smoother for everyone.</p><p><strong>The process:</strong></p><ul><li>Used Vanta to connect our services and fix compliance gaps</li><li>Wrote a ton of policies </li><li>Implemented zero-trust production access</li><li>Upgraded our tech stack (Nx, Infisical, monitoring, VPN, etc.)</li><li>Did penetration testing</li><li>Evaluated all vendors</li></ul><p><strong>Result:</strong> Passed SOC 2 Type I 🎉</p><p><strong>In progress: </strong>Type II</p><p><strong>Next:</strong> maybe GDPR, maybe ISO 27001 (depends on demand)</p><p>Most of the security stuff we were already doing, SOC 2 just forced us to write it down officially. </p><h2>Why SOC 2</h2><p>At some point, every company reaches the phase where <em>"we promise we're doing things securely"</em> just doesn't cut it anymore. We were getting tired of filling out endless security questionnaires, the kind of stuff that can easily live in a proper trust center.</p><p>It's one thing to say, <em>"We use MFA, we encrypt stuff, we care about your data,"</em> but it hits different when a third party auditor confirms we're actually doing it by the book.</p><p>And since our team is still fairly small, we figured it was the right time to get our practices locked in early.</p><p>If you're wondering how SOC 2 works or planning to get certified yourself, this post aims to shed some light.</p><h2>What is SOC 2?</h2><p>SOC 2 is a security and compliance framework created by the AICPA. It defines how companies should handle customer data using five criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.</p><p>There are other frameworks, such as ISO 27001, and in the long run, it pays out to get that one too, depending on what your customer base is, but starting with SOC 2 is never a bad idea. It's widely recognized by US companies, less complex than ISO 27001, and builds a solid security foundation to build upon.</p><p>There are two flavors of SOC 2:</p><ul><li> <strong>SOC 2 Type I</strong> checks that your systems and policies exist at a point in time. Basically, whether you have the right setup.</li><li> <strong>SOC 2 Type II</strong> looks at whether those policies work over time. Think of it as, "cool, but do you really follow through?"</li></ul><p>We've completed <strong>SOC 2 Type I</strong> (🎉) and we're already working on Type II.</p><h2>The Journey</h2><figure><p><img src="https://excalidraw.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lp-cms/media/SOC2%20journey%20timeline%20(1).png" alt="Excalidraw+ SOC 2 journey" width="1968" height="455"></p></figure><p>Before you start the certification audit itself, you need to make sure you're in compliance to begin with. If you're young and brave, you can read up on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/2017-trust-services-criteria-with-revised-points-of-focus-2022">criteria requirements</a> directly from AICPA without using any third-party services to help get going, but such a document doesn't hold your hand or tell you what you need to do. We do not recommend it. </p><p>Instead, we looked for services that can get you set up and going easily (well, easier). They help you centralize compliance docs, security workflows, audits, risk monitoring, and all the other things you definitely don't want to be keeping up to date with instead of shipping your product. We narrowed the list down to Drata and Vanta, and in the end, went with Vanta as most of the services and providers we use already had an integration there.</p><p>Once you plug all your services in (for us, this meant Vercel, GCP, DigitalOcean, GitHub, among others), Vanta runs a check to see what needs fixing. </p><p>Anything without an existing integration, you need to track manually. Sometimes you need to supply evidence in the form of screenshots, so keep your "receipts" at hand! You can do this in Google Drive or elsewhere, but we built this stuff into our internal admin dashboard. It takes a little bit of work upfront, but it pays off long-term and keeps everything nice and organized.</p><p>Vanta also helps you introduce secure workstation policies, such as requiring disk encryption, screen locks, and the use of password managers across your entire team. Not exactly groundbreaking stuff, but useful and necessary, and trying to roll that out on our own would have been a nightmare.</p><p>The upside for us was that we got a bird’s eye view of our team: who has access to what, whether MFA was enabled, and so on.</p><p>Doing all that was a bit overwhelming at first, but once we got the hang of it, it was surprisingly manageable.</p><p>The toughest (or let's say, the most annoying) part by far was the policies. You need a ton of them: "Code of Conduct," "Human Resource Security Policy," "Access Control Policy," "Operational Security Policy," and more. Vanta provided some boilerplate templates to get us started, but we still had to tailor them for our company, especially since we're remote-first. Finding the balance between keeping our startup vibes and introducing more rigid and structured processes was key.</p><p>Actually implementing those policies was easier for us, as we had already been doing most of these things without them being written down, but there were still some processes that needed updating or technical changes that needed implementing. This can be time-consuming, especially when you're also actively developing a product concurrently. The key is to carve out some dedicated time for this, taking on tasks one by one, and aim for a gradual roll-out.</p><p>Even though paperwork isn't exactly our favorite thing, some of it actually made a lot of sense. It forced us to properly write down how we handle incidents like outages and similar, instead of it existing in bits and pieces or locked in the minds of specific team members. And for our customers, it offers a peek into how we operate behind the scenes.</p><p>Since we're a remote team, we implemented a zero-trust production access model with strict role-based controls. Production access is limited to essential personnel (currently the technical co-founders) and operates through our automated deployment pipeline for all routine operations. This approach minimizes the attack surface while ensuring our support team can handle customer requests through our purpose-built internal admin dashboard, which provides controlled access to necessary functions without direct production exposure.</p><p>It also helps us automate SOC 2 tasks like tracking and managing resource access, conducting regular access reviews, and keeping a paper trail for compliance reasons highlighted above. And yes, we log who touches what.</p><p>Of course, no compliance journey would be complete without a few moments that feel like they come straight from a company training video. Well, watching those was quite literally part of it (No, Sheila, passwords go into the password manager, not on your monitor's sticky note), but we now also run regular staff training sessions. Our new member onboarding calls have also become more structured.</p><h2>Technical Work</h2><figure><p><img src="https://excalidraw.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lp-cms/media/soc2-tech-arch-overview%20(1).png" alt="SOC 2 Technical architecture overview" width="1417" height="1376"></p></figure><p>We went a bit crazy here. We started by splitting our monolith into more services and kept adding new apps into our codebase as we grew. To manage it all, we chose <a target="_blank" href="https://nx.dev/">Nx⁠</a> as our build/monorepo framework. Migrating to Nx helps us standardize how our dev team runs development, builds, shipping, and tests within our GitHub CI/CD pipeline. Nx gives us custom executors that we use to handle environment variables, accommodate differences between frameworks like classic SPA and Next.js, and others. The speedup due to caching was a nice bonus (you can do this locally, or in the cloud for added benefits).</p><p>For managing environment keys, we picked <a target="_blank" href="https://infisical.com/">Infisical⁠</a>, which is end-to-end encrypted, self-deployable, and basically ticks all our boxes. This setup lets developers access only development keys and nothing more, same for CI. No more committing environment variables into the codebase or injecting them manually into CI. Try it once, and you'll never want to go back. The secrets management tool also lets us run everything in CI smoothly, such as testing for missing or leaking environment keys. One of the tougher challenges was making CI work smoothly alongside the VPN and firewalls we have in place.</p><p>And our custom firewall and VPN setup finally pushed us to upgrade to GitHub Enterprise to get dedicated IPs for our runners.</p><p>We also set up monitoring for our services and made a public <a target="_blank" href="https://status.excalidraw.com/status">status page⁠</a>. For logging, we use <a target="_blank" href="https://vector.dev/">Vector⁠</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://axiom.co/">Axiom⁠</a>.</p><p>As we wrapped things up, we needed to verify that everything was as secure as we planned. So, we conducted penetration testing across the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw+</a> platform. It found some minor issues, like exposed headers, which we fixed right away. Running penetration tests at least once a year to make sure everything is squared up is a must.</p><h2>Vendors &amp; Risk Management</h2><p>Turns out, your vendors need to have their act together, too. Every service that touches customer data needs to be evaluated and documented.</p><p>The good news? Most of the big players we rely on (Vercel, Google Cloud, GitHub) already have their SOC 2 reports ready to go. </p><p>We use a combination of Vanta (which handles most of the common vendors) and our internal admin dashboard for the ones Vanta doesn't cover, because managing this in spreadsheets gets old fast. For each vendor, we document what data they access, their certifications, key risks, and how we mitigate them.</p><p>Pro tip: Start this early. Some vendors take weeks to respond, and you might need time to find alternatives.</p><h2>Going One Step Further</h2><p>We don't care for tracking our customers, but we do need to know the essentials. How many users do we have, what features are actually used, things like that.</p><p>For Excalidraw, we use a self-hosted version of <a target="_blank" href="https://umami.is/">Umami⁠</a>. For public-facing stuff like our open-source editor and landing pages, we use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a>⁠.</p><p>Both do the job without invading your privacy. So if you're wondering why you don't see a cookie banner (<a target="_blank" href="https://umami.is/docs/faq">Umami⁠ FAQ</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simpleanalytics.com/blog/analytics-without-a-cookie-banner">Simple Analytics⁠</a> ) on our site, that's why.</p><h2>The Audit</h2><p>When it comes to the audit itself, you can either pick from the auditors your provider (e.g., Vanta) works with or find your own. We chose <a target="_blank" href="https://insightassurance.com/">Insight Assurance</a>⁠. What we learned, though, is that we should have contacted them way earlier in the process, as they could have helped us with some of the policies and risk definitions we were overthinking, which would have saved us a lot of time. But hey, lesson learned.</p><p>As for the good ending, we passed SOC 2 Type 1. While Type 2 is next on the list and it's what everyone should aim for, Type 1 is a good stepping stone along the way, as it already demonstrates to your customers you're serious and that you're not running your business from the back of a tool shed.</p><p>If you want to go through the paperwork with a good wine in the evening, you can find it all in our trust center, below.</p><h2>Security page &amp; trust center</h2><ul><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://trust.excalidraw.com/">Trust Center</a>⁠</li><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.excalidraw.com/security-and-compliance">Security and Compliance⁠</a></li></ul><h2>What's Next</h2><figure><p><img src="https://excalidraw.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lp-cms/media/SOC2-blog-roadmap.png" alt="soc2 certification roadmap" width="3860" height="1667"></p></figure><ul><li> SOC 2 Type 2</li><li> GDPR (unless the EU repeals it first)</li><li> ISO 27001 (if enough customers ask)</li></ul></div></section></div>]]></description>

  </div><div><p>The Trump administration has proposed to eliminate the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) by October 2026, citing fiscal responsibility and redundancy with existing regulatory agencies. This proposal, embedded in the proposed fiscal year 2026 budget, has sparked bipartisan opposition in Congress and concern among industry groups.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Background on the CSB</strong></h3><p>Established in 1990 and operational since 1998, the CSB is an independent federal agency tasked with investigating industrial chemical accidents. Headquartered in Washington, DC, the agency's board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. It conducts root cause analyses of chemical incidents at fixed industrial facilities and issues safety recommendations to prevent future occurrences.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the CSB lacks regulatory authority, its findings have influenced policies at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) . The CSB investigative staff includes chemical and mechanical engineers, industrial safety experts, and other specialists with experience in the private and public sectors. Many investigators have years of chemical industry experience.</p><p>The CSB currently operates with just three Senate-confirmed members, down from its full complement of five, yet continues to issue major safety reports — including its latest on three catastrophic events at a Honeywell facility in Louisiana. In the CSB’S 25-year history, the agency has deployed to over 170 chemical incidents and issued more than 1000 recommendations that have led to numerous safety improvements across a wide variety of industries.</p><p>After a CSB team reaches a chemical incident site, investigators begin their work by conducting detailed interviews of witnesses such as plant employees, managers, and neighbors. Chemical samples and equipment obtained from accident sites are sent to independent laboratories for testing. Company safety records, inventories, and operating procedures are examined as investigators seek an understanding of the circumstances of the accident.</p><p>Under its public safety mission, the CSB conducts root cause investigations of chemical accidents at fixed industrial facilities. Root causes are usually deficiencies in safety management systems, but can be any factor that would have prevented the accident if that factor had not occurred. Other accident causes often involve equipment failures, human errors, unforeseen chemical reactions or other hazards. The agency does not issue fines or citations, congress designed the CSB to be non-regulatory and independent of other agencies so that its investigations enhance public safety, the safety of workers and inform industry. &nbsp;</p><p>Both accident investigations and hazard investigations lead to new safety recommendations, which are the Board's principal tool for achieving positive change. Recommendations are issued to government agencies, companies, trade associations, labor unions, and other groups. Implementation of each safety recommendation is tracked and monitored by CSB staff. When recommended actions have been completed satisfactorily, the recommendation may be closed by a Board vote.</p><p>While some recommendations may be adopted immediately, others require extensive effort and advocacy to achieve implementation. Board members and staff work to promote safety actions based on CSB recommendations. In many cases, the lessons from CSB investigations are applicable to many organizations beyond the company investigated. Many CSB recommendations have been implemented in industry, leading to safer plants, workers, and communities.</p><h3><strong>Key Areas of Focus:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Chemical Incident Investigations</strong>: Determining root causes of industrial explosions, toxic releases, and chemical spills.</li>
<li>
<strong>Safety Recommendations</strong>&nbsp;&amp; Policy Development: Providing non-regulatory safety guidance for industry and government.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data Analytics and Digital Modeling</strong>: Using AI and predictive analytics to assess industrial risk factors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Public Outreach and Reporting</strong>: Publishing incident reports, video animations, and safety recommendations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cybersecurity and IT Modernization</strong>: Protecting CSB’s investigative data, reports, and forensic analysis tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Industrial Hazard Prevention</strong>: Identifying systemic safety issues in chemical plants, refineries, and storage facilities.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Details of the Proposed Closure</strong></h3><p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) stated that closing the CSB aligns with efforts to move the nation towards fiscal responsibility and redefine the federal government's role. The budget documents specify that funding for the CSB should be "permanently canceled not later than September 30, 2026."&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the CSB's own budget request for fiscal year 2026 was set at zero dollars, with language suggesting that its functions duplicate those of the EPA and OSHA. However, former OSHA official Jordan Barab described this as "highly unusual," implying that the request may have been imposed by the White House rather than originating from CSB leadership.&nbsp;</p><h3>
<strong>Why it Matters for the Planet:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Shutting down the CSB would weaken federal oversight of chemical safety at a time when industrial accidents pose escalating environmental and public health risks.</p><ul>
<li>CSB investigations not only prevent repeat disasters but also provide vital insights into pollution, workplace safety, and hazardous material management.</li>
<li>Its absence could slow or halt environmental justice progress, particularly in frontline communities located near industrial zones.</li>
<li>Impede collaboration of enhancing vital safety recommendations to close the current gaps between federal and state regulations and local ordinance.</li>
<li>Support chemical industry need to protect workers, public and the environment from harm.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Mistake to Shut Down the CSB</strong></h3><ul><li>
<strong>&nbsp;It Fills a Unique Safety Role</strong>: The CSB investigates industrial chemical accidents—not to assign blame, but to figure out why they happened and how to prevent them. No other federal agency does this kind of root cause analysis focused purely on safety improvement. OSHA and the EPA enforce rules, but they don’t specialize in deep, systems-based investigations like the CSB does.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>It Has a Strong Track Record</strong>: Despite its small size and limited budget, the CSB has produced high-impact reports that have led to real-world safety improvements—such as changes to refinery operations, better emergency response protocols, and industry-wide alerts on chemical handling. Its investigations have prevented repeat disasters.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>Communities and Workers Depend on It</strong>: Many of the facilities CSB investigates are located near low-income or marginalized communities. These people bear the brunt of chemical disasters—explosions, toxic leaks, fires. The CSB gives voice to those most at risk and pushes for safer industry practices that protect lives.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>It’s Cost-Effective</strong>: The CSB operates with a modest annual budget—about $13 million, which is microscopic compared to the cost of even a single industrial explosion. Its work reduces risk and saves far more in avoided injuries, environmental damage, and litigation than it costs to run.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>Eliminating It Increases Risk</strong>: Without the CSB, there would be fewer independent, transparent investigations into chemical accidents. The lessons learned from past disasters would take longer to surface—or never surface at all. That means higher risk for chemical workers, emergency responders, and nearby neighborhoods.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>It Has Bipartisan and Industry Support</strong>: Lawmakers from both parties have defended the CSB, and even chemical industry leaders have acknowledged its value. That kind of consensus is rare—and telling. Killing the CSB would go against expert opinion, common sense, and the public interest.</li></ul><h3><strong>Reactions and Implications</strong></h3><p>The proposal has drawn criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum. Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) warned that eliminating the CSB could lead to more chemical disasters affecting communities near industrial facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Industry groups have also expressed concern. The American Chemistry Council stated that while the proposal is part of the budget process, they value the CSB's work and wish to see it continue. Similarly, the Chlorine Institute emphasized the CSB's vital role in chemical safety and advocated for its full funding or a comparable alternative.&nbsp;</p><p>The CSB's recent investigations underscore its importance. For instance, it released a final report on three serious incidents involving toxic hydrogen fluoride at a Honeywell facility in Geismar, Louisiana, highlighting systemic safety failures.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3><p>While the proposal to eliminate the CSB is part of the administration's budget plan, it requires congressional approval. Given the bipartisan support for the agency, the proposal is expected to face significant resistance in Congress. The CSB’s defunding proposal enters a contested legislative process, with early signals of pushback from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers:</p><ul>
<li>Industry groups, such as the American Chemistry Council and Chlorine Institute, have expressed support for the CSB’s continued operation</li>
<li>Advocacy for stronger chemical safety regulations is expected to intensify in Congress, especially following recent deadly incidents like the hydrogen fluoride leak at a Honeywell plant in Louisiana</li>
<li>The final decision will hinge on Congressional negotiations over the 2026 federal budget</li>
</ul><p>As of now, the CSB continues its operations, with leadership emphasizing the agency's critical role in ensuring chemical safety and protecting communities, workers, and the environment.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><ol>
