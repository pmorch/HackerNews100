Don’t take it from me, take it from </span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick" rel="">Herman Melville</a><span>. But in this case the reality is even more fascinating than the myths.</span></p><p>Capable of diving thousands of feet beneath the waves for over an hour at a time, the sperm whale has perhaps the most exotic diet on the planet. As the biggest toothed predator on earth, it feasts on mysterious bottom-dwelling sharks, skates and, most notably of all, the giant squid - another of the world’s least well-understood animals.</p><p>Superlatives abound. Sperm whales have the biggest heads (in proportion to the rest of their bodies) of any large animal. A typical sperm whale might be one-third head. And while much of what is to be found inside that head is brain (yes, sperm whales are also notable for having the largest brains on earth) even more space is given over to something else: spermaceti.</p><p>Spermaceti is the name given to this very unusual organ as well as the waxy oil it produces. Even today no-one is entirely sure what function the spermaceti serves. One theory says it has something to do with buoyancy, the other that it is for echolocation. What we do know is that it is one of those very unusual things - an organ unique to a single species (well, strictly speaking the three species of sperm whale).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic" width="1280" height="461" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:461,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:77052,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbe5d4f9-b7a2-40cf-a4ad-f991da1dfcdc_1280x461.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Cross section diagrams of a sperm whale’s head, from </span><a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sperm_whale_head_anatomy_(transverse_%2B_sagittal).svg#mw-jump-to-license" rel="">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The upshot is that that enormous head contains within it a vast reservoir - somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 gallons in a male whale - of spermaceti oil.</p><p>Sperm whale oil is a very special oil, comprised of long chained molecules known as fatty esters. These things are quite rare in the wild, to the extent that there are few other naturally-occurring substances which behave quite the way sperm whale oil does.</p><p><span>Humans are ingenious at devising all sorts of random uses for all sorts of random substances (come to think of it, that’s pretty much the subtext of </span><em>Material World</em><span>) and so it was for this oil. Sailors soon realised that it worked brilliantly as a lubricant for their clocks and watches (its viscosity doesn’t change much whatever the temperature - yet another unusual feature of this unusual substance). But eventually an even more popular use-case was discovered: as a fuel for lanterns.</span></p><p>This of course was long before the invention of electricity and most other light sources had severe drawbacks. Tallow and other forms of oil derived from animal fat burnt with a dim, smoky flame. Whale oil, by contrast, provided an excellent light and produced little smoke. While tallow burnt with a foul smell, whale oil produced no unpleasant odours. And so, in the early days of lighting, spermaceti became a sought-after fuel for lanterns.</p><p><span>If you have read much about the history of lighting - or for that matter </span><em>Material World</em><span> - you will know what happened next. Mankind began to hunt and slaughter sperm whales in vast quantities. People panicked that they would soon be extinct. Then, in the middle of the 19th century, humankind worked out how to make kerosene from crude oil, and it rapidly replaced whale oil in lanterns. Since kerosene burnt six times brighter, there was no need any longer to kill whales for lighting.</span></p><p><span>As William Nordhaus, the Nobel prize-winning economist, put it in his </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c6064/c6064.pdf" rel="">seminal paper</a><span> on lighting, as well as </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/05/02/309040279/in-4-000-years-one-thing-hasnt-changed-it-takes-time-to-buy-light" rel="">interviews since</a><span>, kerosene “saved the whales”. It’s a great, counterintuitive story: look! Fossil fuels saved the world (until they threatened it a couple of centuries later)! And so this Nobel prize winning version of history has been </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38650976" rel="">trotted out</a><span> </span><a href="http://www.sjvgeology.org/history/whales.html" rel="">pretty much everywhere</a><span> ever since, including, I should acknowledge, in my own book. It’s become a part of the conventional wisdom.</span></p><p><span>But there’s a problem with the Nordhaus version of events. It is plain </span><strong>wrong</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Crude oil did </span><em>not</em><span> save the whales. While it’s true that whale oil fell out of favour as a fuel for lighting after the discovery of kerosene, the number of whales being killed in the following years didn’t fall to zero. On the contrary, it rose. A lot.

As you see, it’s pretty stark. Far from dropping to zero after the widespread adoption of kerosene, whale oil catches only fell a bit before picking up dramatically in the 20th century. Many multiples more died in the 20th century, long after Nordhaus suggested they had been saved, than in the 19th. Why?</p><p><span>The story features in Jean-Baptiste Fressoz’s brilliant book </span><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/464145/more-and-more-and-more-by-fressoz-jean-baptiste/9781802067309" rel="">More and More and More</a><span>, which I highly recommend as a companion piece to </span><em>Material World</em><span>. As he explains, it turns out lighting oil wasn’t the only use we found for spermaceti.</span></p><p>As I mentioned earlier, right from the start whale oil had other uses, beyond lighting. It was used to grease naval clocks, as well as being deployed in pharmaceuticals, paints and explosives. And when added to conventional petroleum oil, spermaceti transformed a good engine lubricant into the world’s finest engine lubricant. Thanks to those esters, whale oil-infused lubricants were incredibly good at reducing friction. And so while whales were no longer hunted for lighting fuel, they became even more prized in the 20th century for a somewhat more obscure use no-one spent much time thinking about.</p><p>And since whaling technology had come along so much since the 19th century - with powerful diesel engined vessels equipped with ever more lethal harpoons and even onboard processing plants, allowing sailors to drain the spermaceti out of their catches at sea rather than having to bring them back to land - sperm whale populations were ravaged long, long after the discovery of kerosene.</p><p><span>Indeed, that chart above slightly understates the full scale of the onslaught in the 20th century, because quite a lot of the whaling fleets from Japan and the Soviet Union weren’t declaring all their catches to the International Whaling Commission. </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276844456_Emptying_the_Oceans_A_Summary_of_Industrial_Whaling_Catches_in_the_20th_Century" rel="">Adjusted estimates</a><span> are somewhat higher.</span></p><p>Fressoz’s point is that far from saving the whales…</p><blockquote><p>Actually, petroleum increased the demand for whale oil: top-of-the-range lubricants for gearboxes and machine tools used to contain between 5 and 20 per cent whale oil. Until the mid-1970s, aircraft turbojet engines were lubricated at least in part with whale oil.</p></blockquote><p><span>But this story ends somewhat happily, because that chart really does show a dramatic fall to close to zero in recent decades. So what </span><em>really</em><span> saved the whales? Well, the answer is first, the whaling bans which, across most of the world, made it illegal to hunt these whales (a few countries refused to sign up, but catches have nonetheless dropped dramatically in recent years). And, in the face of this enforced shortage of whale oil, lubricant manufacturers and other users of whale oil had to try to find a satisfactory substitute.</span></p><p><span>Lo and behold, in the 1970s there was a sharp rise in research and development spending on esters. Chemists worked out how to create synthetic alternatives. Eventually, however, it was the natural world that provided the best substitute: the </span><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-jojoba-desert-shrub-help-save-endangered-whales" rel="">oil from the jojoba tree</a><span>, which has most of the same properties as whale oil. All of a sudden, an obscure plant, never much cultivated, helped fill the gap left by spermaceti.</span></p><p>So in one respect, Nordhaus was right: technology did eventually save the whales. But a) it happened more than a century later than he suggested, by which point whale stocks were much lower than in the 1860s, b) the technology in question wasn’t derived from crude oil and c) it was only developed in response to a government-enforced ban on whale hunting.</p><p>These might seem like minute distinctions, but they all matter, and perhaps it’s worth reflecting on this in the 2020s. After all, here we are at another inflection point, with a lively debate between those who believe technology, left more or less to its own devices, will deliver the solutions to climate change and those who believe nothing will happen without government intervention.</p><p>For a long time that Nordhaus-fuelled conventional wisdom, that kerosene saved the whales, left one with the impression that technology alone could save the day. But now ponder the corrected story of the whales and you’re left with, well, if not the opposite impression, then a considerably more nuanced conclusion. And I’ve been taught another lesson: always fact check Nobel laureates!</p><p><span>Anyway, </span><a href="https://edconway.substack.com/p/hang-on-are-there-any-lost-minerals" rel="">as promised</a><span>, this was the first of a series of posts about “forgotten materials” - substances we convinced ourselves we had stopped exploiting even as we were mining massive amounts of them. There’s quite a few other interesting examples to come in the weeks ahead.</span></p><p><span>UPDATE 31 Dec: A couple of readers have pointed me towards </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023117739217" rel="">this absolutely excellent paper</a><span> on precisely this topic from Richard York a few years ago.

<p>"The findings are a stark reminder that even the wealthiest Americans are not shielded from the systemic issues in the US contributing to lower life expectancy, such as economic inequality or risk factors like stress, diet or environmental hazards," lead study author Irene Papanicolas, a professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown, said in a news release.</p>
<p>The study looked at health and wealth data of more than 73,000 adults across the US and Europe who were 50 to 85 years old in 2010. There were more than 19,000 from the US, nearly 27,000 from Northern and Western Europe, nearly 19,000 from Eastern Europe, and nearly 9,000 from Southern Europe. For each region, participants were divided into wealth quartiles, with the first being the poorest and the fourth being the richest. The researchers then followed participants until 2022, tracking deaths.</p>
<p>The US had the largest gap in survival between the poorest and wealthiest quartiles compared to European countries. America's poorest quartile also had the lowest survival rate of all groups, including the poorest quartiles in all three European regions.</p>
<p>While less access to health care and weaker social structures can explain the gap between the wealthy and poor in the US, it doesn't explain the differences between the wealthy in the US and the wealthy in Europe, the researchers note. There may be other systemic factors at play that make Americans uniquely short-lived, such as diet, environment, behaviors, and cultural and social differences.</p>
<p>"If we want to improve health in the US, we need to better understand the underlying factors that contribute to these differences—particularly amongst similar socioeconomic groups—and why they translate to different health outcomes across nations," Papanicolas said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Britain is a rich country with the world’s 6th largest economy and the highest tax income for decades, which raises a simple question - why do we seem so broke? Tom Calver, Data Editor at The Times, </span><a href="https://x.com/TomHCalver/status/1903752785012682961" rel="">tackled the question last week</a><span>. The big picture is pretty simple: we have a huge debt burden sucking over £100bn out of the budget every year (more than the entire education budget and nearly double the defence budget); and that would be okay-ish if the economy were growing, but it’s not. </span></p><p>That creates what Calver calls, in the kind of obscure jargon popular among data nerds, “a uniquely shit set of circumstances for the government.” It also raises the next question: why aren’t we growing? The answer broadly comes down to two things.</p><p><span>First, we have the lowest rate of investment (public and private) in the G7, with some trailing off since Brexit.  There are many compelling examples of this, but a fun one was presented in </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/roadscholar.bsky.social/post/3lkxbjp2u7k2p" rel="">a thread by Michael Dnes</a><span> this week: it turns out that over two thirds of the growth in Britain’s motorway network since 2012 has come not from actually building new roads, but because the Ordnance Survey are more accurate at measuring them.  </span></p><p><span>Second, the public sector is getting less and less value for money. In statistical terms, “</span><a href="https://x.com/TomHCalver/status/1903752785012682961" rel="">productivity is about 9 per cent lower than it was in 2019</a><span>,” but we can see that viscerally in e.g. the state of the NHS, a near-£200bn black hole into which tens of billions of additional spending has been poured with </span><a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/there-really-nhs-productivity-crisis" rel="">sluggish improvement to show for it</a><span>. I’m in favour of increased defence spending, but even I have to admit that procurement right now is a disaster, and that without serious reform the extra cash could be spaffed up the wall on things like the </span><a href="https://james1940.substack.com/p/getting-ready-for-war?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">helicopter debacle recounted by James Holland</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The purchasing of new helicopters two-and-a-half years ago, for example, was halted at the last moment because the MOD suddenly decided some competition was needed. It wasn’t. Two – foreign - firms who subsequently tendered for the contract then pulled out at the last minute, wasting valuable time, money and effort, and presumably had entered the bid in the first place only to undermine that of the original British firm. The RAF still doesn’t have any of these new helicopters. </p></blockquote><p><span>What the government gets for the money it spends has been in decline for some time, and is often shockingly poor compared to other nations. HS2 is an </span><a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/britains-infrastructure-is-too-expensive" rel="">order of magnitude more expensive</a><span> than high speed rail projects run by comparable European powers. The new nuclear power station at Hinckley Point C is coming in at </span><a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/visiting-the-worlds-most-expensive" rel="">four times the cost of comparable projects elsewhere</a><span>. These two projects </span><em>alone</em><span> represent an overspend of perhaps £60-70bn versus our competitors, which is the equivalent of cutting a penny from the base rate of income tax… for over a </span><em>decade</em><span>. Obviously that’s a gross simplification - Hinckley Point C is in part privately financed - but it gives you some idea of the sheer </span><em>scale</em><span> of waste.</span></p><p>One reason for this is that parts of the British state are fundamentally misaligned with goals like ‘improving living standards’ or ‘increasing wealth’, whether that’s through hand-wringingly incompetent procurement processes, long-term failure to invest in the infrastructure and management required to support ‘moar frontline staff!!’, acute treasury brain, or endless cohorts of committees and quangos. </p><p><span>Speaking at a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/07/cost-of-shed-to-protect-bat-colony-near-hs2-has-topped-100m-chair-says" rel="">rail conference last year</a><span>, HS2 Chair Sir Jon Thompson said: “To build a railway between Euston and Curzon Street in Birmingham, I need 8,276 consents from other public bodies, planning, transport, the Environment Agency or Natural England. They don’t care whether parliament did or didn’t approve building a railway.”</span></p><p>Imagine for a moment the sheer human effort, the cost, the entire lives consumed by the gigantic national project of ticking each of those 8,276 checkboxes. It is absolutely correct that we have additional checks and balances, but this is an organically-grown system operating with no overall oversight or coherent strategy, spawning busy-work for thousands of people, much of it duplicated, unnecessary or redundant, much of it - like the infamous bat tunnel - having little provable benefit for things like environmental protection in the first place. </p><p><span>Indeed, improving things like the environment </span><em>is not the de facto goal of this system</em><span>, it is not what it was ‘designed’ or incentivised to accomplish. If it were, much of the money would be far better spent. I cannot stress this enough: this is not a battle between, say, infrastructure and the environment. It’s a battle between people who think we can do both, better; and people who seriously believe that a bat tunnel is the best way to spend £120m to support wildlife, a proposition for which no compelling evidence has ever been provided. </span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, local government </span><a href="https://martinrobbins.substack.com/p/the-death-of-a-playground" rel="">veers towards bankruptcy,</a><span> in large part because they’re mandated to write blank cheques for social care with no support or strategy from central government. Individual cases in Central Bedfordshire are now costing up to £750,000 per year, a quarter of the entire libraries and leisure budget and an amount that is rising rapidly with no apparent ceiling. As I wrote previously, “In a single year, residential care costs for children have increased by £2,000 per child… per </span><em>week</em><span>,” taking the </span><em>average</em><span> cost for a single case from ~£200,000 to ~£300,000 per child per year, again with little explanation as to where the money is going or how this is even possible. </span></p><p><span>Similarly, “school transport costs have increased by over 100% - from £9m to £20m - in just 4 years” - that’s driven by an unexplained rise in the number of SEND pupils eligible for support and it amounts to roughly the same as - deep breath - the transport, roads, parking, libraries, leisure, housing benefit, public protection and safety budgets </span><em>combined</em><span>. Central Bedfordshire Council is not an outlier here - collectively, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/30/english-councils-send-debt-analysis" rel="">council overspends on SEND services are set to hit £2bn in the next year, risking further bankruptcies</a><span>. Again this is not about pitting children against libraries, but asking if we seriously believe we’re addressing either of these things well? </span></p><p>There’s a growing tendency for political commentators to talk about the need to raise taxes this year to fix failing public services, and I get it, I really do. Many of these entrenched problems require up-front capital investment to fix or reform broken systems. But they’re overlooking a major issue: to many voters this will sound bonkers given the endemic problems above; and no amount of ‘but actually other countries have a higher tax burden’ or ‘taxes are still lower than they were in the 70s’ is going to persuade them otherwise. </p><p><span>That’s before we consider an inconvenient truth about those nations with higher tax burdens - they fall more heavily on middle earners, because (‘eat the rich’ fantasies aside) you simply can’t get that much money without a broad base of people and businesses to provide it. </span><a href="https://ifs.org.uk/taxlab/taxlab-key-questions/how-do-uk-tax-revenues-compare-internationally" rel="">Per the Institute for Fiscal Studies</a><span> (my italics):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>If the UK were to adopt the income tax and [national insurance] rates of one of its higher-tax European neighbours, it would, in most cases and unsurprisingly, have higher tax rates and raise more revenue from both middle and high earners. </span><em>But the difference in the tax levied would be larger for the median worker than for one near the top of the distribution</em><span>. This is because </span><strong>average tax rates</strong><span> rise more quickly with income in the UK, and are already higher at the top relative to the median, than in most of the European countries that raise more revenue overall.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Advocates of tax rises point out that actually, middle income families face lower taxes than in many other developed nations, and that’s absolute true, but it overlooks a glaring problem: housing costs. Britain’s houses are </span><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/uk-spends-more-on-housing-than-almost-any-other-developed-country-and-gets-the-least-value-from-it-too-13099925" rel="">cramped, ancient and in the wrong places</a><span> leaving workers with longer, more expensive commutes. And we get to pay more for the privilege, almost single-handedly reversing the relative wealth of </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/13/uk-low-middle-income-families-poorer-oecd-counterparts-study-western-europe" rel="">many British families</a><span> versus their European counterparts. It’s a cliché that every other policy problem in Britain resolves to a housing problem, but in this case punishing rents and mortgage payments are consuming a large percentage of the income that other countries would tax. </span></p><p><span>Asking this of middle income voters at a time when trust in </span><em>all</em><span> political parties is at historic lows and standards of living are being eroded is a recipe for outright militancy. </span></p><p><span>If anything is done on taxes, it </span><em>has</em><span> to be coupled with serious, once-in-a-generation reforms that stop the state from simply bleeding out the extra cash, and visibly improve the fabric of people’s lives. That means things like a total rethink of local government funding, a massive expansion of house building, ripping up procurement processes, far more radical reforms of planning, and an integrated strategy for social care. </span></p><p><span>Labour need to put forward an epoch-defining deal for the public to sign up to, not just incremental tweaks and budgetary fixes in response to whatever the OBR says this week. The current level of ambition, of </span><em>vision</em><span>, just doesn’t match up to the situation we’re in. </span></p><p>In short, it’s time for Starmer and Reeves to go big or go home. If they don’t they lose anyway, so go out in style. To quote Jack London: “I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.”</p><p><span>Another plug for my new podcast with </span></p><p><span>. This week: the Lower Thames Crossing, affordable housing, and an interview with Joe Hill, policy director at the Reform think-tank, on “Everythingism”. Also I go on an unsolicited rant about Maidenhead NIMBYs. </span></p><p>Ben Ansell has a fascinating essay on what he calls ‘chaos chasers’. In a nutshell, “people whose lives are easy and vote for disruptive populism on the assumption it won’t change anything about their lives. These people believe in FADFO - Fuck Around, Don’t Find Out.”</p><p>Ben’s post largely looked at voters in the context of populism, but I think this applies neatly to other areas so I left a comment, which I’ve reproduced (lightly edited) below: </p><blockquote><p>This is fascinating and I think it applies strongly in the activist space as well. The term I've always used for it is 'escalators' - people or organisations who, given a crisis, will always try to increase the complexity or drama involved instead of breaking it down and working towards a solution. So with e.g. climate activism, you can see this in protest groups who wrap the whole thing up with ending capitalism, solving Gaza, minority rights and god knows what else, until there's a massive intractable knot of stuff that precludes any notion of actually fixing it.</p><p>It's almost like they *want* a gigantic omnicrisis because that's more exciting than just boring old climate change. So they go and scream at people on the M25 and it feels like that's... sort of the point, to go out and do chaotic, shouty, cathartic stuff without any risk that you might have to actually take responsibility for a real problem or fix it.</p><p>And inevitably the kinds of activists doing this are often time-rich, privileged types who are relatively insulated from the consequences, which is why I think the Just Stop Oil jail sentences were quite triggering for some of these groups - they were shocked that doing something illegal and disruptive might actually result in serious consequences. There's a sense of "yes but surely prison isn't for real people like me?"</p></blockquote><p>Not all activists, obviously, but a certain percentage do just seem to want the world to burn, and in my experience it’s usually the ones who are most comfortable in it.</p><p>Chris Spargo relaunched his YouTube channel this year with an epic series of videos on… I guess the best description I can come up with is ‘the fabric of British society’. He combines the production values of early Tom Scott (which is a complement, it’s still very personal and not overproduced) with a curiosity about the sorts of topics that quietly permeate our environment but rarely get discussed. </p><p>Why do so many supermarkets have clock towers? Why do we think cheese &amp; onion crisp packets should be green? And in the latest video, why is a mysterious symbol carved into thousands of walls and buildings across the UK? It’s addictive stuff. </p><div id="youtube2-sWxXyR4ifbk" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;sWxXyR4ifbk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sWxXyR4ifbk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Behind the Bastards has been one of my favourite podcasts for several years, and they have an absolute banger of a 4-part series on the Zizians, a cult-like offshoot of the Rationalist movement linked to a string of deaths in the United States. What makes the series particularly good is that it properly identifies the Rationalist traits that made it such a fertile breeding ground for this kind of group in the first place. </p><p>A few points stuck out to me. One is how so much of the discussion around AI and the singularity was monopolised by fringe characters with little experience of developing the technology or using it in real, practical environments, distorting public perceptions of the field. </p><p>Another is on the dangers of overthinking. A major problem smart people seem to have, which you see a lot in e.g. conspiracy theorists - is an inability to turn their brains off after a certain point. The real world is messy, and behind any truth you’ll find a web of open questions and contradictions. Think too hard, or too obsessively, and you’ll wind up on a doomed attempt to resolve all of them, plummeting down the rabbit hole until you land in a parody of thought. </p><p>The consequences can be highly disturbing, as Robert explores. It’s well worth a listen on whatever Podcast app you use, or on YouTube below. </p><div id="youtube2-9mJAerUL-7w" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;9mJAerUL-7w&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9mJAerUL-7w?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>That’s all for this week, another essay coming Tuesday week (I’m on holiday next week). Until then, please don’t join any cults (except for our </span><a href="https://www.abundancepod.com/p/the-lower-thames-crossing-boomers-everythingism" rel="">podcast</a><span> obviously).</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>A SpaceX and X engineer, Christopher Stanley—currently serving as a senior advisor in the Deputy Attorney General's office at the Department of Justice (DOJ)—was reportedly caught bragging about hacking and distributing pirated e-books, bootleg software, and game cheats.</p>
<p>The boasts appeared on archived versions of websites, of which several, once flagged, were quickly deleted, Reuters <a href="ttps://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/doge-official-doj-bragged-about-hacking-distributing-pirated-software-2025-04-02/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Stanley was assigned to the DOJ by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While Musk claims that DOGE operates transparently, not much is known about who the staffers are or what their government roles entail. It remains unclear what Stanley does at DOJ, but Reuters noted that the Deputy Attorney General’s office is in charge of investigations into various crimes, "including hacking and other malicious cyber activity." Declining to comment further, the DOJ did confirm that as a "special government employee," like Musk, Stanley does not draw a government salary.</p>
<p>The engineer's questionable past seemingly dates back to 2006, Reuters reported, when Stanley was still in high school. The news site connected Stanley to various sites and forums by tracing various pseudonyms he still uses, including Reneg4d3, a nickname he still uses on YouTube. The outlet then further verified the connection "by cross-referencing the sites’ registration data against his old email address and by matching Reneg4d3’s biographical data to Stanley’s."</p>
<p>Among his earliest sites was one featuring a "crude sketch of a penis" called fkn-pwnd.com, where Stanley, at 15, bragged about "fucking up servers," a now-deleted Internet Archive screenshot reportedly showed. Another, reneg4d3.com, was launched when he was 16. There, Stanley branded a competing messaging board "stupid noobs" after supposedly gaining admin access through an "easy exploit," Reuters reported. On Bluesky, an account called "doge whisperer" <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dogginglover.bsky.social/post/3lid446df4224">alleges</a> even more hacking activity, some of which appears to be corroborated by an IA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101207060144/http://www.electonic.net/forums/">screenshot</a> of another site Stanley created, electonic.net (sic), which as of this writing can still be accessed.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is limited to clearance-eligible individuals, which is broader than US citizens (many classes of non-citizen US persons are eligible). There’s extensive legalese at the bottom of the page to this effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>How’s the non-compete/IP stuff over there?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s bog standard Silicon Valley startup style language (to which the typical California enforceability caveats apply).</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Anything interesting about the way y’all use Nix/NixOS? Flakes or not flakes, that sort of thing?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure if any of these count as interesting, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a large Nixpkgs overlay that adds all of Anduril’s non-opsec-restricted internal packages, followed by additional overlays for compartments.</li>
<li>All Anduril services are configured with NixOS modules.</li>
<li>My team in particular is heavily invested in cross compilation infrastructure (although frankly, Apple Silicon is making it less and less relevant all the time. I find this unfortunate from a packaging system architecture perspective, but it’s practically convenient to have such fast native builds on my local machine).</li>
<li>The trickiest stuff we do is FPGA builds in Nix, and we’re always looking for new ways to improve how this works (along with way to increase the reproducibility of these sorts of builds, which tend to involve stochastic optimization).</li>
<li>We use flakes but in a (IMO) somewhat anemic way. They’re only used to pass overlays around and control pins. <a href="https://github.com/issues/created?issue=NixOS%7Cnix%7C5570">This issue</a> keeps me from using flakes the way I want.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Open-source opportunities? Moonlighting?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We are slowly getting better about open sourcing stuff. On my team the limiting factor is having the time to do maintenance activities, not any sort of legal/IP barrier to releasing stuff, which Anduril is (perhaps surprisingly) pretty lenient about. I know people who do moonlighting/consulting as well, totally fine as long as your customers aren’t our competitors and you’re upfront with the company about it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the questions and for making a constructive post.</p>

              <p>The moderation team brought this thread to our attention as the latest example in an ongoing controversy in the community and they escalated the decision to us so that we can provide them clearer guidance for how to proceed going forward. Our moderation team has done an admirable job, but this controversy has escalated beyond the point where moderation actions alone can resolve this.</p>
<p>To that end, the Steering Committee is banning Anduril from recruiting on Discourse. We will leave this specific thread up and locked (to record this decision), but the moderation team has been instructed to remove future Anduril job posts on Discourse.</p>
<p>We are still working on crafting a more general policy with clear rules that don’t single out any one company. Nonetheless, we make this decision today as we work to establish more permanent guidelines.</p>
<p>We still believe that moderation is essential to keeping these discussions productive. Even though Anduril has been a staple of many recent controversies, so have many community members who have repeatedly posted inflammatory comments. We have advised the Moderation Team to more proactively moderate such behavior.</p>
<p>We are grateful to those who reached out to us in addition to the moderation team. As always, if you have any concerns, you can contact us via:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://alexop.dev/posts/what-is-local-first-web-development/">https://alexop.dev/posts/what-is-local-first-web-development/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577285">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article"> <p>Imagine having complete control over your data in every web app, from social media platforms to productivity tools. Picture using these apps offline with automatic synchronization when you’re back online. This is the essence of local-first web development – a revolutionary approach that puts users in control of their digital experience.</p>
<p>As browsers and devices become more powerful, we can now create web applications that minimize backend dependencies, eliminate loading delays, and overcome network errors. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll dive into the fundamentals of local-first web development and explore its numerous benefits for users and developers alike.</p>
<h2 id="the-limitations-of-traditional-web-applications">The Limitations of Traditional Web Applications</h2>
<p><img src="https://alexop.dev/_astro/tradidonal-web-app.5OCyIzzc_Z13Xuqg.webp" alt="Traditional Web Application" width="1374" height="466" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Traditional web applications rely heavily on backend servers for most operations. This dependency often results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent loading spinners during data saves</li>
<li>Potential errors when the backend is unavailable</li>
<li>Limited or no functionality when offline</li>
<li>Data storage primarily in the cloud, reducing user ownership</li>
</ul>
<p>While modern frameworks like Nuxt have improved initial load times through server-side rendering, many apps still suffer from performance issues post-load. Moreover, users often face challenges in accessing or exporting their data if an app shuts down.</p>
<h2 id="core-principles-of-local-first-development">Core Principles of Local-First Development</h2>
<p>Local-first development shares similarities with offline-first approaches but goes further in prioritizing user control and data ownership. Here are the key principles that define a true local-first web application:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Instant Access:</strong> Users can immediately access their work without waiting for data to load or sync.</li>
<li><strong>Device Independence:</strong> Data is accessible across multiple devices seamlessly.</li>
<li><strong>Network Independence:</strong> Basic tasks function without an internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Effortless Collaboration:</strong> The app supports easy collaboration, even in offline scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proof Data:</strong> User data remains accessible and usable over time, regardless of software changes.</li>
<li><strong>Built-In Security:</strong> Security and privacy are fundamental design considerations.</li>
<li><strong>User Control:</strong> Users have full ownership and control over their data.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to note that some features, such as account deletion, may still require real-time backend communication to maintain data integrity.</p>

<h2 id="local-first-software-fit-guide">Local-First Software Fit Guide</h2>
<h3 id="-good-fit">✅ Good Fit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Editing</strong> 📝 - text editors, word processors, spreadsheets, slides, graphics, video, music, CAD, Jupyter notebooks</li>
<li><strong>Productivity</strong> 📋 - notes, tasks, issues, calendar, time tracking, messaging, bookkeeping</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: Ideal for apps where users freely manipulate their data</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-bad-fit">❌ Bad Fit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money</strong> 💰 - banking, payments, ad tracking</li>
<li><strong>Physical Resources</strong> 📦 - e-commerce, inventory</li>
<li><strong>Vehicles</strong> 🚗 - car sharing, freight, logistics</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: Better with centralized cloud/server model for real-world resource management</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-local-first-applications">Types of Local-First Applications</h2>
<p>Local-first applications can be categorized into two main types:</p>
<h3 id="1-local-only-applications">1. Local-Only Applications</h3>
<p><img src="https://alexop.dev/_astro/local-only.Cp1-EnZ-_EX1Az.webp" alt="Local-Only Applications" width="1374" height="592" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>While often mistakenly categorized as local-first, these are actually offline-first applications. They store data exclusively on the user’s device without cloud synchronization, and data transfer between devices requires manual export and import processes. This approach, while simpler to implement, doesn’t fulfill the core local-first principles of device independence and effortless collaboration. It’s more accurately described as an offline-first architecture.</p>
<h3 id="2-sync-enabled-applications">2. Sync-Enabled Applications</h3>
<p><img src="https://alexop.dev/_astro/sync-enabled-applications.x4TUTTH1_Z1mismy.webp" alt="Sync-Enabled Applications" width="1374" height="592" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>These applications automatically synchronize user data with a cloud database, enhancing the user experience but introducing additional complexity for developers.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-in-implementing-sync-enabled-local-first-apps">Challenges in Implementing Sync-Enabled Local-First Apps</h2>
<p>Developing sync-enabled local-first applications presents unique challenges, particularly in managing data conflicts. For example, in a collaborative note-taking app, offline edits by multiple users can lead to merge conflicts upon synchronization. Resolving these conflicts requires specialized algorithms and data structures, which we’ll explore in future posts in this series.</p>
<p>Even for single-user applications, synchronizing local data with cloud storage demands careful consideration and additional logic.</p>
<h2 id="building-local-first-web-apps-a-step-by-step-approach">Building Local-First Web Apps: A Step-by-Step Approach</h2>
