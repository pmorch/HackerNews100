				<p><span>I</span><span>n 1934, David Hilbert</span>, by then a grand old man of German mathematics, was dining with Bernhard Rust, the Nazi minister of education. Rust asked, “How is mathematics at Göttingen, now that it is free from the Jewish influence?” Hilbert replied, “There is no mathematics in Göttingen anymore.”</p>

			</div>
		
<p>Or so the story goes. It is folklore at this point, a story mathematicians tell one another over coffee while exchanging knowing looks. The details vary in different retellings, but every version has Hilbert speaking this truth to power: Nazis destroyed mathematics at the University of Göttingen. “It’s one of the most well-known stories in the history of science,” says Reinhard Siegmund-Schultze, a math historian at the University of Agder in Norway. “Göttingen was so dominant in mathematics internationally.”</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/199510/maclane.pdf">In 1933, that dominance came crashing down</a>. On April 7, two months after Hitler became chancellor, Germany <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1933-1938/law-for-the-restoration-of-the-professional-civil-service">passed a law</a> making it illegal for Jews — or rather those considered Jewish by the Nazis — and Communists to hold civil service jobs, with a few exceptions including for people who had served Germany in World War I. That immediately forced several Göttingen mathematicians from their jobs. The crisis snowballed, and over the course of the year, a total of 18 left or were driven out.</p>
<p>By the time of Hilbert’s legendary dinner with Rust, Germany had lost its status as the world’s foremost country for mathematical research. America took its place — and today, though globalization has spread the wealth, the U.S. has retained its eminence. From <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bochner.html">Princeton</a> and <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Bers.html">Columbia</a> to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Tarski.html">Berkeley</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Szego.html">Stanford</a>, it’s hard to find a great math department in the United States that was not <a href="http://www.ams.org/samplings/math-history/hmath1-bers16.pdf">shaped in part by European mathematicians</a> who came to or stayed in the U.S. because of the Nazis.</p>
<p>As a new administration with a pronounced anti-science bent takes power in the United States, some scholars are recalling what happened at Göttingen as a cautionary tale. Donald Trump is not Hitler, of course, and “history doesn’t repeat,” as Siegmund-Schultze puts it. Still, he quickly adds, “One also knows from pain that mankind doesn’t really learn from history. Otherwise we wouldn’t do all the same foolish things all the time.”</p>
<p>American democracy is far stronger and longer-lived than was Germany’s between the wars. But we should take the similarities seriously. “I think what you see in both cases is this disaffection of the lower middle class,” says Julia Ault, an expert on German history at the University of Utah. “Part of their status rests on being better than someone else.” Lower-middle-class Germans in 1930 might have felt a loss of status if they perceived Jews to be advancing more quickly than they were. Ault sees a parallel to what some white people in rural America feel: They perceive immigrants as coming in and rising more quickly than they are.</p>
<p>Rather than a drastic Nazi-style crackdown on free speech, what is alarming many scholars today is the idea of a <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2016">post-truth world</a>, in which <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/wh-spokesman-gave-alternative-facts-inauguration-crowd-n710466">evidence doesn’t matter</a> if a story reinforces your beliefs.</p>
<p>“In some sense every scholar is at risk,” says Robbert Dijkgraaf, the current director of the Institute for Advanced Study, which attracted many of the scientists and mathematicians who fled Göttingen and other German universities in the 1930s. “It’s not so much that people are persecuted because of their beliefs, but there is a certain trend where careful reasoning, the search for truth, all the delicacies of having a balanced point of view, acting on facts, being honest about what you do and don’t know, your uncertainty, all these values we have in science and scholarship are at risk.”</p>
<p>The dismissal of experts and the appeals to populism are dangerous, says Ault. “It’s going to be hugely devastating to the EPA, to climate science.” Trump, who <a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/1/18/14313126/trump-pruitt-climate-hoax-lukewarmism">has called climate change a Chinese hoax</a>, has asked for the names of scientists who study global warming. His transition team <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/14/trump-transition-says-request-for-names-of-climate-scientists-was-not-authorized/?utm_term=.73b3c602f5b6">backpedaled on the request</a>, but it was <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/13/505440178/department-of-energy-defies-trump-wont-name-climate-change-workers">unsettling for employees</a> of the Department of Energy. More recently, it was reported that his administration <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/01/24/trump-bans-epa-employees-from-updating-public-via-press-social-media/Anr90pkwhavC2kzK8pwsyK/story.html">issued</a> a temporary ban on external communication from the EPA and blocked the agency from awarding new grants or contracts. “It’s going to take most of our lifetimes to redo what’s going to get undone in the next four years,” Ault says. And for that reason, the political cataclysm that upended the mathematical world in the 1930s is no mere historical curiosity.</p>

<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, helped establish Göttingen’s prominence in the early to mid-19th century. The tradition was continued by a legion of people whose names are sprinkled throughout calculus and physics textbooks today: Riemann, Dirichlet, Schwarz, Klein, Minkowski, Landau, Noether, and Hilbert, who had to a large extent set the mathematical research agenda of the 20th century with his <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/">1900 list of 23 unsolved problems</a> he thought mathematicians should devote themselves to in the new century. Richard Courant, who was part of the 1933 flood of mathematicians leaving Göttingen and for whom a <a href="http://cims.nyu.edu/about/history.html">New York University institute of mathematical sciences is now named</a>, helped secure funding from the Rockefeller Foundation for a new building to house the mathematics institute at Göttingen. It opened in 1929, and for the next few years, mathematics in Göttingen continued to thrive.</p>
<p>Providentially, the institution that would in many ways take Göttingen’s place — as a home not just for world-class mathematicians but for German Jewish ones — was being born at just that moment, in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Institute for Advanced Study, known to mathematicians and scientists simply as “the institute,” <a href="https://www.ias.edu/about/mission-history">was founded in 1930</a> by the Bamberger family, who had sold their department store to Macy’s shortly before the stock market crash in 1929 and had thus managed to prosper through the Great Depression. At the time, many American <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in">institutions of higher education were anti-Semitic</a>, and the Bambergers’ initial vision was to create a medical school that did not discriminate against Jews. Instead, Abraham Flexner, who had studied and written about medical and higher education, convinced them that an institute dedicated to basic research in mathematics and science was more important. He ended up joining them as a founder.</p>
<p>The institute opened in 1933 and was housed in Princeton University’s Fine Hall, home of its mathematics department, until the institute’s own facilities opened in 1939. (This has led to decades of <a href="https://www.ias.edu/about/faqs">confusion</a> about the institute’s relationship with Princeton. They are in the same town, but they have no formal affiliation.) The timing could not have been better for the German Jews whose jobs at home had been abolished. Flexner and the trustees decided, with the help of the Rockefeller Foundation, to create positions for exiled researchers at the institute.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an easy sell. American anti-Semitism was not the only issue; unemployment was high, and <a href="http://www.ams.org/samplings/math-history/hmath1-reingold13.pdf">some believed that</a> “every foreign scholar imported means an American out of a job,” as the MIT mathematics professor Norbert Wiener described it. He feared that “any appointment for more than a year would cause a feeling of resentment that would wreck our hopes of doing anything whatsoever.” Dijkgraaf, the IAS’s current director, says the institute had to walk a fine line. “All these efforts had to be done in a very subtle way,” he says. For one, each grant was fairly modest. But by getting a position at the institute, even a temporary one, a researcher “could at least get a visa and would have a foothold” as they worked to find jobs elsewhere in the U.S., says Dijkgraaf. “There was this joke that the institute was a little bit like an Ellis Island for these scholars at risk.”</p>
<p>In a 1939 report to the Institute for Advanced Study trustees, Flexner wrote, “Fifty years from now the historian looking backward will, if we act with courage and imagination, report that during our time the center of gravity in scholarship moved across the Atlantic to the United States.” And he was right. “In the end America profited hugely,” says Siegmund-Schultze, who adds that “many of these developments would have happened anyway even without the Nazis.” After all, America had more resources, the population was growing, and the nation was starting to replace private financing for the fundamental sciences with public financing — a large part of the reason the U.S. was able to retain its mathematical and scientific dominance after World War II. Nevertheless, America’s willingness to take in scholars fleeing the Nazis provided a boost to its rising scientific establishment and caused the balance of power to shift almost overnight.</p>
<p>“We now think of it as a given that the United States is a center of research and scholarship,” Dijkgraaf says. “It wasn’t at all in the 1930s. It was this brave act and this generosity that allowed this to happen.”</p>
<p>Albert Einstein is the most famous émigré scientist who ended up at the institute as a result of that generosity. Other luminaries included John von Neumann, a Hungarian mathematician, computer scientist, and physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project; Hermann Weyl, who had been Hilbert’s successor at Göttingen; and Kurt Gödel, who <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/2/uncertainty/the-deepest-uncertainty">changed the way mathematicians think about certainty</a>.</p>
<p>As that star-studded list suggests, taking in these refugees was not simply an act of generosity. Oswald Veblen, who had been influential in getting the institute to Princeton in the first place and had become one of the first scholars at the institute, “had a very clear vision that this was a win-win situation,” says Dijkgraaf. “He could help the refugees, but it was also a unique opportunity to strengthen mathematics in the United States.”</p>

<p>Institutions are fragile. They are easier to destroy than build. A few months of Hitler’s policies unraveled two centuries of mathematical progress in Göttingen. That university, and Germany more broadly, never fully recovered. As von Neumann correctly <a href="https://global.britannica.com/biography/John-von-Neumann">predicted</a> in 1933, “If these boys continue for only two more years (which is unfortunately very probable) they will ruin German science for a generation — at least.”</p>
<p>America benefited hugely from the intellects of displaced mathematicians and scientists 80 years ago. And while America’s scientific institutions are not facing the same sudden existential threat Göttingen did in April 1933, their work and their scholars can still be seriously undercut by anti-science and anti-intellectual policies. It would be a tragic irony if American mathematics and science, which owe much of their status and success to the German prejudices of another era, were brought low by a kindred set of attitudes in this one.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/18/ibm_orders_us_sales_staff/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/18/ibm_orders_us_sales_staff/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43727727">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> IBM, which employees wryly or ruefully say stands for I've Been Moved, is once again moving its employees.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Big Blue shared new rules on where it expects its US sales staff to work: At least three days a week at a client, a flagship office, or a sales hub.</p>
<p>And the mainframe giant last week told all US Cloud employees, sales or otherwise, to return to the office at least three days per week at designated "strategic" locations.</p>

    

<p>Several current and former IBM employees who have spoken to <em>The Register</em> about IBM's work directives argue that these policies represent stealth layoffs because older (and presumably more highly compensated) employees tend to be less willing to uproot their lives, and families where applicable, than the "early professional hires" IBM has been courting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/14/ibm_age_discrimination_court_documents/">at some legal risk</a>.</p>
<h3>US sales RTO – sorry, RTC</h3>
<p>In a staff memo seen by <em>The Register</em>, Adam Lawrence, general manager for IBM Americas, billed the return-to-office for most stateside sales personnel as a "return to client initiative."</p>
<p>Citing how "remarkable it is when our teams work side by side" at IBM's swanky Manhattan flagship office, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-09-06-ibm-unveils-new-flagship-office-at-one-madison-avenue-in-new-york-city">unveiled</a> in September 2024, Lawrence added IBM is investing in an Austin, Texas, office to be occupied in 2026.</p>

        


        

<p>Whether US sales staff end up working in NYC, Austin, or some other authorized location, Lawrence told them to brace for – deep breath – IBM's "new model" of "effective talent acquisition, deployment, and career progression." We're told that model is "centered on client proximity for those dedicated to specific clients, and anchored on core IBM locations for those dedicated to territories or those in above-market leadership roles."</p>
<p>The program requires most IBM US sales staff "to work at least three days a week from the client location where their assigned territory decision-makers work, a flagship office, or a sales hub." Those residing more than 50 miles from their assigned location will be offered relocation benefits to move. Sales hubs are an option only for those with more than one dedicated account.</p>

        

<p>IBM presently has five flagship offices for this purpose, one of each in: New York, Austin, Raleigh, Washington DC, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It also has eight sales hubs: Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago, Illinois; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Los Angeles, California; and Seattle, Washington. Additional sales hubs may be added later.</p>
<p>Lawrence said Dallas-based workers involved with the Digital Sales center at that location will be moved to Austin in 2026.</p>
<p>The "return to client initiative" applies to sales people associated with US Enterprise, Strategic, and Horizon clients' sites. Those serving US National market territories, Canada, Latin America, US Federal markets, Technology Expert Labs Delivery, Web Methods, and Software Migration Project Office sellers are exempt.</p>

        

<p>By early May, managers are expected to discuss arrangements with team members; team member colocation decisions are due by early June.</p>
<p>As we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/20/ibm_colocation_program_described_as/">reported</a> in February, IBM in 2024 began rolling out a co-location/return to office plan that started with managers and has now reached the corporation's broader workforce. Co-location expands on return to office directives by insisting that teams operate out of the same location – it's not enough to work out of any IBM office – and by requiring some workers who have never worked from an office to begin doing so.</p>

</ul>
<h3>US Cloud RTO and India</h3>
<p>IBM's office policy change reached US Cloud employees in an April 10 memo from Alan Peacock, general manager of IBM Cloud. Peacock set a July 1, 2025, deadline for US Cloud employees to work from an office at least three days per week, with relocating workers given until October 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The employee shuffling has been accompanied by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/27/ibm_cuts_jobs_in_us/">rolling layoffs</a> in the US, but hiring in India – there are at least 10x as many open IBM jobs in India as there are in any other IBM location, according to the corporation's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ibm.com/careers/search">career listings</a>. And earlier this week, IBM <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ibm_lucknowopeningteaser1920x1080mp4-activity-7317418941553733632-FbUr">said</a> it "is setting up a new software lab in Lucknow," India.</p>
<h3>DEI'ing inside</h3>
<p>This push to hire ever more in India is perhaps what IBM chief human resources officer Nickle LaMoreaux meant in a de-DEI memo earlier this month that equated inclusion with talent acquisition while deemphasizing diversity and equity, the two other elements of DEI.</p>
<p>Citing differing opinions about DEI programs and the need to be compliant "with all applicable laws, executive orders and government policies – even as they shift," LaMoreaux insisted that IBM's broad commitment to inclusion – which dates back to 1954 when chairman Thomas Watson Jr penned IBM Policy Letter #4 – has not changed.</p>
<p>But, she added, "practices are ever evolving" – as if efforts to hire underrepresented groups wax and wane like phases of the moon, outside of corporate control, rather than being deliberate executive-driven directives.</p>
<p>The opinion shaping IBM's realignment appears to be that of President Trump, who on January 20, announced an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/">executive order</a> titled: "Ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferencing." The order seeks to remove DEI considerations from the federal government, though it's not a done deal. Earlier this week, a federal judge <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-dei-chicago-women-diversity-f3c9773c8f8cb39f70b1250e80704789">blocked</a> the US Department of Labor from requiring that government contractors – like IBM – certify that they don't operate any DEI programs.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome of that legal battle, the evolution described by LaMoreaux has already brought change.</p>
<p>"As a result, we have adjusted some of our programs and our communications over the past few months," explained LaMoreaux.</p>
<p>"For example, aspirational diversity goals are no longer part of the executive incentive program, which is instead focused on talent and innovation measures. You may also notice changes to our website designed to attract the most qualified talent pool, and to eliminate outdated content and terminology."</p>
<p>These website changes can be seen, for example, in the disappearance of a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241104025317/https://www.ibm.com/blogs/nordic-msp/i-pledge-to-be-equal/">March 25, 2019 blog post</a> that at least until November 4, 2024 – one day before the US Presidential election – appeared at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/nordic-msp/i-pledge-to-be-equal/">this URL</a>.</p>
<p>The post began, "IBM has a continued commitment to diversity and inclusion. A decade before the Civil Rights Act, IBM’s chairman wrote Policy Letter #4 – history’s first corporate mandate on equal employment, for everyone."</p>
<p>IBM did not respond to a request for comment. ®</p>

<p>arXiv is part of Cornell Tech, the graduate campus and research center of Cornell University. All arXiv employees are Cornell University employees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Positions at arXiv are <a href="https://hr.cornell.edu/understand-your-benefits">staff positions with benefits (endowed)</a>.</li>
<li>Visa sponsorship is not available. You must already possess the legal right to work in the US.</li>
<li>arXiv is headquartered at the <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/">Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island in New York City</a>. When hiring, there is a strong preference for candidates who can report to work at that location, but hybrid and/or remote work may be an option.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-development">Software development</h2>
<p>We are already underway on the arXiv CE ("Cloud Edition") project. This is a project to re-home all arXiv services from VMs at Cornell to a cloud provider (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a>). There are a number of reasons for this transition, including improving arXiv's scalability while modernizing our infrastructure. This will not be a simple port of the existing arXiv code base because this project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace the portion of our backends still written in perl and PHP</li>
<li>re-architect our article processing to be fully asynchronous, and provide better insight into the processing workflows</li>
<li>containerize all, or nearly all arXiv services so we can deploy via Kubernetes or services like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/">Google Cloud Run</a></li>
<li>improve our monitoring and logging facilities so we can more quickly identify and manage production issues with arxiv.org</li>
<li>create a robust CI/CD pipeline to give us more confidence that changes we deploy will not cause services to regress</li>
</ul>
<p>The cloud transition is a pre-requisite to modernizing arXiv as a service. The modernization will enable:
 - arXiv to expand the subject areas that we cover
 - improve the metadata we collect and make available for articles, adding fields that the research community has requested such as funder identification
 - deal with the problem of ambiguous author identities
 - improve accessibility to support users with impairments, particularly visual impairments
 - improve usability for the entire arXiv community</p>
<p>We have three SWE openings, one general and two specialized</p>

<p>We are looking for a developer with Cloud DevOps experience to lead the effort of modernizing our devops system so we can efficiently, reliably, and securely deploy new code, using Infrastructure as code principles. This task will likely involve a fair amount of automation via <a href="https://github.com/readme/featured/defining-gitops">gitops</a>, as well as Google Cloud Platform tools. The devops lead will also put in place a robust CI/CD pipeline, and may also be asked to help fill in test cases.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"><p role="button">Chris Krebs, former CISA Director, became a symbol of truth in cybersecurity after affirming the <span data-ga-track="caption expand">...

<p>In the world of cybersecurity, where truth is paramount and trust is everything, silence can be louder than an alarm.</p>

<p>When President Trump issed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/" aria-label="Executive Order targeting Chris Krebs">Executive Order targeting Chris Krebs</a>—a respected cybersecurity leader and the first director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency—the cybersecurity industry should have responded with a unified voice of outrage and support. But instead, it largely whispered… or worse, said nothing at all.</p>


<p>This moment is not just about Krebs. It’s a constitutional stress test. A moral gut check. And the cybersecurity industry is failing it.</p>

<h2>What Happened in 2020?</h2>
<p>Chris Krebs isn’t a political agitator. His role and actions in 2020 were not partisan. He was Trump’s own appointee to lead CISA, the agency charged with protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure, including elections. In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, Krebs and his team worked tirelessly with state and local election officials to safeguard systems against foreign interference and domestic cyber threats.</p>

<p>When the votes were counted and no credible evidence of widespread fraud emerged—despite a tidal wave of disinformation—CISA issued a joint statement declaring the 2020 election “the most secure in American history.” Over 60 lawsuits attempting to challenge the results were dismissed across the country—primarily due to a complete lack of evidence to support the claims. Many of those decisions came from Republican-appointed judges. The facts were clear.</p>

<p>But truth has become a political liability.</p>
<p>For doing his job—and doing it well—<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/12/16/ex-election-security-chief-chris-krebs-says-gop-refusal-to-concede-election-corrosive-to-democracy/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/12/16/ex-election-security-chief-chris-krebs-says-gop-refusal-to-concede-election-corrosive-to-democracy/" target="_self" aria-label="Krebs was fired via tweet">Krebs was fired via tweet</a>. And now, years later, he has been further targeted by an Executive Order that effectively seeks to blacklist him, his employer, and his professional associates. The message is unmistakable: disloyalty to the narrative will be punished.</p>
<h2>Is the Executive Order Even Legal?</h2>
<p>The Executive Order targeting Chris Krebs is not just a political stunt—it raises serious constitutional red flags.</p>
<p>At its core, it punishes a private citizen for protected speech, which violates the First Amendment. Krebs was fired from his role at CISA for publicly affirming that the 2020 election was secure—an assessment backed by dozens of court rulings and independent audits. Now, years later, he’s the subject of an order that calls for a federal investigation and labels him a “bad-faith actor” for doing his job.</p>


<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petra-molnar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.linkedin.com/in/petra-molnar/" aria-label="Petra Molnar">Petra Molnar</a>, a professor and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Walls-Have-Eyes-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1620978369" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Walls-Have-Eyes-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1620978369" aria-label="The Walls Have Eyes: Surviving Migration in the Age of Artificial Intelligence"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Walls-Have-Eyes-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1620978369">The Walls Have Eyes: Surviving Migration in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</em></a>, “targeting former officials perceived to be in opposition to the current administration is not constitutional.” She adds that the Executive Order “undermines the crucial separation of powers between the President’s Executive Office, the Legislative Branch, and the Justice Department.”</p>
<p>This is more than overreach—it’s retaliatory use of executive authority without legal basis. And while politically motivated targeting isn’t new, Molnar notes that what’s unprecedented is “the escalation of retribution campaigns against individuals perceived to be against the goals of the Trump Administration.”</p>

<p>The Constitution explicitly forbids Congress from issuing bills of attainder—laws that single out individuals for punishment without trial. While that restriction technically applies to the Legislative branch, the spirit of it clearly applies here. A president cannot simply declare someone an enemy of the state for contradicting a political narrative. That’s not national security—it’s authoritarianism, dressed up in executive language.</p>


<h2>The Cybersecurity Community’s Deafening Silence</h2>
<p>You’d think an industry built around defending truth, integrity, and the sanctity of systems would rally around one of its own. There are admittedly a few brave voices—like <a href="https://www.lutasecurity.com/post/in-support-of-chris-krebs-and-sentinelone" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.lutasecurity.com/post/in-support-of-chris-krebs-and-sentinelone" aria-label="Katie Moussouris of Luta Security">Katie Moussouris of Luta Security</a>, cybersecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/trump-revenge-tour-targets-cyber-leaders-elections/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/trump-revenge-tour-targets-cyber-leaders-elections/" aria-label="journalist Brian Krebs">journalist Brian Krebs</a> (no relation to Chris Krebs), and a smattering of others. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stiennon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.linkedin.com/in/stiennon/" aria-label="Richard Stiennon">Richard Stiennon</a>, chief research analyst with IT-Harvest and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Security-Yearbook-2025-Directory-Industry/dp/1394334869/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YLKQQYOAUHCS&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Ko80BjneOX-ZZje5tYrhsm8iCepxsA1O-dWS_7maDcLHuVMNUZqMN-0ojE_4iZGLhG5WJoUZICgdZs195U1Sv8pYxIN7cd0Mrb8Z6FzlKtw.Y5KSekwfxnoCynGjW8QKb4OLgHP-GD7Mw1lp35K0T_M&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=security+yearbook+2025&amp;qid=1744817521&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=security+yearbook+2025%2Cstripbooks%2C138&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Security-Yearbook-2025-Directory-Industry/dp/1394334869/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YLKQQYOAUHCS&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Ko80BjneOX-ZZje5tYrhsm8iCepxsA1O-dWS_7maDcLHuVMNUZqMN-0ojE_4iZGLhG5WJoUZICgdZs195U1Sv8pYxIN7cd0Mrb8Z6FzlKtw.Y5KSekwfxnoCynGjW8QKb4OLgHP-GD7Mw1lp35K0T_M&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=security+yearbook+2025&amp;qid=1744817521&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=security+yearbook+2025%2Cstripbooks%2C138&amp;sr=1-1" aria-label="Security Yearbook 2025">Security Yearbook 2025</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stiennon_donald-trump-signs-executive-orders-activity-7315892854743044098-IwVi/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stiennon_donald-trump-signs-executive-orders-activity-7315892854743044098-IwVi/" aria-label="shared a video">shared a video</a> of Trump signing the Executive Order on LinkedIn with the statement, “This abhorrent president lashing out at those that served the country is sickening.”</p>
<p>In general, however, the cybersecurity industry has largely stayed quiet. In fact, many sources I reached out to refused to comment on the record for this story.</p>
<p>No public statements from RSAC conference organizers. No press releases from leading vendors. No formal pushback from industry alliances. It's not just disappointing—it’s damning.</p>
<p>This is not how you defend your values.</p>
<p>Many organizations seem to believe they can sidestep this conflict by remaining neutral. But neutrality in the face of injustice is a choice—it’s a choice to appease. And appeasement doesn’t work. Just ask Neville Chamberlain.</p>
<h2>The Illusion of Safety Through Silence</h2>
<p>We’ve seen this play out in other sectors. Columbia University has faced intense scrutiny and backlash not for what it said, but for what it failed to say—and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/03/21/columbia-agrees-to-trump-administrations-demands-after-losing-400-million-in-federal-funds/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/03/21/columbia-agrees-to-trump-administrations-demands-after-losing-400-million-in-federal-funds/" target="_self" aria-label="the compromises it made">the compromises it made</a> to stay in the good graces of political power. Paul Weiss, once a symbol of legal prestige, has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2025/03/26/why-lawyers-are-standing-up-to-big-law/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2025/03/26/why-lawyers-are-standing-up-to-big-law/" target="_self" aria-label="come under fire for pulling away">come under fire for pulling away</a> from defending academic clients under political pressure.</p>
<p>Contrast that with Harvard University, which has rejected demands from the Trump administration and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/harvard-chooses-defiance/682457/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/harvard-chooses-defiance/682457/" aria-label="publicly defended democratic norms">publicly defended democratic norms</a>. Or Perkins Coie, the law firm that continues to represent election officials and fight disinformation, even under threat.</p>
<p>Where are the Harvard Universities and Perkins Coie law firms of the cybersecurity world?</p>
<p>The Krebs case is a crucible. It reveals who is willing to stand for principle—and who is hoping the storm passes them by. But that’s not how this works. You don’t avoid authoritarianism by looking the other way. You feed it. You enable it.</p>
<h2>“First They Came…”</h2>
<p>We all know Niemöller’s haunting poem:</p>
<p><em>“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist...”</em></p>
<p>It has become the go-to cautionary tale for the dangers of silence in the face of rising authoritarianism. And yet, here we are—living it in real time—and most of the cybersecurity industry is failing the test.</p>
<p>They came for Krebs. And most watched. Quietly. Uncomfortably. Passively.</p>
<p>Everyone—or at least almost everyone over the age of 40—has probably wondered how Germany allowed Hitler to rise to power. We have gone through the thought exercise at some point of considering what we would have done if we lived in Germany during Hitler’s rise. People don’t ponder that question and think, “I would have remained silent.” They ponder that question and imagine themselves as a noble hero—standing up for liberty and freedom.</p>
<p>And yet, here we are.</p>
<p>Freedom isn’t free and actions have consequences. Will there be repercussions for organizations that defy Trump’s whims? Maybe. Current events suggest the odds are good. But, millions of Americans have given their lives to support and defend the Constitution and stand up for democracy and freedom. The least cybersecurity vendors, law firms, universities, and other targeted organizations can do is risk sacrificing government contracts and revenue to stand up for their principles and the rule of law.</p>
<p>If a former CISA director, a nationally respected cybersecurity expert, can be targeted for doing his job and speaking the truth, what makes you think you’ll be safe when your turn comes?</p>
<h2>The Stakes Are Bigger Than One Person</h2>
<p>This is not about left or right. It’s not about politics. It’s about whether we allow power to dictate truth, or whether we stand up to defend it—even when it’s hard. Especially when it’s hard.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity industry has always portrayed itself as the vanguard—defenders of infrastructure, truth, and resilience. But right now, it’s at risk of becoming just another silent institution, hoping the monster it won’t name doesn’t notice it.</p>
<p>That’s not defense. That’s surrender.</p>
<h2>A Call to Speak</h2>
<p>To every cybersecurity leader, CISO, vendor, and industry body: this is your moment. Not just to protect one man’s reputation, but to show what kind of industry we want to be.</p>
<p>Because if we can’t defend the truth—if we won’t even defend one of our own when truth itself is under attack—then what exactly are we protecting?</p>
<p>Silence isn’t safe.</p>
<p>Silence is surrender.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://buttondown.com/blog/whatever-happened-to-amp-email">https://buttondown.com/blog/whatever-happened-to-amp-email</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43725865">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-sentry-component="Prose" data-sentry-source-file="Prose.tsx"><p>“Email has largely stayed the same,” <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail/">wrote Gmail product manager Aakash Shaney</a> in 2019, while the web rapidly evolved around it.</p><p>No more. Google’s AMP for email meant “your emails can stay up to date” and “you can easily take action directly from the message itself.”</p><p>Four years earlier, the search giant had come for the mobile web with AMP—accreted mobile pages. Devs would code mobile versions of their site using AMP libraries, host them in Google’s CDN, and reap the benefits of near-instant load times and preferential placement in Google search results.</p><p>And now they were coming for your emails, dangling the benefits of a modernized messaging experience where you could book flights and hotels, respond to meeting invites and Google Docs comments, all from the comfort of your inbox.</p><p>“Who would ever want this?” <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32408370">asked @waste_monk on Hacker News</a>. “We are living in hell.”</p><h2>Dante's inbox</h2><p>Yet the road to hell is paved with good intentions, as they say. That, and more than a little hubris.</p><p>On the web, AMP had gained grudging adoption through carrots and sticks. Build an AMP site, and you’d get <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/google-creates-dedicated-placement-in-search-results-for-amp-stories-starting-with-travel-category/">preferential placement in search results</a>, a grey lightning bolt near your site’s name in search results, and a near-zero latency page load from Google’s CDN—all carrots. “We are here to make the web great again,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711172/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-search-publishers-lawsuit">said Google’s vice president of news, Richard Gingras</a> in 2015, only months after Donald Trump brought that phrase into the vernacular. Google assumed publishers the world over would happily rewrite their mobile sites to the search giant’s whims.</p><p>The implicit stick, though, was that without an AMP page, your site wouldn’t rank as highly as it may have previously. And with <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">over 89% of global search volume</a>, when Google asks web publishers to jump, they say how high.</p><p>There were always issues with AMP. It brought back the dynamics of the mobile versus the desktop web, for one. Instead of the same web for everyone, you now had one page on mobile, another page on desktop—exactly what responsive web design had been fighting against ever since the iPhone brought a desktop-class browser to mobile. And, more critically, it lessened your control over your site.&nbsp;</p><p>AMP required allowing any AMP CDN to cache your pages. Visitors might be served your page from a Google domain instead of your own, or the ad tech and other scripts on your site might be incapable of running on your AMP site (handily, it seemed, for Google, who might prefer you to use their ad tech instead).</p><p>It was all enough that, over the coming years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711172/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-search-publishers-lawsuit">Google would come under two antitrust lawsuits</a> that referenced AMP as part of what the US Justice Department saw as Google’s attempt to monopolize online advertising and the web in general.</p><p><a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/">AMP libraries</a> themselves were open-source. And you could offer a competing AMP CDN; <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/bing-amp-cache-bc1c884c">Microsoft’s Bing did</a>, for one. But web developers viewed AMP with suspicion from the onset, as much due to the coercion as anything. “It’s a threat to the open web,” as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ecrzvp/comment/fbdfq7x/">@ImprobableValue summed up</a> the prevailing opinion on Reddit.</p><p>And then Google brought AMP to email.</p><h2>What if email was interactive?</h2><p><img src="https://buttondown.com/next-assets/img/blog/whatever-happened-to-amp-email/Pinterest-AMP.gif" alt="Pinterest AMP email in Gmail" title=""></p><p>Emails has always moved at its own, slower pace. The first email was sent twenty years before the first web page was published, and to this day, plain text emails without HTML are still considered compliant <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822">internet messages</a>.</p><p>As Ray Tomlinson, who implemented and sent the first email from ARPANET in 1971 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/2/2991486/ray-tomlinson-email-inventor-interview-i-see-email-being-used">said about adding formatting to email</a>: “That’s too complicated: we just want to send messages to people.”</p><p>That, for better or worse, has been the ethos of email. It’s why every email message, today, should include both an HTML and plain text version, why you can email anyone and trust that they can read your message. It’s one of the remaining decentralized parts of modern communications, one where <a href="https://www.caniemail.com/clients/gmail/#desktop-webmail">Gmail supports only 152 of the 301 email HTML and CSS features</a> yet your messages still typically look fine.</p><p>Email’s great because “No company owns it. It works reliably and as intended on every platform, every operating system, every device. That’s a rarity today and a hell of a valuable one, ” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/amp-for-email-is-a-terrible-idea/">said TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And here came Google, recommending everyone change how they write emails.</p><p>AMP email used the same frameworks as AMP on the web, with a <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/components/email/">scaled-down set of components</a>. Some new stuff: AMP-form to gather info, AMP-autocomplete to suggest search and filter results, AMP-carousel to showcase said results. Some older stuff, rewritten: AMP-image to “replace the HTML5 img tag” and lazy-load images, AMP-anim to “manage an animated image, typically a gif,” and AMP-timeago for fuzzy timestamps.</p><p><img src="https://buttondown.com/next-assets/img/blog/whatever-happened-to-amp-email/Yahoo-shopping-AMP.gif" alt="AMP eCommerce email in Yahoo! Mail" title=""></p><p>It all worked, in Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and (inexplicably) Mail.ru. Launch partner OYO Rooms let you browse hotel listings and reviews from emails. <a href="https://booking.com/">Booking.com</a> let you flip through room photos—and change your email preferences from daily to weekly from an interactive form in emails. Pinterest emails let you flip through recipes and save them to your boards. And Google Docs, most notably, let you reply to and close comments from your inbox.</p><p>“It’s the biggest thing happening to email since the creation of email,” <a href="https://amp.dev/about/email">Booking.com’s Antony Malone said</a> to the AMP team.</p><h2>AMPing up your emails</h2><p><img src="https://buttondown.com/next-assets/img/blog/whatever-happened-to-amp-email/Screenshot.png" alt="AMP Playground from Google to code AMP emails" title=""></p><p>You, too, could code an AMP email, as long as you were willing to now write AMP, HTML, and plain text versions of every email. The AMP version was familiar enough, HTML if you squint. You’d open with an &lt;html ⚡4email lang="en" data-css-strict&gt; or &lt;html amp4email&gt; tag, then add standard HTML components alongside &lt;amp-img&gt; or &lt;amp-carousel&gt; or other elements as needed. You could build an interactive tick-tack-toe game, if you were so inclined.</p><p>Then, just as today you write HTML and plain text versions of your emails, you’d need to code AMP and HTML versions of each message. You’d need alternatives for core features. Google Docs, for instance, let you reply to a Google Doc comment directly from an email in Gmail. On other email apps without AMP support, the reply button would instead open a New Email window complete with a custom @docs.google.com address where you could email in a reply. That requires a magnitude more effort to build and support, for a simulacrum of interactivity.</p><p>And, even after all of that work, you couldn’t just send your email. You’d need to authenticate your domain with <a href="https://buttondown.com/blog/migration-explained">DKIM, DMARC, and SPF</a>—good ideas, regardless. You’d also need to send a sample email to both <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/ampemail/register">Google</a> and <a href="https://senders.yahooinc.com/amp/">Yahoo!</a>, and register your domain with each of them. Then, if you were lucky, within 5 days you’d be approved to start sending AMP emails.</p><p>All of that, for emails that would only work in a handful of email apps.</p><p>AMP emails, today, still aren’t supported by Gmail or any other service in Microsoft Edge (or Internet Explorer, but that’s more understandable). Yahoo! only added AMP support to mobile in 2022, two years after the initial launch. Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/outlook/developer-preview-of-amp-for-email-in-outlook-com---no-longer-supported/821020">added “preview” support for AMP</a> to <a href="https://outlook.com/">Outlook.com</a> in 2019, only to turn it off a year later in favor of their Exchange-only, JSON-powered “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/">Actionable Messages</a>.”</p><p>The writing seemed on the wall from the beginning. It was all too much effort, for too little, in a developer environment primed to distrust anything new from Google.</p><p>“It’s okay,” declared <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20255877">@_ofdw</a> on Hacker News, 3 months after AMP for Email’s initial release. “Google will kill AMP in a year or two, just like they kill everything else.”</p><h2><strong>AMP, expunged</strong></h2><p>666 days later (seriously!), Google blinked. “We will no longer show the AMP badge icon to indicate AMP content,” <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/more-details-page-experience">announced the Google Search Central Blog</a> in April 2021, and “using the AMP format is no longer required” to be featured in Google News’ Top Stories carousel.</p><p>AMP for Email went more quietly into that dark night. No announcements that AMP for Email was over, no disabling of AMP features in Gmail. It didn’t join the 296 other projects that have been <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">killed by Google</a>, from AngularJS to Zeitgeist (and Google Reader, Google Wave, and so many more).</p><p>Google itself still uses AMP for email, branded as <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9266768?sjid=10526709383943153796-AP">Dynamic Email</a>. You can still reply to Google Docs comments and accept Google Calendar events without leaving Gmail thanks to AMP for email.</p><p><img src="https://buttondown.com/next-assets/img/blog/whatever-happened-to-amp-email/Gmail-comment-AMP.gif" alt="AMP powered Gmail comments" title=""></p><p>But AMP the project has been left to die. The AMP by Example site, linked to in all of the announcements, is dead. AMP’s <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/main/docs/spec/email">Email spec</a> hasn’t been updated since a few typos were fixed in 2023, while the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/wg-amp4email">wg-amp4email working group</a> hasn’t seen an update since 2021. Google’s own <a href="https://playground.amp.dev/?runtime=amp4email">AMP Playground</a> site is stuck in the past, featuring the iPhone XS and Pixel 2 phones.</p><p>AMP “got as far as Google could prop it up and as soon as Google gave up on that everyone promptly ditched it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1g2u0p3/comment/lrqvrpv/">remarked Rarst</a> on a Reddit r/webdev thread about AMP.</p><p>Interactivity in email didn’t die with AMP. You don’t need anything beyond good ol’ HTML. HTML buttons and forms are supported by Gmail and almost every app other than Outlook for Windows or Yahoo! Mail for iOS. The HTML5 &lt;video&gt; element works in Apple Mail, Thunderbird, and Outlook on Mac (as well as, strangely, Outlook 2003 for Windows but no other versions)—just not in Gmail. You can make polls and surveys in email with HTML links and buttons, as <a href="https://docs.buttondown.com/surveys">we do at Buttondown</a>—enough to RSVP to events, even if not enough to dynamically view hotel prices, say.</p><p>AMP, though, wasn’t just interactive. It made emails impermanent. The email you receive today with a comment may not look the same tomorrow after someone edits their comment or adds a new reply. The price on a home listing or plane ticket might dynamically update, gaslighting you about what you know you saw in your inbox yesterday. Email’s the last bastion of permanency on the internet, one place where at least you have a record of what went down. That’s worth preserving. Fuzzy timestamps are the last thing email needed.</p><p>Email’s lasted for 54 years. Over <a href="https://buttondown.com/blog/emails-lindy-lifetime">the next 54 years</a>, expect email to change, slowly. Expect plain text email to stick around forever. Expect people to continue to predict the death of email. And, expect the death of everything that says it’ll usurp email.</p><p>You can’t kill—or change, really—something that’s lasted that long.</p><p><em>Image Credits: Animated demos of AMP emails from Google’s launch posts.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

            </p>
          </figure>

<p>In the early 2010s, I was a big fan of <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sentry</a>. It was a great tool for tracking errors in web
applications. At the time, I was making software for law firms, so sending error reports to a third-party service was
out of the question, I needed to host it myself. So I did.</p>
<p>After leaving the law firm world, I worked as a contractor for a few years. So when I overheard one of my colleagues
asking whether it would be possible to host Sentry on-premise, I figured I could help. I had already done it, after
all. <em>Big mistake</em>.</p>
<h3 id="scare-mongering">Scare-mongering</h3>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that the Sentry documentation was full of warnings about how self-hosting was a bad idea.
Here’s the <a href="https://sentry.io/resources/self-hosted-vs-cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">kind of quote</a> that you couldn’t make up if you were
<a href="https://www.bugsink.com/">their direct competitor</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we don’t necessarily recommend self-hosting to everyone. In addition to existing hidden costs, as Sentry evolves,
our self-hosted version will become more complex, demanding additional types of infrastructure. Our internal system
that powers our newest features will also advance and require more containers, including one for a new database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they even have pretty pictures and a whole <a href="https://www.bugsink.com/static/build-vs-buy.4bd46d420f4e.pdf">pdf</a> to go with it:</p>

          <figure>

            <figcaption>
                Credit: sentry.io
            </figcaption>
          </figure>


<h3 id="hardware-requirements">Hardware requirements</h3>
<p>Despite the warnings, I hadn’t given up yet. I had already done it once, after all. So I opened the
<a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documentation</a> and started reading. More warnings, in this case about the lack
of support for the self-hosted version. Given that they have to make money too, I could understand those (more than the
scary pictures).</p>
<p>But then come the hardware requirements: they recommend at least <strong>16GB of RAM</strong> and 4 cores. Coming from the time when
I ran Sentry on a 512MB VPS, this was a bit of a shock. So is that a real problem, or should I just get with the times,
and accept that 16GB is the new normal? I’d argue that it <em>is</em> a problem, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, there’s a <strong>signal being given</strong> about the <strong>complexity and fragility</strong> of the software. A 16GB RAM requirement
just screams “this is a big, complex piece of software that will break in mysterious ways”. Not very scientific, I know,
but based on experience.</p>
<p>Second, there’s the <strong>simple matter of cost</strong>. The cheapest VM at the super-cheap hosting company Hetzner costs €3.29
per month, but if you need 16GB, you’ll pay 15.90 per month – almost a factor 5 more. And that’s assuming you can run
things at el-cheapo hosting. If you pay-per-compute, or if you work at some big corp, the cost of machines may be much
higher.</p>
<p>Also relevant in corporate environments: there may very well be some threshold where it is easy to spin up “small”
machines (for some value of small), but above which you’ll need to <strong>beg for permission</strong> with a bean counter, sysadmin or manager.</p>
<p>Finally, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idLyobOhtO4&amp;t=3030s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Linus
Torvalds</a> said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you can do something really fast, really well, people start using it differently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same applies for “if it’s small”. One such different use-case is to just <strong>run it
locally</strong>, as an aid in local development. If you need 16GB of RAM to run Sentry, you’ll run the risk of slowing down
your laptop to a crawl, or at least having to think about it. If it’s in the 100MB range, you can just run it and forget
about it.</p>
<p>Oh and if you were thinking of running it on a Raspberry Pi, forget about it, but not (just) because of the RAM. The Pi
has an ARM processor, and <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/1585" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sentry only supports amd64</a>.</p>
<h3 id="so-many-scripts">So many scripts…</h3>
<p>The next chapter in the documentation is about the <a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/#getting-started" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actual
installation</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice is that the installation is done with a shell script. That is not a problem in itself, but
I’m also not the type of person who would just run a shell script from the internet without reading it first, so I did.</p>
<p>The actual script is some 30 lines, but each of those is an include of another script. Counting those, you get:</p>
<pre><code><div><pre><span></span>me@mymachine~/../self-hosted/install$ wc -l *.sh
  [...]
  837 total
</pre></div></code></pre>
<p>That’s not a time-investment I’m willing to make. Especially since this is, as per the documentation, only a first step
towards a reliable installation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>packaged up for low-volume deployments and proofs-of-concept</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And remember that the whole reason for setting up Sentry was to help a colleague. I’m not going to leave them with a
proof-of-concept, and I also don’t want to become the guy who maintains the Sentry installation. And I’m not going to
tell them to read 837 lines of shell script either.</p>
<h3 id="further-searching">Further searching</h3>
<p>Finally, I did some random internet searching, to see what the actual experience was of people who had self-hosted
Sentry. Here are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/17xosxi/selfhosting_sentry_your_experience/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some quotes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a ton of docker containers. Things will fail randomly or maybe with a lot of traffic, don’t remember well. Hard
to upgrade or it would upgrade automatically and break?.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>if you can dedicate like 1/4 to 1/2 an engineer on it then i think its worth it. keeping in mind that it is an
absolutely bear with an ungodly amount of stateful dependencies nowadays.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I can’t say it’s been pleasant, probably my least favorite service to do maintenance on or interact with</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let’s just assume these aren’t astro-turfed by Sentry’s own marketing department, i.e that these are real.
None of this looks very promising. And since I don’t have a 1/4 to 1/2 an engineer to dedicate to this, I would be
looking at a significant share of my own time.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I gave up on self-hosted Sentry before even getting started.</p>
<p>I’m not going to run a piece of software that requires 16GB of RAM, has a complex
installation script, and is known to be a pain to maintain. I’m not going to recommend it to anyone else either.</p>
<p>So did some good come out of this? I’d like to think so… this small journey got me mad enough to just write a <a href="https://www.bugsink.com/">drop-in
replacement for Sentry</a> that can <a href="https://www.bugsink.com/scalable-and-reliable/">run on any cheap hardware you can find</a>. I hope that it is
a useful alternative for people with the same taste in software as me.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-04-17/1744906692-864216-image.png" alt="Kagi Assistant: No training on user data. Combines top LLMs with optional results from Kagi Search. Privacy by default."></p>

<p>At Kagi, our mission is simple: to humanise the web. We want to deliver a search experience that prioritises human needs, allowing you to explore the web effectively, privately, and without manipulation. We evaluate new technologies not for their acclaim but for their true potential to support our mission.</p>

<p>Since its launch, Kagi Assistant has been a favorite for many users as it allows access to world top large language models, grounded in Kagi Search, all in one place in one beautiful user interface - and all that for +$15/mo upgrade from our Professional plan that provides unlimited Kagi Search.</p>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that <a href="https://kagi.com/assistant">Kagi Assistant</a> is now available to all users across all plans, expanding from its previous exclusivity to <a href="https://kagi.com/signup?plan_id=ultimate">Ultimate</a> subscribers, as an added value to all Kagi customers, without increasing the price.</p>

<p><strong>An important note:</strong> We are enabling the Assistant for all users in phases, based on regions, starting with USA today. The full rollout for ‘Assistant for All’ is scheduled to be completed by Sunday, 23:59 UTC.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-04-17/1744906741-483590-image.png" alt="kagi assistant screenshot"></p>

<p>Our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/ai-philosophy.html">approach to integrating AI</a> is shaped by these realities and guided by three principles:</p>

<ol>
<li>AI serves a defined, search-relevant context: Kagi Assistant is a research aid.</li>
<li>AI enhances, it doesn’t replace: Kagi Search remains our core offering, functioning independently. Kagi Assistant is an optional tool you can use as needed.</li>
<li>AI should enhance humanity, not diminish it: Our goal is to improve your research process by helping you synthesise information or explore topics grounded in Kagi Search results, not to replace your critical thinking.</li>
</ol>

<p>Kagi Assistant embodies these principles, working within the context of Kagi’s search results to provide a new way to interact with information. It’s built to make research easier while respecting your privacy and AI’s limits.</p>

<p>By making Kagi Assistant available to everyone, we’re giving all users the choice to explore this capability as part of their Kagi toolkit - at no additional cost to their subscription. Use it when and how it suits your workflow, knowing it’s built with privacy, responsibility, and human-centric values at its core.</p>

<h2>Let’s talk about the specifics!</h2>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-04-17/1744906767-320589-image.png" alt="lets talk about sepcifics doggo"></p>

<h3>AI grounded in Kagi search, guided by you</h3>

<p>When you enable web access, the Assistant has access to Kagi Search results. It will also respect your <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/website-info-personalized-results.html">personalised domain rankings</a> and allows the use of <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/lenses.html">Lenses</a> to narrow search scope.</p>

<p>Or, if you’d prefer to discuss directly with the model, you can also turn off web access. It also supports file uploads, allowing you to provide additional context or information for your queries.</p>

<h3>Custom assistants tailored to your needs</h3>

<p>Create <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/custom-assistants.html">specialized assistants</a> with unique instructions, defining their purpose, context, and web access preferences. Need help with coding, grammar reviews, or diagnosing an issue with your classic VW Bus? Build an assistant for it.</p>

<p>Pro-tip: assign a custom bang (!name) for instant access via your browser’s search bar.</p>

<h3>Refine and redirect with editing</h3>

<p>Conversations don’t always go as planned. If a response misses the mark, Kagi Assistant lets you edit prompts, switch models, or adjust settings mid-thread. This ensures you stay in control and can redirect the conversation without starting over.</p>

<h3>Privacy as a foundation</h3>

<p>Your privacy is our priority. Assistant threads are private by default, automatically expire based on your settings, and your interaction data is not used to train AI models.  This applies to both Kagi and third-party providers, under strict contractual terms.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/llms-privacy.html#llms-privacy">Kagi LLMs privacy</a> for additional information.</p>

<h3>A note on our fair-use policy</h3>

<p>Providing powerful AI tools requires significant resources. To ensure sustainability, we’re starting to enforce our <a href="https://kagi.com/privacy#Terms-of-use">fair-use policy</a>.</p>

<p>Basically our policy states that you can use AI models based on your plan’s value. For example, a $25 monthly plan allows up to $25 worth of raw token cost across all models (there is a 20% built-in margin that we reserve for providing searches, development and infrastructure for the service). From our token usage statistics, 95% of users should never hit this limit.</p>

<p>While most users won’t be affected, those exceeding the generous threshold will have the possibility to renew their subscription cycle instantly. Soon, we’ll introduce credit top-ups for added flexibility. This approach ensures a fair, user-funded model while maintaining quality service and is a simple way to control usage, compared to arbitrary usage limits found in other services.</p>

<h2>Your favourite models are waiting for you</h2>

<p>Choose from a range of leading LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more. You can switch models mid-thread and explore their performance through our regularly updated <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/llm-benchmark.html">open-source LLM benchmark</a>.  Choice of models in non-Ultimate plans will be limited compared to our full offering in the Ultimate plan, please see below.</p>

<p>Access to your favourite LLMs makes Kagi Assistant mould to your requirements and query customisations, so we feature an array of models for you to choose from.</p>

Team Kagi.</p>

<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

<p><strong>Q: Does using a less costly model (like DeepSeek) compared to larger ones use fewer credits?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes. The fair use policy calculates usage based on the actual cost charged by the model provider. Therefore, using smaller, less expensive models will allow for significantly more token usage compared to larger models.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Does Kagi receive discounted rates from AI model providers?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> No, Kagi does not receive discounts. However, we utilize smart caching techniques for the models to reduce operational costs, and these savings are passed on to the user.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why did Kagi start enforcing the fair use policy?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The policy was enforced due to excessive use. For instance, the top 10 users accounted for approximately 14% of the total costs, with some individuals consistently using up to 50 million tokens per week on the most advanced models. Our profit margins are already quite narrow. 95% of users should never hit any usage limits.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the specific usage limit?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The limit corresponds directly to the monetary value of your Kagi plan, converted into an equivalent token amount. For example, a $25 plan provides $25 worth of token usage. This calculation includes a 20% margin for Kagi to cover search provision, development, and infrastructure costs. Savings achieved through prompt caching and other optimizations are passed on to you.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Where can I view my token usage?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Currently, you can monitor your token usage on the Consumption page: <a href="https://kagi.com/settings?p=consumption">https://kagi.com/settings?p=consumption</a>. We plan to display cost and interaction details more prominently soon, potentially on the billing page or directly within the Assistant interface.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I can not access Assistant!</strong><br>
A: We are doing staged rollout beginning with USA, full rollout scheduled by Sunday, 23:59 UTC. This will include other regions and even the trial plan.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" data-transition="content" data-loop="false" itemprop="articleBody">

    <p>For nearly three decades, a cold war has raged through the halls of Congress and in high-end shellfish restaurants perched precariously on Washington, D.C.’s southern coast. The battle lines have shifted between successive administrations, sometimes tilting toward proletariat victory, and sometimes cutting fast toward total surrender to corporate America.</p>

<p>This month, thanks to the whims of the president and hefty sums of cash, Donald Trump has amended an old axiom to guarantee that nothing in life is certain but death, and paying money to file your taxes.</p>

<p>According to a <u><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irs-direct-file-tax-returns-free-trump-4bb0bca02fab9b3d06ae6f45ac67b7ab" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (report)">report</a></u> by the Associated Press this week, the IRS is moving to shut down its free tax filing program known as <u><a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (Direct File)">Direct File</a></u>, with employees working on the program told to stall work on future iterations. The news comes after Intuit, the maker of TurboTax and the biggest player in tax preparation software, spent years tirelessly fighting any attempt by the government to bring the nightmarish American system of tax collection into line with European nations that have streamlined most citizens’ filing process down to the click of a button.</p>

<p><a href="https://prospect.org/topics/daniel-boguslaw/"><em><strong>More from Daniel Boguslaw</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Even when the Biden administration broke through in the Inflation Reduction Act to fund a pilot program for Direct File, which expanded to 25 states this tax season, Intuit didn’t stop fighting. Instead, it continued cajoling lawmakers and the White House into forcing millions of Americans to shell out hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars to file with expensive and confusing tax prep software.</p>

<p>A glance at Intuit’s 2025 first-quarter lobbying disclosures gets at this continued, quarter-century saga. The company <u><a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/?index=%22lobbying-disclosures%22&amp;size=10&amp;keyword=%22intuit%22&amp;filters=%7B%22reportYear%22:%5B%222025%22%5D%7D&amp;sort=%5B%7B%22_score%22:true%7D,%7B%22field%22:%22registrant.name%22,%22order%22:%22asc%22%7D%5D" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (shelled out $240,000)">shelled out $240,000</a></u> to lobby members of Congress on tax-related issues. Forty thousand dollars was doled out to <u><a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2025/Q1/301711402.xml" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (Raffaniello &amp; Associates)">Raffaniello &amp; Associates</a></u> to curry favor on issues like “Tax Administration &amp; tax system integrity” and “Regulation of tax return preparers.” It also lobbied on implementation of Public Law 117-169, which is the <u><a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ169/PLAW-117publ169.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (statute that created IRS Direct File)">statute that created IRS Direct File</a></u>.</p>

<p><u><a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2025/Q1/301696911.xml" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (Jake Perry + Partners)">Jake Perry + Partners</a></u> received $30,000 to lobby on the same issues, including personal outreach to Elon Musk’s lackeys in Congress. According to the firm’s filing, at least part of that money was spent on “Communications with DOGE Caucus members regarding tax simplification, waste, fraud and abuse.”</p>

<p><u><a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2025/Q1/301696545.xml" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP)">Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP</a></u>, a law firm targeted with legal sanction by the Trump administration for employing special counsel Robert Mueller, received $60,000 for its work on behalf of Intuit. Its services included advocacy to “Enhance tax administration and tax system integrity” and “support tax simplification and voluntary compliance.” WilmerHale is <u><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/politics/law-firms-challenge-trump-executive-order/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (suing the Trump administration)">suing the Trump administration</a></u> over attacks on their firm, while also cozying up to Republicans to make tax filing more expensive. Money talks.</p>

<blockquote><p>Intuit shelled out $240,000 to lobby members of Congress on tax-related issues in the first quarter of 2025.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This work has paid off. In December, 29 House Republicans <u><a href="https://adriansmith.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/adriansmith.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Letter%20to%20President-Elect%20Trump%20re%20IRS%20Direct%20File%20-%20Version%20%232%20-%2012-10-2024%20%40%2005-22%20PM.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (wrote)">wrote</a></u> to then-President-elect Trump at Mar-a-Lago, asking him to end Direct File on day one. A <u><a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/house-republicans-do-the-bidding-of-big-tax-prep/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (report from Public Citizen)">report from Public Citizen</a></u> showed that these lawmakers have received $1.8 million in campaign contributions from opponents of Direct File over their political careers.</p>

<p>The relatively paltry first-quarter lobbying sum pales in comparison to the big kahuna spend that Intuit made last year: a direct payment to Trump’s inaugural committee. As Politico <u><a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/12/21/shutdown-averted-crisis-delayed-00195800" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (reported in December)">reported in December</a></u>, Intuit handed Trump $1 million for inaugural festivities that were eventually sent indoors due to bad weather. This was a common bribe-like substance from corporate America intended to show fealty to Washington’s new overlords.</p>

<p>A company spokesperson told Politico that the donation was “part of our decades-long commitment to bipartisan advocacy … Intuit is committed to ensuring our customers’ voices are heard on important issues, and our expanded participation in the democratic process reflects our growth as a company and the variety of policy issues that impact the approximately 100 million diverse consumers and businesses we serve.”</p>

<p>“Congratulations to President <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (@realDonaldTrump)">@realDonaldTrump</a> and Vice President <a href="https://x.com/JDVance" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (@JDVance)">@JDVance</a> on your inauguration,” Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, who <u><a href="https://aflcio.org/paywatch/highest-paid-ceos?industry=All&amp;state=All&amp;sp500=1&amp;combine=&amp;page=2" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (made $27 million)">made $27 million</a></u> last year, <u><a href="https://x.com/sasan_goodarzi/status/1881796616010731688" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (tweeted)">tweeted</a></u> on January 21st. “We encourage Washington to promote innovation to strengthen small businesses that are the backbone of the economy and to simplify the tax code to help Americans prosper.”</p>

<p>Intuit certainly knew the importance of persuading Trump to ditch the IRS free filing program. In its <u><a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000896878/000089687825000015/intu-20250131.htm#i3a88bc58bc1b4166afb68013b05313fe_139" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (quarterly financial statement to investors)">quarterly financial statement to investors</a></u>, Intuit listed among its risk factors “increasing competition from the public sector,” specifically IRS Direct File, which “could expand with increased awareness of and government support for the program … federal and state governments are or could become publicly funded direct competitors of the U.S. tax services industry and of Intuit. Government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications on us.”</p>

<p>They should have been scared. Customer satisfaction with Direct File was high, with <u><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/5248523-irs-direct-file-is-a-government-success-story/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (over 90 percent of users)">over 90 percent of users</a></u> ranking it as excellent or above average in surveys.</p>

<p>In 2019, ProPublica published an extensive <u><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (investigation)">investigation</a></u> into Intuit’s efforts to safeguard a business model it long marketed as consumer-friendly, despite the millions of dollars lifted off of everyday Americans attempting to file their taxes on time. Intuit focused on carrying out two simultaneous objectives to ensure a maximum windfall: “stoking innovation in Silicon Valley while stifling it in Washington.” In a confidential <u><a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/6483065-Intuit-board-of-directors-presentation-2007/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (document)">document</a></u> obtained by ProPublica, Intuit outlines the maneuvers it undertook from 1997 to 2006 to block any attempt at making tax filing cheaper and easier for consumers. “For a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,” the title slide reads.</p>

<p>Since 2002, Intuit and other tax preparation services have been legally required to offer a free private-sector version of what the government should have built and provided all along. But Intuit’s playbook has been to create a booby-trapped version of its expensive software, with embedded code that once hid the free offering from search engines like Google, making it exceedingly difficult for those seeking free filing to discover.</p>

<p>In 2023, Intuit was forced <u><a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/attorney-general-henry-announces-141-million-settlement-for-millions-of-americans-decieved-by-turbotax-owner-intuit/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (to pay out)">to pay out</a></u> over $100 million in a multistate class action lawsuit that accused the firm of tricking customers into overpaying for services that the firm is legally required to offer for free. 4.4 million consumers nationwide received checks as the result of the multistate settlement. “By requiring consumers to pay for tax-return services that should have been available for free, Intuit cheated taxpayers out of their hard earned money,” then-Pennsylvania Attorney General Michelle Henry said at the time. “Intuit’s deceptive practices and aggressive advertising campaign were unnecessary and illegal; especially when the IRS offers free tax-return services for eligible consumers.”</p>

<p>On April 15, tax filing day, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), long a sworn foe of for-profit tax filing companies, slammed the Trump administration for its failures to simplify the filing process.</p>

<p>“Despite Treasury Secretary Bessent’s promise to keep Direct File going through the 2025 tax filing season, the long-term future of the program continues to be threatened, in no small part due to Intuit’s lobbying,” Warren wrote. “Intuit has spent nearly $4 million in 2023 and again in 2024 attempting to kill the program. During the 2024 election cycle, Intuit joined other commercial tax preparation companies to make large donations to Republican congressmembers who later worked to eliminate Direct File.”</p>

<p>Yet after tens of millions in lobbying, hundreds of millions in lawsuits, and a cool million for Trump’s inauguration, it seems that Intuit’s ceaseless spending has paid off.</p>

The winds of authoritarianism are blowing stronger. We’re seeing alarming signs of a coordinated effort to silence critical voices and undermine the very foundations that support progressive causes.

For example, when I looked at music biopics, I found that on an absolute basis there was a dramatic increase over the last few years, but on a relative basis, the peak was in the 1940s.</span></p><p>I didn’t really have a hypothesis to test with the Chordonomicon dataset, though. I just wanted to explore what was in there. There had to be something interesting among 680,000 chord progressions. And there was. But, first, we should start with a simple question: What’s a chord?</p><p><span>If you’re looking for in depth discussions on music theory, I’m not your guy. (You should probably turn to someone like </span></p><p><span> and his newsletter </span><em><a href="https://ethanhein.substack.com/" rel="">Ethan teaches you music</a></em><span>.) But for this case, I think some basic definitions will help. A “note” is a single pitch. When you hit one key on the piano, for example, you are playing a note. An “interval” is a combination of two notes. A “chord” is a combination of three or more unique notes (e.g., a C major chord is comprised of the notes C, E, and G).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png" width="1440" height="834" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:834,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:47815,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/i/161358964?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd70e310-4e84-48ed-abcc-a9af3c25abb8_1440x834.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Above you can see a breakdown of the top 20 most common chords across the nearly 52 million chords notated in the Chordonomicon dataset. If you’ve ever played a guitar or piano, you won’t be surprised by the fact that G major and C major are at the top, accounting for 24% of all chords. These are some of the first chords you learn on those instruments. What’s interesting is that chord choices differ when you look across genre.</p><p>Below you can see a usage comparison of 20 common chords in jazz and country. The differences are stark. In country, for example, five major chords — G major, C major, D major, A major, and F major — comprise 61% of all chords played. Among jazz songs, by comparison, those chords only make up 39% of total chords. Nevertheless, if we take a look at some other chords, the relationship flips. Bb major, for example, makes up 2.6% of all chords in our jazz sample. For country, it’s 1.4%, almost half. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png" width="1440" height="910" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:910,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:56976,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/i/161358964?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5e795a1-efca-4100-bb53-36aa3e81f877_1440x910.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>What explains these differences? Of course, some of it is connected to arbitrary compositional choices. But another piece is explained by the instruments used in each genre. For example, the trumpet is commonly used in jazz, and trumpets are tuned to Bb. Similarly, banjos and guitars are common in country. Banjos are tuned to open G, and, as noted, chords like G, C, and D are some of the first you will learn when picking up the guitar. </p><p>Looking at individual chords across a bunch of genres is a bit chaotic, though. Instead, we can group chords into a few categories to make cross-genre comparisons a bit more digestible. Below we can see that while your simple, three-note major chords (e.g., A major, Db major) are the most common across every genre, there are some stark differences in other categories. 7th chords, for example, are 2.5 to 13 times more common in jazz than any other genre. Similarly, power chords are 2 to 21.5 times more common in punk than any other genre. Furthermore, Suspended, diminished, and augmented chords basically don’t exist in rap.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png" width="1440" height="1206" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1206,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:186836,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/i/161358964?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2753ea62-ecf1-42ed-8725-b8faf6652f71_1440x1206.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>But it’s not just interesting to compare these chord categories across genre. It’s interesting to compare them over time. Below you can see the prevalence of each chord type by decade from the 1930s to the 2020s. The most striking trend is that 7th chords have fallen into disuse. In the 1940s, 27.7% of all chords were 7th chords. Thus far in the 2020s, only 8.25% are. This decline is largely connected to the decline of jazz, a genre where the 7th chord family was a defining feature. As jazz has lost favor, simple minor triads (e.g., E minor, Ab minor) have become more prevalent.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png" width="1440" height="904" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:904,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125848,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/i/161358964?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd079a337-42dd-474a-aaf4-9e0679b494c2_1440x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>One common criticism of contemporary chord progressions is that they are unimaginative, the same four chords being looped for minutes on end. With the Chordonomicon dataset you can check this. But you can’t just get a count of unique chords per song. As I’ve written elsewhere, the </span><a href="https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/i/154793351/so-what-is-uncharted-territory-going-to-be-like" rel="">length of pop songs has changed dramatically over the last eight decades</a><span>. To account for that, we need to look at the unique chord rate. </span></p><p>Here’s what that means. If a song is A major, D major, F# minor, and E major repeated 5 times, that would be 20 total chords and 4 unique chords (i.e., 4 unique chords repeated 5 times). The unique chord rate would be (4 / 20), or 20%. The idea is that if this rate is higher, it signifies less repetitiveness and more chordal experimentation. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png" width="1440" height="978" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:978,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:114129,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/i/161358964?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd7beec4-a8bc-400f-90f3-782fcfdaf38a_1440x978.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>When you look at the median unique chord rate for each decade from the 1930s to the 2020s, you see that the rate has fallen from 13% to 8%. The rate hasn’t just collapsed recently, though. It began falling in the 1960s and 1970s before leveling off through the 2000s. It fell to its current level in the 2010s and has remained the same since.</p><p>Does this mean that all songs these days are so basic that someone who just picked up an instrument for the first time could write and perform them? No. While chord progressions are a key piece to building a song, they aren’t the only piece. Melody, lyrics, and rhythms also play an important role. This data doesn’t speak to that. But it does speak to the fact that our chord progressions are more redundant than ever before. If you’re sitting down to write a song, throw a 7th chord in. The ghost of a jazz great will smile on you.</p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13jGfTC2Gm9HUA4HWyil3h?si=1ceafb60b09646fd" rel="">A New One</a><br><span>"Hounds" by For Nina</span><br><span>2025 - Punk</span></p><div id="youtube2-UPZ9vBwH_KU" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;UPZ9vBwH_KU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UPZ9vBwH_KU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Though the riff circling throughout the verses of “Hounds” would be enough to keep me coming back, that’s not the main reason I’ve been addicted to this single from Ireland’s For Nina.

    <p data-block-key="w22bj">Today we are rolling out an early version of <b>Gemini 2.5 Flash</b> in <b>preview</b> through the Gemini API via <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/vertex-ai/studio">Vertex AI</a>. Building upon the popular foundation of 2.0 Flash, this new version delivers a major upgrade in reasoning capabilities, while still prioritizing speed and cost. Gemini 2.5 Flash is our first fully hybrid reasoning model, giving developers the ability to turn thinking on or off. The model also allows developers to set thinking budgets to find the right tradeoff between quality, cost, and latency. Even with <b>thinking off,</b> developers can maintain the fast speeds of 2.0 Flash, and improve performance.</p><p data-block-key="b171q">Our Gemini 2.5 models are thinking models, capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding. Instead of immediately generating an output, the model can perform a "thinking" process to better understand the prompt, break down complex tasks, and plan a response. On complex tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning (like solving math problems or analyzing research questions), the thinking process allows the model to arrive at more accurate and comprehensive answers. In fact, Gemini 2.5 Flash performs strongly on <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">Hard Prompts in LMArena</a>, second only to 2.5 Pro.</p>

                    2.5 Flash has comparable metrics to other leading models for a fraction of the cost and size.

    <h2 data-block-key="hippi">Fine-grained controls to manage thinking</h2><p data-block-key="4g2lu">We know that different use cases have different tradeoffs in quality, cost, and latency. To give developers flexibility, we’ve enabled setting a <b>thinking budget</b> that offers fine-grained control over the maximum number of tokens a model can generate while thinking. A higher budget allows the model to reason further to improve quality. Importantly, though, the budget sets a cap on how much 2.5 Flash can think, but the model does not use the full budget if the prompt does not require it.</p>

    </div>
  <div>
    <p data-block-key="hippi">The model is trained to know how long to think for a given prompt, and therefore automatically decides how much to think based on the perceived task complexity.</p><p data-block-key="c6ud">If you want to keep the lowest cost and latency while still improving performance over 2.0 Flash, <b>set the thinking budget to 0.</b> You can also choose to <b>set a specific token budget</b> for the thinking phase using a parameter in the API or the slider in Google AI Studio and in Vertex AI. The budget can range from 0 to 24576 tokens for 2.5 Flash.</p><p data-block-key="bm9va">The following prompts demonstrate how much reasoning may be used in the 2.5 Flash’s default mode.</p><h3 data-block-key="4qsi3"><b><br>Prompts requiring low reasoning:</b></h3><p data-block-key="ee1fc"><b>Example 1:</b> “Thank you” in Spanish</p><p data-block-key="dfdib"><b>Example 2:</b> How many provinces does Canada have?</p><h3 data-block-key="5r2iv"><b><br>Prompts requiring medium reasoning:</b></h3><p data-block-key="2hnrv"><b>Example 1:</b> You roll two dice.
