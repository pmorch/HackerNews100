<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>People die but their data may endure, which troubles legal scholar Victoria Haneman.</p>
<p>The emergence of generative AI means a person's digital presence can be recreated and revived, even if they or their family don't want that kind of memorial.</p>
<p>Haneman, Chair of Fiduciary Law at the University of Georgia School of Law, argues US law should give a dead person's estate a limited right to digital deletion as a defense against the exploitation of digital remains.</p>

    

<p>She makes that case in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://bclawreview.bc.edu/articles/10.70167/YOEQ2314">an article</a> titled "The Law of Digital Resurrection," published earlier this year in the Boston College Law Review.</p>

        


        

<p>"Digital resurrection by or through AI requires the personal data of the deceased, and the amount of data that we are storing online is increasing exponentially with each passing year," Haneman wrote.</p>
<p>"It has been said that data is the new uranium, extraordinarily valuable and potentially dangerous. A right to delete will provide the decedent with a time-limited right for deletion of personal data."</p>

        

<p>There's already a burgeoning business in training generative AI models on personal digital files, so the models can respond in ways that evoke the creator of those files. Firms like Seance AI, StoryFile, Replika, MindBank Ai, and HereAfter AI offer the ability to recreate a person's voice and likeness.</p>
<p>A living person may have some say on the matter through the control of personal digital documents and correspondence. But a dead person can't object, and US law doesn't offer the dead much data protection in terms of privacy law, property law, intellectual property law, or criminal law.</p>
<p>The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA), a law developed to help fiduciaries deal with digital files of the dead or incapacitated, can come into play. But Haneman points out that most people die intestate (without a will), leaving matters up to tech platforms. Facebook's response to dead users is to allow <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/651319028315841?locale=br_FR">anyone to request the memorialization of an account</a>, which keeps posts online. As for RUFADAA, it does little to address digital resurrection, says Haneman.</p>

</ul>
<p>The right to publicity, which provides a private right of action against unauthorized commercial use of a person's name, image, or likeness, covers the dead in about 25 states, according to Haneman. But the monetization of publicity rights has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://perma.cc/J8MA-HMYU">proven to be problematic</a>.</p>
<p>Haneman says that there are some states where it's theoretically possible to be prosecuted for libeling or defaming the deceased, such as Idaho, Nevada, and Oklahoma, but adds that such prosecutions have declined because they tread upon the constitutional right to free expression.</p>

        

<p>The situation is different in Europe, she observes, where human dignity is considered a fundamental right that informs European privacy rules. In Europe, for example, there's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/13/ai_models_forgotten_data/">a right to be forgotten</a> and this has been extended <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://perma.cc/5RKT-MUB7">in France</a> to include the removal of personal data from user accounts of the deceased, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://privacydesk.in/publications/articles/what-happens-to-your-personal-data-when-you-die/">in Italy</a> to the right of heirs to access and potentially erase a dead relative's personal data.</p>
<p>The right to be forgotten wouldn't work in the US, Haneman argues, because it would likely be deemed a violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>A recent California law, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/11/newsom_repair_delete_laws/">Delete Act</a>, which took effect last year, is the first to offer a way for the living to demand the deletion of personal data from data brokers in one step. But according to Haneman, it's unclear whether the text of the law will be extended to cover the dead – a possibility think tank Aspen Tech Policy Hub <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://aspenpolicyacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/phosthmous-data-privacy-v6.pdf">supports</a> [PDF].</p>
<p>Haneman argues that a data deletion law for the dead would be grounded in laws governing human remains, where corpses receive protection against abuse despite being neither a person nor property.</p>
<p>"The personal representative of the decedent has the right to destroy all physical letters and photographs saved by the decedent; merely storing personal information in the cloud should not grant societal archival rights," she argues. "A limited right of deletion within a twelve-month window balances the interests of society against the rights of the deceased." ®</p>

It'd be great if this could be automatic, as I want to avoid this ever happening in the future. I hope I can script this via the API.</p><p>Finally, I want to say a huge thanks to Cloudflare for helping with the bandwidth. I haven't written about it yet, but when I contacted them back in November, they managed to get my bandwidth sponsorship status approved in 48 hours over a Saturday. Moreover, they connected me with some of their best engineers to discuss how OpenFreeMap could use their architecture even better. I've never seen a company of their size move as agilely as they did.</p><p>As the sole person running OpenFreeMap, I'm incredibly proud of these two numbers. First, that my architecture hit a 99.4% CDN cache rate, which is fantastic for a service with weekly data updates. And second, that my own servers successfully handled the remaining 1,000 requests per second. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png" width="226" height="121.136" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:268,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:226,&quot;bytes&quot;:35267,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://blog.hyperknot.com/i/170530219?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ATGA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35b950cd-6da7-4bcc-bfd3-5c2835e071e2_500x268.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I managed to contact the dev behind Wplace.live.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An analysis of studies incorporating data from almost 30 million people has highlighted the role that air pollution – including that coming from car exhaust emissions – plays in increased risk of dementia.</p>
</div><div><p>Dementias such as Alzheimer's disease are estimated to affect more than 57.4 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to almost triple to 152.8 million cases by 2050. The impacts on the individuals, families and caregivers and society at large are immense.</p>

<p>While there are some indications that the prevalence of dementia is decreasing in Europe and North America, suggesting that it may be possible to reduce the risk of the disease at a population level, elsewhere the picture is less promising.</p>

<p>Air pollution has recently been identified as a risk factor for dementia, with several studies pointing the finger at a number of pollutants. However, the strength of evidence and ability to determine a causal effect has been varied.</p>

<p>In a paper published in The Lancet Planetary Health, a team led by researchers at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing scientific literature to examine this link further. This approach allowed them to bring together studies that on their own may not provide sufficient evidence, and which sometimes disagree with each other, to provide more robust overarching conclusions.</p>

<p>In total, the researchers included 51 studies, including data from more than 29 million participants who had been exposed to air pollutants for at least one year, mostly from high-income countries. Of these, 34 papers were included in the meta-analysis: 15 originated in North America, 10 in Europe, seven in Asia, and two in Australia.</p>

<p>The researchers found a positive and statistically-significant association between 3 types of air pollutant and dementia. These were:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)</strong>, a pollutant made up of tiny particles small enough that they can be inhaled deep into the lungs. These particles come from several sources, including vehicle emissions, power plants, industrial processes, wood burning stoves and fireplaces, and construction dust. They also form in the atmosphere because of complex chemical reactions involving other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The particles can stay in the air for a long time and travel a long way from where they were produced.</li>
	<li><strong>Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)</strong>, one of the key pollutants that arise from burning fossil fuels. It is found in vehicle exhaust, especially diesel exhaust, and industrial emissions, as well as those from gas stoves and heaters. Exposure to high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide can irritate the respiratory system, worsening and inducing conditions like asthma and reducing lung function.</li>
	<li><strong>Soot</strong>&nbsp;from sources such as vehicle exhaust emissions and burning wood. It can trap heat and affect the climate. When inhaled, it can penetrate deep into the lungs, aggravating respiratory diseases and increasing the risk of heart problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the researchers, for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, an individual’s relative risk of dementia would increase by 17%. The <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/media/105046/download">average roadside measurement for PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Central London in 2023</a> was 10 μg/m³.</p>

<p>For every 10 μg/m3 of NO2, the relative risk increased by 3%. The <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/media/105046/download">average roadside measurement for NO<sub>2</sub> in Central London in 2023</a> was 33 µg/m³.</p>

<p>For each 1 μg/m³ of soot as found in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the relative risk increased by 13%. Across the UK, <a href="https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/assets/documents/reports/cat05/2409260927_Airborne_Particle_Concentration_particle_numbers_black_carbon_in_UK.pdf">annual mean soot concentrations measured at select roadside locations in 2023</a> were 0.93 μg/m³ in London, 1.51 μg/m³ in Birmingham and 0.65 μg/m³ in Glasgow.</p>

<p>Senior author Dr Haneen Khreis from the MRC Epidemiology Unit said: “Epidemiological evidence plays a crucial role in allowing us to determine whether or not air pollution increases the risk of dementia and by how much. Our work provides further evidence to support the observation that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution is a risk factor for the onset of dementia in previously healthy adults.</p>

<p>“Tackling air pollution can deliver long-term health, social, climate, and economic benefits. It can reduce the immense burden on patients, families, and caregivers, while easing pressure on overstretched healthcare systems.”</p>

<p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how air pollution may cause dementia, primarily involving inflammation in the brain and oxidative stress (a chemical process in the body that can cause damage to cells, proteins, and DNA). Both oxidative stress and inflammation play a well-established role in the onset and progression of dementia. Air pollution is thought to trigger these processes through direct entry to the brain or via the same mechanisms underlying lung and cardiovascular diseases. Air pollution can also enter circulation from the lungs and travel to solid organs, initiating local and wide-spread&nbsp;inflammation.</p>

<p>The researchers point out that the majority of people included in the published studies were white and living in high-income countries, even though marginalised groups tend to have a higher exposure to air pollution. Given that studies have suggested that reducing air pollution exposure appears to be more beneficial at reducing the risk of early death for marginalised groups, they call for future work to urgently ensure better and more adequate representation across ethnicities and low- and middle-income countries and communities.</p>

<p>Joint first author Clare Rogowski, also from the MRC Epidemiology Unit, said: “Efforts to reduce exposure to these key pollutants are likely to help reduce the burden of dementia on society. Stricter limits for several pollutants are likely to be necessary targeting major contributors such as the transport and industry sectors. Given the extent of air pollution, there is an urgent need for regional, national, and international policy interventions to combat air pollution equitably.”</p>

<p>Further analysis revealed that while exposure to these pollutants increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease, the effect seemed stronger for vascular dementia, a type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. Around 180,000 people in the UK are thought to be affected by this type of dementia. However, as there were only a small number of studies that examined this difference, the researchers did not class it as statistically significant.</p>

<p>Joint first author Dr Christiaan Bredell from the University of Cambridge and North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust said: “These findings underscore the need for an interdisciplinary approach to dementia prevention. Preventing dementia is not just the responsibility of healthcare: this study strengthens the case that urban planning, transport policy, and environmental regulation all have a significant role to play.”</p>

<p>The research was funded by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and from the European Union’s Horizon Europe Framework Programme.</p>

<span>    <span>A</span>(<span>i32</span>),</span>
<span>    <span>B</span>(<span>i32</span>),</span>
<span>    C,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>Usually, you handle it like this:</p>

        <figure>
          <pre><code><span><span>match</span> u {</span>
<span>    U::<span>A</span>(_) =&gt; <span>handle_a</span>(),</span>
<span>    U::<span>B</span>(_) =&gt; <span>handle_b</span>(),</span>
<span>    U::C =&gt; <span>handle_c</span>(),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
          But once in a while, there’s common handling code you want to run for
          several variants. The most straightforward way is to duplicate:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <pre><code><span><span>match</span> u {</span>
<span>    U::<span>A</span>(_) =&gt; {</span>
<span>        <span>handle_ab</span>();</span>
<span>        <span>handle_a</span>();</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    U::<span>B</span>(_) =&gt; {</span>
<span>        <span>handle_ab</span>();</span>
<span>        <span>handle_b</span>();</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    U::C =&gt; <span>handle_c</span>(),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
          But this gets awkward if common parts are not easily extractable into
          function. The “proper” way to do this is to refactor the enum:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <pre><code><span><span>enum</span> <span>U</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>AB</span>(AB),</span>
<span>    C</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>enum</span> <span>AB</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>A</span>(<span>i32</span>),</span>
<span>    <span>B</span>(<span>i32</span>),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This gets <em>very</em> awkward if there’s one hundred usages of <code>U</code>, 95 of them look better with flat structure, one needs
          common code for ab case, and the four remaining need common code for
          ac.
        </p>
        <p>
          The universal recipe for solving the AB problem relies on a runtime
          panic:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <pre><code><span><span>match</span> u {</span>
<span>    U::<span>A</span>(_) | U::<span>B</span>(_) =&gt; {</span>
<span>        <span>handle_ab</span>();</span>
<span>        <span>match</span> u {</span>
<span>            U::<span>A</span>(_) =&gt; <span>handle_a</span>(),</span>
<span>            U::<span>B</span>(_) =&gt; <span>handle_b</span>(),</span>
<span>            _ =&gt; <span>unreachable!</span>(),</span>
<span>        }</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    U::C =&gt; <span>handle_c</span>(),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
          And… this is fine, really! I wrote code of this shape many times, and
          it never failed at runtime due to a misapplied refactor later. Still,
          every time I write that <code>unreachable</code>, I die inside a
          little. Surely there should be some way to explain to the compiler
          that <code>c</code> is really unreachable there? Well, as I realized
          an hour ago, in Zig, you can!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the awkward runtime-panicky and theoretically brittle version:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <pre><code><span><span>switch</span> (u) {</span>
<span>    .a, .b =&gt; <span>|</span>_, ab<span>|</span> {</span>
<span>        handle_ab();</span>
<span>        <span>switch</span> (ab) {</span>
<span>            .a =&gt; handle_a(),</span>
<span>            .b =&gt; handle_b(),</span>
<span>            <span>else</span> =&gt; <span>unreachable</span>,</span>
<span>        }</span>
<span>    },</span>
<span>    .c =&gt; handle_c(),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>And here’s a bullet-proof compiler-checked one:</p>

        <figure>
          <pre><code><span><span>const</span> U = <span>union</span>(<span>enum</span>) {</span>
<span>    a: <span>i32</span>,</span>
<span>    b: <span>i32</span>,</span>
<span>    c,</span>
<span>};</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> handle</span>(u: U) <span>void</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>switch</span> (u) {</span>
<span>        <span>inline</span> .a, .b =&gt; <span>|</span>_, ab<span>|</span> {</span>
<span>            handle_ab();</span>
<span>            <span>switch</span> (ab) {</span>
<span>                .a =&gt; handle_a(),</span>
<span>                .b =&gt; handle_b(),</span>
<span>                <span>else</span> =&gt; <span>comptime</span> <span>unreachable</span>,</span>
<span>            }</span>
<span>        },</span>
<span>        .c =&gt; handle_c(),</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> handle_ab</span>() <span>void</span> {}</span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> handle_a</span>() <span>void</span> {}</span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> handle_b</span>() <span>void</span> {}</span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> handle_c</span>() <span>void</span> {}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span><span> main</span>() <span>void</span> { handle(.c); }</span></code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
          There are two tricks here. <code>inline .a, .b</code> forces the
          compiler to generate the program twice, where <code>ab</code>
          is bound to <em>comptime</em> value. The second trick is <code>comptime unreachable</code>, which instructs the compiler to fail if
          it gets to the else branch. But, because <code>ab</code> is known at
          comptime, compiler knows that <code>else</code> is in fact
          unreachable, and doesn’t hit the error.
        </p>
        <p>Adding a bug fails compilation, as intended:</p>

        <figure>
          <pre><code><span>    <span>switch</span> (u) {</span>
<span>        <span>inline</span> .a, .b, .c =&gt; <span>|</span>_, ab<span>|</span> {</span>
<span>            handle_ab();</span>
<span>            <span>switch</span> (ab) {</span>
<span>                .a =&gt; handle_a(),</span>
<span>                .b =&gt; handle_b(),</span>
<span>                <span>else</span> =&gt; <span>comptime</span> <span>unreachable</span>,</span>
<span>            }</span>
<span>        },</span>
<span>    }</span></code></pre>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <pre><code><span><span>$</span> ./zig/zig build-exe partial-match.zig</span>
<span><span>partial-match.zig:14:34: error: reached unreachable code</span></span>
<span><span>                else =&gt; comptime unreachable,</span></span>
<span><span>                                 ^~~~~~~~~~~</span></span></code></pre>

      <p><strong>Sandstorm protects you.</strong> Each document, chat room, mail box, notebook, blog, or anything else you create is a "grain" in Sandstorm. Sandstorm containerizes each one in its own secure sandbox from which it cannot talk to the world without express permission. All your grains are private until you share them. The result is that 95% of security vulnerabilities are automatically mitigated.

11</strong><span>: openai's $3b acquisition of windsurf falls apart. after months of negotiations, they walk away.</span></p><p><strong>also thursday, july 11</strong><span>: google announces they're paying $2.4b to hire windsurf's ceo and 41 researchers for deepmind. not to acquire windsurf. just the humans. the same day openai walks. what a coincidence!</span></p><p><strong>friday afternoon</strong><span>: windsurf's founders—or what's left of them—make their first call to cognition. not "let's explore options." not "let's take our time." just: "you want a company?"</span></p><p><strong>monday morning</strong><span>: deal signed. cognition gets the entire business—$82m arr, 200+ employees, all the ip—for basically the loose change in reed hastings' couch.</span></p><p>so let's recap: google swoops in the exact moment openai bails, cherrypicks the leadership team for $2.4b, and leaves behind a headless $82m arr company like a half-eaten sandwich.</p><p>at $57 million per engineer, that's either the greatest talent arbitrage in history or the most expensive acquihire cope of all time.</p><p>the punchline? google's deal explicitly excluded the actual business. they looked at $82m of arr and said "nah, we're good."</p><p>when buyers are paying billions for your employees but won't touch your revenue with a ten-foot pole, you're not running a business—you're running an extremely expensive temp agency.</p><p>windsurf's ceo once let slip that their $10/month plan had "not much margin." this is like saying the titanic had "not much buoyancy."</p><p>the whisper network on twitter has been screaming about this for months:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://x.com/jsnnsa/status/1941306461402829189" rel="">@jsnnsa claims

that claude code charges $5/day ($150/month) as a "good proxy for how much those 'should' cost," you start to see the problem. cursor charges $20/month. windsurf charges $15/month. they're selling dollar bills for quarters.</span></p><p>based on the forensics:</p><ul><li><p>cursor: 50 employees, $42m/month revenue, but $53m/month implied burn</p></li><li><p>revenue per user: $20/month</p></li><li><p>api costs for power users: $80-200/month</p></li><li><p>margin on heavy users: -300% to -500%</p></li><li><p>every new customer makes the problem worse</p></li></ul><p>here's why this is a death spiral:</p><ul><li><p>you can't raise prices (claude code is your competition)</p></li><li><p>you can't cut costs (api bills are fixed)</p></li><li><p>you can't stop growing

summer of 2007</p><p>windsurf was behind and out of time, bear sterns in 2008. they needed either:</p><ul><li><p>api costs to drop 10x (not happening)</p></li><li><p>their models to beat anthropic

point, you don't have a margin problem—you have a margin call.</p><p><span>windsurf's fire sale proves what we've been avoiding: the coding part has no value capture — and claude code is coming. they're racing against irrelevance. </span><strong>and they're not alone</strong></p><p>bolt and replit aren't bleeding cash like cursor/windsurf—they're not subsidizing every api call. but they're sitting on a different time bomb:</p><ul><li><p>mediocre margins at best</p></li><li><p>users build an app then aren’t reliably going to do more stuff</p></li><li><p>claude code is coming for their lunch</p></li><li><p>their entire value prop evaporates the second anthropic decides to add a "deploy" button</p></li></ul><p>but here's the twist: at least we're not low-code tools, bc since i last wrote, the low-code apocalypse arrived:</p><ul><li><p><strong>figma</strong><span> launched text-to-ui</span></p></li><li><p><strong>retool</strong><span> released ai app builder</span></p></li><li><p><strong>airtable</strong><span> dropped their own "describe what you want" feature</span></p></li><li><p><strong>notion</strong><span> is pushing ai-powered app creation</span></p></li></ul><p>low-code ui builders are out. whatever the fuck this text-to-app paradigm is, it's in. squarespace and webflow announcements incoming in 3... 2... 1...</p><p>but these are if the coding layer is worthless, what isn't?</p><ul><li><p><strong>hosting infrastructure</strong><span>: netlify doesn't write code, but bolt drives massive traffic to it. when everyone's building apps with ai, someone still needs to host them. boring, profitable, sustainable. replit rolls this in house, notion has a light version of this.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>databases</strong><span>: supabase is laughing. every ai-generated app needs data storage. they don't care if you wrote the code or claude did. this is why turning their tables into databases, retool released hosted databases, and airtable is entering the space at all</span></p></li><li><p><strong>workflow automaton:</strong><span> running workloads on cron jobs with ec2 instances is very much still valuable — you see retool, zapier, and airtable also enter from that perspective</span></p></li><li><p><strong>seo optimization</strong><span>: webflow still owns this. lovable and bolt roadmaps are desperately trying to add seo features because that's where actual value lives, and notion has made some forrays</span></p></li><li><p><strong>basically all the services that low code platforms had to bulid out in the past</strong><span>, like auth / security / rbac / latency</span></p></li></ul><p>the infrastructure that manages code is still worth something — and at this point i’d say more of replit’s value is in being able to serve the code you make in it the way netlify does, than in bolt — bolt is more of a distribution engine for netlify where replit is bundling the whole thing together. if bolt can't figure out some defensible angle (maybe they carve out seo as a niche?), i might be writing them to zero.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-2796283269388226709" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>Recently the CEO of Github wrote a blog post called <a href="https://ashtom.github.io/developers-reinvented">Developers reinvented</a>. It was reposted with various clickbait headings like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/github-ceo-thomas-dohmke-warns-developers-embrace-ai-or-quit">GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke Warns Developers: "Either Embrace AI or Get Out of This Career"</a>&nbsp;(that one feels like an LLM generated summary of the actual post, which would be ironic if it wasn't awful). To my great misfortune I read both of these. Even if we ignore whether AI is useful or not, the writings contain some of the absolute worst reasoning and stretched logical leaps I have seen in years, maybe decades. If you are ever in the need of finding out how not to write a "scientific" text on any given subject, this is the disaster area for you.</p><p>But before we begin, a detour to the east.</p><h2>Statistics and the Soviet Union</h2><p>One of the great wonders of statistical science of the previous century was without a doubt the Soviet Union. They managed to invent and perfect dozens of ways to turn data to your liking, no matter the reality. Almost every official statistic issued by USSR was a lie. Most people know this. But even most of those do not grasp <i>just how much</i> the stats differed from reality. I sure didn't until I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39679779-empire-of-the-absurd">this book</a>. Let's look at some examples.</p><h2>Only ever report percentages</h2><p>The USSR's glorious statistics tended to be of the type "manufacturing of shoes grew over 600% this five year period". That certainly sounds a lot better than "In the last five years our factory made 700 pairs of shoes as opposed to 100" or even "7 shoes instead of 1". If you are really forward thinking, you can even cut down shoe production on those five year periods when you are not being measured. It makes the stats even more impressive, even though in reality many people have no shoes at all.</p><p>The USSR classified the real numbers as state secrets because the truth would have made them look bad. If a corporation only gives you percentages, they may be doing the same thing. Apply skepticism as needed.</p><h2>Creative comparisons</h2><p>The previous section said the manufacturing of shoes has grown. Can you tell what it is not saying? That's right, growth over what? It is implied that the comparison is to the previous five year plan. But it is not. Apparently a common comparison in these cases was the production amounts of the year 1913. This "best practice" was not only used in the early part of the 1900s, it was used far into the 1980s.</p><p>Some of you might wonder why 1913 and not 1916, which was the last year before the bolsheviks took over? Simply because that was the century's worst year for Russia as a whole. So if you encounter a claim that "car manufacturing was up 3700%" some year in 1980s Soviet Union, now you know what that actually meant.</p><h2>"Better" measurements</h2><p>According to official propaganda, the USSR was the world's leading country in wheat production. In this case they even listed out the production in absolute tonnes. In reality it was all fake. The established way of measuring wheat yields is to measure the "dry weight", that is, the mass of final processed grains. When it became apparent that the USSR could not compete with imperial scum, they changed their measurements to "wet weight". This included the mass of <i>everything</i> that came out from the nozzle of a harvester, such as stalks, rats, mud, rain water, dissidents and so on.</p><p>Some people outside the iron curtain even believed those numbers. Add your own analogy between those people and modern VC investors here.</p><h2>To business then</h2><p>The actual blog post starts with this thing that can be considered a picture.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnvKIDpXIXw4sobIuJol13Nyvo2k3lS465_e8v-HNDYAR0pMz653j2pKgenz8pJodfFpqdJaAT-N68z-M_REejgPWmv9z0j87EqFsQ6prRY_u8AezZKHjpvbvXvMx2fgOd3B9HqUeIumtRiaZFDRZJwERKKr0Q-zHq83XD6T2nrPbo1VwyTLPlBqzg01Q/s720/reinvented.png"><img data-original-height="480" data-original-width="720" height="213" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnvKIDpXIXw4sobIuJol13Nyvo2k3lS465_e8v-HNDYAR0pMz653j2pKgenz8pJodfFpqdJaAT-N68z-M_REejgPWmv9z0j87EqFsQ6prRY_u8AezZKHjpvbvXvMx2fgOd3B9HqUeIumtRiaZFDRZJwERKKr0Q-zHq83XD6T2nrPbo1VwyTLPlBqzg01Q/s320/reinvented.png" width="320"></a></p><p>What message would this choice of image tell about the person using it in their blog post?</p><ol><li>Said person does not have sufficient technical understanding to grasp the fact that children's toy blocks should, in fact, be affected by gravity (or that perspective is a thing, but we'll let that pass).</li><li>Said person does not give a shit about whether things are correct or could even work, as long as they look "somewhat plausible".</li></ol><p>Are these the sort of traits a person in charge of <i>the largest software development platform on Earth</i>&nbsp;should have? No, they are not.</p><p>To add insult to injury, the image seems to have been created with the Studio Ghibli image generator, which Hayao Miyazaki described as an abomination on art itself. Cultural misappropriation is high on the list of core values at Github HQ it seems.</p><p>With that let's move on to the actual content, which is this post from Twitter (to quote Matthew Garrett, I will respect their name change once Elon Musk starts respecting his child's).</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt9Ybd7z0kDtsXvmnc398YA5WEL1wzhJm7zvZMY8N68ms8UfUBkIvrz0upLIlZzPAAYytcOyE84bEoCCFA_lxafqrOTDKpGZtQD9IqYeIZsBgj_F_YBCtW6MEsZsfemMvAb4B2shrZHywPf5da8cyB3MYuYJF4EcFhqu_1j4nAhvanCQPi4fE5Is7mNCg/s808/evidence.png"><img data-original-height="403" data-original-width="808" height="160" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt9Ybd7z0kDtsXvmnc398YA5WEL1wzhJm7zvZMY8N68ms8UfUBkIvrz0upLIlZzPAAYytcOyE84bEoCCFA_lxafqrOTDKpGZtQD9IqYeIZsBgj_F_YBCtW6MEsZsfemMvAb4B2shrZHywPf5da8cyB3MYuYJF4EcFhqu_1j4nAhvanCQPi4fE5Is7mNCg/s320/evidence.png" width="320"></a></p><p>Oh, wow! A field study. That makes things clear. With evidence and all! How can we possibly argue against that?</p><p>Easily. As with a child.</p><p>Let's look at this "study" (and I'm using the word in its loosest possible term here) and its details with an actual critical eye. The first thing is statistical representativeness. The sample size is 22. According to <a href="http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html">this sample size calculator</a> I found, a required sample size for just one thousand people would be 278, but, you know, one order of magnitude one way or another, who cares about those? Certainly not business big shot movers and shakers. Like Stockton Rush for example.</p><p>The math above assumes an unbiased sampling. The post does not even attempt to answer whether that is the case. It would mean getting answers to questions like:</p><ul><li>How were the 22 people chosen?</li><li>How many different companies, skill levels, nationalities, genders, age groups etc were represented?</li><li>Did they have any personal financial incentive on making their new AI tools look good?</li><li>Were they under any sort of duress to produce the "correct" answers?</li><li>What was/were the exact phrase(s) that was asked?</li><li>Were they the same for all participants?</li><li>Was the test run multiple times until it produced the desired result?</li></ul><p>The latter is an age old trick where you run a test with random results over and over on small groups. Eventually you will get a run that points the way you want. Then you drop the earlier measurements and publish the last one. In "the circles" this is known as <i>data set selection</i>.</p><p>Just to be sure, I'm <i>not</i> saying that is what they did. But if someone drove a dump truck full of money to my house and asked me to create a "study" that produced these results, that is exactly how I would&nbsp;do it. (I would not actually do it because I have a spine.)</p><p>Moving on. The main headline grabber is "Either you embrace AI or get out of this career". If you actually read the post (I know), what you find is that this is actually a quote from one of the participants. It's a bit difficult to decipher from the phrasing but my reading is that this is not a grandstanding hurrah of all things AI, but more of a "I guess this is something I'll have to get used to" kind of submission. That is not evidence, certainly not of the clear type. It is an opinion.</p><p>The post then goes on a buzzwordsalad tour of statements that range from the incomprehensible to the puzzling. Perhaps the weirdest is this nugget on education:</p><blockquote><p>Teaching [programming] in a way that evaluates rote syntax or memorization of APIs is becoming obsolete.</p></blockquote><p>It is not "becoming obsolete". It has been considered the wrong thing to do for as long as computer science has existed. Learning the syntax of most programming languages takes a few lessons, the rest of the semester is spent on actually using the language to solve problems. Any curriculum not doing that is just plain bad. Even worse than CS education in Russia in 1913.</p><p>You might also ponder that if the author is <i>so</i> out of touch with reality in this simple issue, how completely off base the rest of his statements might be. In fact the statement is so wrong at such a fundamental level that it has probably been generated with an LLM.</p><h2>A magician's shuffle</h2><p>As nonsensical as the Twitter post is, we have not yet even mentioned the biggest misdirection in it. You might not even have noticed it yet. I certainly did not until I read the actual post. Try if you can spot it.</p><p>Ready? Let's go.</p><p>The actual fruit of this "study" boils down to this snippet.</p><blockquote><p>Developers rarely mentioned “time saved” as the core benefit of working in this new way with agents. They were all about increasing ambition.</p></blockquote><p>Let that sink in. For the last several years the main supposed advantage of AI tools has been the fact that they save massive amounts of developer time. This has lead to the "fire all your developers and replace them with AI bots" trend sweeping the nation. Now even this AI advertisement of a "study" can not find any such advantages and starts backpedaling into something completely different. Just like we have always been at war with Eastasia, AI has never been about "productivity". No. No. It is all about "increased ambition", whatever that is. The post then carries on with this even more baffling statement.</p><blockquote><p>When you move from thinking about reducing effort to expanding scope, only the most advanced agentic capabilities will do.</p></blockquote><p>Really? Only the most advanced agentics you say? That is a bold statement to make given that the leading reason for software project failure is scope creep. This is the one area where human beings have decades long track record for beating any artificial system. Even if machines were able to do it better, "Make your project failures more probable! Faster! Spectacularer!" is a tough rallying cry to sell.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;To conclude, the actual findings of this "study" seem to be that:</p><ol><li>AI does not improve developer productivity or skills</li><li>AI does increase developer ambition</li></ol><p>This is strictly worse than the current state of affairs.

          <p>We’ve started delivering search results from our new European-based search index to Ecosia users! This will help us build the kind of ethical and fair internet we believe in.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year <a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/eusp/"><u>we launched European Search Perspective (EUSP)</u></a>, a joint venture with Qwant. The launch marked a big step forward in our journey towards tech independence and digital sovereignty for Europe.</p><p>Now, we’ve taken the next step: our users in France are receiving a portion of their search results directly from EUSP’s own index. We’re aiming to serve 50% of French search queries by the end of the year, and will soon start rolling out to other countries.</p><h3 id="what-does-having-an-independent-search-index-mean"><strong>What does having an independent search index mean?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>A search index is the database of information that search engines pull their results from. Until now, only a handful of companies have built their own – which means most smaller search engines have to depend on them to provide search results.</p><p>That’s why EUSP has developed <a href="https://staan.ai/"><u>Staan</u></a> (Search Trusted API Access Network), a search index aimed to support a sovereign, privacy-first search infrastructure for Europe. It’s built for alternative search engines and AI companies that need fast, reliable access to the latest web data, while safeguarding user privacy and data security.</p><p>By using Staan as one of our sources, we can start to build greater digital independence and transparency.</p><h3 id="why-is-this-independence-important"><strong>Why is this independence important?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Having our own search infrastructure is a critical step towards plurality; a healthy and diverse search market reflecting multiple perspectives, and building Europe’s own digital tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of Europe’s search, cloud, and AI layers are built on American Big Tech stacks, which puts whole sectors at the mercy of political or commercial agendas. To put it bluntly: if Big Tech decided to pull the plug, Europe would be in trouble.</p><p>Creating a fully independent search index means we have more control. We can better serve our users, develop ethical AI, and double down on our mission to build tech that benefits people and the planet.</p><h3 id="an-open-foundation-for-competition-privacy-and-innovation"><strong>An open foundation for competition, privacy and innovation</strong></h3><p>Unlike Ecosia’s steward-owned model, EUSP is structured to allow outside investment –&nbsp; enabling long-term scaling of its infrastructure. EUSP’s search index is also available to other tech companies, offering a foundation for competition, data privacy, and innovation in areas like generative AI.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="what-does-all-this-mean-for-you"><strong>What does all this mean for you?</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>At first, you probably won’t notice much change when using Ecosia – this update is behind the scenes. But when we look at the bigger picture, it’s a meaningful step that helps you keep growing your climate impact.&nbsp;</p><p>How? Because it strengthens Europe’s long-term competitiveness, democratic control, and stability. If we have more autonomy over our own tools, we can focus on shaping the greener, fairer tech future we want, and continue expanding our mission to tackle the climate crisis, together.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we started building a durable workflows library, the most critical architectural decision we faced was what data store to use for workflow metadata. The core durable workflow operations are simple–checkpointing workflow state and recovering an interrupted workflow from its latest checkpoint. Almost any data store can handle these operations, but choosing the right one is critical to ensure workflows are scalable and performant.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll dive deep into why we chose to build on Postgres. While there are good nontechnical reasons for the decision (Postgres is popular and open-source with a vibrant community and over 40 years of battle-testing), we’ll focus on the technical reasons–key Postgres features that make it easier to develop a robust and performant workflows library. In particular, we’ll look at:</p><ol role="list"><li>How Postgres concurrency control (particularly its support for locking clauses) enable scalable distributed queues.</li><li>How the relational data model (plus careful use of secondary indexes) enables performant observability tooling over workflow metadata.</li><li>How Postgres transactions enable exactly-once execution guarantees for steps performing database operations.</li></ol><h2>Building Scalable Queues</h2><p>It’s often useful to enqueue durable workflows for later execution. However, using a database table as a queue is tricky because of the risk of contention. To see why that’s a problem, let’s look at how database-backed queues work.&nbsp;</p><p>In a database-backed workflow queue, clients enqueue workflows by adding them to a queues table, and workers dequeue and process the oldest enqueued workflows (assuming a FIFO queue). Naively, each worker runs a query like this to find the N oldest enqueued workflows, then dequeues them:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894e8dd31d1c21c43fb9ad1_AD_4nXfg9qKIxkxY5Zpo2Pw14wum0vuFrq6lzvMCf5NrauJaXHJa5EeaL-sfyD7tYE3OcV8oASA4utitnDGTaNVcTGegQswZQZpOLHhMnsg5D6cTq9kgIDSKsMYsbyd9z2qN19KHpbIr-Q.png" loading="lazy" alt="SQL query to retrieve tasks from durable queues"></p></figure><p>The problem is that if you have many workers concurrently pulling new tasks from the queue, they all try to dequeue the same workflows. However, each workflow can only be dequeued by a single worker, so most workers will fail to find new work and have to try again. If there are enough workers, this contention creates a bottleneck in the system, limiting how rapidly tasks can be dequeued.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894f405ac7da4fd1c11f336_Storing-workflow-state-in-Postgres.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Fortunately, Postgres provides a solution: locking clauses. Here's an example of a query using them:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894e8dd8c41c852c7e0f674_AD_4nXf0B0MCzqgtonGjb9BPutnuYHkD9zI0tmlhrzb2zRj9PowCICOPJI5E84haepmjmUVWaANmwaoSWCXfaa9Pb_RVe-kQ-95z2yqs5Z9Qyz3gpqG06_kqTzxl5V5ykg3X1xuFgyQVtQ.png" loading="lazy" alt="Postgres SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED query example"></p></figure><p>Selecting rows in this way does two things. First, it locks the rows so that other workers cannot also select them. Second, it skips rows that are already locked, selecting not the N oldest enqueued workflows, but the N oldest enqueued workflows <strong>that are not already locked by another worker</strong>. That way, many workers can concurrently pull new workflows <strong>without contention</strong>. One worker selects the oldest N workflows and locks them, the second worker selects the next oldest N workflows and locks those, and so on.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894f3e5aa45514af18ed1f7_Postgres-durable-execution-database.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Thus, by greatly reducing contention, Postgres enables a durable workflow system to process tens of thousands of workflows per second across thousands of workers.</p><h2>Making Workflows Observable</h2><p>One benefit of durable workflows is that they provide built-in observability. If every step in every workflow is checkpointed to a durable store, you can scan those checkpoints to monitor workflows in real time and to visualize workflow execution. For example, a workflow dashboard can show you every workflow that ran in the last hour, or every workflow that errored in the past month:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894e8dd8c41c852c7e0f67d_AD_4nXcEfN3ZxPtX1f1DoZrSXUR5yy7Q-Hjh_37L1oS8JNtIiNX6Syk2V4YPXZ-Nvero9EigvvqOmuUfqPkCM5YM1caCJifOHGjP6InqJkYu8pWbQ5dF9uS8ynZznzlvJhFwoXcN0g0JOQ.png" loading="lazy" alt="Observing durable workflow history"></p></figure><p>To implement observability, you need to be able to run performant queries over workflow metadata. Postgres excels for this because virtually any workflow observability query can be easily expressed in SQL. For example, here’s a query to find all workflows that errored in the last month.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894e8dd8c41c852c7e0f671_AD_4nXfFo1KTBYl86FzIfe6IIkKUDFm9Wxex-Z4hl1bD1z2kQHGKzNQfzwnpPYFmZ6rKL0suFvafIb0fW-UadctI9yQryoJcHUEpjcCX4azVuQxV0mS3mTHKHWw_5tNmQ9XirIjx5py5ag.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example SQL query to retrieve durable workflow status"></p></figure><p>These queries might seem obvious, but it's impossible to overstate how powerful this is. It's only possible because Postgres's relational model allows you to express complex filtering and analytical operations declaratively in SQL, leveraging decades of query optimization research. Many popular systems with simpler data models, such as key-value stores, have no such support.</p><p>Postgres also provides the tools to make these observability queries performant at scale (&gt;10M workflows): secondary indexes. Secondary indexes allow Postgres to rapidly find all workflows that have a particular attribute or range of attributes. They’re expensive to construct and maintain, so they have to be used carefully: you can’t index every workflow attribute without adding prohibitive overhead.</p><p>To strike a balance between query performance and runtime overhead, we added secondary indexes to a small number of fields that are the most selective in frequently run queries. Because most workflow observability queries are time-based (typically a dashboard displaying all workflows in a time range), the most important index is on the created_at column. We additionally added indexes to two other attributes that are frequently searched without specifying a time range: executor_id (users often want to find all workflows that ran on a given server) and status (users frequently want to find all workflows that ever errored).</p><p>‍</p><h2>Implementing Exactly-Once Semantics</h2><p>Typically, durable workflows guarantee that steps execute <strong>at least once</strong>. The way it works is that after each step completes, its outcome is checkpointed in a data store:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894e8dd8c41c852c7e0f664_AD_4nXfKuFmryR-dSWb6SVWe0gUvn9dR-htEefBDMaN12rcS-Or0Xf15vJvXSopkDn9eRMfY6W9qzNesrHuRuY-9JAXqZN8rqPLIxhpd1IniuTT32eTxo6OEgdMPvIKTqG7jD1YJTEkEDg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Durable workflow checkpointing diagram"></p></figure><p>If the program fails, upon restart the workflow looks up its latest checkpoint and resumes from its last completed step. This means that if a workflow fails while executing a step, the step may execute twice–once before the failure, then again after the workflow recovers from the failure. Because steps may be executed multiple times, they should be idempotent or otherwise resilient to re-execution.</p><p>By building durable workflows on Postgres, we can do better and guarantee that steps execute <strong>exactly once</strong>–if those steps perform database operations. To do this, we leverage Postgres transactions. The trick is to execute the entire step in a single database transaction, and to “piggyback” the step checkpoint as part of the transaction. That way, if the workflow fails while the step is executing, the entire transaction is rolled back and nothing happens. But if the workflow fails after the transaction commits, the step checkpoint is already written so the step is not re-executed.</p><p>For example, let’s say a step inserts a record into a database table</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894e8dd8c41c852c7e0f66a_AD_4nXfYy-7kyUOTTm5MKv3i0RmtsPJDd4uBn3t3rybq91mErk3aJ7R31gFu3EuOx-Zidu0SV8UJcEV7cQH0C-ohlCYd5F9GofbMjgh7xz22_nK2dlkkc4Fjv8DOw6-vzdfBn2qYWiUegg.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This step isn’t idempotent, so executing it twice would be bad–the order would be inserted into the table twice. However, because the step consists solely of a database operation, we can perform the step and checkpoint its outcome in the same transaction, like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672411cbf038560468c9e68f/6894e8dd8c41c852c7e0f6bf_AD_4nXdc2Acac_XJH2Mmoxu1umX0YJ1ibdOm1lP4HeQzGswhiRkMBiIz0LyZDFqsMEyTtjTxKcxtih3RLac43cW6INe82s0kPSwx6FpxkKvHMdw_PmB4jixFOziDtOsiP6XQ2HxolF-a6w.png" loading="lazy" alt="example of an idempotent step in a durable workflow"></p></figure><p>Thus, the step either fully completes or commits (including its checkpoint) or fails and completely rolls back–the step is guaranteed to execute <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p><h2>Learn More</h2><p>If you like hacking with Postgres, we’d love to hear from you.

<p>The following is a statement from acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy on the passing of famed Apollo astronaut Jim Lovell. He passed away Aug. 7, in Lake Forest, Illinois. He was 97 years old.</p>
<p>“NASA sends its condolences to the family of Capt. Jim Lovell, whose life and work inspired millions of people across the decades. Jim’s character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount. We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.</p>
<p>“From a pair of pioneering Gemini missions to the successes of Apollo, Jim helped our nation forge a historic path in space that carries us forward to upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and beyond.</p>
<p>“As the Command Module Pilot for Apollo 8, Jim and his crewmates became the first to lift off on a Saturn V rocket and orbit the Moon, proving that the lunar landing was within our reach. As commander of the Apollo 13 mission, his calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions.</p>
<p>“Known for his wit, this unforgettable astronaut was nicknamed Smilin’ Jim by his fellow astronauts because he was quick with a grin when he had a particularly funny comeback.</p>
<p>“Jim also served our country in the military, and the Navy has lost a proud academy graduate and test pilot. Jim Lovell embodied the bold resolve and optimism of both past and future explorers, and we will remember him always.”</p>

Updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models are now planned for the first half of 2026.</p>

Apple is now said to be "internally targeting" a launch early next year.</p>
<p>The current M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max ‌MacBook Pro‌ models were announced in October 2024 and released in November 2024, so pushing the M5 models back to 2026 would see Apple skipping a yearly refresh. It is typical for new Macs to come out in October or November after the September <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> event.</p>
<p>Gurman does not give a reason why Apple is potentially "delaying" the launch of the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models, but he says the timing is fluid, so there may still be a chance that we get the new Macs before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models will have few changes beyond the M5 chip update, because Apple is planning for bigger changes in for the M6 ‌MacBook Pro‌. The next ‌MacBook Pro‌ models are expected to transition to OLED displays and new case designs. Rumors have suggested the OLED ‌MacBook Pro‌ would come in 2026, but if Apple is planning to launch the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models in 2026, that might mean the OLED model will be pushed to 2027. Alternatively, Apple could debut the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ in early 2026 and the OLED version in late 2026, but that would be unusual.</p>
<p>Apple is also planning to release M5 ‌MacBook Air‌ models in 2026, which will replace the current M4 models. Other rumors suggest Apple is working on a MacBook that has an A18 Pro chip in it for 2026, but Gurman didn't mention it. </p>
<p>The M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ and ‌MacBook Air‌ models could be accompanied by a new display that Apple has in the works. Apple is developing an external monitor that is expected to be a follow up to the 2022 Studio Display. It is expected to launch in early 2026.</p>
