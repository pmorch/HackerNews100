<p>In 2020, I built my first side project. I <em>scratched my own itch</em>, then started selling it, and since then, the project has earned me over $15,000. But a few months after releasing it, I was so tired of the maintenance that I wanted to shut it down. Here is a story about my short entrepreneurial adventure.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the second part of 2020, I had some spare time. I just finished a project for a client, and I've decided to dedicate a few months to making a <a href="https://modernpythonprojects.com/">Python course</a> – just to try something new. At the same time, I became interested in using technical analysis to trade stocks. Following one of the "internet investment gurus" (yes, I know how bad it sounds), I started day-trading stocks following some "mystical knowledge" on how to leverage price formation called "harmonic patterns" to figure out when to buy or sell (look, I'm sorry, I also cringe when I write those words).</p>
<p>Like many <s>traders</s> investors, I was using <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/">TradingView</a>, the most popular free platform for technical analysis. Compared to the tools offered by stock brokers at that time, TradingView was far superior with its user-friendly web interface and a plethora of tools. You could even write your own scripts using an abomination of a scripting language called PineScript to implement all sorts of additional tools, graphs, and metrics for your charts.</p>
<p>But there was no script that would draw harmonic patterns for me, and after a few days of drawing them manually, I got tired and decided to automate the process. It took me a few weeks to learn the language and implement a script to automatically draw harmonic patterns on the chart. The script significantly decreased the time I had to spend searching for stocks to trade. Then, I wrote another script - one that was drawing potential future patterns.</p>
<p><em>Great! If those scripts work for me, maybe someone will pay money to use them too.</em> After all, the idea of harmonic patterns wasn't new – the earliest harmonic pattern, the "Gartley Pattern", was first described in 1935. There are books, articles, and videos on this topic, so for sure, I wasn't the only one using them.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, TradingView supports selling access to scripts, although in a slightly convoluted way. With the most expensive subscription, if you publish your script with "invite only" access, you can control which users can use it. So, I bought that subscription and created a landing page connected to Gumroad to accept payments for monthly and yearly subscriptions.</p>

<p>Now, I needed to find a way to tell TradingView's users about my scripts, as those "invite only" scripts are not easy to find. TradingView doesn't promote them in the search results; instead, it prioritizes free-to-use scripts with publicly available source code. And even if someone found my scripts or my website, I needed to convince them that my scripts are useful and do what they are supposed to do. Even though I offered a 14-day money-back guarantee on any subscription, people were reluctant to give their credit card details on some random website.</p>
<p>So, I've created a couple of smaller scripts by reusing large chunks of code from the existing scripts. Their source code was still hidden, but people could use the scripts for free - with limited functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>you could find only some types of price formations</li>
<li>there was a limit to how many past days you could check</li>
<li>there were no automatic notifications when a new pattern appeared</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, people liked them and started using them. When they asked about missing features like the notifications or detecting more patterns, I directed them to the paid scripts.</p>
<p>Then, I published some "ideas" on TradingView - screenshots of popular stocks with drawings of the existing and potential future harmonic patterns generated with my scripts. Finally, I created a YouTube channel where I published videos showing all the features of my scripts (this was partially so I didn't have to explain over and over again how they work).</p>
<p>And I started waiting for the cash to roll in.</p>
<p>Nothing happened for the first two weeks, but then I got my first sale! Someone bought access to one of the scripts for a month. For the first time in my life, I got paid for selling something on the internet. It felt amazing! Later, they requested a refund because they didn't find the script helpful, but to this day, I clearly remember the excitement of laying on the sofa in the evening and getting an email from Gumroad saying, "Hey, someone just paid you $9 for the thing you've built".</p>

<figcaption>The first sale felt more rewarding than any other that followed, although hitting a $1,000 revenue per month was also a nice milestone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Slowly, more people started using my free scripts, and some also bought the paid ones. To strike while the iron was still hot, I posted a message saying that anyone interested can leave a comment under the paid scripts, and I will give them a free 1-week trial. So people started doing that, and each time, I would log in to TradingView and manually grant them access for a week. Some of those trials turned into paid subscriptions, but most didn't. Slowly but steadily, the number of subscribers started increasing.</p>

<p>As more people used my scripts, I started getting more emails with questions and requests for new features. Many of the emails contained requests for free access to the scripts. Others had very basic questions, answers to which were given in the description of each script.</p>
<p>Some people wanted to buy the source code:

<p>There were people requesting that I add some very specific features because someone they watched on YouTube recommended it.

<p>Quite a few folks were asking for some "hot tips" on how to trade <em>something</em> or if that <em>something</em> was going to go up or down (almost always, this <em>something</em> was cryptocurrencies or forex).

<p>Even worse, sometimes such requests were accompanied by a backstory like "I'm a poor student and want to make some money" or "I've lost some money trading, but your script looks very cool, and I will use it to make money back". Why on earth would you bet your money on some random tool you don't even understand? And then ask some random stranger on the internet for financial advice?! This was sad. I built a tool for people who knew what harmonic patterns were. People who had an investment strategy and only needed a tool to automate the drawing of the charts that they would normally draw by hand. Not some gung-ho <em>investors</em> whose entire investment strategy consists of "this random script I found five minutes ago says that stock X will go up, so I buy."</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would get a job offer. Yay! For writing PineScript for a living. Nay!</p>

<h3 id="disputes" tabindex="-1">Disputes </h3>
<p>Sometimes, people would open a "dispute". A dispute means someone complained to PayPal that their credit card was wrongfully charged and then it's up to PayPal to decide if they are right (and refund them the full amount of money + charge me additional $20 for "chargeback fees") or if they are not (then I get to keep the payment).</p>
<p>In general, I try to be as accommodating to customers as possible. I'm selling software, so unlike with a physical product, I have unlimited stock of my products; producing new copies costs me nothing, and I don't have costs related to handling shipments or returns. So if someone writes to me and asks, "Hey, I forgot to cancel my subscription, and it renewed for another month", or "It's past the 14-day money-back guarantee, but it turns out that the script is not useful for me", I give them their money back. I want to be nice to people. I started selling those tools to help others. I don't want to charge them for a product they don't like.</p>
<p>But I also don't want people to open disputes. If you have too many disputes, you risk that PayPal will freeze your account.</p>
<p>Sometimes, being nice to people is not enough. Especially if you don't get a chance to show your goodwill because you're sleeping. My first dispute came from a customer who sent me a message in the middle of the night asking how to cancel their subscription and, half an hour later, proceeded to open a dispute. Even though all they had to do was check the emails from Gumroad that contained a link to manage their subscription. And those are short emails with a few lines of text, so it's not that the link is hidden somewhere - at least other people who wanted to cancel their subscription managed to find it. Or they could at least send me an email without opening a dispute right away.</p>
<p>Luckily, after I explained that I could (and wanted to) refund their payment, provided they closed the dispute first, the customer cooperated with me. So we closed the dispute, and shortly afterwards, they got their money back.</p>
<p>A few more disputes happened throughout the years but were less thrilling. Usually, someone would open a dispute through PayPal, not answer my messages (or PayPal's), and then PayPal would dismiss that dispute as unfounded.</p>
<h3 id="and-yes-fraud" tabindex="-1">And yes, fraud </h3>
<p>Being polite and accommodating will take you a long way and make your online interactions much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>It also means that, at some point, someone will try to take advantage of you.</p>
<p>For me, it happened three times. Most of the time, someone tried using a stolen credit card, but Gumroad caught that and cancelled the payment. But the first time a fraud happened, it caught me a bit off guard. I don't have many screenshots left because that person deleted their TradingView account, but here's how it went.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Scammer (that's not his real name 😉) asked for free access to the script. That's not uncommon - sometimes, people send me requests like that. When I kindly but firmly denied his request, he tried to pay, but his payment was declined with a message saying he should contact Gumroad. Again, this didn't sound like a red flag, more like a technical issue. Eventually, I got a confirmation email that he had paid for the subscription.</p>
<p>Two months later, a "sale has been disputed" email dropped. The dispute was initiated by Mr. Scammer. I asked him why he initiated the dispute because he never mentioned wanting to cancel his subscription or getting a refund. This is when things started to be very fishy:</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-250.webp 250w, https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-473.webp 473w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) calc(100vw - 32px), (max-width: 767px) 608px, (max-width: 960px) calc(100vw - 40px), 920px"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-250.jpeg 250w, https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-473.jpeg 473w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) calc(100vw - 32px), (max-width: 767px) 608px, (max-width: 960px) calc(100vw - 40px), 920px"><img alt="Screenshot of me asking the scammer about the dispute" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-250.jpeg" width="473" height="400"></picture></p>
<p>Weird grammar errors were not a red flag. They are common in emails I get from existing and potential customers, so it doesn't automatically mean an email is a scam. But a story of your wife controlling the finances and you forgetting to tell her about buying a script for TradingView, which made her open a dispute? That's even weirder than the "I'm a student who can't afford $15, but I <em>really</em> need this script for my day-trading" emails I sometimes get.</p>
<p>While waiting for the dispute to be resolved, Mr. Scammer tried to buy the subscription one more time, this time with less success:
<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-250.webp 250w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-600.webp 600w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-920.webp 920w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-1228.webp 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) calc(100vw - 32px), (max-width: 767px) 608px, (max-width: 960px) calc(100vw - 40px), 920px"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-250.jpeg 250w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-600.jpeg 600w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-920.jpeg 920w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-1228.jpeg 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) calc(100vw - 32px), (max-width: 767px) 608px, (max-width: 960px) calc(100vw - 40px), 920px"><img alt="Email about fraud attempt from Mr. Scammer" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-250.jpeg" width="1228" height="1065"></picture></p>
<p>So, was his "wife" not only controlling the finances but also using stolen credit cards? I wrote him that he's permanently banned from buying any scripts from me, and the next time he tries, I will immediately revoke his access. That stopped any further attempts.</p>
<p>That was the most interesting case of fraud. Usually, when people got caught, they ignored my messages instead of coming up with a creative story:

<h3 id="burn-out" tabindex="-1">Burn out </h3>
<p>Answering emails and checking TradingView comments to give out trial access took a bit of time every day. Not much, but I tried to answer at least every day. It was a minor annoyance when I wasn't working full-time. But when I had to do this after a full day of work, and I got yet another email asking to add some <em>magical</em> method for determining take profit levels that was invented by a crypto-trading YouTuber with 50 followers<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, I had enough.</p>
<p>The worst part was that after a few months, I wasn't even using those scripts anymore. I had fun day trading when I wasn't working full-time. It was a nice break from recording videos and a motivation to learn about financial markets. But when a new contract started, I stopped day trading due to the lack of time.</p>
<p>But I still had existing customers that I needed to take care of and potential new customers asking me all sorts of questions. I was growing tired of maintaining this project. Sometimes, I would spend an hour answering many detailed questions from a potential customer only to never hear back from them. At times, someone would leave a 1-star review on Gumroad because I didn't want to add some weird functionality they requested. On days like that, I wanted to close down this project, refund the money to the existing clients, and delete my TradingView account.</p>
<p>Still, the project was bringing in a bit of money every month. I didn't want to kill the goose that laid tiny golden eggs. So, I've decided that I'm going to sell my "goose".</p>
<h2 id="selling-my-project-well-trying-to" tabindex="-1">Selling my project. Well, trying to... </h2>
<p>I looked for platforms where I could list my project for sale. I found a few and decided to submit an ad to <a href="https://indiemaker.co/">IndieMaker</a> and <a href="https://transferslot.com/">Transferslot</a> (which looked much more active three years ago). I prepared a detailed description of the project and shared details like the number of views on my YouTube channel, unique visitors to the website, the number of followers and subscribers on various platforms, and, of course, the revenue. I even shared some ideas on how to move this project forward. For example, getting one of the free scripts promoted in the weekly TradingView newsletter could accelerate the sales of paid scripts.</p>
<p>Then, following some random advice on the internet, I came up with a number to ask for that was around 5x the revenue from last year. I then sent my ad for publication.</p>
<p>IndieMaker published my ad, and shortly after, I received an inquiry from a potential buyer. But after answering questions about the Monthly Recurring Revenue growth and what assets come with the project, there was no follow-up. I got more messages later, but those were just spam ("Hey, I'm interested in your project, send us a list of your inventory"). Transferslot never published my ad. I think the website was already abandoned when I submitted it.</p>
<p>If you have any experience selling projects online (and if you don't, <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/selling_software_business">this article</a> from Patrick McKenzie is the best way to understand how it works), you're probably shaking your head by now. People buying software businesses look for <strong>simple, low-risk, boring-tech projects</strong> with a proven track record of stable or increasing profits. No one wants to buy a project written in an esoteric language (PineScript) running on a proprietary platform (TradingView) that targets a very specific niche of traders.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks with no more replies, I had to decide what to do next. I could submit my ad to bigger platforms like <a href="https://flippa.com/">Flippa</a> and pay to have it listed there. But I felt that this project was so niche that I wouldn't find a potential buyer on other platforms either. Especially a potential buyer who knew the PineScript language necessary to maintain and improve the scripts' source code.</p>
<p>While waiting for more bids from potential buyers, I started thinking about what I could do to ease the burden of this project. I'm an engineer, goddamit! We're not meant to click buttons in the browser or send the same email over and over again!</p>
<h2 id="turning-the-autopilot-on" tabindex="-1">Turning the autopilot on </h2>
<p>I checked my options and decided to automate the following parts of my work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gumroad payment should automatically grant access to the script on TradingView and send a "welcome" email. This would cover the most time-critical part of my work, so I didn't have to start my day from logging in to TradingView and granting access to people who bought subscriptions during the night.</li>
<li>A chatbot to manage subscriptions so that I could do all the manual work (removing access from people who cancelled subscriptions, extending trial access, etc.) with simple commands from my phone without logging in to TradingView.</li>
<li>Finally, I could create an online form where people could request trial access by leaving their TradingView username. This form would then trigger a Python script granting them one week's access to the selected TradingView script.</li>
</ul>
<p>I implemented all those features using <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a> to connect various services together - webhooks, a Telegram bot, Python scripts, sending emails, etc. I will write a separate article describing this setup's technical details.</p>
<p>Once I had the automation in place, users could request free trial access through an online form or buy a subscription on Gumroad, and everything would be handled automatically. From time to time, when they cancelled their subscription, I had to send a short message to my Telegram bot to set an expiration date for their access.</p>
<p>The hardest part was to stop caring so much about this project and disconnect myself. I like helping people. That's why I became a programmer - to build things that help me or help others. When I get an email, I try to answer it as best as I can. Years of working with clients taught me to explain things in a simple and easy-to-understand way. So, I spent hours patiently answering questions from potential customers only to never hear back from them. And even though I posted a link to the form where people could request trial access, plenty of folks didn't bother reading the description and kept commenting or sending me messages requesting trials.</p>
<p>This had to stop. I started by checking TradingView messages only on the weekends and granting trial access in bulk. For every comment about trial access, I replied "I gave you access now, but it would have been faster if you used the form I posted", hoping that others would see my reply and use the form next time. I still paid special attention to my existing clients and answered their emails every evening. But if someone was not an existing client, I would only respond to their questions on weekends. Eventually, I stopped checking the TradingView comments or messages. If people really wanted a trial, they would eventually read the two-sentence instruction, click the link, and fill in the form.</p>
<p>Did this affect my sales significantly? I don't think so. Most of the people asking basic questions would never convert to paying customers anyway. They were window shopping. They found a script that seemed to predict price changes, and they wanted to know how to make money with it. And the theory behind how it works and why it's supposed to work? Nah, they didn't care. They had ten more random scripts to test out today.</p>
<p>Did disconnecting from my project affect my sanity? Oh, hell yes! The project went on autopilot, and it no longer felt like a dreaded chore when I was checking my emails or logging in to my TradingView account. It lost a lot of traction because I stopped updating it, so people think it's not useful anymore (even though it does its job as well as it did a few years ago). Its revenue declined in the past years. But I don't care. I'm happy again.</p>
<p>What's next for this project? I guess I will keep running it until I decide that including it in my monthly accounting is not worth the effort, which is when I will shut it down. But for now, the $200 I get every month with almost no work is a nice passive income.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-ve-learned" tabindex="-1">Things I've learned </h2>
<h3 id="don-t-let-a-side-project-burn-you-out" tabindex="-1">Don't let a side project burn you out </h3>
<p>The dreaded truth that most programmers learn the hard way is that releasing a product is just the beginning. Once it's out there, you have to maintain it: fix bugs, implement new features, deal with disputes or frauds, and answer a LOT of emails (often from curious window shoppers who never convert to paying customers).</p>
<p>This maintenance is easier if you have more products and you do support in bulk. Or if your project can replace your full-time job and maintaining it is the only thing you do during the day. But if you do this on top of your regular job, it's a terrible time sink. You need to set some boundaries. Otherwise, working on your project will take all your available time.</p>
<p>Working on a side project is much more fun if you're also one of its users and genuinely want to keep improving it. It's incredibly smooth if you love your project, and the perspective of working on it full-time sounds like a dream job. And accordingly, it's much harder to support a project when you move on to doing something else and you're no longer interested in maintaining it, but you still have existing customers you need to keep happy.</p>
<p>If your side project is not a source of genuine joy and you have other priorities, it's important to set some boundaries. I've decided to focus my support only on the paying customers. I also stopped adding new features and told myself that unless my scripts break, I'm not touching the code. Even though I still had a list of additional improvements I wanted to make one day, I deleted that list. I already had paying customers, which means people find value in what I've built. Sure, I can add new features to attract new customers. But that means even more coding and maintenance for a <em>chance</em> to attract new customers.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-merchant-of-record" tabindex="-1">Use a merchant of record </h3>
<p>If you're planning to sell products globally, consider using a "merchant of record" like Gumroad or Paddle. This way, you won't have to figure out how much tax to charge for each country (basically, you only sell to Gumroad, and they resell your product to the final customer). Figuring out taxes was the last thing I wanted to do when selling my products. I went with Gumroad, which - at the time of writing - charges a 10% fee, plus around 3% of PayPal/Stripe fees on top of that.</p>
<p>There might be cheaper options, so do your research before choosing one. Once you get some recurring payments rolling in, you can't easily move your existing customers to a different company. When the Gumroad fees increased throughout the years, I always thought that migrating to another service was too much of a hassle, so that's why I'm still using Gumroad.</p>
<h3 id="selling-stuff-to-customers-is-hard" tabindex="-1">Selling stuff to customers is hard </h3>
<p>I had this one guy where the conversation looked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hey, amazing script, I rated it 5 stars! Can you implement the take profit levels for me?</li>
<li>I'm sorry, but I can't. The original methodology doesn't specify exact take profit levels. It also doesn't make sense because take profits should be manually determined, for example, based on support or resistance levels visible on the chart. Different people will use different take profit levels based on their risk appetite.</li>
<li>Ok, but can you please put them for me? I follow this [insert some YouTube crypto day-trader], and he uses [some very specific take profit levels]. I would like the script to draw them for me.</li>
<li>Look, I can't do this. Those take profit levels are very specific to your trading system. They won't work for most other people, but they will slow down the script for everyone.</li>
<li>Ok, bro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>He cancelled his subscription a few days later and lowered his 5-star review to 2 stars.</p>
<p>Business-to-consumer (B2C) is difficult (not that business-to-business is much easier - it has a different set of challenges). But this doesn't mean that B2C is not worth pursuing. There are many people who did great selling to customers. One of the most well-known is Pieter Levels (<a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">@levelsio</a>), creator of projects like NomadList, RemoteOK, and, more recently, PhotoAI. According to his Twitter profile stats, he makes an astonishing $200k Monthly Recurring Revenue from his projects. But B2C, while easier to get into than establishing a relationship with a company in a B2B business model, means that you will need many more customers to have the revenue levels that B2B can bring. And more customers mean more work.</p>
<h3 id="be-nice" tabindex="-1">Be nice </h3>
<p>Try to be nice to people. I mean, being nice to people in general will make the world a better place. But when dealing with customers, never assume they do something in bad faith. Sure, some folks will try to take advantage of you. But many "problems" are just a matter of misunderstanding. People will request a chargeback because they think it's the only way to get a refund for a subscription they forgot about. If someone asks me for a refund, then no matter what's the reason, I give them their money back and wish them good luck with their investments. Fighting disgruntled customers over $20 is not a good way to spend time.</p>
<p>If you're nice to people, they are more likely to use and recommend your products. One of the reasons why Amazon got so popular early in the days was because of its extraordinary customer support. Ten years ago, when my Kindle stopped turning on (which might or might not have been caused by accidental yet excessive force applied to it), Amazon's support said "no worries, we'll send you a new one for free". Someone would send me a free product instead of requesting to prove that it broke by itself? This blew me away! Especially since I was living in Poland, where the strong post-communism roots mean that if a seller is not mean to you, then this already counts as them being nice.😉</p>
<p>So, I wanted to do the same with my customers. I tried to accommodate their needs, write detailed explanations to their questions, and generously issue refunds or even discounts when requested. When someone complained that something didn't work because it didn't work the way <em>they</em> wanted, I suggested alternative scripts and offered refunds. And that paid back. I received a lot of nice messages from customers, and even though I was getting tired of supporting my project, getting positive feedback from time to time kept me going for all those years.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that's the story of my first side project. It was fun at the beginning, frustrating in the middle, and now it's mostly a passive income that will eventually dry up.</p>
<p>Was it worth the money? Not really. Spending equal time working for a client would probably earn me more. But the experience I gained from this side project will be invaluable when I build the next one.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the next article, where I describe the technical setup I used to automate most of this project.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://csvbase.com/blog/13">https://csvbase.com/blog/13</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41307011">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!-- Being on The Semantic Web is easy, and, frankly, well worth the bother -->
<p>The Semantic Web is the <em>old</em> Web 3.0.  Before "Web 3.0" meant
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">crypto-whatnot</a>, it meant
"machine-readable websites".</p>
<p>I thought this concept hadn't really gone anywhere but it turns out that The
Semantic Web (best read in a very deep voice) is now very widely adopted.</p>
<p>The Semantic Web is so widely adopted in fact that I think it's fair to say
that we're already on Web 3.0.  It's not the future, it's the present.  I
suppose that means the blockchain crowd will need to argue their case to get
all that crypto stuff into the next major version.  Good luck to them,
<a href="https://calpaterson.com/blockchain.html">really</a>.</p>
<p>If Web 3.0 is already here, where is it, then?  Mostly, it's hidden in the
markup.</p>
<h2>JSON-LD for a <code>BlogPosting</code></h2>
<p>A worked example might help.  Here's how Semantic Web metadata is added for a
blog post, for example the one you're reading now.</p>
<p>You include a special <code>&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;</code> element inside the
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of an HTML page.  Inside that element is some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a>.</p>
<p>JSON-LD (JSON "for Linked Data") is the leading format for encoding Sematic Web
metadata.  It's <em>just JSON</em>, really.  There are schemas that lay out the
"types" you can use to describe the stuff on your page.  For a blog post, the
right type is <a href="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">BlogPosting</a>.  Here's a (mildly
truncated) example of a <code>BlogPosting</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"@context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"https://schema.org"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"BlogPosting"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"headline"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"From Shell to Excel - with a little bit of HTTPS"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"url"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"https://csvbase.com/blog/10"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"description"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Write once, read everywhere"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Person"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Cal Paterson"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>"email"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cal@calpaterson.com"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>"url"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"https://calpaterson.com/about.html"</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>},</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"image"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"https://csvbase.com/blog-static/excel.png"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"datePublished"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2024-08-12"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"dateCreated"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2024-08-12"</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>"dateModified"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2024-08-12"</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>It's all pretty self expanatory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
keys starting with <code>@</code> are metadata (meta-metadata?)<ul>
<li><code>@context</code> is the namespace.  Usually it's schema.org</li>
<li><code>@type</code> is the class, <code>BlogPosting</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the other keys are just things <a href="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">allowed in the <code>BlogPosting</code> type</a></li>
<li>the values of keys can be other types, eg <code>Person</code> for the <code>author</code> key in
this case</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's in it for me?</h2>
<p>Does anyone actually read all that stuff?  Yes, a lot of bots are out there
parsing JSON-LD metadata.  Nice things tend to happen to blog posts that
include the Semantic Web metadata:</p>
<p>Social media sites (Twitter/Discord/Facebook/WhatsApp/etc) start showing that
<strong>nice link preview</strong> with an image for your links.  Link previews usually look
a bit like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@calpaterson/112953513297517114">
<img alt="screenshot of a mastodon link preview" src="https://csvbase.com/blog-static/mastodon-link-preview.png">
</a></p><p>People do click on these link previews more often than on "bare urls", which is
something that drives adoption of the Semantic Web.</p>
<p>Search engine web crawlers also make use of this metadata both to <strong>crawl a bit
more intelligently</strong> but also to show <strong>more information in search results</strong>
(for example: who the author is).  Again, people are more likely to click on
such "enhanced" search results, which is another thing that has driven
adoption.</p>
<p>Automated link aggregators <strong>show your post</strong> to their users.  I once woke to
many many nice emails from people who normally wouldn't have read my blog.
After being initially puzzled I eventually learned that Android had decided,
all on its own, to show my blog post on its on-phone news screen.  All possible
because of Semantic Web metadata.</p>
<p>Many other, usually nice, things can happen.  The joy of The Semantic Web is
that it is <em>permissionless</em> as well as "vendor-neutral".  Anyone can take the
metadata and run with it.  That's cool, that's the web spirit.</p>
<h2>Is it really hard?</h2>
<p>Not really, no.  A bit of JSON, containing things already on the page anyway,
just laid out in a way for computers to read.  If people can write <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/reckoning/">enormous
frontend apps</a> I think they can
figure out JSON-LD.</p>
<h2>JSON-LD for other stuff</h2>
<p>There are other JSON-LD "types" than just <code>BlogPosting</code>.  A lot more.  Some
well supported ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/Event"><code>Event</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness"><code>LocalBusiness</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting"><code>JobPosting</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/Product"><code>Product</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/Recipe"><code>Recipe</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://csvbase.com/about">csvbase</a> is a website full of table data
(tinder-for-dogs style pitch: "Github, for data tables"), so it uses the
<a href="https://schema.org/Dataset"><code>Dataset</code></a> type to describe each of tables
(<a href="https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges">for example</a>) in a
machine-readable way.  Here's an example of the JSON-LD csvbase includes on
each table page:</p>

<p>There's a lot of stuff in there.  From basic things like the last time the
data was changed (personal bugbear of mine) to some more complicated stuff.</p>
<p>Several <code>DataDownload</code> objects are included, to help bots understand where
people can go to just download the data, without having the visit the site.
Hopefully that's nice for people viewing tables through data-specific search
engines, like Google's <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Dataset
Search</a>.  Save them a click.</p>
<p>There's also some more advanced stuff.  The JSON-LD document actually includes
<em>two</em> schemas.  One is the ordinary "schema.org" one (<code>Dataset</code>) but the other
is a schema called <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/">"CSV on the
Web"</a>, which allows you to describe
the columns and the types of those columns --- as well as other more detailed
data I haven't sorted out yet.</p>
<p>I haven't direct evidence that anyone is yet doing much with these CSVW types
yet but Google do <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/dataset#tabular">document that they read
it</a>
so perhaps there is more to come on this in the future from them.  And of
course, there is nothing to stop anyone else using it.  It's all standardised
stuff.</p>
<h2>It is really necessary?  "Doesn't AI solve this?"</h2>
<p>It would of course be possible to sic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">Chatty-Jeeps</a> on the raw markup and
have it extract all of this stuff automatically.  But there are some good
reasons why not.</p>
<p>The first is that large language models (LLMs) routinely get stuff wrong.
If you want bots to get it right, provide the metadata to ensure that they do.</p>
<p>The second is that requiring an LLM to read the web is throughly
disproportionate and exclusionary.  Everyone parsing the web would need to be
paying for pricy GPU time to parse out the meaning of the web.  It would feel
bizarre if "technological progress" meant that fat GPUs were required for
computers to read web pages.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>JSON-LD is not the only form of Semantic Web metadata, though it's increasingly
got the most momentum.  There is some overlap between the various schemes and
many bots will parse whatever they can find.  Here's a quick overview of the
alternatives:</p>
<p>At some point Facebook created the <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph Protocol</a>, a
standard based on using special <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags.  It's widely used and supported
but only covers the kinds of things you might post to Facebook: articles,
songs, videos, etc.  What zoomers call "Content".</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">"microdata"</a>.
It's very simple but I think quite hard to parse out.  Bits of it are well
supported.</p>
<p>Twitter published a spec for <a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards">"Twitter
Cards"</a>
which pretty much just lets you describe how you want your thing to appear on
Twitter.  It's pretty limited - but Twitter is popular - so this is widely
implemented.</p>
<p>Before JSON-LD there was a nest of other, more XMLy, standards emitted by the
various web steering groups.  These actually have very, very deep support in
many places (for example in library and archival systems) but on the open web
they are not a goer.</p>
<h2>Boring technology</h2>
<p>It is surprising how low-key The Semantic Web is.  Thousands of sites are
already setting this metadata.  The Semantic Web is already widespread, it's
just that there was no moment of victory.</p>

<p>If you think csvbase is cool:</p>
<ul>
<li>become <a href="https://csvbase.com/billing/pricing">a supporter</a></li>
<li>star <a href="https://github.com/calpaterson/csvbase">the github repo</a></li>
<li>follow me <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@calpaterson">on mastodon</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:cal@calpaterson.com">write me an email</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Googlers, if you're reading this, JSON-LD could have the same level of public
awareness as RSS if only you could release, and then shut down, some kind of
app or service in this area.  Please, for the good of the web: consider it.</p>
<p>Semantic Web information on websites is a bit of a "living document".  You tend
publish something, then have a look to see what people have parsed (or failed
to parse) it and then you try to improve it a bit.  If you have ideas for ways
that csvbase can improve its metadata, please <a href="https://github.com/calpaterson/csvbase/issues">open an issue on the github
repo</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&amp;id=83257&amp;key=user_uploads/1087615/dea0086b-00cd-4322-b4ba-d670c17a85f8"></p>
<p>Hello, we’re Alex and Devan, and we’re building the low-cost cruise missiles the United States needs!</p>
<p><strong>What we’re building</strong></p>
<p>Ares is building a new class of anti-ship cruise missiles. We are going to deliver the capabilities that the DoD wants in a form factor that’s 10x smaller and 10x cheaper.</p>
<p>Our missiles will be compatible with existing launch platforms, deliver smaller payloads at high subsonic speeds, and take out ships hundreds of miles away. We’re focusing on ground and ship-launched variants to start but will expand into air-launched versions, as well as versions with extended ranges and different payloads.</p>
<p><strong>Why we’re doing this</strong></p>
<p>A war with China in the Taiwan Strait would look nothing like what we've seen in Ukraine or the Middle East. Wargames within DoD and military experts are in agreement that the most useful weapons in such a conflict would be long range anti-ship weapons or cruise missiles.</p>
<p>The United States is not adequately prepared. In a potential conflict, our stockpiles will run out in weeks, and we currently don’t have the industrial capacity to build at a rate that could win a war, much less deter China. Higher-ups in DoD are waking up to the problem, and generals such as Major General Cameron Holt and officials such as Chairman of the House Select Committee on China Mike Gallagher have echoed this sentiment.</p>
<p>Recent conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have shown that our weapons are too large, too expensive for the wars of today. Existing anti-ship cruise missiles are low-volume, multi-million dollar, 3,000 lb behemoths meant to take out large cruisers and destroyers.</p>
<p>But Chinese shipbuilding capability is far superior to ours, and we can’t make enough anti-ship missiles to counter. In addition, huge missiles aren’t needed to take out the smaller corvettes and frigates that make up the People’s Liberation Army Navy. And $3M missiles make even less sense to take out swarms of $200k small, unmanned surface vessels.</p>
<p>The DoD needs smaller, less expensive cruise missiles, and lots of them! But no one has delivered on that promise yet.</p>
<p><strong>How we know how to do this</strong></p>
<p>Both of us have worked at multiple defense and munitions startups.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devanplantamura">Devan</a> is an Army Psychological Operations and Navy combat veteran and has deep experience in operations and business development at well-funded defense startups.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alextseng1/">Alex</a> was the first engineering hire at an earlier missile startup, built autonomous systems at Rivian and Stanford, and worked on turbojets at CSULB.</p>
<p><strong>Where we’re at now</strong></p>
<p>We spent the summer building multiple prototypes and flight-testing them in the Mojave. In 11 weeks, we went from starting the company to flight testing with our own design. We are on track to deliver early working missile systems to our first customers by mid-2025.</p>
<p>We believe our vision for anti-ship cruise missiles can help fill the munitions gap that the US faces. At Ares, we would never wish for a war to occur. But by helping to rebuild our defense industrial base, we can make sure the United States is prepared to stop a conflict and save countless lives.</p>
<p><strong>Our Ask</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for extremely talented aerospace engineers to help bring our prototypes to fruition. If you know any aerodynamics, propulsion, or GNC engineers who are interested in building something incredibly cool and want to make a positive difference in geopolitics, please send them our way!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p><i><span>This is part of a series of profiles detailing the experiences of institutions that have unbundled or canceled big deal journal contracts. The aim of the series is to provide insights, lessons learned, and inspiration to libraries to consider a similar move.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p><span>MIT leaders describe the experience of not renewing its largest journal contract as overwhelmingly positive. MIT has long tried to avoid vendor lock-in through big deal contracts and, in 2019, maintained individual title-by-title subscriptions to approximately 675 Elsevier titles. In 2020, they took the significant step of canceling the full Elsevier journals contract – all 675 titles – leaving users with immediate access to only pre-2020 backfile content. Since the cancellation, MIT Libraries estimates annual savings at more than 80% of its original spend. This move saves MIT approximately $2 million each year, and the Libraries provide alternative means of access that fulfills most article requests in minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After laying the groundwork with faculty and university administrators, the transition has been relatively seamless with minimal push back from researchers. Most faculty have been supportive of the Libraries in taking a principled stand in line with MIT values and are finding alternative means of&nbsp; access to needed research without an Elsevier subscription. Four years out, the faculty who continue to be most challenged by lack of immediate access are in the life sciences.</span></p>
<p><span>The experience has highlighted the extraordinary difference between what MIT had been paying (with pricing based on historic spend) to subscribe to Elsevier journal content and what it actually costs the Libraries to provide users with read access to what they need. On the publishing side, MIT’s analysis demonstrates that there were no financial economies of scale offered by Elseiver’s read and publish proposal. While local institutional context varies, MIT librarians believe others could likely benefit from a similar move. They are interested in collaborating with others to make collective investments in open publishing using their savings.</span></p>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<p><span>In 2019, the MIT Ad Hoc Task Force on Open Access recommended the development of a new</span><a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/publishing/framework/"> <span>framework with value-based principles</span></a><span> to serve as the basis for institutional contract negotiations with publishers. The document, formally adopted in May 2020, spelled out the Institute’s commitment to open access and equity, and provided the Libraries with a critical new tool to use in negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span>There was a growing belief on campus that MIT’s history of supporting open learning, open source software, and open scholarship should also be reflected in its relationships with publishers. The new principles-based framework helped to ensure that decisions, such as journal contract negotiations, were firmly anchored in the institution’s values. This approach also provided concrete touchstones to assist individual authors and faculty in navigating publishing decisions in a similar fashion.</span></p>
<p><span>“For MIT to continue to pay millions of dollars to corporations that lock up the scholarship that comes out of our own campus was just inconsistent with MIT’s history of supporting open education and research,” said Chris Bourg, Director of Libraries at MIT.</span></p>
<p><span>The principles were crafted in consultation with the </span><a href="https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/committee-library-system"><span>MIT Committee on the Library System</span></a><span>, whose members proved to be key in garnering support. A draft of the document was shared in meetings with the councils of MIT’s five schools. Presentations were given jointly by a Libraries’ representative (typically Bourg or a member of the MIT scholarly communications team) and a faculty member from the committee (often Roger Levy, then-committee chair and a professor of brain and cognitive science).</span></p>
<p><span>“It was really important to have those champions among the faculty who could talk peer to peer,” Bourg said of the work to get campus buy-in for the principles and the changes that could result. Levy was an important example of someone who published in Elsevier journals but was supportive of the Libraries’ potentially canceling its contract with the publisher. In their presentation, the pair explained that canceling contracts with publishers, including Elsevier, who were not willing to adhere to MIT’s principles was a very real possibility.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to answering questions at council meetings, the Libraries presented its principles to the MIT Dean’s group, which includes the provost and the school and college Deans, who also endorsed the Libraries’ approach.</span></p>
<p><span>The main questions from faculty centered on how they would be able to&nbsp; continue to access articles if subscriptions were canceled because the publisher was unwilling to meet MIT’s principles. To help understand the scope of what support would be necessary, MIT used </span><a href="https://unsub.org/"><span>Unsub</span></a><span> to determine what proportion of the resources that MIT faculty typically used were already openly available. Bourg and her colleagues were then able to explain to faculty that MIT had perpetual access to back issues, and that newer articles that were not available openly could be obtained quickly and relatively inexpensively through interlibrary borrowing.</span></p>
<p><span>Many faculty were enthusiastically behind the principles-based approach, said Bourg, while a subset generally agreed with the principles but had concerns about potential changes in access. The year before, the University of California system canceled their Elsevier contract, which signaled MIT would not be alone and helped to allay some concerns at the time.</span></p>
<p><b>Decision, Outcomes, and Campus Response</b></p>
<p><span>During negotiations with Elsevier in 2020, MIT presented its principles to the publisher’s representatives as the basis for new contract negotiations. Once it was clear that the company would not agree to advancing MIT’s principles outlined in the Framework (such as allowing all authors to retain their copyright), the Libraries made the decision not to renew its contract, effective that July.</span></p>
<p><span>To support the MIT community once the Libraries went out of contract with Elsevier, scholarly communications librarians created </span><a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/publishing/how-to-access-elsevier-articles/"><span>a webpage to guide users through their options for continuing to access articles</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the first several months, the approach focused on providing access through a combination of Interlibrary Loan (ILL) and openly available copies of articles, in addition to conversations with individual faculty about Elsevier’s business strategy and the MIT Framework. A handful of scholars (especially in the life sciences) expressed concerns about lack of immediate access, Bourg said, and when these concerns persisted, MIT decided to also contract with Reprints Desk, which enables on-demand access for a per-article charge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Turnaround times were and remain almost instant for nearly all requests,” Bourg said. Using this combination of non-subscription access strategies, 92% of all articles are delivered to faculty within 1 minute, and 97% within 1 hour.</span></p>
<p><span>“A lot of universities are hesitant to provide per-article access because of concerns that heavy use could result in costs that would exceed a standard big deal subscription or read and publish deal,” Bourg said. But that has not been the case at MIT. The Libraries has spent about $300,000 annually for commercial document delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We spent years building a coalition and getting support from deans, department heads, and provosts, and we had their backup from the start,” Bourg said. “While some scholars remain frustrated by the inconvenience of slightly slower access, we have worked very hard to reduce friction and inconvenience. We do not have any evidence of any decline in the quality of research and teaching at MIT.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 2022, Elsevier approached MIT with a request to re-engage in contract discussions. This time, Bourg was joined by an MIT contracts attorney in the negotiation, and once again, the Libraries’ asks were based on the </span><a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/publishing/framework/"><span>MIT Framework for Publisher Contracts</span></a><span>. MIT requested an outlining of the goods and services they would be paying for, some means of using the MIT contract to advance equity in the scholarly communications system, and a contract that allowed all MIT authors (including non-corresponding authors) to have their articles openly available in a repository without an embargo. However, the company returned to MIT with its standard read and publish contract proposal, and MIT once again decided to remain out of contract.</span></p>
<p><span>MIT librarians continue to collect data about what journals people are requesting and continue to listen to how faculty are adjusting. The Libraries expect that a limited number of MIT scholars may have purchased personal journal subscriptions. Most seem willing to take the small extra step to access an article through document delivery or other access mechanisms in order to stand by MIT values</span></p>
<p><span>MIT expects to maintain a similar level of savings over time while it remains out of contract. While demand for Reprints Desk may increase somewhat over time (as backfile access satisfies a lower percentage of demand), this need may be significantly offset by the increasing proportion of the literature that is publicly available—particularly once the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/"><span>2022 OSTP Memo</span></a><span> comes into full effect. It is also likely that any increased costs for on-demand read access will be less than the annual price increases MIT would have faced had it remained in its journal subscriptions contract.</span></p>
<p><b>Next Steps and Advice</b></p>
<p><span>Bourg said she’s proud of the work that so many people did and the logic senior leaders saw in not paying for content that researchers didn’t need. The cancellation is part of a broader conversation on campus about the future of scholarly communication that she hopes will continue.</span></p>
<p><span>Bourg’s advice for others: “Look at data about use, costs, and find allies across your campus who care about issues of equity and openness,” Bourg said. “This is both the right thing to do in terms of our values with public engagement and the right thing to do from an economic point of view.”</span></p>
<p><span>As the savings from remaining out of contract with Elsevier continue to accumulate, MIT is interested in collaborating with other libraries to reinvest these funds in community-controlled open publishing initiatives that better serve both their own campus and the academic community more broadly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Bourg notes that “Everyone in the libraries contributed in some way – from direct involvement in negotiations, to vendor assessment, technical work, and workflow creation in implementing alternative access, to assisting patrons and answering questions, to gathering and analyzing data, making presentations, scheduling and coordinating meetings, and much much more. This was a true all library effort.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="item-66c32bae78d02d10004b1261" data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1724066826990">
  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>This is the Dallas High Five, one of the tallest highway interchanges in the world. It gets its name from the fact that there are five different levels of roadways crossing each other in this one spot. In some ways, it’s kind of atrocious, right? It’s this enormous area of land dedicated to a complex spaghetti of concrete and steel; like the worst symbol of our car-obsessed culture. But in another way, it really is an impressive feat of engineering. 37 bridges and more than 700 columns are crammed into this one spot to keep the roughly half a million vehicles flowing in every direction each day.</p><p>They say everything’s bigger in Texas, but that’s not always true when it comes to engineering projects in the US. The tallest concrete dam is split between Arizona and Nevada. The longest bridge span is in New York. The longest road tunnel is in Alaska, and the longest water tunnel, not only in the US but the whole world, is the Delaware Aqueduct in New York. The largest hydroelectric plant is the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington, while the largest nuclear plant is in Georgia. </p><p>But one thing that Texas really does do bigger is highway interchanges. If you’ve driven from one major Texan highway onto or over another, you may have been astonished to find yourself and your vehicle well over a hundred feet or 30 meters above the ground. There’s no clearinghouse of data for flyover ramp heights, as far as I can find. Plus there’s the complexity of what a true height really means since many interchanges use excavation below grade for the lower level. Still, even the most conservative estimate puts the High Five taller than the Statue of Liberty from her feet to the top of her head. And if you do a little digging, you’ll find that many, if not most, of the tallest highway interchanges in the world are right here in the Lone Star State. Let’s talk about why. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. </p><p>The idea of a freeway really started in the 1920s with what’s now the Autostrada A8 in Italy: an automobile-only road with controlled access. Freeways are separated from local roads with limited ways to get on and off. And if you’ve driven a vehicle in the past century, the idea of a controlled-access freeway is pretty much taken for granted. Smooth curves and limited chances to enter or exit mean more speed and more capacity. But eventually, those big roads intersect other roads (sometimes other big roads) and that creates an obvious challenge.</p><p>Unlike most roads that cross at the same level on the ground, or as engineers say, “at grade,” freeways use grade separation at intersections. Roads go over or under one another. No traffic signals, stopping, or interruptions. Again, this is nothing groundbreaking. But what if you want to turn from one road onto the other? Just like that, we’ve gone from an intersection to an interchange. And this is where things get a lot more complicated. But we have to build up to it.</p><p>The diamond interchange is probably the simplest way to get grade separation because it kind of half doesn’t. Through traffic on the freeway flows right by, in most cases without any need to slow down. But that’s not true at the crossroad. Ramps enter and leave the highway at gentle angles and meet the crossroad nearly at right angles. Viewed from above, the ramps form a rough diamond shape, giving the interchange its name. The intersections of the ramps and the crossroad are just that: intersections. They are usually controlled by stop signs or traffic signals. Diamond interchanges can often get away with having just one bridge, a relatively small one carrying the crossroad over the highway. So, this can be the cheapest and easiest to build type of interchange to build. But, those intersections create limitations on how much traffic it can handle, so it’s really only used when the cross road is a minor one.</p><p>This kind of interchange is sometimes called a service interchange, in contrast to a system interchange, where two controlled access highways cross. As traffic increases, the only way to increase capacity is to eliminate at-grade intersections. So, the largest interchanges implement grade separation for every lane. The classic system interchange is the cloverleaf. Four ramps form a diamond, usually for the right-hand turns. These are directional ramps, that is, they curve toward the ultimate direction a traveler is trying to go. You exit right and end up driving to the right. The OTHER four ramps give the cloverleaf its name. The loop ramps, usually used for left-hand turns, curve around while ascending or descending so they can cross over themselves. So, you can get traffic flowing in any direction with no at-grade intersections and just one bridge.</p><p>The loop ramps make the whole thing look like a four-leafed clover, but finding yourself on this type of interchange doesn’t usually feel very lucky. For one, the loops are often pretty tight, requiring motorists to slow way down. And for two, there’s the weave. Consider traffic entering the highway from one of the loops. In the same place vehicles are trying to get back up to speed and merge left onto the freeway, drivers trying to exit the highway are slowing down and moving right. This inevitably creates traffic as people struggle to merge and cross paths with one another. Along with suboptimal traffic conditions, cloverleaf interchanges eat up a lot of of land. When cloverleaf interchanges were at their height of popularity in the mid-20th century, land was plentiful, and there were fewer cars, but as the volume of traffic increased AND the cost of land went up, engineers had to come up with new solutions to build better grade-separated highway crossings. And so they did.</p><p>Now, there’s such a huge variety of freeway interchange designs that it would be impossible to cover them all. The turbine, the windmill, the braided interchange, the ITL, mixes of various designs, and more. Each of these balances the constraints of a project like this in a different way: land requirements, cost, capacity, safety, et cetera. And the design that generally provides the most capacity, on the smallest footprint, (often for the highest cost), is the stack.</p><p>Like the cloverleaf, a stack has the four directional ramps, usually for the right-hand turns. But we move the exit for the left-hand turn off the main highway to avoid the weaving problem, and fly them over the middle of the intersection where they meet up with the opposite directional ramp. These ramps are often called flyovers, and it’s easy to see why. The gentle curves and elevation changes of the stack mean that drivers can safely maintain speed whether they’re going straight through the interchange or changing direction. The curved ramps often bank to the inside of the curve, called superelevation, making it even easier to maintain speed through the turn. This conventional configuration is called a four-level stack. There’s one level for the freeway, another for the crossing freeway to pass over, and two levels for the flyovers. It’s bridges on bridges, each one providing enough clearance underneath for large trucks. So these upper ramps end up pretty high off the ground. Four-level stacks are actually fairly ubiquitous in the US these days. These are impressive structures in their own right, but this is where Texas takes it to another level, literally. And it mostly has to do with feeder or frontage roads.</p><p>Lots of highways use frontage roads running parallel to connect areas alongside that would otherwise be cut off from the roadway network. They allow businesses to develop right up to and facing the freeway with easy access to those coming on and off it, basically keeping areas attached to the roadway network. Texas took the idea and ran with it. Apparently, they started as a way to reduce the cost of acquiring land for road projects. If you could promise the landowner access to a new highway along a frontage road, you're making their property more valuable, so they’re willing to sell a portion for the highway at a much lower cost. Now, Texas has over 6,400 miles (or 10,300 kilometers) of frontage roads. That’s almost the circumference of the moon, and as far as I can tell, way more than any other state in the US. I won’t go into the pros and cons of this approach here. Some research has shown pretty conclusively that the money saved on acquisition costs doesn’t make up for their many disadvantages. And Texas has since changed its policy to only include frontage roads on new freeways where necessary and justified. Although, from what I can tell seeing new construction these days, there don’t seem to be many projects where they’ve been left out. And one major effect of putting frontage roads alongside every highway happens at interchanges. Because these are more roads that need grade separation from all the others. So, at stack interchanges around the state, there aren’t just four levels but five.</p><p>In fact, this kind of interchange is often referred to as the Texas stack because it's so popular here. In a typical configuration, one freeway goes below grade at the bottom level. The frontage roads sit at grade. The crossing freeway is elevated. Then there are the two layers of flyovers. With a minimum vertical clearance of 16 feet or about 5 meters, plus the thickness of each bridge, vehicles on the highest flyovers are often more than a hundred feet or 30 meters above the ground. It’s a nice way to get a good look at the city, even if you only get to enjoy the view for a moment.</p><p>The Dallas High Five is probably the most famous interchange in Texas with its cool nickname, but it doesn’t stand alone. There are quite a few five-level stacks around the state and even a couple that qualify as six-level stacks with flyovers connecting to other highways. My friend Brian, better known as the Texas Highway Man, documents a lot of new construction in Texas, including this replacement of an old cloverleaf crossing with a five-level stack in San Antonio. These flyovers will be higher than a twelve-story building when they’re done. The frontage roads for this new interchange use a pretty innovative concept. Four partial roundabouts morph into one funny-shaped roundabout that’s been lovingly nicknamed the “fidget spinner.” </p><p>Of course, Texas stacks don’t exist only in the Lone Star State. The Big I is another famous interchange in Albuquerque decorated with a tumbleweed snowman each winter. The Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange in Los Angeles gets its fifth level not for frontage roads but the high occupancy lane. Plus, it has a railroad at the lowest level, which I always appreciate. Not just because I like trains, but also because it’s a reminder that these artfully sculpted ribbons of concrete carefully woven together represent a tremendous investment of public money, our money, into a way of getting people from A to B that has a lot of downsides. Everyone has different thoughts about what a city should look like, but there’s a growing recognition that the way we prioritize motor vehicle traffic in the US may not have been the best path forward. And so, I admit that my ideal city has a lot fewer of these towering interchanges that kind of stand as a testament to a transportation network that doesn’t necessarily reflect our highest values and aspirations. But, I still find them pretty impressive in their own right, and whenever I’m in a new city, I try to plan my driving to hit those tallest ramps at the top of the stack to get a bigger, if momentary, perspective on the built environment. It’s always a nice reminder of our capacity for grand designs and ambitious projects, even if they might not always be the best solutions.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-ai">https://zed.dev/blog/zed-ai</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41302782">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article><p>At Zed, we've dedicated our careers to mastering the art of text manipulation. From crafting parser generators to designing programming languages and shipping two production-grade text editors, we've always been captivated by the expressive power of words and symbols. So when large language models emerged to revolutionize text interpretation and generation, we knew we had to explore their potential.</p>
<p>In the two years since LLMs came onto our radar, we've been focused on building out the core of Zed: a fast, reliable text editor with the features developers need. Meanwhile, we've been quietly experimenting with integrating LLMs into our own workflows. Not as a flashy gimmick, but as a practical tool to enhance our productivity working on a complex, real-world codebase.</p>
<p>As we refined our AI integration, we caught the attention of some unexpected allies. Engineers at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>, one of the world's leading AI companies, discovered Zed and quickly saw the value of our raw, text-centric interface that puts minimal separation between the user and the language model. Their enthusiasm was validating, and our conversations sparked a dialogue that quickly evolved into a collaboration.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-ai/zed-ai-cover.png" alt=""></figure></div>
<p>Now, we're ready to introduce two exciting developments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Zed AI</strong>: A hosted service providing convenient and performant support for AI-enabled coding in Zed, powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and accessible just by signing in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A private beta</strong> of the Claude 3.5 Sonnet's new <em>Fast Edit Mode</em>, optimized for text editing. This upcoming mode achieves unprecedented speed in transforming existing text, enabling near-instantaneous code refactoring and document editing at scale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Zed AI is available now, free during our initial launch period. Sign in to Zed to access an AI-powered assistant panel and inline code transformations that integrate directly with your editing environment. The Claude 3.5 Sonnet Fast Edit Mode beta is currently invite-only, but we're working with Anthropic to expand access as soon as we can.</p>
<h2 id="how-zed-ai-works"><span data-br=":Rudrrrrqdt6la:" data-brr="1">How Zed AI Works</span></h2>
<p>What began as an experiment in AI-assisted coding has evolved into something that's captured the attention of leading AI practitioners. Our collaboration with Anthropic has grown organically, with a growing wave of their developers now using Zed daily and a core team of Anthropic's Rust engineers actively contributing to our open-source codebase.</p>
<p>By marrying cutting-edge AI with a fast, thoughtfully designed editor, we're creating a tool that resonates with those at the forefront of AI development—experts who demand both power and precision in their workflows.</p>
<p>Our approach to AI-assisted coding hinges on the interaction between two core features: Zed's assistant panel and inline transformations. This combination allows developers to leverage the power of language models while maintaining full control over their code.</p>
<h3 id="the-assistant-panel-mastering-massive-context"><span data-br=":R1edrrrrqdt6la:" data-brr="1">The Assistant Panel: Mastering Massive Context</span></h3>
<p>The assistant panel is where you interact with AI models in Zed, but it's not your typical chat interface. It's a full-fledged text editor that exposes the entire LLM request. Code snippets, conversation history, file contents—it's all there, and it's all just text. You can observe, edit, and refine any part of the request using familiar coding tools, giving you full transparency and control over every interaction.</p>
<p>To populate this text-based context, we've introduced a system of slash commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/tab</code>: Insert the contents of an open tab</li>
<li><code>/file</code>: Insert the contents of a specific file or tree of files</li>
<li><code>/terminal</code>: Include terminal output</li>
<li><code>/diagnostics</code>: Insert diagnostic information from across the codebase</li>
<li><code>/fetch</code>: Insert the response from an arbitrary HTTP URL</li>
</ul>
<p><figure><video loop="" muted="" controls="" playsinline=""><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/410d006808a1e647b2ed6532ffc3ae33/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8.0, vorbis&quot;"><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/410d006808a1e647b2ed6532ffc3ae33/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.4D401E, mp4a.40.2&quot;"></video><figcaption>Creating a Zed extension using the assistant panel.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The <code>/file</code> command allows us to bring in relevant context from our codebase, which the AI can then use to assist in development tasks.</p>
<p>When you use a slash command or the quote selection binding (cmd-&gt;), Zed inserts the content as folded text. This includes entire directory trees, which are inserted as recursive folds containing the full text of each file.</p>
<p>Zed's folding mechanism for inserted context balances detail with the big picture when working with large codebases or API documentation. Every token of context remains visible and editable, ensuring precise control over AI prompts. Expand folds to examine specifics, or collapse them to focus on the overall structure. This flexibility lets you tailor both your view and your AI interactions to the task at hand.</p>
<p>Slash commands are extensible via WebAssembly or a JSON-based context server protocol, opening up exciting possibilities. You can create custom commands tailored to your workflow, and we envision a future where language servers might implement /commands to fetch context in language-specific ways.</p>
<p>Now that we've created our Perplexity extension, let's see it in action:</p>
<p><figure><video loop="" muted="" controls="" playsinline=""><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/b7c638b64f27e3df65db06f10cb73c21/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8.0, vorbis&quot;"><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/b7c638b64f27e3df65db06f10cb73c21/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.4D401E, mp4a.40.2&quot;"></video><figcaption>Using the created Zed extension.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In this demo, we:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use our new <code>/perplexity</code> command to fetch key C interfaces for microphone capture on macOS:
"/perplexity Provide the essential C interfaces for capturing microphone input on macOS. Include only the most relevant functions and structures."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the fetched interfaces to generate Rust bindings:
"Generate Rust bindings for capturing microphone input on macOS using these C interfaces."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This streamlined workflow demonstrates how Zed AI can seamlessly integrate external knowledge (<code>/perplexity</code>) and code generation, all within a single, coherent interface. By fetching the key interfaces directly, we've eliminated the need for manual file operations, making the process more efficient and focused.</p>
<h3 id="inline-transformations"><span data-br=":R36drrrrqdt6la:" data-brr="1">Inline Transformations</span></h3>

<p>Inline transformations, activated with <code>ctrl-enter</code>, allow you to transform and generate code via natural language prompts. What sets them apart is their precision and responsiveness.</p>
<p>To give you fast feedback, we've implemented a custom streaming diff protocol that works with Zed's CRDT-based buffers to deliver edits as soon as they're streamed from the model. You see the model's output token by token, allowing you to read and react to changes as they happen. This low-latency streaming creates a fluid, interactive coding experience that keeps you engaged and in control throughout the process.</p>
<p>For those in our closed beta, we're taking this experience to the next level with Claude 3.5 Sonnet's Fast Edit Mode. This new capability delivers mind-blowingly fast transformations, approaching real-time speeds for code refactoring and document editing. The immediacy of these changes creates an almost magical feeling of direct manipulation through natural language, dramatically streamlining complex editing tasks.</p>
<p>Inline transformations in Zed use the context you've built in the assistant panel. There's no hidden system prompt－you see and control every input shaping the model's output. This transparency lets you fine-tune the model's behavior and improve your skills in AI-assisted coding.</p>
<p>Text transformation in Zed gains a powerful dimension through its recursive capabilities. You can apply inline transformations within the assistant panel itself, allowing you to refine context and iteratively improve prompts. This feature turns the panel into a dynamic workspace for prompt engineering, where you can experiment with different approaches, refine your instructions, and even use AI to help craft more effective AI prompts.</p>
<p>Inline transformations also work with Zed's multiple cursor feature, allowing you to apply the same transformation across multiple selections simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-for-zed-ai"><span data-br=":R46drrrrqdt6la:" data-brr="1">What's Next for Zed AI</span></h2>
<p>We're continuously working to expand Zed AI's capabilities. Here's a glimpse of what we're developing:</p>
<h3 id="workflows-for-complex-transformations"><span data-br=":R4edrrrrqdt6la:" data-brr="1">Workflows for Complex Transformations</span></h3>
<p>You've seen how inline transformations can pull context from the assistant panel and even transform the panel's content itself. With the <code>/workflow</code> command, we're expanding this capability to create a two-way interaction between the assistant panel and your project files.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to work within the assistant panel to orchestrate changes that directly affect your codebase. When you use <code>/workflow</code>, it directs the model to emit a series of <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> tags that Zed interprets. These steps suggest inline transformations directly in your project files, offering a guided, AI-assisted approach to complex coding tasks.</p>
<p>The <code>/workflow</code> command effectively bridges the gap between the assistant panel and your actual code, allowing for a more integrated and powerful AI-assisted development process. While we're actively refining this feature, you can already try <code>/workflow</code> in Zed today. We encourage you to experiment with it across different programming languages and share your experiences. Your insights will help us expand and improve it.</p>

<h3 id="tools-for-efficiently-crafting-contexts"><span data-br=":R52drrrrqdt6la:" data-brr="1">Tools for Efficiently Crafting Contexts</span></h3>
<p>We recognize that efficiently building appropriate context is a key challenge in AI-assisted development. To address this, we're developing tools that help you gather relevant information more quickly. These tools maintain the transparency and control central to Zed's philosophy, giving you powerful context-building capabilities while ensuring you understand and manage what goes into each AI interaction.</p>
<p>We're currently working on two key features to solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/search</code>: Currently behind a configuration flag, this command helps you quickly find and insert relevant project information into the assistant panel. It's designed to speed up context building while still allowing you to review and edit the results before they're used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/auto</code>: An upcoming feature that will automatically insert context based on your current task, much like other / commands. While it operates automatically, the inserted context remains fully visible and editable, allowing you to explore, modify, or remove any information it pulls in. This feature aims to streamline context building while maintaining your ability to control and understand the information being used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are designed to give you leverage in managing complex contexts, while preserving your ability to understand and control exactly what information is being used in your AI interactions. We believe this balance of power and transparency is crucial for effective AI-assisted development.</p>
<p>As we continue to refine these tools, we welcome your feedback and ideas on how to further improve context management in Zed AI.</p>

The victim does not have to be in the public channel for the attack to work]</strong></em></p><p>Slack AI is a feature built on top of Slack that allows users to query Slack messages in natural language. Prior to August 14th, Slack only ingested messages. After August 14th, Slack also ingests uploaded documents, Google Drive files, etc which increases the risk surface area as we’ll address in section 3.</p><p><strong>1. The Vulnerability</strong></p><p><span>The core of the issue from Slack AI stems from </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_injection#:~:text=The%20concept%20of%20prompt%20injection%20was%20first%20discovered%20by%20Jonathan%20Cefalu%20from%20Preamble%20in%20May%202022%20in%20a%20letter%20to%20OpenAI%20who%20called%20it%20command%20injection.%20The%20term%20was%20coined%20by%20Simon%20Willison%20in%20November%202022.%5B11%5D%5B12%5D" rel="">prompt injection</a><span>, initially discovered by Jon Cefalu, and more specifically </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173" rel="">indirect prompt injection</a><span>, initially coined by Kai Greshake</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-147935237" href="https://promptarmor.substack.com/p/data-exfiltration-from-slack-ai-via#footnote-1-147935237" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>Prompt injection occurs because an LLM cannot distinguish between the “system prompt” created by a developer and the rest of the context that is appended to the query. As such, if Slack AI ingests any instruction via a message, if that instruction is malicious, Slack AI has a high likelihood of following that instruction </span><strong>instead of, or in addition to, the user query</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Note that Slack </span><a href="https://www.sangfor.com/blog/cybersecurity/disney-slack-hack-insider-threat-causes-massive-data-breach" rel="">insider threats are already an issue (leaks from Disney, Uber, EA, Twitter, etc in the past have happened via Slack),</a><span> and this just explodes the risk as now an attacker </span><strong>does not even need access to the private channel or data within Slack to exfiltrate it</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>2. Data Exfiltration Attack Chain: Public Channel Injection</strong></p><p><span>In Slack, users queries retrieve data from both public and private channels. However, data is also retrieved from </span><strong>public channels the user is not a part of</strong><span>. Per Slack’s response, “Messages posted to public channels can be searched for and viewed by all Members of the Workspace, regardless if they are joined to the channel or not. This is intended behavior,” this is desired functionality for the Slack AI application.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We demonstrate how this behavior will allow an attacker to exfiltrate API keys that a developer put in a private channel (that the attacker does not have access to). </span><strong>Note that the data exfiltrated does not have to be an API key, and the attacker does not have to know what confidential data someone put in a private channel to exfiltrate it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Here is what the attack chain would look like:&nbsp;</p><p>A) A user puts an API key in their own private channel with one user: themselves. This can be in any private channel, including a user’s messages with themselves</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

If a user downloads a PDF that has one of these malicious instructions (e.g. hidden in white text) and subsequently uploads it to Slack, the same downstream effects of the attack chain can be achieved.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we did not test for this functionality explicitly as the testing was conducted prior to August 14th, we believe this attack scenario is highly likely given the functionality observed prior to August 14th. Administrators should likely restrict Slack AI’s ability to ingest documents until this is resolved: https://slack.com/help/articles/28244420881555-Manage-Slack-AI-settings-for-your-organization#manage-files-in-search-answers</p><p><strong>4.

Messages posted to public channels can be searched for and viewed by all Members of the Workspace, regardless if they are joined to the channel or not. This is intended behavior.”</p></li></ul><p>Slack’s security team had prompt responses and showcased a commitment to security and attempted to understand the issue. Given how new prompt injection is and how misunderstood it has been across the industry, this is something that will take the industry time to wrap our heads around collectively.&nbsp;</p><p>However, given the proliferation of Slack and the amount of confidential data within Slack, this attack has material implications on the state of AI security, especially after the change made on August 14th which substantially increases the risk surface. As we mentioned to Slack during responsible disclosure, this necessitated a public disclosure so that users could turn off the necessary settings to decrease their exposure.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> is an <strong>extremely fast Python package manager</strong>,
written in Rust.</p>
<p>We first released <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> in <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv">February</a> as
a drop-in replacement for common <code>pip</code> workflows.</p>
<p>Today, we're announcing a series of features that extend <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>
beyond a <code>pip</code> alternative, and into an end-to-end solution for managing
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/">Python projects</a>,
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/">command-line tools</a>,
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/">single-file scripts</a>, and even

<p>It's <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/05/05/cargo-pillars.html#pillars-of-cargo">Cargo</a>, for Python:
a unified interface that's fast, reliable, and easy to use.</p>

<p>At Astral, we build high-performance developer tools for the Python ecosystem. We're best known for
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff</a>, an extremely fast Python

<p>In <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv">February</a>, we released <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>, an
extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, initially designed as a drop-in replacement
for common <code>pip</code> workflows.</p>
<p>Today, we're announcing the largest expansion in uv's capabilities since that initial release:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/">End-to-end project management</a>: <code>uv run</code>,
<code>uv lock</code>, and <code>uv sync</code>. uv can now generate and install from cross-platform lockfiles based on
standards-compliant metadata, making it a high-performance, unified alternative to tools like
Poetry, PDM, and Rye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/">Tool management</a>: <code>uv tool install</code> and <code>uv tool run</code>

<p>And all covered in new, comprehensive <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these interfaces represent a significant expansion in scope for uv. But what's unique is how
they come together. As a whole, they comprise a new, unified toolchain that takes the complexity out
of Python development.</p>
<p>Combined with <code>uv pip</code> (which we'll continue to maintain and improve as a first-class feature), uv
fits into any Python workflow, from one-off scripting to large, multi-package workspace development.</p>
<p>You can install <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> today via our standalone installers, or from
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/uv/">PyPI</a>.</p>

<h3><span id="projects"></span>Projects<!-- --> <a href="#projects">#</a></h3>
<p>uv is now capable of managing entire Python projects. If you've used
<a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">Poetry</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm">PDM</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye">Rye</a>, you'll find
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/">uv's project API</a> to be a familiar alternative.</p>
<p>The project API is built atop Python standards, starting with the use of <code>pyproject.toml</code> for
declaring project metadata.</p>
<p>For example, you can run <code>uv init &amp;&amp; uv add "fastapi&gt;=0.112"</code> to generate the following:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>project</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>hello-world</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>version</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>0.1.0</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>readme</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>README.md</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>dependencies</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> [</span><span>"</span><span>fastapi&gt;=0.112</span><span>"</span><span>]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>From there, uv will create a lockfile based on the project's dependencies — here's a snippet:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[[</span><span>package</span><span>]]</span></span>

<p>uv's lockfile is a snapshot of the project's fully-resolved dependencies at a moment in time, and
ensures that the project's environment is consistent across machines.</p>
<p>Critically, the lockfile is <em>cross-platform</em>, in that it can be used to install a given project on
any platform, regardless of where it was generated. uv defines a unique solution for every platform,
producing a readable and auditable lockfile that defines exactly which packages will be installed.</p>
<p>For example: if you run <code>uv lock</code> on macOS, uv still generates resolutions for Linux and Windows,
even if the set of required dependencies is slightly different on each platform.</p>
<p>And it does this very quickly. uv can resolve the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/">Jupyter</a>
project's dependencies in about half a second without any caching (and in around 20 milliseconds
with a warm cache).</p>

<p>The center point of the project API is <code>uv run</code>, which runs a command in the project's environment
(without requiring explicit activation of a virtual environment).</p>
<p><code>uv run</code> is fast enough that every invocation will implicitly re-lock and re-sync the project,
ensuring that your environment is up-to-date without the need for manual intervention.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>uv run</code> guarantees that your command is executed in a consistent, locked
environment.</p>

<p>With <code>uv run</code>, you don't have to think about activating virtual environments, managing dependencies,
or keeping your project up-to-date. It just works.</p>
<p><em>For more, see the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/">project documentation</a>.</em></p>
<h3><span id="dependency-sources-editables-relative-paths-and-more"></span>Dependency sources: editables, relative paths, and more<!-- --> <a href="#dependency-sources-editables-relative-paths-and-more">#</a></h3>
<p>uv is built on Python standards, like <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>. But it also adds
features that are essential to local development but <em>not</em> covered by the standards, like relative
paths and editable dependencies.</p>
<p>So while a project's dependencies (and publishable metadata) are defined in the standards-compliant
<code>project.dependencies</code> table, uv allows you to define alternate "sources" for each dependency to use
during development via <code>tool.uv.sources</code>.</p>
<p>For example, to use a local, editable version of <code>anyio</code>, you can run <code>uv add --editable ../anyio</code>
to produce the following <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>project</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>hello-world</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>version</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>0.1.0</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>readme</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>README.md</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>dependencies</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> [</span><span>"</span><span>anyio</span><span>"</span><span>]</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>[</span><span>tool</span><span>.</span><span>uv</span><span>.</span><span>sources</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>anyio</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> { </span><span>path</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>../anyio</span><span>"</span><span>, </span><span>editable</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> }</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When published to PyPI, the above package would declare a dependency on <code>anyio</code>; but when synced
locally via <code>uv run</code>, the editable package at <code>../anyio</code> would be included in the development
environment instead. While the project's dependencies haven't changed, the sources from which those
dependencies are drawn have.</p>

<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/#dependency-sources">dependency sources documentation</a>.</em></p>
<h3><span id="workspaces"></span>Workspaces<!-- --> <a href="#workspaces">#</a></h3>
<p>Inspired by the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html">Cargo concept of the same name</a>, uv
supports workspaces: collections of one or more packages that are managed together.</p>
<p>Think: a FastAPI-based web application, alongside a series of libraries that are versioned and
maintained as separate Python packages, all in the same Git repository.</p>
<p>Most large Python projects end up implementing their own version of this concept, with hand-rolled
scripts and custom tooling to manage the relationships between packages. uv's
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/workspaces/">workspace API</a> provides a consistent,
high-performance, and opinionated solution to the kinds of development challenges that appear at
scale.</p>
<p>In a workspace, each package has its own <code>pyproject.toml</code>, but the workspace shares a single
lockfile, ensuring that the workspace operates with a consistent set of dependencies.</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>project</span><span>]</span></span>

<span><span>members</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> [</span><span>"</span><span>libraries/*</span><span>"</span><span>]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>From the workspace root, you can run commands within any given workspace member with (e.g.)
<code>uv run --package fastapi</code> or <code>uv run --package uvicorn</code>.</p>
<p><em>For more, see the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/workspaces/">workspace documentation</a>.</em></p>
<h3><span id="tools"></span>Tools<!-- --> <a href="#tools">#</a></h3>
<p>uv is now capable of installing command-line tools (like <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff</a>)
in dedicated, isolated virtual environments (<code>uv tool install</code>) – and running one-off commands
without any explicit installation step (<code>uvx</code>).</p>
<p>If you've used <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipx">pipx</a> or
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx">npx</a>, you'll find uv's tool API to be a familiar
alternative.</p>
<p>For example, you can run Darren Burns' <a href="https://github.com/darrenburns/posting"><code>posting</code></a> TUI with
nothing more than <code>uvx posting</code>.</p>

<p>The tool API enables you to centrally manage the Python applications that live on your system. For
example, you can run <code>uv tool list</code> to view all installed tools (along with the executables they
expose), or <code>uv tool upgrade</code> to upgrade all installed tools to their latest supported versions.</p>
<p>uv's tool API is extremely fast. Executing commands via <code>uvx</code> adds virtually no overhead.</p>
<p><em>For more, see the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/">tools documentation</a>.</em></p>
<h3><span id="python-bootstrapping"></span>Python bootstrapping<!-- --> <a href="#python-bootstrapping">#</a></h3>
<p>uv is now capable of installing and managing Python itself, making it entirely self-bootstrapping:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="console" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>-LsSf</span><span> </span><span>https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> sh</span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>uv</span><span> </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>install</span><span> </span><span>3.12</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to any explicit <code>uv python</code> invocations, uv can automatically download Python versions
as needed (on <code>uv run</code>, <code>uv venv</code>, etc.), e.g., if you're yet to install Python on a machine, or are
lacking a specific, requested Python version.</p>
<p>For example, here's the entire sequence of commands necessary to run <code>posting</code> on a fresh Ubuntu
Docker image – there are no hidden steps:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="console" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>apt-get</span><span> </span><span>update</span><span> &amp;&amp; apt-get </span><span>install</span><span> </span><span>-y</span><span> </span><span>curl</span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>-LsSf</span><span> </span><span>https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> sh</span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>source</span><span> </span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.cargo/env</span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>uvx</span><span> </span><span>posting</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Upon invoking <code>uvx</code>, uv will automatically install Python 3.12.4, create an ephemeral virtual
environment, install the package, and invoke the <code>posting</code> CLI. It's really easy.</p>
<h3><span id="single-file-scripts"></span>Single-file scripts<!-- --> <a href="#single-file-scripts">#</a></h3>
<p>Finally: uv now includes first-class support for single-file Python scripts with inline dependency
metadata, as defined in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a>.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following <code>main.py</code>, which fetches the first ten PEPs from the Python
Enhancement Proposal index:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="python" data-theme="default"><span><span>import</span><span> requests</span></span>
<span><span>from</span><span> rich.pretty </span><span>import</span><span> pprint</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>resp </span><span>=</span><span> requests.get(</span><span>"</span><span>https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json</span><span>"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>data </span><span>=</span><span> resp.json()</span></span>
<span><span>pprint([(k, v[</span><span>"</span><span>title</span><span>"</span><span>]) </span><span>for</span><span> k, v </span><span>in</span><span> data.items()][:</span><span>10</span><span>])</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This script depends on <code>requests</code> and <code>rich</code>, but doesn't include any explicit dependency metadata.
Historically, you'd need to manage these dependencies separately from the script, e.g., in a
dedicated <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>Now, you can use <code>uv add</code> to automatically embed the dependency declarations within the script
itself:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3764731489927965048">
<p>C. J. Date's Sigmod 1983 keynote, "Database Usability", was prescient. Usability is the most important thing to the customers. They care less about impressive benchmarks or clever algorithms, and more about whether they can operate and use a database efficiently to query, update, analyze, and persist their data with minimal headache. (BTW, does anyone have a link to the contents of this Sigmod'83 talk? There is no transcript around.)</p><p><a href="https://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu/usable/usability.pdf">The paper we cover today is from Sigmod 2007.</a> It takes on the database usability problem raised in that 1983 keynote head-on, and calls out that the king is still naked.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's give some context for the year 2007. Yes, XML format was still popular then. The use-case in the paper is XQuery. The paper does not contain any &nbsp;reference to json. MongoDB would be released in 2009 with the document model; and that seems to be great timing for some of the usability pains mentioned in the paper! Web 2.0 was in full swing, social media was rising. Cloud computing and big data was emerging. NoSQL movement was just starting.</p><h2>Database usability is an important but wicked problem</h2><p>Why is database usability important? "In places where database systems are used extensively, we find an army of database administrators, consultants, and other technical experts all busily helping users get data into and out of a database. For almost all organizations, the indirect cost of maintaining a technical support team far exceeds the direct cost of hardware infrastructure and database product licenses. Not only are support staff expensive, they also interpose themselves between the users and the databases. Users cannot interact with the database directly and are therefore less likely to try less straightforward operations. This hidden opportunity cost may be greater than the visible costs of hardware/software and technical staff."</p><p>This is spot on. And the paper follows up on this with flight booking example. You youngins may not remember, but pre-2005 we had to call a travel agent to book our flights and get paper tickets in return. This sucked, we don't have any transparency in to the process, we couldn't explore options (price, convenience, dates, airports) and customize our trip. Having access to flight booking via web was really a great improvement for user experience.&nbsp;</p><p>For flight booking, slapping a web-search interface to the flight databases solved the problem, but you still needed the database including its querying engine for this solution. But things are not that easy for operationalizing databases. It is all about how you manage expectations when you are serving the customer (<a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/08/strict-serializability-but-at-what-cost.html">as I wrote before</a>). The paper compares the database problem with the web search problem to make this point. Users expect the ability to query the database in a more sophisticated way than text based web-querying. Secondly, users expect more precise and complete answers from database search. Finally, users expect to create and update databases, not just query them in a read-only manner.</p><p>The big takeaway for me is that database usability is a wicked problem. This is a technical term, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">look it up.</a> Maybe by defining it well, we can tame this a bit, and downgrade it from the wicked problem to the messy problem category.&nbsp;</p><h2>Case study: MIMI protein interaction database system</h2><p>After the sequencing of the human genome was completed, biologists began focusing their attention on the proteins expressed by these genes, their interactions, and their functions. This team build MIMI to facilitate this, and collaborated with University of Michigan biologists throughout a multi-year project.</p><p>"Given the XML representation of the data, XQuery was our first choice for accessing the database. Indeed, some users wanted the power of a declarative query language, even if they didn’t have the training to write such queries. A majority of users, however, were complete technophobes and preferred forms-based interfaces. (Such interfaces do a good job today for specific applications—quite complex back-end queries can be run, for instance in an airline reservations database, while the user is shielded from this complexity by a simple form-based query interface.) Aside from these were a few users who wanted to download the entire dataset and write Perl scripts to slice and dice it. Our challenge in MiMI was to provide easy-to-use interfaces beyond a few hand- designed forms for some common queries. In fact, MiMI allows users to access data through various interfaces, which are depicted in Figure 1."</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhu7wbyNklGJSrFBgwWvytde4zWr00DqBpM_uusD-YJZABk50a8eu21vI-lY-okTFhxFBAFAdkldB4xmyoGPmzuxJ2Ku4EE4Wk1F07ATfAtfdDjFJbUZSmFD8Id4_9UuHdny4PIRI4PUffxjoiwd2Lgtqx1QnPOOQu9JNvJYh4pdGUrxAd2wI6V3qNN6d4/s1920/Screenshot%202024-08-19%20at%208.34.42%E2%80%AFPM.png"><img data-original-height="1090" data-original-width="1920" height="365" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhu7wbyNklGJSrFBgwWvytde4zWr00DqBpM_uusD-YJZABk50a8eu21vI-lY-okTFhxFBAFAdkldB4xmyoGPmzuxJ2Ku4EE4Wk1F07ATfAtfdDjFJbUZSmFD8Id4_9UuHdny4PIRI4PUffxjoiwd2Lgtqx1QnPOOQu9JNvJYh4pdGUrxAd2wI6V3qNN6d4/w640-h365/Screenshot%202024-08-19%20at%208.34.42%E2%80%AFPM.png" width="640"></a></p><p>This sounds good on paper right? But when you have users, you run into a whole bunch of problems you haven't anticipated. The paper lists some of these anecdotes, and writes: "As we analyze our accomplishments, and more impor- tantly, the many remaining issues described above, we have come to realize that the usability of a database system is much more than skin deep. Our work on query interfaces may contribute towards the usability of a system, but they are far from enough to provide the optimal user experience. In the next section, we enunciate what we believe are the major database usability problems."</p><p>The title of the next section is "The persistence of pain".</p><p>The subsection titles are even funnier. Painful relations (this takes the prime spot!), Painful options, Unexpected pain, Unseen pain, and Birthing pain.</p><h2>Painful relations</h2><p>In this subsection, the paper complains about the relational model.</p><p>"Whereas a single table of data is natural for most peo- ple, joins between multiple tables are not. Unfortunately, normalization is at the center of relational design. Indeed normalization saves space, avoids update anomalies, and is a desirable property from many perspectives. However, the use of joins in a relational model does not retain the integrity of data objects that a user regards as one unit."</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeEaxOHc5HuYA0hTT59YiH5QGxhLf8PFecO9BxDuzlepqbga92sr2BsuzAKJskN2AeWJax_PhovffWr1fJD4uSGOlKr5Tmw0fRyj6PK2d7FEz-trh2LVpK1_HF_D6iZL4DLvF8i9lapC5ww17DlpeVZP-WObKYyXnRdfiC9l2ZEj-NBm283kCfFMOSKZ4/s934/Screenshot%202024-08-19%20at%208.35.05%E2%80%AFPM.png"><img data-original-height="748" data-original-width="934" height="256" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeEaxOHc5HuYA0hTT59YiH5QGxhLf8PFecO9BxDuzlepqbga92sr2BsuzAKJskN2AeWJax_PhovffWr1fJD4uSGOlKr5Tmw0fRyj6PK2d7FEz-trh2LVpK1_HF_D6iZL4DLvF8i9lapC5ww17DlpeVZP-WObKYyXnRdfiC9l2ZEj-NBm283kCfFMOSKZ4/s320/Screenshot%202024-08-19%20at%208.35.05%E2%80%AFPM.png" width="320"></a></p><p>The paper gets back to the flight example, but this time from the POV of the backend database in Fig 2. It says that "Such “splattering” of data decreases the usability of the database in terms of schema comprehension, join computation, and query expression."&nbsp;</p><p>Actually Figure 2 doesn't look that bad, but things devolve from there. "The users will have to stitch the information back together to answer most of the real queries. The fundamental issue is that joins destroy the connections between information pertaining to the same real world entities and are nonintuitive to most normal users. We note that many commercial database systems carefully denormalize their schema to reduce the number of joins required, although the purpose there is to speed up query evaluation. Finally, queries become painful to express across multiple tables. Because joins innately disrupt data cohesion, such queries are problematic for many users. For example, consider a query as simple as “Find all flights from Detroit to Beijing” in our airline database. <b>Even though we are interested only in information about flights, the city names that specify the selection predicate are found only in the airports relation, which must be joined twice with flight info to express our query.</b>"</p><p>The paper mentions that: "The current solution to manage this pain is to hire database administrators (DBAs) and offer them copious amounts of money not to leave once they have learned the company’s database schema well."</p><h2>The other pains</h2><p>Painful options: Too many options overwhelms users. While simplicity is crucial for novices, experts require advanced tools. The challenge lies in balancing functionality for diverse user needs without cluttering the interface.</p><p>Unexpected pains: Systems often produce confusing results without explanation. Users need clear insights into why outcomes differ from their expectations. This requires transparent system behavior, explainability, and intuitive error messaging.</p><p>Unseen pain: The lack of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interfaces makes query formulation difficult. Real-time, predictive capabilities during query construction help users refine searches effectively. This involves instant feedback and suggestions as users type.</p><p>Birthing pain: Creating and populating databases is complex for ordinary users. They struggle with schema design and data reorganization for existing structures. Simplifying these processes without sacrificing database integrity is crucial.</p><h2>The painless future</h2><p>There is no silver bullet. Of course, you knew this, because database usability is a wicked problem. The paper makes some suggestions, and leaves it at that.&nbsp;</p><p>Presentation data models: Expand the concept of views beyond tables to support various presentation data models (object, geographic, network, multidimensional, tabular). This flexibility would allow users to interact with data in formats most suitable for their needs.</p><p>Integrated Provenance: Incorporate data provenance (both "why" and "where") into presentation models. This feature would help users understand the origin and transformations of their data, enhancing transparency and trust in results.</p><p>Intuitive Interaction: Develop presentation data models capable of direct manipulation through familiar actions like point-and-click and drag-and-drop. This approach would make databases more accessible to non-technical users, reducing the learning curve.</p><p>Flexible Schema Design: Support "schema-later" and "heterogeneous" database creation, allowing users to start with unstructured data and add structure as needed. This flexibility would enable faster database setup and evolution as requirements change.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Ok, it is 17 years after the publication of this paper. Where are we at in terms of database usability? What were the biggest improvements you can think of? What were the steps taken to reduce the friction?</p><p>The Designing Data Intensive Applications Book (2017) goes into <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/08/designing-data-intensive-applications.html">usability/maintainability discussion a bit in Chapters 1 and 2.</a> It compares relational model and document model. It also talks about Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks a bit. But it seems like we are still long way from making databases usable.&nbsp;</p><p>If nothing else, since we had to make database systems also distributed systems we added to these problems, especially for the operationalization of databases. We opened Pandora's box in terms of partial failures, unexplained performance problems due to geo-distribution, data migration, storage disaggregation, and metastable failures. Well we have our work cut out for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, let's look at this more optimistically and consider recent developments that may be beneficial. How about LLMs? LLMs may help, but if not used intentionally in a principled manner, they make more of a mess. They would be adding to the painful options, unexpected pains. They probably can't do much to address the unseen pain, and maybe do a probabilistic (best effort) job in addressing birthing pain, which may make things worse. But applied in a principled way, I believe LLMs can go a long way to improve database usability. It is someone else's paper to write, and when this is written, I will be interested in learning from it.&nbsp;</p>
