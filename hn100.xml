    <p>If you are reading this message, the experiment below is still ongoing. This page was served to you by a real Nintendo Wii.</p>
<p>You can check the Wii’s <a href="https://blog.infected.systems/status">live status page</a> for system load info.</p>
  </div>

<p>For a long time, I’ve enjoyed the idea of running general-purpose operating systems on decidedly not-general-purpose hardware.</p>
<p>There’s been a few good examples of this over the years, including a few which were officially sanctioned by the OEM. Back in the day, my PS3 ran <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yellow-dog-linux-on-ps3-actually-works/">Yellow Dog Linux</a>, and I’ve been searching for a (decently priced) copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_PlayStation_2">PS2 Linux</a> for 10+ years at this point.</p>
<p>There are some other good unofficial examples, such as <a href="https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/02/dusting-off-dreamcast-linux.html">Dreamcast Linux</a>, or <a href="https://psplinux.info/files/">PSPLinux</a>.</p>
<p>But what a lot of these systems have in common is that they’re now very outdated. Or they’re hobbyist ports that someone got running once and where longer-term support never made it upstream. The PSP Linux kernel image was last built in 2008, and Dreamcast Linux is even more retro, using a 2.4.5 kernel built in 2001.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen many of these projects where I’d be comfortable running one as part of an actual production workload. Until now.</p>
<p>While browsing <a href="https://netbsd.org/">the NetBSD website</a> recently, I noticed the fact that there was a ‘Wii’ option listed right there on the front page in the ‘Install Media’ section, nestled right next to the other first-class targets like the Raspberry Pi, and generic x86 machines.</p>
<p>Unlike the other outdated and unmaintained examples above, clicking through to the NetBSD Wii port takes you to the latest stable NetBSD 10.1 release from Dec 2024. Even the <a href="https://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/latest/evbppc/binary/gzimg/">daily HEAD builds</a> are composed for the Wii.</p>
<p>As soon as I discovered this was fully supported and maintained, I knew I had to try deploying an actual production workload on it. That workload is the blog you’re reading now.</p>
<h3 id="finding-a-sacrificial-wii">Finding a sacrificial Wii</h3>
<p>Our story begins at the EMF Camp 2024 Swap Shop - your premier source for pre-loved game consoles, cardboard boxes full of 56k modems, and radioactive orphan sources.</p>

<p>I picked this up expecting to use it for homebrew games and emulation mostly, but I don’t think it expected this fate.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-fast-enough">Is it fast enough?</h3>
<p>So we have a spare Wii. And an OS with mainline support. But is a Wii actually fast enough to handle this as a production workload?</p>
<p>The single-core ‘Broadway’ CPU in the Wii is part of IBM’s continued evolution of the PowerPC 750 lineup, dating all the way back to Apple’s iconic 1998 Bondi Blue fishtank iMac. Although Broadway is one of the later 750 revisions, the commercially-available equivalent chip - the PowerPC 750CL - has a maximum TDP of only 9.8 W, and clocks about 33% higher than the version in the Wii.</p>
<p>So with a single-core chip based on a late-90s architecture and a TDP well under 10 W, it’s clear that we’re probably fairly contstrained here in terms of compute performance.</p>
<p>With that said, one of the other PowerPC 750 deployments you might be familiar with is currently floating 1,500,000 km from Earth mapping the deepest reaches of the universe in more detail than humanity has ever seen before. So if I can’t get this thing serving a static website, then I think it’s probably time to execute on my long-term plan of retiring from tech and opening a cat cafe.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, you can read about the James Wii Space Telescope’s use of the PowerPC 750 <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150019915/downloads/20150019915.pdf">in this NASA presentation</a>. The 750 actually gets a lot of use in spaceflight and satellite applications because there is a radiation-hardened version available, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750">RAD750</a>. Some other recent uses of the chip include both the Mars <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)">Curiosity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseverance_(rover)">Perseverance</a> rovers.</p>
<h3 id="installing-netbsd-on-the-wii">Installing NetBSD on the Wii</h3>
<p>Okay, Nintendo lawyers avert your eyes.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since I softmodded a Wii. I remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BlpONgj74A">Twilight Hack</a>, which involved exploiting a buffer overflow in the <em>Twilight Princess</em> save game handler to run unsigned code.</p>
<p>Things are much easier these days. The <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wilbrand">Wilbrand exploit</a> seems to be what people generally recommend now. Like some other exploits, it takes advantage of the fact that an SD card can be used to store and retrieve messages from the Wii Message Board. Exploting this allows unsigned code execution, which allows us to boot the <a href="https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/HackMii_Installer_Wii">HackMii</a> tool that installs the Homebrew Channel.</p>
<p>It’s an easy mod which just requires knowing the MAC address of the console and generating a few files to load from an SD card. There’s a handy browser-based tool <a href="https://wilbrand.donut.eu.org/">here</a> which does all of the hard work for you.</p>
<p>I did have some issues using a larger SDHC card to run the Wilbrand exploit, but had the best luck with a 1GB non-SDHC card. SD card compatibility <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/SD/SDHC_card_compatibility_tests">seems to be a known issue</a> for Wii homebrew, but overall I’d still call the process fairly painless.</p>
<p>Once we’ve hacked the console, we should have the Homebrew Channel available in our Wii Menu:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/wiimenu.jpg" alt="The Homebrew Channel now available on the Wii Menu">
</figure>



<p>Now we can prepare our NetBSD SD card. We do this by downloading the <code>wii.img.gz</code> image from the <a href="https://netbsd.org/">front page of the NetBSD site</a>.</p>
<p>For this card, I opted to use a fairly speedy 32GB SDHC card. The Wii doesn’t support SDXC or newer cards, which means we’re limited to 32GB. Larger flash devices also <em>generally</em> tend to be faster and more resilient than smaller ones. And NetBSD seems a lot less bothered by living on a larger card than the Wilbrand exploit was. So overall I’d recommend getting a decent quality fast 32GB card if you want to try this.</p>
<p>We can unpack and write this image however we please, but I’m a fan of using the Raspberry Pi Imager because it’ll do the work of extracting the image and verifying it post-write for us:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/pi-imager.png" alt="Using the Raspberry Pi Imager to write and verify the image">
</figure>



<p>At this point, things are very easy. The NetBSD Wii image has all the necessary metadata &amp; structure needed to boot directly from the Homebrew Channel as if it were any other kind of homebrew app. I think there’s a lot of credit due here to <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jmcwhatever">NetBSD developer Jared McNeill</a>, who seems to be the main author of the Wii port.</p>
<p>Placing our SD card in the console and launching the Homebrew Channel is all we need to do to prepare ourselves to launch NetBSD:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/homebrew.jpg" alt="NetBSD, ready to launch">
</figure>



<p>Once booted into NetBSD, we can use a USB keyboard just fine, but it will be easiest to get SSH working so we can manage the system remotely. The SSH daemon is already running out-of-the-box, so the only changes we need to make are to set a password for the <code>root</code> user and then enable logging in as root by adding <code>PermitRootLogin yes</code> to the <code>sshd_config</code>.</p>
<p>You could set up an unprivileged user or do anything else you fancy here but I was keen to get SSH going ASAP, as due to <del>the absence of HDMI-enabled screens in my server-area</del> laziness I was doing this bit using a capture card and Photo Booth on macOS which doesn’t actually support disabling the image-flip on the video feed:</p>

</figure>



<p>If you thought it was hard to exit Vim, try doing it back to front.</p>
<p>After installation, I set a static network config by editing <code>/etc/ifconfig.axe0</code> and restarted the host.</p>
<p>On that note, I’m using the official RVL-015 Wii LAN Adapter. I went to great lengths to track down one of these for a decent price for the best chance of compatibility. On reflection, this probably wasn’t needed as by the time we’re booted into NetBSD we should have all of NetBSD’s drivers available to us, so I expect most generic USB adapters would probably work (in theory!).</p>
<p>If anyone is wondering though, here are the specifics of the adapter and chipset, taken from <code>dmesg</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>[     2.089988] axe0 at uhub2 port 1

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="package-management">Package management</h3>
<p>After restarting, I installed NetBSD’s <code>pkgin</code> package manager by setting some env vars and then using <code>pkg_add pkgin</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"/usr/pkg/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>export</span> <span>PKG_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/evbppc/10.1/All/"</span>
</span></span><span><span>pkg_add pkgin
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After this, I was able to use pkgin to install a bunch of useful packages - most importantly including our <code>lighttpd</code> web server, which I’ve picked due to it being slim and well-suited for resource constrained environments:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>pkgin install bsdfetch iperf3 lighttpd nano rsync
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After that, I copied the basic <code>lighttpd</code> sample config, and enabled and started it:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cp -fv /usr/pkg/share/examples/rc.d/lighttpd /etc/rc.d
</span></span><span><span><span>echo</span> <span>'lighttpd=YES'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span><span><span>/etc/rc.d/lighttpd start
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By default, <code>lighttpd</code> is set up to serve static content from <code>/srv/www/htdocs</code>. Since my blog is a collection of static pages built with Hugo, I was able to simply <code>rsync</code> these files over and within seconds I had the system serving my site over standard HTTP.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-fast-enough-addendum">Is it fast enough? (addendum)</h3>
<p>Alright, you got me. It turns out that while a PPC 750 might be enough to map the futhest reaches of the universe, a bit of soak testing suggests it does struggle a bit when trying to concurrently serve a lot of pages encrypted with modern TLS.</p>
<p>I tried freeing up resources by disabling a bunch of services I don’t need that are running out of the box on NetBSD:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sed -i <span>'s/^dhcpcd=.*/dhcpcd=NO/'</span> /etc/rc.conf <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'dhcpcd=NO'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span><span><span>sed -i <span>'s/^inetd=.*/inetd=NO/'</span> /etc/rc.conf <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'inetd=NO'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span><span><span>sed -i <span>'s/^mdnsd=.*/mdnsd=NO/'</span> /etc/rc.conf <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'mdnsd=NO'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span><span><span>sed -i <span>'s/^postfix=.*/postfix=NO/'</span> /etc/rc.conf <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'postfix=NO'</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I also disabled <code>ntpd</code>, which was using a staggering 15% of the whole system’s RAM:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>USER PID  %CPU %MEM COMMAND
</span></span><span><span>root 9161  0.0 15.6 /usr/sbin/ntpd -p /var/run/ntpd.pid -g
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately it seems <code>ntpd</code> is definitely necessary to keep the system clock in-check. I’m not sure whether the Wii just drifts a lot, whether it’s specific to NetBSD on the Wii, or whether the clock battery in what may be a nearly 20 year old console has given up but I got some interesting and quite indignant sounding error messages after disabling this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/preposterous.jpg" alt="The world needs more indignant sounding error messages like this">
</figure>



<p>To compensate, I cheated by adding <code>ntpd -q -g</code> to the main <code>crontab</code>, so the system would run it hourly at <code>:42</code> min past the hour. We still get timesync, but we don’t need to sacrifice a sixth of our RAM keeping it resident:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>42    *       *       *       *       /usr/sbin/ntpd -q -g
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Even after freeing up the resources above, it seems like serving multiple encrypted requests in parallel was a struggle for the 750, so I opted to move the TLS termination for the blog to a Caddy instance sitting in front of the Wii.</p>
<p>I have Caddy acting as a reverse proxy to the Wii, handling encryption and cert management with ACME. <strong>Importantly, there are no caching options enabled in Caddy. Every request the site serves is being serviced directly by the Wii</strong> - including the large number of images on this post which I’ll almost certainly regret adding. I optimised as much as I could, but this page is still almost exactly 1 MB when all of the content is loaded.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/caddy.jpg" alt="Shitpost diagram of Caddy reverse proxy">
</figure>



<p>Through this method, I’ve also been able to sinkhole LLM slop-scrapers at Caddy’s level, by dropping requests from <a href="https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt/blob/main/robots.txt">known scraper User Agents</a> before they’re forwarded to the Wii. Hopefully that might help to keep our single core chugging along without too much distress.</p>
<h3 id="status-monitoring">Status monitoring</h3>
<p>Moving the SSL termination to Caddy also gives me the advantage of enabling Caddy’s Prometheus exporter, so I can load it into my InfluxDB + Grafana stack and monitor site load without putting a bunch of additional stress on the Wii.</p>
<p>But I’m still interested (and I’m sure you are too) in monitoring the general state of the Wii resources as this post goes live.</p>
<p>Considering I had to disable the NTP client for using too much RAM, I think running something like a Prometheus exporter directly on the Wii is right out of the window to begin with. So I put together a simple shell script that runs from the <code>crontab</code> every 15 min, outputting some system stats to a basic HTML file in the webroot.</p>

<p>Honestly, this worked way better and was far easier than I was expecting. Naturally, there are some downsides to the setup here though.</p>
<p>Rebooting NetBSD reboots the whole console, and not just the NetBSD ‘app’, so you’ll find yourself back at the Wii Menu after any kernel patch or system upgrade. Yes, this does mean that the Wiimote and sensor bar in your server cupboard are now a vital component of the production infrastructure.</p>
<p>I was reasonably pleased with the power consumption too. Some testing based on stats from my UPS monitoring suggest that when idling, the Wii is adding a fairly consistent ~18 W to my overall homelab usage.</p>
<p>By my calculations, that means I can expect the Wii to use ~13.2 kWh/month, which on my fairly expensive UK power tariff comes out to around £3.47/month - which does actually make this cheaper than most of the VPSes I can find around the obvious cloud providers. So when you’re looking for your next VPS… you know what to consider.</p>
<p>This was a fun experiment for a rainy day over a long weekend. I’ll probably keep it going for a while if it actually continues to work as well as it started. I’m often interested in applying artificial constraints to the things I deploy, as I find that’s when I learn best.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe I’ll have been forced to become an expert in NetBSD TCP kernel tunables by this time next week…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit today against Uber, alleging the rideshare and delivery company charged consumers for its Uber One subscription service without their consent, failed to deliver promised savings, and made it difficult for users to cancel the service despite its “cancel anytime” promises.</p><p>“Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,” said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson. “The Trump-Vance FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people. Today, we’re alleging that Uber not only deceived consumers about their subscriptions, but also made it unreasonably difficult for customers to cancel.”</p><p>In its <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/uber-ftc-v-timeline-item-2025-04-21" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="507f8cc6-ae69-4735-a845-328330233ba4" data-entity-substitution="canonical">complaint</a>, the FTC alleges that Uber used deceptive billing and cancellation practices. For example, the complaint alleges:</p><ul><li>When signing up for Uber One, customers are wrongly promised savings of $25 a month. Even if that were true, Uber does not account for the cost of the subscription (up to $9.99/month) when calculating those savings. The company also obscures material information about the subscription (for example, by using small, greyed out text which consumers can easily miss). Many consumers say they were enrolled without consent; the complaint quotes one consumer saying they were charged despite not even having an Uber account.</li><li>After sign-up, Uber charges consumers before their billing date. For example, some consumers who signed up for a free trial say they were automatically charged for the service before the free trial ended even though Uber promises customers the ability to cancel at no charge during the trial period.</li><li>When customers try to cancel, Uber makes it extremely difficult. Users can be forced to navigate as many as 23 screens and take as many as 32 actions to cancel. If a customer tries to proceed with cancellation, Uber can require them to say why they want to cancel, urge them to pause their membership or, if that failed, present them with offers to stay. Some users are told they have to contact customer support to cancel but are given no way to contact them; others claim that Uber charged them for another billing cycle after they requested cancellation and were waiting to hear back from customer support.</li></ul><p>The FTC alleges that the company’s deceptive billing and cancellation practices violate the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act (ROSCA), which requires online retailers to clearly disclose the terms of the service they are selling, obtain consumers’ consent before charging them for a service, and provide a simple way to cancel a recurring subscription.</p><p>The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint was 2-0-1 with Commissioner Mark R. Meador recused. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.</p><p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the named defendants are violating or are about to violate the law and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court.</p><p>The lead attorneys on this matter are Stephanie Liebner, James Doty, and Paul Mezan in the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Dia has been tested on only GPUs (pytorch 2.0+, CUDA 12.6). CPU support is to be added soon.
The initial run will take longer as the Descript Audio Codec also needs to be downloaded.</p>
<p dir="auto">On enterprise GPUs, Dia can generate audio in real-time. On older GPUs, inference time will be slower.
For reference, on a A4000 GPU, Dia rougly generates 40 tokens/s (86 tokens equals 1 second of audio).
<code>torch.compile</code> will increase speeds for supported GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">The full version of Dia requires around 10GB of VRAM to run. We will be adding a quantized version in the future.</p>

</center>
<p>Trust is everything. Social media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasn’t always given us the tools to know who we’re interacting with or why we should trust them.</p>
<p>In 2023, we launched our first layer of verification: letting individuals and organizations <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">set their domain as their username</a>. Since then, over 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to their website. Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky. At the same time, we've heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.</p>
<p><strong>Now, we’re introducing a new layer — a user-friendly, easily recognizable blue check</strong>. Bluesky will proactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their names. Additionally, <strong>through our Trusted Verifiers feature, select independent organizations can verify accounts directly</strong>. Bluesky will review these verifications as well to ensure authenticity.</p>
<center>

  <figcaption>A verified Bluesky account with a blue check.</figcaption>
</center>
<h2>Trusted Verifiers</h2>
<p>Blue checks issued by platforms are just one form of trust. But trust doesn’t come only from the top down; it emerges from relationships, communities, and shared context.</p>
<p>So, we’re also enabling <strong>trusted verifiers</strong>: organizations that can directly issue blue checks. Trusted verifiers are marked by scalloped blue checks, as shown below.</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/nyt-verification-illustration.png" alt="The New York Times account is a trusted verifier with a scalloped blue check" width="700">
  <figcaption>The New York Times account is a trusted verifier with a scalloped blue check.</figcaption>
</center>
<p>For example, the New York Times can now issue blue checks to its journalists directly in the app. Bluesky’s moderation team reviews each verification to ensure authenticity.</p>
<p>When you tap on a verified account's blue check, you’ll see which organizations have granted verification.</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/paul-verification.png" alt="Paul Frazee's account is verified by Bluesky" width="700">
  <figcaption>Tap on the blue check to see which organization verified the user.</figcaption>
</center>
<p>You can also choose to hide verification within the app — navigate to Settings &gt; Moderation &gt; Verification Settings to toggle it off.</p>
<h2>How to Get Verified on Bluesky</h2>
<p>You can self-verify by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">setting your domain as your username</a>. We highly encourage official organizations and individuals to do this.</p>
<p>During this initial phase, Bluesky is not accepting direct applications for verification. As this feature stabilizes, we’ll launch a request form for notable and authentic accounts interested in becoming verified or becoming trusted verifiers.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Decades later, a generation of adoptees wrestles with the aftermath.</p></div></div><p>In 1975, to hear the Americans tell it, the mass adoption of Vietnamese children was a story of rescue and redemption. These children were war babies, bụi đời, children of dust. A decade of death coupled with a thriving sex trade near US military bases had put nearly 20,000 children in more than a hundred orphanages throughout South Vietnam. By April, as the Viet Cong swept down the coast, mixed race children were said to be in danger. The Northern army would find foreign offspring and carve their livers from their bodies to eat, or so the rumors went. Out of fear and desperation, mothers relinquished their babies — many underweight, sick, or maimed by war — to the Americans.

Ford described the babylift as a humanitarian “mission of mercy.” It was, just as importantly, a deflection from military defeat and abandonment. A month later, 2,894 Vietnamese and Cambodian children were on their way to American homes; approximately 1,300 others were adopted to Australia, Canada, and across Europe.</p><p>Some of the first children were flown away on a C-5A Galaxy transport aircraft, a plane whose interior could rival a gymnasium. Orphanage workers loaded the cargo hold with 200-plus children, an endeavor “like trying to carry loose eggs in the bed of a pickup truck,” as journalist Dana Sachs described in her book, <em>The Life We Were Given</em>. Twelve minutes after takeoff, a door in the rear of the plane blew out, ripping a hole in the side of the plane. The plane crashed into a rice paddy, crushing the cargo hold where the children were kept — 138 died, including 78 babies.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1290" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog6-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Cover of The New York Daily News on April 5, 1975.

Subsequent flights evacuated more than 2,5000 children to the US and other countries for adoption.</p><p>Photo by Sal Veder / AP Photo</p></div></div></div><p>Operation Babylift continued without a breath. The next day, 324 children, including survivors from the previous day’s crash, were loaded onto a commercial Pan Am flight. This time, babies in white pajamas were packaged neatly in cardboard boxes. Boxes with babies were wedged under seats like carry-on luggage. Some babies were buckled into the red-and-yellow plane seats, slumped over like little dolls. In the ensuing weeks, the seven US and international adoption organizations in Vietnam competed to ensure space on planes for the children in their care.</p><p>A South Vietnamese lieutenant gave this bitter statement to the <em>New York Times</em>: “It is nice to see you Americans bringing home souvenirs of our country as you leave — china elephants and orphans. Too bad some of them broke … but we have plenty more.”</p><p>Americans had adopted children from abroad in previous decades, most notably from South Korea, but Operation Babylift created a story around adoption that transformed the displacement of a foreign baby to an American home into an act of charity. Out of the horrors of war came an opportunity for benevolence and absolution. “Everyone suffers in a war, but no one suffers more than the children, and the airlift was the least that we could do,” Ford wrote in his autobiography. This narrative has never been without its critics — Grace Paley, writing for <em>Ms. Magazine</em> at the time of the babylift, called it “a cynical political game” — but even those who acknowledged the alarming messiness of the campaign’s logistics thought of the adoptions themselves as a win-win. A Massachusetts senator put it this way: “Very simplistically, it is better to live in elitism in the United States than to be dead in Vietnam.”</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="790" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/GettyImages-2206801760-min.jpg"></p><div><p>Babies on an Operation Babylift flight.</p><p>Photo by Jean-Claude FRANCOLON/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="622" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog8-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Fifty-two Vietnamese children arrive in a World Airways plane at Oakland Airport in California.</p><p>Photo by Jerry Telfer/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="688" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog9-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Inside Ambulance at San Francisco International Airport, Medical Staff Arrival of Operation Babylift Plane from South Vietnam.

Nhu Miller, a Vietnamese woman who was living nearby, came to the Presidio to interpret for the older children and found that some didn’t know where they were. They wanted to see their parents, siblings, grandparents. “When can I go home?” they asked. In the chaos, many lacked identifying documents; their papers had been lost, mixed up, or fabricated. “I went to help and saw people were just picking them out like puppies,” Miller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/booming/from-lucky-encounter-in-vietnam-to-40-years-married.html">said later</a>.</p><p>How one viewed the babylift — as a mission to save children or to abduct them — depended in part on how one defined the purpose of adoption. Was it to provide <em>for</em> a child or to <em>provide a child</em> to eager Western parents? FCVN and other adoption agencies, as well as prospective parents, persisted with their adoptions in defiance of evidence that some children had other alternatives. They offered their belief in the restorative power of a loving family as reasoning. “Let’s forget the politics and think of the kids,” said one adoptive parent of an Operation Babylift child. This attitude prevails today. </p><p>The children’s birth mothers were rarely given consideration. Yet some refused to be forgotten. One mother, Anh Thi Hoang Doan, arrived as a refugee at Camp Pendleton in Southern California, four months after entrusting her seven children to FCVN in the belief that the agency would transport her children safely to the United States. She’d planned to join them. She explained these conditions to the agency, and — not intending to give her children up — she did not sign an adoption release. Once in California, Doan found several of her children quickly. A fifth child, Binh, had been adopted by a couple in Iowa. The couple refused to return the boy. Doan sued for custody, and the couple appealed. Finally, after 18 months, she won Binh back. Her last child, Than, was lost in the shuffle of FCVN. Doan died in 2021, having never found him.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1212" height="857" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.sbnation.com/csk/uploads/verge-features/american-war/articles/babylift/spot/babylift_spot_1-min.png"></p></div><div><p>“What is my face? Who are my people? Where do I come from?”
</p></div></div><p>The mission of Operation Babylift concluded with the arrival of the Vietnamese babies to their American homes. For the humanitarians and the new parents, this made for a happy ending. But as the children grew up, their stories continued on to other endings.</p><p>“My adoption was not one of those happy, wonderful stories,” Lynelle Long told me. She was taken from Vietnam to Australia at five months old, in 1973. She was not formally adopted until she was in her late teens. “I suffered years of abuse,” she said. Long gave a testimonial last year to the Australian minister of immigration, in which she spoke about suffering sexual abuse by several family members. Two years ago, her adoptive father pleaded guilty to the abuse, and Long legally annulled her adoption. In her passport, “place of birth” had always been listed as Australia. She finally changed it to the truthful location: Vietnam.</p><p>Australia did not have a history of adoption before the Vietnam War, so Long was among the first children to arrive in the country. Back then, no one talked about adoption. “I just grew up feeling strange, weird, isolated, very alone,” she told me. When Long was in her early 20s, she went looking for a meeting like Alcoholics Anonymous for adoptees from abroad. There was none. She joined one group for domestic adoptees, but when she attended she found that they didn’t talk about the experience of looking different from their white families or about facing a daily undercurrent of racism. She asked the group organizers if they ever heard from other adopted people like her. A few came around now and again, they told her. She gave them her name and number and told them to share it when they did. A couple years later, Long, then working at IBM, transformed these chance connections into an online group for anyone around the world who’s been adopted to a foreign country.</p><p>InterCountry Adoptee Voices became a lifeline for adopted people looking for legal advice, help with mental health problems, and information about how to find their birth families — none of which was provided by governments in the years after the babylifts. The United States does not provide welfare checks on internationally adopted children, opening them up to potential harm. In 2022, research on a group of around 800 South Korean adoptees found that a third of them were abused by their adoptive families. The US government also does not collect information about the wellbeing of adopted children later in life. Yet teenagers who were transnationally adopted are far more likely to suffer serious mental health disorders than children who were not adopted. “As a taken child, I was never in any position to defend or protect myself. I had no voice,” Long said in her testimonial.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="705" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog11-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Children on the first Operation Babylift flight.</p><p>Photo by AP Photo/File</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="1210" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog12-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Babies on an Operation Babylift flight.</p><p>Courtesy Gerald R.

The jet was specially chartered by Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner.</p><p>Photo by Bettmann Archive / Getty Images</p></div></div></div><p>Not every adoption story is so sobering, but even children who are placed in happy families tend to grow up with complicated feelings about their histories. In 2000, a sociology student named Indigo Willing started one of the first groups for people adopted from Vietnam, called Adopted Vietnamese International (AVI). Willing was adopted from Vietnam to the suburbs of Sydney in 1972. Her family was loving, she told me, but that didn’t make her forget how she got there. She likened adopted people to lost souls wandering the earth, searching for answers.</p><p>“There’s not a day that I don’t look in the mirror and I wonder, ‘What is my face? Who are my people? Where do I come from?’” she told me. AVI is now a Facebook group of around 2,000 members, where people share baby photos and scans of government flight rosters. They list the names of their birth mothers and 50-year-old addresses, asking, “If you know anything, please let me know.” They fundraise for trips back to Vietnam to hand out DNA kits, in the hopes of expanding the databank of birth families. They organize heritage tours. Willing has traveled back to Vietnam, but she’s never found her birth parents.</p><p>Many of the adopted people I spoke to described themselves as fundamentally incomplete. The parts of their lives that are absent from memory loom as large as the parts that are present. “My narrative is the source of who I am and yet also a reminder of what I am not and do not have. I’m in between a complete story and a story that will never be fully known,” Bert Ballard, who was flown out from Saigon’s An Lac orphanage at three weeks old, wrote in an <a href="https://www.inheritancemag.com/stories/in-between-the-already-but-not-yet">anthology of adoption stories</a>.</p><p>It is for this reason that some adopted people find the closest sense of family among other adoptees. In the Facebook groups, adoptees will sometimes call each other brother and sister. “You guys are my homeland,” said one Korean adoptee to a room of other adoptees at a 2018 conference.</p><p>Jane Joy was adopted from Saigon in 1973 and grew up in a white family in western New York. A few years ago, she founded a Facebook group called Vietnamese Adoptees that she restricted to adopted people only. She told me that so often the good intentions and the injured feelings of adoptive parents end up circumscribing what their adopted children feel permitted to talk about. “I remember being seven or eight years old, and it felt like it physically hurt to not look like my family. I remember saying to my mom, ‘I just wish I had blonde hair, blue eyes.’ She didn’t understand,” Joy told me. “To her, my perspective didn’t make sense. <em>Oh, but you’re different.</em> I didn’t want to be different. That was the last thing I wanted.”</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1297" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog13-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Flight crew members assist Vietnamese children on an Operation Babylift flight to the Philippines.</p><p>Courtesy Gerald R.

Ford Presidential Library</p></div></div></div><p>Long, Willing, and Joy are part of what’s often called the first generation of Vietnamese adoptees, people now in their 50s and 60s. For decades after the war, the most widely circulated first-person accounts of the babylifts were memoirs written by humanitarian workers like Cherie Clark, and the events held to commemorate the babylifts were put on by adoption agencies and airline companies. But as the first generation of adoptees came of age, they began to articulate their own perspectives. After groping the dark to find each other, adoptees formed a common language for their experience. They talk about “coming out of the fog” — learning to question the white savior narrative so often handed down by their birth parents. They’ve published memoirs, made documentaries and films. Many have managed to find and reunite with their birth families. They’ve created a counternarrative of adoption that acknowledges the reality of grief, loss, and anger in their stories.</p><p>The recent book <em>Somewhere Sisters</em> by journalist Erika Hayasaki follows the remarkable full story of an adoption, from birth to relocation, to reunion and its aftermath. In Nha Trang in 1998, a 26-year-old Vietnamese woman named Liên bears twin daughters prematurely. Both are ill, weighing less than four pounds. Liên has neither job nor home, and the father is gone. She brings the twins to a nearby orphanage, which accepts one girl, named Loan. Liên’s other daughter, Hà, she entrusts to the care of her sister. Over the next three years, Liên intermittently visits her daughters. One day, she comes by the orphanage and is told that Loan has been adopted by an American family. She is not told their names, but we learn they are the Solimenes, a wealthy family living in a large house in a Chicago suburb. The adoption was motivated by the mother Keely, who, in the wake of 9/11, wanted to do something good and meaningful for the world.</p><p>Hà, meanwhile, lives a poor but happy childhood in her village. At the age of 13, Loan finally reunites with her sister Hà and mother Liên after years of effort on Keely’s part. Her persistence at finding Hà and Liên — procuring interpreters, pursuing leads, and visiting Nha Trang in person several times — is a generous act, but it also makes clear how fully the adoptive family is in control of reunion. Keely makes it happen, though only according to her motivations and on her schedule. Early on, Liên writes Keely a letter to tell her she desires to reconnect with Loan. But Keely will not be ready for six more years. She does not reply.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1212" height="857" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.sbnation.com/csk/uploads/verge-features/american-war/articles/babylift/spot/babylift_spot_2-min.png"></p></div><div><p>After groping in the dark to find each other, adoptees formed a common language for their experience
</p></div></div><p>The United States has absorbed more adopted children than every other country put together. In 2004, at the peak of international adoption, American families adopted almost 23,000 children. Since then, international adoptions to the US have decreased by more than 90 percent, largely due to Hague Convention regulations intended to eliminate trafficking. In other countries, the narrative around adoption has soured. Ethiopia was sending a couple thousand children to the US a year when the abuse and death of a 10-year-old girl pushed the country to ban all international adoptions. Today, the country’s official policy is that every Ethiopian child should grow up in Ethiopia. China — the country that has cumulatively sent the most children to the US — ceased overseas adoptions last year. When international adoptions do take place, Hague Convention guidelines suggest that the process should be regulated and that contact information for the birth family is preserved and made available if the child desires it.</p><p>There are currently more than a million people in Western countries who were adopted from abroad, including a predominantly Asian American population of adult adoptees in the United States. It’s a group of people unique in history. The first generation has found their voice; the youngest cohort is now coming of age. They are in the unique position, too, of seeing with clear eyes how the cherished American institution of family is offered up or withheld for political aim. </p><p>One of the primary issues facing some American adoptees today is, appallingly, being denied citizenship. Until 2001, foreign adoptions in the US were routed through the same legal pathway as for domestic adoptions. The result was that naturalizing the foreign-born children did not happen as part of that process. Parents had to apply for their children’s citizenship separately, and many of them were either never informed or never did it.</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="822" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog15-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>President Gerald Ford holds a Vietnamese baby that arrived in the US on one of the Operation Babylift flights to San Francisco.</p><p>Courtesy Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library</p></div></div><p>Kris Larsen’s parents did apply for his American citizenship after they adopted him in Guam from an Operation Babylift flight. They assumed he received it, because they didn’t hear otherwise. But his paperwork was never processed. In 2012, Larsen was in his early 40s and serving a prison sentence in Seattle when an ICE check flagged him. The news that he wasn’t a US citizen made no sense to him. “I kind of laughed it off because I was like, ‘That’s impossible. I’ve been here all my life,’” he told me. His family told him it was a mistake and not to worry. On his release, when his family went to the prison to meet him, ICE picked him up instead. He was on their deportation list.</p><p>In 2000, Congress passed legislation to grant citizenship to all adopted children who were under 18. But the law did not apply to adopted adults, including the Operation Babylift cohort and thousands of other adoptees from Korea, China, and other countries.</p><p>Talking to Larsen, I made the mistake of referring to his situation as “undocumented.” He quickly corrected me. He has never been undocumented. In 2022, he petitioned for a pardon, which he received, and was reissued a green card. Now, in his 50s, he is in the process of applying for citizenship.</p><p>About 10 years ago, after the widely publicized deportations of a couple of Korean adoptees, one of whom committed suicide, a movement formed to lobby for legislation that would grant citizenship to adoptees who’d been left out of the 2000 law — a group that potentially numbers in the thousands. The proposed bill, the Adoptee Citizenship Act, has not passed. Conservative opponents categorize it as an undesirable “immigration bill” and demand that adopted people with criminal records and the many dozen adoptees who have already been deported be excluded from the bill.</p><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="604" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog16-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Fifty-two Vietnamese children arrive in a World Airways plane at Oakland Airport in California.</p><p>Photo by Jerry Telfer/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="680" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/fog17-min.jpeg"></p><div><p>Babies on an Operation Babylift flight.</p><p>Photo by Peter O’Loughlin/AP Photo</p></div></div></div><p>Monte Haines is one such person. He was deported to South Korea in 2009. Five ICE agents escorted him off the plane, put $20 in his pocket, and left. It was November. Haines was wearing a T-shirt and shorts. He had no luggage, no phone, no ID. He did not speak Korean. For three weeks, he slept under a bridge and ate from the trash. “It’s like ping-pong,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf7bj6nuh5s">he said at a panel</a> a few years ago. “First the Korean government sent me to the US, then from the US they sent me back to Korea.”</p><p>The children of Operation Babylift, and all other descendants of American war, are both adoptees and refugees. But they are not voluntary immigrants, and they are not foreigners. The denial of citizenship to adopted Americans like Larsen and Haines reveals that the beneficent embrace of the American family was always conditional, coming at the cost of more vulnerable families and even the children themselves. Adoption in the US has never erased a child’s foreignness. Those who grew up and were charged with crimes are most vulnerable, suddenly marked as not properly deserving to belong. This logic has continued in more insidious form under President Donald Trump, who has dispensed with any notion of saving the children and instead straightforwardly threatens them. His 2018 family separation policy severed approximately 5,500 migrant children from their families in order to broadcast a political warning; more than a thousand are still not reunited. His move earlier this year to undo birthright citizenship is a bald attempt to deny nonwhite children of the US their claim to the American family. </p><p>Long has never found her birth family. Even so, she feels her story is complete. “You can find peace without finding your birth family. That’s not necessary. It’s the process of finding yourself that is necessary,” she said. Haines, meanwhile, managed to move into a studio apartment and get work at a pizza shop, but he has never found home. His new compatriots in Seoul look at him like he’s a foreigner. “I’m Korean, same as you,” he tells them. He has not returned to the United States.</p></main></div></div>]]></description>

<em>[ED: There’s a lot of talk of replacing human programmers. Sure, some will go, but not all. My views on how this plays out have changed considerably over the last 2 months. 3 out of 5 hats.]</em></p>
<h2>
Why LLM-Powered Programming is More Mech Suit Than Artificial Human</h2>
<p>
Last month, I used Claude Code to build two apps: an MVP for a non-trivial backend agent processing platform and the early workings of a reasonably complex frontend for a B2C SaaS product. Together, these projects generated approximately 30k lines of code (and about the same amount again thrown away over the course of the exercise). The experience taught me something important about AI and software development that contradicts much of the current narrative.</p>
<h2>
The Mech Suit Programmer</h2>
<p>
Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTBAvkC3ew" target="_blank">Ripley’s final showdown with the Xenomorph Queen in <em>Aliens</em></a>? She straps into the Power Loader—an industrial exoskeleton that amplifies her strength and capabilities. The suit doesn’t replace Ripley; it transforms her into something far more powerful than either human or machine alone.</p>
<p>
This is exactly how tools like Claude Code work in practice. They’re not replacement programmers; they’re amplifiers of what I can already do. That backend project? It would’ve taken me months the old way. With Claude Code, I knocked out the core in weeks. But let’s be clear - I wasn’t just describing what I wanted and watching magic happen.</p>
<p>
Think of Ripley controlling that Power Loader. Claude Code gave me tremendous lifting power while I maintained control of where we were going. I made all the architectural calls, set the quality bar, and kept us on vision. Most importantly, I had to watch - diligently - for it going off the rails. And when it did (which happened regularly), I had to bring it back into line. The AI cranked out implementation details at incredible speed, but the brain behind the operation? Still mine, and constantly engaged.</p>
<h2>
Vigilance Required</h2>
<p>
With great power comes great responsibility. You must maintain constant awareness when working with AI coding tools—something I learned through several painful lessons.</p>
<p>
Claude Code occasionally made bewildering decisions: changing framework code to make tests pass, commenting out whole sections of code and replacing them with hardcoded values to achieve a passing test rather than fixing the underlying problem, or introducing dependencies that weren’t necessary or appropriate. It has a massive bias for action, so you have to ruthlessly tell it to do less than it wants to do to keep it under control. I even found myself swearing at it from time to time in a weird form of anthropomorphising that I am still not entirely sure I am comfortable with or properly understand.</p>
<p>
Much like piloting an A380, the system handles tremendous complexity but requires a human to grab the yoke at critical moments. Modern aircraft can practically fly themselves, but we still need skilled pilots in the cockpit making key decisions. Taking your eyes off the process, even briefly, can lead to trouble. In my case, the backend required three complete rewrites because I looked away at crucial junctures, allowing the AI to go down problematic implementation paths that weren’t apparent until much later.</p>
<p>
This vigilance requirement creates a fascinating dynamic. While the AI dramatically accelerates certain aspects of development, it demands a different kind of attention from the developer—less focus on writing each line of code, more focus on reviewing, guiding, and maintaining architectural integrity.</p>
<h2>
The Time Cost of Coding</h2>
<p>
Working with Claude Code has fundamentally shifted how I think about the economics of programming time. Traditionally, coding involves three distinct “time buckets”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Why am I doing this?</strong> Understanding the business problem and value  </li>
  <li>
<strong>What do I need to do?</strong> Designing the solution conceptually  </li>
  <li>
<strong>How am I going to do it?</strong> Actually <em>writing</em> the code  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For decades, that last bucket consumed enormous amounts of our time. We’d spend hours, days or weeks writing, debugging, and refining. With Claude, that time cost has plummeted to nearly zero. I can generate thousands of lines of functional code in a sitting—something that is, frankly, mind-blowing.</p>
<p>
But here’s the critical insight: the first two buckets haven’t gone anywhere. In fact, they’ve become <em>more</em> important than ever. Understanding the intent behind what you’re building and clearly defining what needs to be done are now the primary constraints on development speed.</p>
<p>
And there’s a new skill that emerges: wielding the knife. With code generation being essentially free, we need to become much more comfortable with throwing away entire solutions. The sunk cost fallacy hits programmers hard—we hate discarding code we’ve invested in, fearing we might break something important or never get back to a working state.</p>
<p>
But when your assistant can rewrite everything in minutes, that calculus changes completely. Three times during my backend project, I looked at substantial amounts of code—thousands of lines that <em>technically worked</em>—and decided to scrap it entirely because the approach wasn’t right. This wasn’t easy. My instinct was still to try to salvage and refactor. But the right move was to step back, rethink the approach, and direct the AI down a different path.</p>
<p>
This willingness to cut ruthlessly is a muscle most developers haven’t developed yet. It requires confidence in your architectural judgment and a radical shift in how you value implementation time.</p>
<h2>
Experience Still Matters</h2>
<p>
For me, using Claude Code has been a learning exercise in itself. Progress often felt like two steps forward and three back, particularly in the early stages. Generating 20k+ lines of code became relatively straightforward on a daily basis, but knowing when to throw everything away and rebuild from scratch—that took 30 years of experience.</p>
<p>
Wisdom and a bit of grey hair gave me the confidence to recognise when a particular approach wasn’t going to scale or maintain properly, even when the code appeared functional on the surface. Rather than just sit there and watch it generate code, I had to pay very close attention to spot anti-patterns or worse emerging that would either stop working soon after it was written, or lie dormant and bite later on. </p>
<p>
This highlights a critical danger: developers without substantial real-world experience might not recognise when the AI produces nonsense output. They might not realise when AI-generated code solves the immediate problem but creates three more in the process. The mech suit amplifies capability, but it also amplifies mistakes when operated without expertise. These tools are incredibly powerful, but they are also incredibly dangerous when pointed in the wrong direction. </p>
<h2>
The Centaur Effect</h2>
<p>
Chess provides a useful parallel here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_chess" target="_blank">“Centaur chess”</a> pairs humans with AI chess engines, creating teams that outperform both solo humans and solo AI systems playing on their own. What’s fascinating is that even when AI chess engines can easily defeat grandmasters, the human-AI combination still produces superior results to the AI alone. The human provides strategic direction and creative problem-solving; the machine offers computational power and tactical precision.</p>
<p>
My experience with Claude demonstrated this effect clearly. When I treated the AI as a partner rather than a replacement, development velocity increased dramatically. What I found most effective was when I spent time writing out a stream-of-consciousness “spec” and then iterating with Claude to turn it into an more formal design document. </p>
<p>
But the partnership still required my domain knowledge and architectural judgment to succeed. The AI excelled at pattern recognition and code generation but lacked the contextual understanding to make appropriate trade-offs and design decisions. It can’t tell when it’s done that seems ok, but is actually bonkers. It needed me to watch it constantly and keep it on track.</p>
<h2>
Finding the Balance</h2>
<p>
Building these applications required finding the right balance between delegation and control. Claude went down some insane rabbit holes on the backend when left unsupervised—places where the AI would implement increasingly complex solutions to problems that should have been solved differently or perhaps didn’t need solving at all. In one nightmare example, it ended up completely duplicating a whole section of code in one place rather than reuse an existing component. It worked (for some version of the word “work”) but it was <em>wrong</em>. Way wrong. </p>
<p>
It was a similar story on the front end. I had to constantly stop it from trying to implement functionality in hacky JavaScript rather than use idiomatic Elixir and Phoenix LiveView patterns. </p>
<p>
Over time, I developed a rhythm for collaboration. For straightforward implementations following established patterns, I could delegate broadly. For novel challenges or areas with significant trade-offs, I needed to provide more detailed specifications and review output more carefully.</p>
<p>
What I’ve built could not have been completed so quickly without Claude Code, but it also would have failed completely without human oversight. The true value emerged from understanding when to leverage the AI’s capabilities and when to assert human judgment.</p>
<h2>
The Future is Augmentation</h2>
<p>
There is a view in many circles that LLMs will replace programmers. I am hesitant to say that this will <em>never</em> happen, becuase a lot of things with LLMs have surprised me recently, and I expect more surprises to come. For now, however, I don’t see LLMs <em>effectively</em> replacing programmers; but they are transforming how we work. Like Ripley in her Power Loader, we’re learning to operate powerful new tools that extend our capabilities far beyond what we could achieve alone.</p>
<p>
This transformation will change what we value in developers. Raw coding ability becomes less important; architectural thinking, pattern recognition, and technical judgment become more crucial. The ability to effectively direct and collaborate with AI tools emerges as a vital skill in itself.</p>
<p>
The developers who thrive in this new environment won’t be those who fear or resist AI tools, but those who master them—who understand both their extraordinary potential and their very real limitations. They’ll recognise that the goal isn’t to remove humans from the equation but to enhance what humans can accomplish.</p>
<p>
In my view, that’s something to embrace, not fear. The mech suit awaits, and with it comes the potential to build software at scales and speeds previously unimaginable—but only for those skilled enough to operate the machines in ways that don’t harm themselves or those around them.</p>

            <p>Pipelining might be my favorite programming language feature.</p>
            <p>
              What is pipelining? Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from your
              parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.
            </p>
            <p>When I say pipelining, I’m talking about the ability to write code like this:</p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>get_ids</span>(data: <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Widget<span>&gt;</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Id<span>&gt;</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span>data.iter()<span>              </span><span>// get iterator over elements of the list
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>        </span>.filter(<span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.alive)<span> </span><span>// use lambda to ignore tombstoned widgets
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>        </span>.map(<span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.id)<span>       </span><span>// extract ids from widgets
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>        </span>.collect()<span>           </span><span>// assemble iterator into data structure (Vec)
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>}<span>
</span></span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As opposed to code like this. (This is not real Rust code. Quick challenge for the curious Rustacean, can
              you explain why we cannot rewrite the above code like this, even if we import all of the symbols?)
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>get_ids</span>(data: <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Widget<span>&gt;</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Id<span>&gt;</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span>collect(map(filter(iter(data),<span> </span><span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.alive),<span> </span><span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.id))<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>}<span>
</span></span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              I honestly feel like this should be so obvious that it shouldn’t even be up for debate. The first code
              example—with its nice ‘pipelining’ or ‘method chaining’ or whatever you want to call it—it
              <em>just works</em>. It can be read line-by-line. It’s easy to annotate it with comments. It doesn’t
              require introduction of new variables to become more readable since it’s already readable as is.
            </p>
            <p>
              As opposed to, y’know,
              <em>the first word in the line describing the final action our function performs</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me make it very clear: This is an <del>article</del> <em>hot take</em> about syntax. In practice,
              <em>semantics beat syntax every day of the week</em>. In other words, don’t take it too seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, this is not about imperative vs. functional programming. This article takes for granted that
              you’re already on board with concepts such as ‘map’ and ‘filter’. It’s possible to overuse that style, but
              I won’t talk about it here.

            <p>
              Here is a feature that’s so bog-standard in modern programming languages that it barely feels like a
              feature at all. Member access for structs or classes with our beloved friend the <code>.</code>-operator.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a form of pipelining. It puts the data first, the operator in the middle, and concludes with the
              action (restricting to a member field). That’s an instance of what I call pipelining.
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>type</span> Bar <span>struct</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	field <span>int</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>func</span> <span>get_field</span>(bar Bar) <span>int</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	<span>return</span> bar.field
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>// vs. syntax like that of Python's `getattr` function
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>get_field</span>(bar Bar) <span>int</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	<span>return</span> <span>getattr</span>(bar, <span>"field"</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              You see what I am getting at, right? It’s the same principle. One of the reasons why
              <code>x.y</code>-style member access syntax (and <code>x.y()</code>-style method call syntax!) is popular
              is since it’s easy to read and chains easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s make the comparison slightly more fair, and pretend that we have to write <code>x.get(y)</code>.
              Compare:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span>fizz.<span>get</span>(bar).<span>get</span>(buzz).<span>get</span>(foo)
</span></span><span><span><span>// vs.
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>get</span>(<span>get</span>(<span>get</span>(fizz, bar), buzz), foo)
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Which one of these is easier to read? The pipelined syntax, obviously. This example is easy to parse
              either way, but imagine you’d like to blend out some information and purely focus on the final operation.
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span>&lt;previous stuff&gt;.<span>get</span>(foo)
</span></span><span><span><span>// vs.
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>get</span>(&lt;previous stuff&gt;, foo)
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              You see the problem, right? In the first example, we have ‘all of the previous stuff’ and then
              <em>apply another operation</em> to it. In the second example, the operation which we want to perform
              (<code>get</code>) and the new operand (<code>foo</code>) are spread out with ‘all of the previous stuff’
              sitting between them.
            </p>
            <p>Looking back at our original example, the problem should be obvious:</p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>get_ids</span>(data: <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Widget<span>&gt;</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Id<span>&gt;</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span>collect(map(filter(iter(data),<span> </span><span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.alive),<span> </span><span>|</span>w<span>|</span><span> </span>w.id))<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>}<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>-----------------------------</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>// it's fun to parse the whole line to find the start
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>------------------------</span><span>2</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>-----------------</span><span>3</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>---------------------------------------</span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>// all the way back to find the second arg
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>-------------</span><span>5</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>------------------------------------------------------</span><span>6</span><span> </span><span>// and all the way back again
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>-----</span><span>7</span><span> </span><span>// okay the final step is the first word in the line that makes sense
</span></span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              I cannot deny the allegations: I just don’t think it makes sense to write code like that as long as a
              clearly better option exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why would I have to parse the whole line just to figure out where my input comes in, and why is the data
              flow ‘from the inside to the outside’? It’s kind of silly, if you ask me.

              Readability is nice, and I could add add a whole section complaining about the mess that’s Python’s
              ‘functional’ features.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, let’s take a step back and talk about ease of editing. Going back to the example above, imagine
              you’d like to add another <code>map</code> (or any other function call) in the middle there. How easy is
              this?

              <li>
                You’ll have to parse through the line, counting commas and parentheses to find the exact place to add
                the closing parenthesis.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <code>git diff</code> of this is going to be basically unreadable, everything is crammed onto one
                line.
              </li>
              <li>This line is getting long and unreadable, and at that point you’ll want to refactor it anyway!</li>

              This is adding a single line of code. No parentheses counting. It’s easy and obvious. It’s easy to write
              and easy to review. Perhaps most importantly, it shows up <em>incredibly nicely</em> in the
              <code>blame</code> layer of whatever editor or code exploration tool you’re using.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might think that this issue is <em>just</em> about trying to cram everything onto a single line, but
              frankly, trying to move away from that doesn’t help much. It will still mess up your git diffs and the
              blame layer.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can, of course, just assign the result of every <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> call to a
              helper variable, and I will (begrudgingly) acknowledge that that works, and is
              <em>significantly</em> better than trying to do absurd levels of nesting.

            <h2 id="code-discovery">Code Discovery</h2>
            <p>
              When you press <code>.</code> in your IDE, it will show a neat little pop-up that tells you which methods
              you can call or which fields you can access.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is probably the single IDE feature with the biggest value add, and if not that, then at least the
              single most frequently used one. Some people will tell you that static analysis for namespace or
              module-level code discovery is useless in the age of AI autocompletion and vibe coding, but I very much
              disagree.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>

              Words to live by. What he’s describing here is something that essentially <em>requires</em> pipelining to
              work at all. (And types or type annotation, but having those is the direction the industry is moving in
              anyway.)
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn’t matter if it’s the trusty <code>.</code> operator, C++’s <code>-&gt;</code>, or if it’s
              something more bespoke such as Elm’s or Gleam’s <code>|&gt;</code> or Haskell’s <code>&amp;</code>. In the
              end, it’s a pipeline operator—the same principle applies. If your
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol" target="_blank">LSP</a> knows the type of
              what’s on the left, it <em>should</em> in principle be able to offer suggestions for what to do next.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your favorite language’s LSP/IDE does a poor job at offering suggestions during pipelining, then it’s
              probably one of the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                You don’t know which type you’re even holding. This happens most often when the language is dynamically
                typed, ’types’ are hard to deduce with static analysis, and you’re touching/writing code without type
                annotations. (e.g. Python)
              </li>
              <li>
                The ecosystem and LSP just didn’t have enough time put into them, or most active users don’t care
                enough. (e.g. any sufficiently obscure language)
              </li>
              <li>
                You are in a situation in which even looking up which methods are available is hard, often due to a
                bespoke build process that confuses the editor. (e.g. basically any build or runtime generation of code,
                or bespoke loading/selection of libraries).
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              In either case, great editor/LSP support is more or less considered mandatory for modern programming
              languages. And of course, this is where pipelining shines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask any IDE, autocompleting <code>fizz.bu... -&gt; fizz.buzz()</code> is <em>much easier</em> than
              autocompleting <code>bu... -&gt; buzz(...)</code>, for the obvious reason that you
              <em>didn’t even write <code>fizz</code> in the second example yet</em>, so your editor has less
              information to work with.

            <h2 id="sql">SQL</h2>
            <p>
              Pipelining is <em>amazing</em> at data processing, and allows you to transform code that’s commonly
              written with ‘inside-out’ control flow into ’line-by-line’ transformations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where could this possibly be more clear than in SQL, the presumably single most significant language for
              querying and aggregating complex large-scale datasets?
            </p>
            <p>
              You’ll be pleased to hear that, yes, people are in fact working on bringing pipelining to SQL. (Whether
              it’s actually going to happen in this specific form
              <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/2d2720461b82f2fd" target="_blank">is a different question</a>,
              let’s not get too carried away here.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Unless you’re one of those people who spends so much time dealing with SQL that it’s become second nature,
              and the thought that the control flow of nested queries is hard to follow for the average non-database
              engineer is incomprehensible to you, I guess.
            </p>
            <p>Personally, I’m a fan.</p>
            <p>
              Anyway, if you’re interested, listen to this

              Out of the Gang of Four
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern" target="_blank">builder pattern</a> is one that
              isn’t completely irredeemable.
            </p>
            <p>
              And—surprise, surprise—it fits pretty well into pipelining. Any situation where you need to construct a
              complex, stateful object (e.g. a client or runtime), it’s a great way to feed complex, optional arguments
              into an object.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some people say they prefer optional/named arguments, but honestly, I don’t understand why: An optional
              named <code>foo</code> parameter is harder to track down in code (and harder to mark as deprecated!) than
              all instances of a <code>.setFoo()</code> builder function.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have no clue what I’m talking about, this here is the type of pattern I’m talking about. You have a
              ‘builder’ object, call some methods on it to configure it, and finally <code>build()</code> the object
              you’re actually interested in.

            <h2 id="making-haskell-slightly-more-readable">Making Haskell (slightly more) readable</h2>
            <p>Haskell is hard to read.</p>
            <p>
              It has these weird operators like <code>&lt;$&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>, <code>$</code>, or
              <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> and when you ask Haskell programmers about what they mean, they say something like
              “Oh, this is just a special case of the generalized
              <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Control-Monad.html#v:-62--61--62-" target="_blank">Kleisli Monad Operator</a>
              <code>&gt;=&gt;</code> in the category of endo-pro-applicatives over a locally small poset.” and your eyes
              have glazed over before they’ve even finished the sentence.
            </p>
            <p>(It also doesn’t help that Haskell allows you to define custom operators however you please, yes.)</p>
            <p>
              If you’re wondering “How could a language have so many bespoke operators?”, my understanding is that most
              of them are just fancy ways of telling Haskell to compose some functions in a highly advanced way. Here’s
              the second-most basic<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
              example, the <code>$</code> operator.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine you have functions <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and some value <code>data</code>. In a
              “““normal””” language you might write <code>foo(data)</code>. In Haskell, this is written as
              <code>foo data</code>. This is since <code>foo</code> will automatically ‘grab’ values to the right as its
              arguments, so you don’t need the parentheses.
            </p>
            <p>
              A consequence of this is that <code>bar(foo(data))</code> is written as <code>bar (foo data)</code> in
              Haskell. If you wrote <code>bar foo data</code>, the compiler will interpret it as
              <code>bar(foo)(data)</code>, which would be wrong. This is what people mean when they say that Haskell’s
              function call syntax is
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property" target="_blank">left-associative</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>$</code> operator is <em>nothing but syntactic sugar</em> that allows you to write
              <code>bar $ foo data</code> instead of having to write <code>bar (foo data)</code>. That’s it. People were
              fed-up with having to put parens everywhere, I guess.
            </p>
            <p>If your eyes glazed over at this point, I can’t blame you.</p>
            <p>Let’s get back on track.</p>
            <p>
              Talking about any of the fancier operators would be punching well above my weight-class, so I’ll just
              stick to what I’ve been saying throughout this entire post already. Here’s a stilted Haskell toy example,
              intentionally not written in
              <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree" target="_blank">pointfree</a> style.
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>-- Take an input string `content`</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Split into lines, check whether each line is a palindrome and stringify</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Ex. "foo\nradar" -&gt; "False\nTrue"</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>checkPalindromes</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>checkPalindromes</span> content <span>=</span> unlines <span>$</span> map (show <span>.</span> isPalindrome) <span>$</span> lines <span>$</span> map toLower content
</span></span><span><span>  <span>where</span>
</span></span><span><span>    isPalindrome xs <span>=</span> xs <span>==</span> reverse xs
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              If you want to figure out the flow of data, this whole function body has to be read
              <em>right-to-left</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make things even funnier, you need to start with the <code>where</code> clause to figure out which
              local “variables” are being defined. This happens (for whatever reason) at the end of the function instead
              of at the start. (Calling <code>isPalindrome</code> a variable is misleading, but that’s besides the
              point.)
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point you might wonder if Haskell has some sort of pipelining operator, and yes, it turns out that
              one was
              <a href="https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/78#issuecomment-1183568372" target="_blank">added in 2014</a>! That’s pretty late considering that Haskell exists since 1990. This allows us to refactor the above
              code as follows:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>checkPalindromes</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>checkPalindromes</span> content <span>=</span>
</span></span><span><span>  content
</span></span><span><span>    <span>&amp;</span> map toLower
</span></span><span><span>    <span>&amp;</span> lines
</span></span><span><span>    <span>&amp;</span> map (show <span>.</span> isPalindrome)
</span></span><span><span>    <span>&amp;</span> unlines
</span></span><span><span>  <span>where</span>
</span></span><span><span>    isPalindrome xs <span>=</span> xs <span>==</span> reverse xs
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Isn’t that way easier to read?</p>
            <p>
              <em>This</em> is code which you can show to an enterprise Java programmer, tell them that they’re looking
              at
              <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Java Streams</a>
              with slightly weird syntax, and they’ll get the idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, in reality nothing is as simple. The Haskell ecosystem seems to be split between users of
              <code>$</code>, users of <code>&amp;</code>, and users of the
              <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/flow-2.0.0.0/docs/Flow.html#g:1" target="_blank">Flow</a>-provided operators, which allow the same functionality, but allow you to write
              <code>|&gt;</code> instead of <code>&amp;</code>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t know what to say about that, other than that—not entirely unlike C++—Haskell has its own share of
              operator-related and cultural historical baggage, and a split ecosystem, and this makes the language
              significantly less approachable than it has to be.

            </div>
            <p>
              In the beginning I said that ‘Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from
              your parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.’
            </p>
            <p>
              I still think that this is true, but it doesn’t get across the whole picture. If you’ve paid attention in
              the previous sections, you’ll have noticed that <code>object.member</code> and
              <code>iterator &amp; map</code> share basically <em>nothing</em> in common outside of the order of
              operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the first case, we’re accessing a value that’s <em>scoped</em> to the object. In the second, we’re
              ‘just’ passing an expression to a free-standing function.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or in other words, pipelining is not the same as pipelining. Even from an IDE-perspective, they’re
              different. In Java, your editor will look for methods associated with an object and walk up the
              inheritance chain. In Haskell, your editor will put a so-called
              <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.3-rc1/users_guide/typed-holes.html" target="_blank">’typed hole’</a>, and try to deduce which functions have a type that ‘fits’ into the hole using
              <a href="https://herecomesthemoon.net/2025/01/type-inference-in-rust-and-cpp/" target="_blank">Hindley-Milner Type Inference</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personally, I like type inference (and
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class" target="_blank">type classes</a>), but I also like if
              types have a namespace attached to them, with methods and associated functions. I am pragmatic like that.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I like about Rust is that it gives me the best out of both worlds here: You get traits and type
              inference without needing to wrap your head around a fully functional, immutable, lazy, monad-driven
              programming paradigm, and you get methods and associated values without the absolute dumpster fire of
              complex inheritance chains or AbstractBeanFactoryConstructors.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve not seen any other language that even comes close to the convenience of Rust’s pipelines, and its
              lack of higher-kinded types or inheritance did not stop it. Quite the opposite, if anything.
            </p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              I like pipelining. That’s the one thing that definitely should be obvious if you’ve read all the way
              through this article.
            </p>
            <p>I just think they’re neat, y’know?</p>
            <p>I like reading my code top-to-bottom, left-to-right instead of from-the-inside-to-the-outside.</p>
            <p>
              I like when I don’t need to count arguments and parentheses to figure out which value is the first
              argument of the second function, and which is the second argument of the first function.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when my editor can show me all fields of a struct, and all methods or functions associated with a
              value, just when I press <code>.</code> on my keyboard. It’s great.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when <code>git diff</code> and the <code>blame</code> layer of the code repository don’t look like
              complete ass.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when adding a function call in the middle of a process doesn’t require me to parse the whole line
              to add the closing parenthesis, and doesn’t require me to adjust the nesting of the whole block.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when my functions distinguish between ‘a main value which we are acting upon’ and ‘secondary
              arguments’, as opposed to treating them all as the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like when I don’t have to pollute my namespaces with a ton of helper variables or free-standing
              functions that I had to pull in from somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re writing pipelined code—and not trying overly hard to fit everything into a single, convoluted,
              nested pipeline—then your functions will naturally split up into a few pipeline chunks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each chunk starts with a piece of ‘main data’ that travels on a conveyer belt, where every line performs
              exactly one action to transform it. Finally, a single value comes out at the end and gets its own name, so
              that it may be used later.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that is—in my humble opinion—exactly how it should be. Neat, convenient, separated ‘chunks’, each of
              which can easily be understood in its own right.
            </p>

            <p><span>The milestone is the result of a long term decline of fossil generation in the US power sector, with wind and solar growing substantially over the last decade. Ten years ago, in March 2015, fossil generation still provided 65% of US electricity generation. Wind and solar generation stood at just 5.7%. Since then, the share of wind and solar power has more than quadrupled.</span></p>
<p><span>Solar power is set to account for </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64586"><span>more than half</span></a><span> of new generating capacity installed in the US in 2025, with more than a third of new solar panels going to Texas. Solar’s rise has been extraordinary. Ten years ago, in March 2015, solar power accounted for just 1% of US electricity generation. By March 2025, this had grown to 9.2%.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><p><i></i> Apr 21, 2025<br><i></i> 5 min read</p></header><div><p>Three years ago, I was part of a team responsible for developing and maintaining Kubernetes clusters for end user customers. A main source for downtime in customer environments occurred when image registries went down. The traditional way to solve this problem is to set up a stateful mirror, however we had to work within customer budget and time constraints which did not allow it. During a Black Friday, we started getting hit with a ton of traffic while GitHub container registries were down. This limited our ability to scale up the cluster as we depended on critical images from that registry. After this incident, I started thinking about a better way to avoid these scalability issues. A solution that did not need a stateful component and required minimal operational oversight. This is where the idea for <a href="https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel">Spegel</a> came from.</p><p>As a sole maintainer of an open source project, I was enthused when Microsoft reached out to set up a meeting to talk about Spegel. The meeting went well, and I felt there was going to be a path forward ripe with cooperation and hopefully a place where I could onboard new maintainers. I continued discussions with one of the Microsoft engineers, helping them get Spegel running and answering any architecture questions they had. At the time I was positive as I saw it as a possibility for Micorosft to contribute back changes based on their learnings. As time went on, silence ensued, and I assumed work priorities had changed.</p><p>It was not until KubeCon Paris where I attended a talk that piqued my interest. The talk was about strategies to speed up image distribution where one strategy discussed was P2P sharing. The topics in the abstract sounded similar to Spegel so I was excited to hear other’s ideas about the problem. During the talk, I was enthralled seeing Spegel, my own project, be discussed as a P2P image sharing solution. When <a href="https://github.com/Azure/peerd">Peerd</a>, a peer to peer distributor of container content in Kubernetes clusters made by Microsoft, was mentioned I quickly researched it. At the bottom of the README there was a thank you to myself and Spegel. This acknowledgement made it look like they had taken some inspiration from my project and gone ahead and developed a version of their own.</p><p><img src="https://philiplaine.com/posts/getting-forked-by-microsoft/acknowledgement-blur.png" alt="Acknowledgement">
<small><a href="https://github.com/Azure/peerd?tab=readme-ov-file#acknowledgments">Source: Peerd</a></small></p><p>While looking into Peerd, my enthusiasm for understanding different approaches in this problem space quickly diminished. I saw function signatures and comments that looked very familiar, as if I had written them myself. Digging deeper I found test cases referencing Spegel and my previous employer, test cases that have been taken directly from my project. References that are still present to this day. The project is a forked version of Spegel, maintained by Microsoft, but under Microsoft’s MIT license.</p><p><img src="https://philiplaine.com/posts/getting-forked-by-microsoft/test-parse-path-blur.png" alt="Test Parse Path">

Software released under an MIT license allows for forking and modifications, without any requirement to contribute these changes back. I default to using the MIT license as it is simple and permissive. The license does not allow removing the original license and purport that the code was created by someone else. It looks as if large parts of the project were copied directly from Spegel without any mention of the original source. I have included a short snippet comparing the code which adds the mirror configuration where even the function comments are the same.</p><p><img src="https://philiplaine.com/posts/getting-forked-by-microsoft/hosts-peerd.png" alt="Hosts Peerd">

I am frequently asked about the differences between Spegel and Peerd. As a maintainer, it is my duty to come across as unbiased and factual as possible, but this tumultuous history makes it challenging. Microsoft carries a large brand recognition, so it has been difficult for Spegel to try and take up space next to such a behemoth.</p><p>As an open source maintainer I have dedicated ample time to community requests, bug fixes, and security fixes. In my conversation with Microsoft I was open to collaboration to continue building out a tool to benefit the open source community. Over the years I have contributed to a multitude of open source projects and created a few of my own. Spegel was the first project I created from the ground up that got some traction and seemed to be appreciated by the community. Seeing my project being forked by Microsoft made me feel like I was no longer useful. For a while I questioned if it was even worth continuing working on Spegel.</p><p>Luckily, I persisted. Spegel still continues strong with over 1.7k stars and 14.4 million pulls since its first release over two years ago. However, I am not the first and unfortunately not the last person to come across this David versus Goliath-esque experience. How can sole maintainers work with multi-billion corporations without being taken advantage of? With the changes of Hashicorp licensing having a rippling effect through the open source community, along with the strong decline in investment in open source as a whole, how does the community prevail? As an effort to fund the work on Spegel I have enabled GitHub sponsors. This experience has also made me consider changing the license of Spegel, as it seems to be the only stone I can throw.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Data Centers Can Slash Power Needs With One Coding Tweak"><p>Much of the world’s web traffic is routed through <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers" target="_self"><u>data centers</u></a>, which also fuel power-guzzling <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/" target="_self"><u>artificial intelligence (AI)</u></a> applications. In the U.S. alone, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-new-report-evaluating-increase-electricity-demand-data-centers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data centers consumed around 4 percent of the country’s total electricity in 2023</u></a>, and that number is projected to rise up to 12 percent by 2028.</p><p>Some researchers are thinking big, formulating innovative schemes to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-centers-designed-for-tropics" target="_self"><u>make data centers more sustainable</u></a>. Others, like <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mkarsten/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Martin Karsten</u></a>, a professor of systems and networking at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>University of Waterloo</u></a> in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/canada">Canada</a>, are enhancing current methods in the tiniest of ways to reduce <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-center-energy">data center energy</a> consumption.</p><p>Karsten and his former master’s student, Peter Cai, uncovered inefficiencies in how the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/linux" target="_self"><u>Linux</u></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/operating-system">operating system</a> (OS) processes <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/network-traffic">network traffic</a> at the kernel level: The <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Linux kernel</u></a> is the “seed” or core of the OS, managing communication and resources such as memory between the hardware and processes.</p><p>In the case of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers">data centers</a>, these processes entail figuring out where to send segments of information called “data packets” transmitted over the network. When the network receives a new packet, it triggers an interrupt request. The kernel sends this request to the CPU, which then puts its current task on hold to process the packet.</p><p>The OS also periodically polls the network to check for incoming packets before an interrupt request fires. This <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/networking/napi.html#poll" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>busy polling</u></a> mechanism minimizes delays in network traffic processing at the cost of CPU power consumption. During low traffic conditions in particular, polling continues even without packets to process, leading to needless energy usage.</p><p>Karsten decided to optimize this approach. “Instead of always waiting for a fixed period of time, we dynamically wait based on what we know is going on in the application,” he says. He devised a technique such that busy polling happens during high network traffic periods, with unnecessary interrupt requests suspended. When network traffic dies down, interrupt-based delivery resumes. “That makes the resulting mechanism much more efficient and flexible,” he adds.</p><h2>Optimizing <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/linux">Linux</a> for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/energy-efficiency">Energy Efficiency</a></h2><p>Putting theory into practice, Karsten partnered with <a href="https://blog.dama.to/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Joe Damato</u></a>, a distinguished engineer at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> services provider <a href="https://www.fastly.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Fastly</u></a> and frequent Linux kernel contributor, to develop the changes. It turns out they didn’t have to write any new code.</p><p>“It’s really just reorganizing the way in which the data flow and the data processing is happening,” says Damato. “We piggyback on existing code in the Linux kernel, and we change the order in which things operate.”</p><p>That change led to around 30 lines of reworked code. They tested the functionality and performance of their modifications on different scenarios and workloads, and found that the kernel improvements can decrease power consumption by up to 30 percent.</p><p>This energy savings comes with a caveat. “It is sort of a best case because the 30 percent applies to the network stack or communication part of it,” Karsten explains. “If an application primarily does that, then it will see 30 percent improvement. If the application does a lot of other things and only occasionally uses the network, then the 30 percent will shrink to a smaller value.”</p><p>The altered code can especially benefit network-dominant applications like data centers whose traffic levels fluctuate during the day, because the change is automatic and dynamic based on network traffic load. Such a small code snippet could also have a huge cascading impact, with some reports noting that Linux is widely used by a majority of <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/breakdown/os-linux/data_center" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data center providers</u></a> and <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>websites</u></a>.</p><h2>Linux Kernel Update Goes Live</h2><p>The <a href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=80b6f094756f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>code</u></a> has been implemented as part of the <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_6.13#NAPI_suspension_for_more_efficient_networking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Linux kernel release version 6.13</u></a> in January. Karsten and Cai also published a related <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3626780" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a> in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/toc/pomacs/2023/7/3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em>Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems</em></u></a> in 2023 and presented it at the <a href="https://www.sigmetrics.org/sigmetrics2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ACM SIGMETRICS 2024</u></a> conference.</p><p>Damato hopes to spread the word about their work at upcoming Linux kernel networking conferences this year. He’s also planning to add support for a similar mechanism in Fastly’s <a href="https://github.com/h2o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>H2O server</u></a>.</p><p>And because Linux is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/open-source" target="_self"><u>open source</u></a>, Damato hopes others would follow their lead. “Whether you use <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nginx">nginx</a> or Apache or whatever it happens to be as your web server, you’ll be able to use some of the code we put out there to help inspire and direct you into how you might implement the same thing for your web server.”</p><p>For Karsten, this work has motivated him to take on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/sustainability" target="_self"><u>sustainability</u></a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/green-software" target="_self"><u>software efficiency</u></a> as his next research agenda.</p><p>“When I grew up in computer science in the 90s, everybody was concerned about efficiency. Because computers were small, they just had a small amount of memory. They were slow, so you had to worry about every cycle and every byte,” he says. “Somehow in the last 20 years, this has gotten lost. Everybody’s completely gung-ho about performance without any regard for efficiency or resource consumption. I think it’s time to pivot, where we can find ways to make things a little more efficient.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 04:31:35 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/">https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43748512">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Template strings, also known as t-strings, have been <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/">officially accepted</a> as a feature in Python 3.14, which will ship in late 2025. 🎉</p>
<p>I’m excited; t-strings open the door to safer more flexible string processing in Python.</p>
<h4 id="whats-the-big-idea-with-t-strings">What’s the big idea with t-strings?</h4>
<p>Since they were introduced in Python 3.6, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals">f-strings</a> have become a <em>very</em> popular way to format strings. They are concise, readable, and powerful.</p>
<p>In fact, they’re <em>so</em> delightful that many developers use f-strings for everything… even when they shouldn’t!</p>
<p>Alas, f-strings are often dangerously (mis)used to format strings that contain user input. I’ve seen f-strings used for SQL (<code>f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_name}'"</code>) and for HTML (<code>f"&lt;div&gt;{user_name}&lt;/div&gt;"</code>). These are not safe! If <code>user_name</code> contains a malicious value, it can lead to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">cross-site scripting</a>.</p>
<p>Template strings are a <em>generalization</em> of Python’s f-strings. Whereas f-strings immediately become a string, t-strings evaluate to a new type, <code>string.templatelib.Template</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>from</span><span> string.templatelib </span><span>import</span><span> Template</span></span>
<span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "World"</span></span>
<span><span>template: Template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Importantly, <code>Template</code> instances are <em>not</em> strings. The <code>Template</code> type does not provide its own <code>__str__()</code> implementation, which is to say that calling <code>str(my_template)</code> does not return a useful value. Templates <em>must</em> be processed before they can be used; that processing code can be written by the developer or provided by a library and can safely escape the dynamic content.</p>
<p>We can imagine a library that provides an <code>html()</code> function that takes a <code>Template</code> and returns a safely escaped string:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>evil </span><span>=</span><span> "&lt;script&gt;alert('bad')&lt;/script&gt;"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"&lt;p&gt;</span><span>{evil}</span><span>&lt;/p&gt;"</span></span>
<span><span>safe </span><span>=</span><span> html(template)</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> safe </span><span>==</span><span> "&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('bad')&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Of course, t-strings are useful for more than just safety; they also allow for more flexible string processing. For example, that <code>html()</code> function could return a new type, <code>HTMLElement</code>. It could also accept all sorts of useful substitutions in the HTML itself:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>attributes </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><span>"src"</span><span>: </span><span>"roquefort.jpg"</span><span>, </span><span>"alt"</span><span>: </span><span>"Yum"</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"&lt;img </span><span>{attributes}</span><span> /&gt;"</span></span>
<span><span>element </span><span>=</span><span> html(template)</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> str</span><span>(element) </span><span>==</span><span> "&lt;img src='roquefort.jpg' alt='Yum' /&gt;"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you’ve worked with JavaScript, t-strings may feel familiar. They are the pythonic parallel to JavaScript’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates">tagged templates</a>.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-work-with-t-strings">How do I work with t-strings?</h4>
<p>To support processing, <code>Template</code>s give developers access to the string and its interpolated values <em>before</em> they are combined into a final string.</p>
<p>The <code>.strings</code> and <code>.values</code> properties of a <code>Template</code> return tuples:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "World"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.strings </span><span>==</span><span> (</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>, </span><span>"!"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.values </span><span>==</span><span> (name,)</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>There is always one more (possibly empty) string than value. That is, <code>t"".strings == ("",)</code> and <code>t"{name}".strings == ("", "")</code>.</p>
<p>As a shortcut, it’s also possible to iterate over a <code>Template</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "World"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span><span>contents </span><span>=</span><span> list</span><span>(template)</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> contents[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>==</span><span> "Hello "</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> contents[</span><span>1</span><span>].value </span><span>==</span><span> name</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> contents[</span><span>2</span><span>] </span><span>==</span><span> "!"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Developers writing complex processing code can also access the gory details of each interpolation:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "World"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name</span><span>!s:&gt;8</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.interpolations[</span><span>0</span><span>].value </span><span>==</span><span> name</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.interpolations[</span><span>0</span><span>].expression </span><span>==</span><span> "name"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.interpolations[</span><span>0</span><span>].conversion </span><span>==</span><span> "s"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.interpolations[</span><span>0</span><span>].format_spec </span><span>==</span><span> "&gt;8"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>In addition to supporting the literal (<code>t"foo"</code>) form, <code>Template</code>s can also be instantiated directly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>from</span><span> string.templatelib </span><span>import</span><span> Template, Interpolation</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> Template(</span></span>
<span><span>	"Hello "</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>	Interpolation(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>"World"</span><span>, </span><span>expression</span><span>=</span><span>"name"</span><span>),</span></span>
<span><span>	"!"</span></span>
<span><span>)</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Strings and interpolations can be provided to the <code>Template</code> constructor in any order.</p>
<h4 id="a-simple-t-string-example">A simple t-string example</h4>
<p>Let’s say we wanted to write code to convert all substituted words into pig latin. All it takes is a simple function:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>def</span><span> pig_latin</span><span>(template: Template) -&gt; </span><span>str</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>	"""Convert a Template to pig latin."""</span></span>
<span><span>	result </span><span>=</span><span> []</span></span>
<span><span>	for</span><span> item </span><span>in</span><span> template:</span></span>
<span><span>		if</span><span> isinstance</span><span>(item, </span><span>str</span><span>):</span></span>
<span><span>			result.append(item)</span></span>
<span><span>		else</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>			word </span><span>=</span><span> item.value</span></span>
<span><span>			if</span><span> word </span><span>and</span><span> word[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>in</span><span> "aeiou"</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>				result.append(word </span><span>+</span><span> "yay"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>			else</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>				result.append(word[</span><span>1</span><span>:] </span><span>+</span><span> word[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>+</span><span> "ay"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>	return</span><span> ""</span><span>.join(result)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "world"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> pig_latin(template) </span><span>==</span><span> "Hello orldway!"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is a goofy example; if you’d like to see some <em>less</em> silly examples, check out the <a href="https://github.com/davepeck/pep750-examples/">PEP 750 examples repository</a>.</p>
<h4 id="whats-next-once-t-strings-ship">What’s next once t-strings ship?</h4>
<p>T-strings are a powerful new feature that will make Python string processing safer and more flexible. I hope to see them used in all sorts of libraries and frameworks, especially those that deal with user input.</p>
<p>In addition, I hope that the tooling ecosystem will adapt to support t-strings. For instance, I’d love to see <code>black</code> and <code>ruff</code> format t-string <em>contents</em>, and <code>vscode</code> <em>color</em> those contents, if they’re a common type like HTML or SQL.</p>
<p>It’s been fun to get to know and work with <a href="https://github.com/jimbaker">Jim</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pauleveritt">Paul</a>, <a href="https://github.com/koxudaxi">Koudai</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lysnikolaou">Lysandros</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido</a> on this project and to interact with <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep750-template-strings-new-updates/71594">many more members of the Python community</a> online without whose input PEP 750 simply wouldn’t have come together. I can’t wait to see what developers build with t-strings once they ship!</p> </div></div>]]></description>

We estimate the effect of social media deactivation on users’ emotional state in two large randomized experiments before the 2020 U.S. election. People who deactivated Facebook for the six weeks before the election reported a 0.060 standard deviation improvement in an index of happiness, depression, and anxiety, relative to controls who deactivated for just the first of those six weeks. People who deactivated Instagram for those six weeks reported a 0.041 standard deviation improvement relative to controls. Exploratory analysis suggests the Facebook effect is driven by people over 35, while the Instagram effect is driven by women under 25.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TikTok uses a custom virtual machine (VM) as part of its obfuscation and security layers. This project includes tools to:</p>

<li><strong>Deobfuscate</strong> <code>webmssdk.js</code> that has the virtual machine.</li>
<li><strong>Decompile</strong> TikTok’s virtual machine instructions into readable form.</li>

<p dir="auto">When looking at <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfVersions/raw.js">webmssdk.js</a> you're met with a
heavily obfuscated file. The main method of obfuscating Javascript
is to take advantage of bracket notation which let's you index a variable
using another variable.</p>
<p dir="auto">So when you see something like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// Line 3391 of ./deobfVersions/raw.js
r[Gb[301]](Gb[57], e))"><pre><span>// Line 3391 of ./deobfVersions/raw.js</span>
<span>r</span><span>[</span><span>Gb</span><span>[</span><span>301</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>Gb</span><span>[</span><span>57</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You have absolutely no idea what it's indexing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each use of this method is using an array <code>Gb</code> defined as</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    var Gb = [&quot;ydTGHdFNV&quot;, &quot;sNxpGNHMrpLV&quot;, &quot;xyrNMLEN Fpp rpMu&quot;, &quot;ydWyNe&quot;, ...].map(function(a) {
        return a.split(&quot;&quot;).map(function(c) {

        }).join(&quot;&quot;)
    });"><pre>    <span>var</span> <span>Gb</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"ydTGHdFNV"</span><span>,</span> <span>"sNxpGNHMrpLV"</span><span>,</span> <span>"xyrNMLEN Fpp rpMu"</span><span>,</span> <span>"ydWyNe"</span><span>,</span> ...<span>]</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As you can see we can't even read this either as it's all encoded
using this string <code>"LsfVNxutyOcrEMpYAGdFHneaUKRXSgoJDbhqICzPZklivTmWBwQj"</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because this code get's executed immediately we can simply take this snippet
and run it in any console and retrieve:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[
    &quot;isTrusted&quot;,
    &quot;beforeunload&quot;,
    &quot;filename too long&quot;,
    &quot;isView&quot;,
    ...
]"><pre><span>[</span>
    <span>"isTrusted"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"beforeunload"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"filename too long"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"isView"</span><span>,</span>
    ...
<span>]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">We can now see each of these strings, therefore we can use RegEx to go through
the script and replace all uses of the array as seen <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfuscation/changeNotation.js#L322">here</a>
It will also convert the bracket notation back to readable dot notation.</p>
<p dir="auto">After that we've left with <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfVersions/ems1.js">webmssdk1</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The example from above now looks like this</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="r.addEventListener(&quot;abort&quot;, e),"><pre><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"abort"</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span><span>,</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Much better.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another significant obfuscation method used is for disguising function calls.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each function is defined in an array <code>Ab</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="  var Ab = [function(e) {

<p dir="auto">When using common IDE's if we click on this function it will just bring us to
the start of the array making it difficult to keep track of what function call
is calling what function.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can make this readable by:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Taking the array</li>
<li>Replace each of the function element with it's own standard function calling it <code>function Abindex(args)</code></li>
<li>Replace each call to <code>Ab[index](args)</code> with <code>Abindex(args)</code></li>

<p dir="auto">We can do this by using the AST form of the script via bapel as seen <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfuscation/bapel.js#L55">here</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Which gives us <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfVersions/ems2.js#L1798">this</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Virtual Machine part of the script, specifically when executing the bytecode
is a nested if else statement as seen <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfVersions/ems2.js#L2235">here</a></p>
<p dir="auto">It is actually just a normal switch case but has been disguised pretty well. After manually
doing some of the cases, AI was able to help me out and do the rest. Which gave me <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/handleBytecode.js">this</a>,
which looks pretty standard for a bytecode VM.</p>
<p dir="auto">When debugging the Virtual Machine later and seeing which functions it uses
I was able to tell what it's doing and changed some of var names.</p>

<p dir="auto">TikTok is using a full-fledged bytecode VM, if you browse through <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/vm.js">it</a>, it supports
scopes, nested functions and exception handling. This isn't a typical VM and shows that
it is definitely sophiscated.</p>
<p dir="auto">To be able to write a form of decompilation I simply went through each of the cases
and wrote appropriate code for each one, and any case that jumps to another position
for loops like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="case 2:
    var a = instructions[index++];
    stack[pointer] ? --pointer : index += a;

    <span>break</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">I would simply stop it from doing so:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="case 2:

    //stack[pointer] ? --pointer : index += a;

    addCode(`// if (!v${pointer}) skip ${a} to ${index + a}`, byteCodePos)
    break;"><pre>case <span>2</span>:

<p dir="auto">After doing this for all the cases I dumped each file <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/decompiler/functions">here</a>.
It's not completely readable but you should be able to make out a general idea
of what each function is doing, for example <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/decompiler/functions/VM223.js">VM223</a> which is

<p dir="auto">As this is a Javascript file executed on the web, it is actually possible to replace
the normal <code>webmssdk.js</code> with the deobfuscated file and use TikTok normally.</p>
<p dir="auto">This can be achieved by using two browser extensions known as <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en-GB" rel="nofollow">Tampermonkey</a> for executing
custom code and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/disable-content-security/ieelmcmcagommplceebfedjlakkhpden?hl=en-GB&amp;pli=1" rel="nofollow">CSP</a> to disable CSP so I can fetch files from blocked origins. This is so I
can put <code>latestDeobf.js</code> in my own file server and have it be fetched each time, this is so I can easily
edit the file and let the changes take effect each time I refresh. This makes it much easier to bebug
when reversing functions.</p>

<p dir="auto">Now that we have deobfuscated the file and decompiled the VM we can
start to reverse any function we want and figure out what it's doing.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you make a request to the server it usually consists of 3 additional headers.</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>

<p dir="auto">When making a request that doesn't require authentication like querying a user. Only <code>X-Bogus</code> is
needed to be generated which can be done using <code>window.frontierSign</code>. <code>_signature</code> isn't needed
and any <code>msToken</code> can be used.</p>
<p dir="auto">This popular <a href="https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api">API</a> let's you make those requests.
It uses a webdriver library called <a href="https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-playwright" rel="nofollow">playwright</a>, that simply sets up a browser instance, so it can easily call <code>window.frontierSign</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to making authentication-based requests like posting a comment, <code>_signature</code> is needed
and isn't exposed to <code>window</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The inital function call for each request is <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/decompiler/functions/VM86.js">VM86</a> which then calls</p>

                  <h2><span><strong>Abstract</strong>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>A sustained, coordinated social media harassment and doxxing campaign – which we codenamed JUICYJAM – targeting the pro-democracy movement in Thailand has run uninterrupted, and unchallenged, since at least August 2020. We define doxxing as the search for and the publication of an individual’s personal data on the Internet with malicious intent, in this instance, to suppress and harass the Thai pro-democracy movement. The operation utilized an inauthentic persona over multiple social media platforms (primarily X and Facebook) to target pro-democracy protesters by doxxing individuals, continuously harassing them, and instructing followers to report them to the police. Through our analysis of public social media posts we determined that the campaign was not only inauthentic, but the information revealed could not have been reasonably sourced from a private individual. Thanks to a public leak of confidential military and police documents in March 2025, we can now attribute the campaign to the Royal Thai Armed Forces and/or the Royal Thai Police. With a high rate of following and engagement across platforms, JUICYJAM is an uncommon instance of a successful state-sponsored influence operation. JUICYJAM’s tactics support a larger network of judicial harassment and democratic suppression that is infrequently enforced by social media platforms, but poses a significant threat to civil society.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Since at least August 2020, a coordinated social media harassment and doxxing campaign targeting the Thai pro-democracy movement has run uninterrupted and unchallenged. We codenamed it JUICYJAM.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Thanks to a public leak of confidential military and police documents that occurred in March 2025, we can now attribute the campaign to the Royal Thai Armed Forces and/or the Royal Thai Police, whose online repression efforts have allegedly been merged into a joint “Cyber Team” since 2023.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The campaign operates within a broader context of dissent repression tactics, both online and offline, that closely resemble those we have previously analyzed in other regions – such as, for example, in Hong Kong.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>JUICYJAM’s longstanding, uninterrupted activity over multiple social media platforms (primarily X and Facebook) once again exposes the shortcomings of platforms in creating and enforcing policies on highly coordinated and harmful doxxing campaigns intended to suppress civil society.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Platforms’ policies on doxxing seldom consider the behaviour in the context of coordinated – and often state-sponsored – campaigns against civil society. They also do not consider environmental factors, such as the doxxing happening during unrest and protests.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><a id="background"></a>Background</strong></h2>
<p><span>In 2014, Thailand faced its second military coup of the century, placing a military junta – the National Council for Peace and Order – in power. The junta immediately imposed martial law, ratified a military-backed constitution, and, in 2019, the former army chief who led the coup, Prayuth Chan-o-cha, was elected Prime Minister. In July 2020, youth-led pro-democracy protests broke out across the country, demanding a more democratic constitution and reforms to the monarchy. The protesters were met with severe repression, and after a two-year </span><a href="https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/thailand_report_second_wave_774a_sg_au_210906.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pause</span></a><span> of prosecutions, in November 2020, Prime Minister Prayuth ordered authorities to bring back the enforcement of </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span>, or Section 112 of the Criminal Code, which criminalizes “insulting the monarchy”. Thailand’s use of </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span> has been both arbitrary and prolific; protesters can be arrested for as little as </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-49963123" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>sharing social media posts</span></a><span> that are ‘insulting to the monarchy’. Furthermore, the weaponization of </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span> has devastating consequences: those convicted under Section 112 face three to 15 years in prison per count. Thai authorities have extensively used </span><i><span>lèse-majesté </span></i><span>as a tool to punish pro-democracy advocates, with around 270 protesters detained and convicted </span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/01/thailand-must-immediately-repeal-lese-majeste-laws-say-un-experts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>since 2020</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Weaponizing the judiciary has not been enough, however. Since the 2014 coup, the Thai pro-democracy movement has been heavily targeted through various digital means. In 2022, Citizen Lab researchers uncovered an extensive </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/07/geckospy-pegasus-spyware-used-against-thailands-pro-democracy-movement/"><span>espionage campaign</span></a><span> impacting several groups within the movement, such as FreeYOUTH and WeVo. In fact, one of the authors of this report, Katekanok Wongsapakdee, was also found to be targeted.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, </span><a href="https://globaldemocracycoalition.org/library/state-sponsored-online-disinformation-impact-on-electoral-integrity-in-thailand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>multiple influence operations</span></a><span> (IOs) have been exposed for their attempts to discredit the pro-democracy movement and intimidate its members. In October 2020, the company now called X (formerly Twitter) exposed one of the most notorious online IOs targeting the Thai protest movement when it </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240810002008/https://blog.x.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/disclosing-removed-networks-to-our-archive-of-state-linked-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>announced</span></a><span> the removal of 926 covertly coordinated accounts. The network of accounts was attributed with high confidence to the Royal Thai Army (RTA). Twitter found the accounts to be “engaging in amplifying pro-RTA and pro-government content, as well as engaging in behavior targeting prominent political opposition figures.”<a id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span>Further analysis conducted by the </span><a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/ym245nv3149" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Stanford Internet Observatory</span></a><span> found that this influence operation did not achieve any relevant traction with legitimate audiences. The authors state that “the accounts had few followers, the tweets received very low levels of engagement, and the magnitude of tweets is unlikely to have effectively diverted public attention”. Despite the relative investment of resources to conduct this operation, it appears to have failed.</span></p>
<p><span>Twitter’s takedown did not, however, stop influence operations from being deployed to repress the then still very active pro-democracy protests in Thailand. Within this context, we identified several social media campaigns for research candidates, and singled out one that appeared to show the hallmarks of a well-coordinated, and resourced, influence operation. We set out to investigate the campaign’s footprint, tactics, and to determine attribution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We codenamed this operation JUICYJAM.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Leak</strong></h2>
<p><span>While compiling our initial analysis on JUICYJAM, there was a significant leak of information from a Member of the Thai Parliament. On March 25, 2025, Thai MP Chayaphon Satondee, released confidential </span><a href="https://x.com/ThaiEnquirer/status/1904559473940955395" target="_blank"><span>documents</span></a><span> allegedly illustrating the influence operation’s machinery put in place by the Thai authorities to quash dissent.</span></p>
<p><span>It is important to clarify the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We could not independently verify the documents as authentic, or complete. The documents were released by a Thai opposition MP, who claimed to have obtained them from “military and police officers who love democracy,”<a id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the context of a general debate for a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Paethongtarn Shinawatra.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The MP claims the documents originated from a joint-forces “Cyber ​​Team” created in 2023<a id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>. They allegedly contain the “Weekly Cyber ​​Team Operations Report” for August 17-23, 2024, or the first week after Paethongtarn Shinawatra received parliamentary approval to assume the position of Prime Minister, and the report for October 19-25, 2024, or the period after Paethongtarn assumed the position of Prime Minister.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We could review the available documents in detail thanks to the MP making them available on the web<a id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>, which allowed us to assess them as, at the very least, highly plausible.</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The documents’ layout, language, and alleged purpose are consistent with those from internal reports produced by a military or law enforcement agency.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The documents were reported about in detail by international, as well as local, media, such as the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/thai/articles/c20lw5qx4z1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>BBC</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>What caught our attention, however, was the presence, within a set of leaked presentation slides ostensibly explaining the strategy behind the IO, of several tweets where the account’s handle was consistently cut off from the presented screenshot, as if to protect it from inadvertent exposure.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Through cross-comparison, we were able to confirm that the tweets seen in the documents had been posted by the X handle we had been researching as the main online asset for </span>JUICYJAM<span>: <code>@jjookklong3</code>.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If authentic, the leaked documents prove JUICYJAM to be a state-sponsored influence operation, designed to suppress the protest groups, and to counter protest narratives, through a variety of aggressive tactics.</p>
<h2><strong>A Well-Coordinated Suppression Network</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p><i>Note</i><i><span>: as we have done in </span></i><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/07/hkleaks-covert-and-overt-online-harassment-tactics-to-repress-the-2019-hong-kong-protests/"><i><span>previous research</span></i></a><i><span>, in this report we define </span></i><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01296612.2020.1850000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span>doxxing</span></i></a><i><span> as the search for and the publication of an individual’s personal data on the Internet with malicious intent.</span></i></p>
<p>JUICYJAM is a prolific set of social media entities, particularly on X and on Facebook, working in coordination to dox and harass individuals and groups within the broader Thai pro-democracy camp. It centres around a single persona, a supposed middle-aged businesswoman going by the name of “Ms. Juk Khlong Sam”. Visually, it consistently utilizes a character from the popular Japanese Anime comic “One Piece”<a id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> in its profile and cover photos.</p>
<p>Unlike many other influence operations<a id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a>, JUICYJAM can be considered as highly successful. Utilizing its visible views and engagement metrics as a proxy measure for influence, we can observe that the campaign enjoys:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Almost 110,000 followers on its X account, with tweet views often upwards of 15,000 (peaks of more than 50,000), and a consistent flow of likes, replies, and retweets.</li>
<li aria-level="1">A combined (non-unique) count of more than 133,000 followers on Facebook<span>, divided between Pages (claimed to be non-official, as we will see, but reposting the X account’s same doxxing content), and a Group. An average post by one of the Facebook Pages typically achieved several hundred reactions, and dozens of comments.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span><span>The vast majority of that audience, and of the consequent engagement, appears to be authentic – i.e. generated by real users, rather than other accounts operated by JUICYJAM.</span></span></li>
</ul>

The post shows over 2,000 reactions, 144 comments, and almost 50 shares.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong><a id="timeline"></a>Timeline</strong></h2>
<p>We can observe JUICYJAM’s activity as far back as August 2020. At that time, two identical blogs were created on separate platforms – WordPress<a id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> and Blogger<a id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>, respectively – only days apart. On them, the previously unseen alias “Ms. Juk Khlong Sam”<span> published two separate posts containing photos and private information – the veracity of which we could not verify – on two alleged members of the Thai protest movement. Some of the information being exposed included the names of the individuals’ family members; the schools they attended; or the name and location of the small businesses their families owned.</span></p>
<p><span>The blogs were no longer updated after the two posts were made. The persona, however, lived on.</span></p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, a Twitter (now X) account was created utilizing the same alias as the blogs: <code>@jjookklong3</code>. The profile for the first time displayed pictures of the “Big Mom” Anime character – which will remain a constant theme for the operation across its several years of activity.</p>
<figure><p><img decoding="async" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2.png" alt="" width="1043" height="545" title="JUICYJAM: How Thai Authorities Use Online Doxxing to Suppress Dissent 2" srcset="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2.png 1043w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-300x157.png 300w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-1024x535.png 1024w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-768x401.png 768w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-605x316.png 605w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-297x155.png 297w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-500x261.png 500w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-180x94.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Header of the <code>@jjookklong3</code> X (Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/jjookklong3" target="_blank">account</a>, showing the “Big Mom” character from “One Piece” as the profile picture.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>According to what is visible today, the account began posting approximately one week after its creation, on September 9, 2020. Its </span><a href="https://x.com/jjookklong3/status/1303518244414791680" target="_blank"><span>first known tweet</span></a><span> (</span><a href="https://archive.ph/oiIre" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>archive</span></a><span>) described the account’s operator as a woman, disconcerted and indignant with the protest movement’s actions. The persona will be further built over the following years, as we will see later in this report.</span></p>
<p><span>Shortly after the publishing of the Twitter account, several assets utilizing the same (or very similar) naming convention, and an identical “Big Mom” visual theme, surfaced on Facebook.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The first, created in mid November 2020, was a </span>Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/jjookklong3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Group</a> called “เจ๊จุก คลองสาม Family” (Ms. Juk Khlong Sam Family).
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">The Group was set as private, but visible<a id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a>, meaning that we could observe the existence of the Group itself, as well as some other information related to it, but not its contents.</li>
<li aria-level="2">The Facebook Group in question utilized the same alias, and the same anime character, seen everywhere else until that moment.</li>
<li aria-level="2">On its Twitter/X account, “Ms. Juk Khlong Sam” repeatedly claimed ownership of the Facebook Group<span>, even redirecting its followers to specific posts made within it.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The Group remains very active to this day, with approximately 13 posts made per day, according to the visible statistics.</span></li>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A few months after the Group, in March 2021, the first of several </span>Facebook Pages<span> (</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jjookklong3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>1</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jjookklong3v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>2</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jjookklong3v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>3</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064600722544" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>4</span></a><span>) using the same naming and visual patterns, and reposting the same content as the Twitter account, was published.</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Unlike the Group, none of them were claimed by <code>@jjookklong3</code></span><span>&nbsp;– at that point steadily at the epicenter of the campaign. In fact, the X profile even </span><a href="https://archive.ph/7lvwK" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>repudiated</span></a><span> them on occasions, which apparently prompted the Pages’ administrators to </span><a href="https://archive.ph/NfDas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>explain</span></a><span><a id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> that their intent was to further amplify the contents of the Twitter account over Facebook.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>All Pages went inactive in 2021, except for </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jjookklong3v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>one</span></a><span> (เจ๊จุก คลองสาม FC v.1).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>A broader set of social media accounts replicating the Twitter account’s and other existing profiles’ patterns was published in the subsequent years:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>An Instagram </span><a href="https://instagram.com/jjook_klong3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>account</span></a><span> with two posts, which was linked to in the bio header of the <code>@jjookklong3</code></span><span>&nbsp;Twitter account, allowing us to confirm it as affiliated.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A TikTok </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jjook_klong3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>profile</span></a><span>, with only one video posted.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A Telegram </span><a href="https://t.me/jjookklong3" target="_blank"><span>account</span></a><span> – we were unable to review its posts.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A Threads </span><a href="https://www.threads.net/@jjook_klong3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>profile</span></a><span> with approximately 30 publicly visible posts</span><span>.<a id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>On April 4, 2025, as we were preparing this report for publication, a new </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jjook.klongsam" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Facebook Page</span></a><span> was created. For the first time, the X profile </span><code><span>@jjookklong3</span></code> <a href="https://archive.ph/vAkAr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>claimed it</span></a><span> as its own, and asked its X audience to follow it. Given the limited available time, we did not conduct in-depth analysis of the Page’s activity.</span></p>
<p>Overall, the core of the activity for the operations appeared to rely on the X profile and the Facebook Group. However, the ostensibly “unofficial” (but evidently tolerated, at the very least) Facebook Pages effectively also acted as an amplifier for the same harassment and doxxing content posted on Twitter. <span>The newly created “official” Facebook Page could now also acquire a prominent role in the campaign, showing it as fully active as of April 2025.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a id="ecosystem"></a>A Broader Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p><span>While their analysis is out of scope for this report, we nonetheless note that JUICYJAM does not exist in isolation. We were able to identify several other social media entities covertly amplifying its contents, as well as producing their own.</span></p>
<p><span>Several of the social media handles revealed as operated by the Thai authorities in the March 2025 leak were also found to be reposting, or otherwise interacting with JUICYJAM.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we found at least one news channel consistently amplifying and propagating JUICYJAM’s doxxing posts, both on broadcast and social media.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Confirming JUICYJAM as an Influence Operation</strong></h2>
<p><span>Several signals had pointed us towards the assessment that “Ms. Juk Khlong Sam”</span> <span>was most likely an inauthentic persona.</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>First, no piece of content ever posted by any of the JUICYJAM online assets contained verified identifiable information on the account’s owner. Claims that the operator owned a factory, that “she” was a middle-aged woman with a past in the protest movement herself, or that she had directly taken pictures of protesters – none of that could be confirmed through what the persona ever published.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Secondly, a significant portion of the photographic and video footage included in the posts, as well as many of the personal details shared about the targets, could not reasonably have been sourced by a private individual. We show a few examples below.<br>
</span></li>

<h2><strong>Attributing JUICYJAM</strong></h2>
<p>Based on the leaked documents, as well as circumstantial evidence we have collected during our research, we can now attribute JUICYJAM to the Royal Thai Armed Forces and/or the Royal Thai Police. Drawing from our observations – discussed in the following section – on the content type, behavioural patterns, and language utilized for JUICYJAM, however, we assess that this particular operation is more likely to be run by the Royal Thai Police. We detail the rationale behind our assessment further below.</p>
<h2><strong>Evidence from Leaked Documents</strong></h2>
<p><span>It is important to start by saying that the documents released to the public on March 25, 2025 show an alleged coordinated effort across multiple branches of the Thai military and police forces since at least 2023. JUICYJAM – active since 2020 – was probably merged into the broader coordinated effort when that was formed.</span></p>
<p><span>As summarized by the local news outlet </span><a href="https://archive.ph/N10Gx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Thai Enquirer</span></a><span>, “documents from the army show that before the 2023 election, the military convened security meetings to analyze movements deemed anti-monarchy. This led to the creation of a “Special Security Task Force” coordinating operations across military branches.” Additionally, “the Cyber Team was established to coordinate efforts across agencies”, and “the IO structure was unified before the 2023 election”. The 2023 Thai general election happened on </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230320164814/https://ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/documents/140A022N0000000000100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>May 14, 2023</span></a><span>.</span></p>

The column at the right end identifies police officials – marked by red boxes – while the other columns show military officials. The picture was posted by the X account for Thai Enquirer at this <a href="https://x.com/ThaiEnquirer/status/1904559473940955395/photo/1" target="_blank">address</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/Vb34j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archive</a>).</figcaption></figure>

<p>In this context, we could identify at least two leaked presentations intended to demonstrate the Cyber Team’s tactics to an internal audience. As part of that demonstration, the two documents show a total of five tweets that we can prove were published by the Twitter (X) account <code>@jjookklong3</code>.</p>
<p>The files are titled “Our Strategy August 67”<a id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> (ยุทธศาสตร์ฝ่ายเรา สิงหาคม 67.pdf) and “Our Strategy October 67” (ยุทธศาสตร์ฝ่ายเรา ตุลาคม 67.pdf), respectively.</p>
<p><span>The slides present the tweets by <code>@jjookklong3</code></span><span>&nbsp;– whose handle, as previously mentioned, is redacted – as tactical responses deployed to suppress protest narratives perceived as threatening for the establishment.</span></p>
<p><span>The first example showed how <code>@jjookklong3</code> </span><span>was utilized to counter a specific protest narrative. The narrative was popularized in response to the arrest and conviction of Jatuporn Sae-ung, an activist whose doxxing we address later on in this report.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the leaked slides provided below, <code>@jjookklong3</code> </span><span>was employed by the ‘Cyber Team’ to counteract the protest narrative through two common IO methods:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Distraction: moving the focus of its audience towards a more defensible argument than the one for which the target was arrested and charged;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Smear: discrediting the target by suggesting they were associated with a given person or group (in the example provided, a now disbanded political party in the Thai opposition).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>The reproduction, verbatim, of tweets by <code>@jjookklong3</code></span><span>&nbsp;in the context of regular internal reports on the IO tactics deployed by the interforce “cyber team” has no other plausible explanation than the fact that the account – and therefore the entire campaign – was run by the Cyber Team itself.</span></p>
<p><span>As for the specific branch responsible for creating and operating JUICYJAM, we cannot reach a definitive conclusion. However, we do note</span> circumstantial evidence <span>that this particular IO could be conducted by the</span> Royal Thai Police<span>. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="#background">mentioned 2020 influence operation</a> attributed to the Royal Thai Army by X, formerly Twitter, the tweets made available by the platform showed an insisted focus on promoting the Royal Thai Army and attacking individual protesters.</li>
<li>A qualitative comparison of the language used by the 2020 IO and @jjookklong3 shows a clear difference. @jjookklong3’s focus is on targeting individual protesters, calling for their arrest, and promoting the Royal Thai Police.</li>
<li>As mentioned before, several pieces of photographic and video content posted by @jjookklong3 – and the connected social media and blogging handles – appear to have been either captured or likely acquired by the Royal Thai Police.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><a id="real-life-impact-of-JJ"></a>The Real-Life Impact of JUICYJAM: A Multidimensional Attack on the Protest Movement</strong></h2>
<p><span>Like comparable influence operations designed to quash protest movements and prop autocratic regimes, it is critical to consider the real-life implications of JUICYJAM. Similarly to what we had highlighted in the context of the 2020-2021 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong – see our report on the “</span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/07/hkleaks-covert-and-overt-online-harassment-tactics-to-repress-the-2019-hong-kong-protests/"><span>HKLEAKS</span></a><span>” campaign – the Thai actors appear to maximize their impact through the concurrent action of smear campaigns, intimidation, illegal assaults, and judicial harassment.</span></p>
<p><span>We identified a pattern that linked the doxxing and online harassment of individual protesters by </span><span><code>@jjookklong3</code> </span><span>to their arbitrary detention, and subsequent charging, by the local authorities. On some occasions, the targets have also been assaulted by unidentified masked gangs before their arrest.</span></p>

<p>The ultimate goal of following up doxxing with judicial harassment – a process that has been documented in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2025.2461478" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>previous research</span></a><span> – is to reduce the target to silence and inaction, if not exile, through the combined power of covert and overt repression.</span></p>
<p><span>A few examples of the impact of these combined methods include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Jatuporn Sae-ung (จตุพร แซ่อึง), also known as “New”</b>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Jatuporn Sae-ung was at the centre of the </span><code>@jjookklong3</code> <span>tweets we observed as part of the leaked documents allowing us to attribute the campaign to the Thai authorities. She was accused by JUICYJAM of having mocked the Monarchy – a crime punishable under the </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span> law, also known as Section 112 – for wearing a traditional Thai costume at a protest demonstration.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The JUICYJAM action was twofold: it doxxed and belittled Jatuporn (tweet </span><a href="https://archive.ph/PCVLC" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>) and the protesters (</span><a href="https://archive.ph/mukl3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>) in regards to the traditional costume, and to the related protest; and it sought to link her to the now-defunct opposition Move Forward Party (</span><a href="https://archive.ph/pI1IF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>). Two of these tweets were shown in the leaked presentation slides promoting the “Cyber Team” actions internally, as seen in the previous sections.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In September 2022, Jatuporn was </span><a href="https://archive.ph/atqtY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>sentenced</span></a><span><span> to three years in prison for mocking Queen Suthida, and temporarily released on bail.<br>

<li aria-level="2"><span>On March 20, 2021, he joined a demonstration dubbed REDEM, which was organized by Free YOUTH and the Democracy Restoration Group (DRG) in Bangkok.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Later on the same night, he was assaulted and brutally beaten by an unidentified group dressed in black. According to a Facebook </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/poramin.rassameesawas/posts/pfbid0jpCoFpJSBUqA3JAAG8QeW2meA4hjypZRqVrjnGVRrU2BKiyvtZnAsBUzaTukqdvnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>post</span></a><span> published by a friend of his, he was beaten with steel batons, and “suffered a cracked head, a cracked cheek, and a cracked lip.

<h2><strong>How Could JUICYJAM Operate Unchallenged For So Long?</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Key Factors</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The notion of doxxing is only sparsely captured within the policies of the main social media platforms.&nbsp; It is therefore difficult for an external reader to conclusively identify the rules and actions that the platforms promise to enact in response to its deployment.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Moreover, as doxxing is typically framed merely as a privacy violation, the platforms’ policies do not expressly consider its use by adversarial coordinated actors, particularly in the context of state repression.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Additionally, our analysis of JUICYJAM’s history shows that even when doxxing is specifically mentioned in policies, the related prohibitions are inconsistently enforced on.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Reviewing the Policies on Doxxing for X and Meta</strong></h2>
<p><span>In the current version of their </span><a href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Private Information policy</span></a><span> (last updated in March 2024), </span>X<span> states:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure><div><span>“You may not threaten to expose, incentivize others to expose, or publish or post other people’s private information without their express authorization and permission, or share private media of individuals without their consent. </span><span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span>Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called “doxxing,” is a breach of their privacy and can pose serious safety and security risks for those affected.”</span></p></div></figure>
<p><span>While JUICYJAM did primarily post pictures and videos taken at public demonstrations, it very frequently enriched them with private information and footage, including in certain cases government IDs and other official documents – which would most definitely qualify as “a breach of [the targets’] privacy” and posing “serious safety and security risks for those affected”. The continued, and highly prominent, activity and existence of the </span><code>@jjookklong3</code><span> account therefore appears to be a clear failure in this policy’s enforcement by the platform.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Platforms’ policies on doxxing seldom consider the behaviour in the context of coordinated – and often state-sponsored – campaigns against civil society, where the great imbalance of power between attackers and targets exponentially increases their harm, as we have seen in this report.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>They also do not consider environmental factors, such as the doxxing happening during unrest and protests.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/673967193790462-oversight-board-publishes-policy-advisory-opinion-on-the-sharing-of-private-residential-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, these issues were addressed in a set of 17 recommendations made to Meta by the Oversight Board <a id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> </span><span>&nbsp;in response to a request for a policy advisory opinion on “Sharing Private Residential Information”<a id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a>.

</table></div><figcaption><p><span><strong>Table 1.</strong> Recommendations 11 and 12 as provided by the Oversight Board to Meta. Excerpt from the </span><a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/pao-private-residential-information-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>full list</span></a><span> of 17 recommendations provided in response to the company’s </span><a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/673967193790462-oversight-board-publishes-policy-advisory-opinion-on-the-sharing-of-private-residential-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>request</span></a><span> for a policy advisory opinion on its “Sharing Private Residential Information” policy.</span></p></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>The Oversight Board’s </span><a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/oversight/oversight-board-recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>recommendations</span></a><span> – unlike </span><span>decisions</span><span> – are not binding. </span><span>Neither of these recommendations were implemented by Meta at the time of publication of this report.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Recommendation 11 was blocked (“no further action”), with Meta deferring its intended purposes to the existing partnership with “850 safety partners globally, including helplines and organisations that work with victims of harassment, online and offline”.</span></li>
<li><span>Recommendation 12 was initially labeled with “assessing feasibility”, stating that “to assess the board’s recommendation, we will first need to determine how to identify when sharing private residential information ‘is clearly related to malicious action that created a risk of violence or harassment’ and how we can log this type of information in our system.” However, the most recent update was shown to have happened on June 12, 2023.&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>We note that in the </span><a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/oversight/oversight-board-recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>complete list</span></a><span> of recommendations provided by the Oversight Board to Meta, Recommendation 12 on “Sharing Private Information” is also labelled as “no further action” and “no further updates”, signalling that the company has eventually decided not to implement it.</span></li>

<p><span>As shown before in this report <a id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a></span><span>, JUICYJAM’s inauthentic persona, and its doxxing and harassing content, continues to be visible – and highly reachable – on at least four Facebook Pages, one Facebook Group, one Instagram account, and one Threads account as of April 2025.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, successes in enforcing policies against coordinated doxxing do happen, occasionally. In June 2021, shortly before JUICYJAM started, </span>Google <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/google-takes-down-maps-targeting-hundreds-thais-accused-opposing-king-2021-06-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>removed</span></a><span> two custom Google Maps that “had listed the names and addresses of hundreds of Thai activists who were accused by royalists of opposing the monarchy”. The maps had been published by a team coordinated by Songklod “Pukem” Chuenchoopol, a prominent pro-monarchy activist, with the intention of reporting everyone named to the police for </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span>. We also noticed that the hashtag </span><span>#CaptainPooKhem</span><span> – commonly used by his supporters to amplify his posts – appears to be blocked on </span>Facebook<span>, returning </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/captainpookhem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>no results</span></a><span>. It remains however possible to post it, as can be seen on </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheNationThailand/posts/10157447102161937" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>existing posts</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusions: The Ongoing Harm of Coordinated Doxxing Continues to be Underestimated</strong></h2>
<p><span>Government-operated doxxing campaigns are potent tools of repression, and it is no accident that they are often targeted against peaceful pro-democracy movements.&nbsp; Critically, whether in Hong Kong, Thailand, or </span><a href="https://eastasiaforum.org/2022/12/05/doxxing-and-deficiencies-in-indonesias-cybersecurity-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>elsewhere</span></a><span>, governments and their proxies often deploy them to complement and enhance more traditional forms of state repression, like violence and deprivation of liberty.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of JUICYJAM, for example, targets of the campaign were also detained, charged, and often physically assaulted.<a id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a></span><span>&nbsp;The harm can be devastating.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Low Risk, High Reward</strong></h2>
<p><span>While JUICYJAM was ostensibly the work of a fictitious persona, the campaign was fueled with information and content only available to government entities. The veil of plausible deniability it offered to them was sufficient for the campaign to thrive for several years before being exposed as linked to the Thai authorities. There is also no guarantee that it will stop now.</span></p>
<p><span>In the conclusions to our </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/07/hkleaks-covert-and-overt-online-harassment-tactics-to-repress-the-2019-hong-kong-protests/"><span>report</span></a><span> on the HKLEAKS influence operation – which, as we have seen, followed the same general playbook as JUICYJAM – we had stated: “If digital repression is about raising the cost of activism, then the HKLEAKS case suggests that doxxing can be a fairly low risk but potentially high reward instrument of digital repression.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the extremely serious harms for the targets of doxxing campaigns, this statement continues to be accurate.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Coordinated Government-Backed Doxxing: Likely to Grow</strong></h2>
<p><span>JUICYJAM’s five-year-and-counting run in Thailand without serious disruption shows that the current tools, attention, and approach to this problem were largely insufficient to mitigate the harm caused to peaceful protesters and activists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Social media companies frame their limited action on doxxing as a necessary balance of freedom of expression and safety (and the difficulties of determining public vs. private information) <a id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn20"><sup>20</sup></a>.</span><span> However, repressive states specifically deploy coordinated doxxing as a technique to punish authentic freedom of expression </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> threaten safety. </span><span>Today, most major social media platforms are moving towards reducing, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/01/10/elon-musk-fired-80-per-cent-of-twitter-x-engineers-working-on-trust-and-safety/?sh=71c80f1c79b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>gutting</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly74mpy8klo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>eliminating</span></a><span> programs originally aimed at increasing ecosystem safety and health initiatives.&nbsp; Campaigns like JUICYJAM are likely to become more common as states learn from each other and operate in an increasingly permissive environment on certain platforms. The playbook stands to be repeated on a potentially global scale in a world that is seeing a continued </span><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2024/mounting-damage-flawed-elections-and-armed-conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>trend of democratic decline</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Outreach to Platforms</strong></h2>
<p><span>On April 9, 2025, we sent emails to </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Citizen-Lab-Letter-to-Meta_Redacted.pdf"><span>Meta</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Citizen-Lab-Letter-to-X_Redacted.pdf"><span>X</span></a><span> with questions and recommendations to address the concerns raised by our work. At the time of publication, we had not received a response from X. While Meta acknowledged receipt, they did not answer our questions.</span></p>
<p><span>Our recommendations to X and Meta include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Provide an easily accessible and responsive way (i.e. a hotline) for victims of doxxing to report the malicious public sharing of their private content</b><span>. The content should be quickly removed after Meta and X verified it as the product of doxxing.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Implement instruments for Meta and X to identify, and remove, networks acting in a coordinated manner to conduct doxxing</b><span>. The action should not only consist in the removal of individual pieces of content, but in the simultaneous removal, permanent ban, and subsequent monitoring of the networked actors responsible for the malicious activity.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Develop and implement instruments for the protection of civil society from doxxing</b><span> through Meta’s and X’s platforms in hybrid and authoritarian regimes according to The Economist Democracy Index, or Partly Free and Not Free countries according Freedom House’s Freedom in the World survey. Such instruments should include appropriate solutions on both the policy and the technological side.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Conduct an audit on the existence and activity of potential coordinated doxxing networks</b>, with priority on illiberal countries as defined per point above. Implement a coordinated removal of the networks confirmed as conducting doxxing. Publicly disclose proven cases of state-sponsored doxxing networks.</li>

    <p>TikZJax converts <code>script</code> tags (containing TikZ code) into SVGs.</p>

    <p>See a live demo at <a href="https://tikzjax.com/">https://tikzjax.com/</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="example">Example</h2>

    <p>In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your HTML, include </p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://tikzjax.com/v1/fonts.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://tikzjax.com/v1/tikzjax.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, include TikZ code such as</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/tikz"&gt;
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) circle (1in);
  \end{tikzpicture}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Your TikZ will be compiled into SVGs; the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element will be
replaced with the corresponding SVG.  For instance, the above code generates</p>  



<p>You can also use this for commutative diagrams.  For example, this code</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/tikz"&gt;
  \begin{tikzcd}
    A \arrow[r, "\phi"] \arrow[d, red]
      &amp; B \arrow[d, "\psi" red] \\
    C \arrow[r, red, "\eta" blue]
      &amp; |[blue, rotate=-15]| D
  \end{tikzcd}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will be rendered as</p>



<h2 id="howdoesthiswork">How does this work?</h2>

<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/kisonecat/web2js">web2js</a>, the Pascal source of <code>tex</code>
is compiled to WebAssembly; the latex format is loaded (without all the hyphenation data), and </p>

<pre><code>\documentclass[margin=0pt]{standalone}
\def\pgfsysdriver{pgfsys-ximera.def}
\usepackage{tikz}
</code></pre>

<p>is executed.  Then core is dumped; the resulting core is compressed, and by reloading the dumped core in the browser, it is possible to very quickly get to a point where TikZ can be executed.  By using an SVG driver for PGF along with <a href="https://github.com/kisonecat/dvi2html">dvi2html</a>, the DVI output is converted to an SVG.</p>

<p>To emphasize this: <b>all of this happens in the browser.</b></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <hr>
    
    
    
    <div id="preamble">
  <p>Every transactional system does four things:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It <em>executes</em> transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <em>orders</em> transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <em>validates</em> transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <em>persists</em> transactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><em>Executing</em> a transaction means evaluating the body of the transaction to produce the intended reads and writes.  There is still notable variety across systems as to how the body of a transaction is executed.  Writes might be applied to storage during this phase, or they might be buffered locally and submitted as a batch at the end.  A transaction might be executed more than once for different purposes.</p>
<p><em>Ordering</em> a transaction means assigning the transaction some notion of a time at which it occurred.  This could be a version, a timestamp, a log sequence number, or a more complex description of transaction IDs it happened before or after.  MVCC databases may assign two versions: an initial read version, and a final commit version. In this case, we’re mainly focused on the specific point at which the commit version is chosen — the time at which the database claims all reads and writes occurred atomically.</p>
<p><em>Validating</em> a transaction means enforcing concurrency control, or more rarely, domain-specific semantics.  If a transaction is going to be rejected for a system defined reason, such as having serializability conflicts with existing transactions, it will happen here.  When validation happens after ordering, it checks to see if the assigned order is valid.  When validation happens before ordering, it provides a range of acceptable commit versions, and the ordering step chooses one of them.</p>
<p><em>Persisting</em> a transaction makes making it durable, generally to disk.  Sometimes writes are incrementally made durable during transaction execution, but the key point in persistence is when all writes <em>and</em> the commit record marking the transaction as committed are durable.  Often this is noting how the system performs replication and persists the outcome of its atomic commitment protocol.  (And sometimes the lines between those two aren’t very clear.)</p>
<p>All four of these things must be done before the system may acknowledge a transaction’s result to a client.  However, these steps can be done in any order.  They can be done concurrently.  Different systems achieve different tradeoffs by reordering these steps.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="_examples">
Examples
</h2> 
<p>A classic optimistic concurrency control database will execute a transaction, and record the read and write sets.  Once execution finishes, a commit version is allocated, and concurrent transactions are checked for conflicts.  If no conflicts were found, the transaction is made durable, and acknowledged as committed.</p>

<p>A classic pessimistic concurrency control database executes a transaction and acquires locks as it runs to exclude conflicting transactions.  When the transaction finishes, it acquires a commit version, and then is persisted to disk.  Then it releases the locks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A client transaction starts by contacting one of the Proxies to obtain
a read version (i.e., a timestamp). The Proxy then asks the Sequencer
for a read version that is guaranteed to be no less than any
previously issued transaction commit version, and this read version
is sent back to the client. <span>Then the client may issue multiple reads
to StorageServers and obtain values at that specific read version.
Client writes are buffered locally without contacting the cluster.</span>
At commit time, the client sends the transaction data, including
the read and write sets (i.e., key ranges), to one of the Proxies
and waits for a commit or abort response from the Proxy. If the
transaction cannot commit, the client may choose to restart the
transaction from the beginning again.</p>
<p>A Proxy commits a client transaction in three steps. <span>First, the
Proxy contacts the Sequencer to obtain a commit version that is
larger than any existing read versions or commit versions.</span> The
Sequencer chooses the commit version by advancing it at a rate of
one million versions per second. <span>Then, the Proxy sends the transaction
information to range-partitioned Resolvers, which implement
FDB’s optimistic concurrency control by checking for read-write
conflicts</span>. If all Resolvers return with no conflict, the transaction
can proceed to the final commit stage. Otherwise, the Proxy marks
the transaction as aborted. <span>Finally, committed transactions are sent
to a set of LogServers for persistence</span>. A transaction is considered
committed after all designated LogServers have replied to the
Proxy, which reports the committed version to the Sequencer (to
ensure that later transactions' read versions are after this commit)
and then replies to the client. At the same time, StorageServers
continuously pull mutation logs from LogServers and apply committed
updates to disks.</p>

<p>So from breaking down this part of the paper, we see</p>

<p>A client executes a transaction.</p>

<p>The proxy acquires a commit version.</p>

<p>The transaction is made durable.</p>

<p>A familiar diagram!  FoundationDB operates as a classic optimistic concurrency control database.  With this in mind, if you’re trying to understand one piece of the system (e.g. distributed conflict checking in the resolvers), you can replace the other pieces temporarily with the minimal equivalents from the most simplistic optimistic database implementation (e.g. replace the log servers with appending to a single WAL on one disk).</p>

<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3523173873845838643">Spanner</a><a id="_sideref_3"></a><sup>[3]</sup> is Google’s flagship database, used extensively within Google, and inspired a generation of NewSQL databases that followed in its architectural footsteps<a id="_sideref_4"></a><sup>[4]</sup> of partitioned Paxos and distributed transactions.  For Spanner’s description of its transaction protocol, we see §4.2.1 Read-Write Transactions:

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Like Bigtable, writes that occur in a transaction are
buffered at the client until commit. As a result, reads
in a transaction do not see the effects of the transaction’s
writes. This design works well in Spanner because a read
returns the timestamps of any data read, and uncommitted writes have not yet been assigned timestamps.</p>
<p>Reads within read-write transactions use wound-wait to avoid deadlocks.
<span>The client issues reads
to the leader replica of the appropriate group, which
acquires read locks and then reads the most recent
data. While a client transaction remains open, it sends
keepalive messages to prevent participant leaders from
timing out its transaction. When a client has completed
all reads and buffered all writes, it begins two-phase
commit.</span> The client chooses a coordinator group and
sends a commit message to each participant’s leader with
the identity of the coordinator and any buffered writes.
Having the client drive two-phase commit avoids sending data twice across wide-area links.</p>
<p><span>A non-coordinator-participant leader first acquires
write locks.</span> It then chooses a prepare timestamp that
must be larger than any timestamps it has assigned to previous transactions (to preserve monotonicity), and logs a
prepare record through Paxos. Each participant then notifies the coordinator of its prepare timestamp.</p>
<p>The coordinator leader also first acquires write locks,
but skips the prepare phase. <span>It chooses a timestamp for
the entire transaction after hearing from all other participant leaders.</span> The commit timestamp s must be greater or
equal to all prepare timestamps (to satisfy the constraints
discussed in Section 4.1.3), greater than TT.now().latest
at the time the coordinator received its commit message,
and greater than any timestamps the leader has assigned
to previous transactions (again, to preserve monotonicity). <span>The coordinator leader then logs a commit record
through Paxos (or an abort if it timed out while waiting
on the other participants).</span></p>
<p>Before allowing any coordinator replica to apply
the commit record, the coordinator leader waits until
TT.after(s), so as to obey the commit-wait rule described
in Section 4.1.2. Because the coordinator leader chose s
based on TT.now().latest, and now waits until that timestamp is guaranteed to be in the past, the expected wait
is at least 2 * epsilon. This wait is typically overlapped with
Paxos communication. After commit wait, the coordinator sends the commit timestamp to the client and all
other participant leaders. Each participant leader logs the
transaction’s outcome through Paxos. <span>All participants
apply at the same timestamp and then release locks.</span></p>

</div>
<p>Spanner is a bit more complicated, partly because lock-related operations involved in transaction validation are stretched across the whole text.  It also tries to trick you by talking about details out of execution order, so make sure to always read closely for "then" to give hints on the ordering of the steps.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The execute and validate steps seem to be intertwined, as read locks are acquired while the transaction executes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writes are buffered until the client is ready to commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two-phase commit is started to check if the transaction can commit on all participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the coordinator has heard all of the minimum required timestamps from its participants during the two-phase commit’s prepare, it decides the final commit version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transaction is then made durable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, read and write locks are released.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Drawing this out, Spanner looks like:</p>

<p>Oh hey, it still looks exactly like a classic pessimistic concurrency control database.  So despite the significantly more complicated explanation of how transactions are executed, it’s reasonable to approach the paper from the viewpoint of "How does this end up being equal to SERIALIZABLE MySQL?", and you can think through how the two systems differ piece by piece.</p>
<h3 id="_tapir">
TAPIR
</h3> 
<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8784667365134534173">TAPIR</a><a id="_sideref_5"></a><sup>[5]</sup> is a strictly serializable database advertising itself as an improvement on Spanner that can commit transactions with better latency and throughput through the use of its novel replication protocol. The core of TAPIR is described in §5.2.1:
<span><a id="_sidedef_5"></a>[5]: <a id="TAPIR"></a>Irene Zhang, Naveen Kr. Sharma, Adriana Szekeres, Arvind Krishnamurthy, and Dan R. K. Ports. 2015. Building consistent transactions with inconsistent replication. In <em>Proceedings of the 25th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles</em> (SOSP '15), Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 263–278. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8784667365134534173">[scholar]</a></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><span>We begin with TAPIR’s protocol for executing transactions.</span></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For <code>Write(key, object)</code>, the client buffers <code>key</code> and <code>object</code> in
the write set until commit and returns immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <code>Read(key)</code>, if <code>key</code> is in the transaction’s write set, the
client returns <code>object</code> from the write set. If the transaction
has already read <code>key</code>, it returns a cached copy. Otherwise,
the client sends <code>Read(key)</code> to the replica.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On receiving <code>Read</code>, the replica returns <code>object</code> and <code>version</code>,
where <code>object</code> is the latest version of <code>key</code> and <code>version</code> is the
timestamp of the transaction that wrote that version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On response, the client puts <code>(key, version)</code> into the transaction’s read set and returns <code>object</code> to the application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Once the application calls Commit or Abort, the execution
phase finishes. To commit, the TAPIR client coordinates
across all participants — the shards that are responsible for
the keys in the read or write set — to find a single timestamp,
consistent with the strict serial order of transactions, to assign
the transaction’s reads and writes, as follows:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>The TAPIR client selects a proposed timestamp. Proposed
timestamps must be unique, so clients use a tuple of their
local time and their client id.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TAPIR client invokes <code>Prepare(txn, timestamp)</code> as an
IR consensus operation, where <code>timestamp</code> is the proposed
timestamp and <code>txn</code> includes the transaction id (<code>txn.id</code>)
and the transaction read (<code>txn.read set</code>) and write sets
(<code>txn.write set</code>). The client invokes Prepare on all participants
through IR as a consensus operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each TAPIR replica that receives Prepare (invoked by IR
through ExecConsensus) first checks its transaction log for
<code>txn.id</code>. If found, it returns PREPARE-OK if the transaction
committed or ABORT if the transaction aborted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the replica checks if txn.id is already in its
prepared list. If found, it returns PREPARE-OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Otherwise, the replica runs TAPIR’s OCC validation
checks, which check for conflicts with the transaction’s
read and write sets at timestamp, shown in Figure 8.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the TAPIR client receives results from all shards, the
client sends <code>Commit(txn, timestamp)</code> if all shards replied
PREPARE-OK or <code>Abort(txn, timestamp)</code> if any shards
replied ABORT or ABSTAIN. If any shards replied RETRY,
then the client retries with a new proposed timestamp (up
to a set limit of retries).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>On receiving a Commit, the TAPIR replica: (1) commits the
transaction to its transaction log, (2) updates its versioned
store with w, (3) removes the transaction from its prepared
list (if it is there), and (4) responds to the client.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On receiving a Abort, the TAPIR replica: (1) logs the
abort, (2) removes the transaction from its prepared list (if
it is there), and (3) responds to the client.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Which initially feels like a lot of description to work through, but it breaks down into separable pieces pretty well:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The transaction is executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clients picks a proposed commit timestamp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each replica then concurrently runs an OCC check and persists the data to the prepare log.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Thus, our diagram looks like:</p>

<div>

</p>
</div>
<p>This also highlights the key aspect of TAPIR: its blending of the concurrency control validation and commit outcome persistence protocols.</p>
<p>Tangentially, TAPIR was the inspiration behind this way of decomposing databases, as it included a nice diagram which I occasionally fell back to when reading papers I struggled to make sense of:</p>

<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11098336506858442351">Calvin</a><a id="_sideref_6"></a><sup>[6]</sup> is the iconic system for deterministic databases, and subsequent papers improving on various aspects of its design all share the same overall characteristics.  In §3 System Architecture, Calvin’s architecture is introduced as:
<span><a id="_sidedef_6"></a>[6]: <a id="Calvin"></a>Alexander Thomson, Thaddeus Diamond, Shu-Chun Weng, Kun Ren, Philip Shao, and Daniel J. Abadi. 2012. Calvin: fast distributed transactions for partitioned database systems. In <em>Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data</em> (SIGMOD/PODS '12), ACM. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11098336506858442351">[scholar]</a></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of Calvin lies in separating the system into three separate layers of processing:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The sequencing layer (or “sequencer”) intercepts transactional inputs and places them into a global transactional input
sequence</span>—this sequence will be the order of transactions to
which all replicas will ensure serial equivalence during their
execution. <span>The sequencer therefore also handles the replication and logging of this input sequence.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scheduling layer (or “scheduler”) <span>orchestrates transaction execution using a deterministic locking scheme to guarantee equivalence to the serial order specified by the sequencing layer while allowing transactions to be executed concurrently by a pool of transaction execution threads</span>. (Although
they are shown below the scheduler components in Figure 1,
these execution threads conceptually belong to the scheduling layer.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The storage layer handles all physical data layout. Calvin
transactions access data using a simple CRUD interface; any
storage engine supporting a similar interface can be plugged
into Calvin fairly easily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This means Calvin breaks down as:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sequence the transaction into a global log.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the log durable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take locks to know when one can safely execute in the serial order despite concurrency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute the transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop all locks acquired.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Calvin is the most well known example of a database which does <strong>not</strong> execute transactions before committing them. It gains some significant advantages from this, in that its commit process is completely immune to contention in the workload, and some disadvantages, in that long running transactions will stall any later committed transactions from executing.</p>

<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3451458773692631815">Exploiting Commutativity For Practical Fast Replication</a><a id="_sideref_7"></a><sup>[7]</sup> defines a Consistent Unordered Replication Protocol (CURP), that allows clients to replicate requests that have not yet been ordered, as long as they are commutative. Stitching together a few paragraphs from §3.2 Normal operation:
<span><a id="_sidedef_7"></a>[7]: <a id="CommutativeRaft"></a>Seo Jin Park and John Ousterhout. 2019. Exploiting Commutativity For Practical Fast Replication. In <em>16th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 19)</em>, USENIX Association, Boston, MA, 47–64. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3451458773692631815">[scholar]</a></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Client interaction with masters is generally the same as it
would be without CURP. <span>Clients send update RPC requests
to masters.</span> If a client cannot receive a response, it retries the
update RPC. If the master crashes, the client may retry the
RPC with a different server.</p>
<p>For 1 RTT updates, masters return to clients before replication to
backups. <span>To ensure durability, clients directly record
their requests to witnesses concurrently while waiting for
responses from masters. Once all f witnesses have accepted
the requests, clients are assured that the requests will survive
master crashes, so clients complete the operations with the
results returned from masters.</span></p>
<p><span>A witness accepts a new record RPC from a client only
if the new operation is commutative with all operations that
are currently saved in the witness. If the new request doesn’t
commute with one of the existing requests, the witness must
reject the record RPC since the witness has no way to order
the two noncommutative operations consistent with the
execution order in masters. For example, if a witness already
accepted “x←1”, it cannot accept “x←5”.</span></p>
<p>Each of f witnesses operates independently; witnesses
need not agree on either ordering or durability of operations.
In an asynchronous network, record RPCs may arrive at
witnesses in different order, which can cause witnesses to
accept and reject different sets of operations. However, this
does not endanger consistency. First, as mentioned in §3.2.1,
a client can proceed without waiting for sync to backups
only if all f witnesses accepted its record RPCs. Second,
requests in each witness are required to be commutative
independently, and only one witness is selected and used
during recovery (described in §3.3).</p>
<p>The role of masters in CURP is similar to their role in
traditional primary-backup replications. Masters in CURP
receive, serialize, and execute all update RPC requests from
clients. <span>If an executed operation updates the system state, the
master synchronizes (syncs) its current state with backups by
replicating the updated value or the log of ordered operations.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Thus, we can decompose CURP into its pieces:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clients read from the master and send the writes to both the leader and all the followers of a replication group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each replica concurrently checks for conflicts and records the transaction locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After replying to the client, the transactions are ordered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Thus, we have:</p>

<div>

</p>
</div>
<p>Which also very nicely shows how CURP is rather unique: ordering transactions is the last thing that it does, and ordering transactions last is how it derives all of its advantages.</p>

<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7246772973103959497">TicToc</a><a id="_sideref_8"></a><sup>[8]</sup> introduces itself as a new transaction protocol that assigns read and write timestamps to data items and uses them to lazily compute a valid commit timestamp for each transaction. Doing so removes the need for centralized timestamp allocation, and commits transactions that would be aborted by conventional timestamp ordering schemes.
<span><a id="_sidedef_8"></a>[8]: <a id="TicToc"></a>Xiangyao Yu, Andrew Pavlo, Daniel Sanchez, and Srinivas Devadas. 2016. TicToc: Time Traveling Optimistic Concurrency Control. In <em>Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data</em> (SIGMOD/PODS'16), ACM. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7246772973103959497">[scholar]</a></span></p>
<p>Sounds cool.  Stitching together some pieces of text from §3.2 Protocol Specification so that they read well in order, the transaction protocol is described as:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><span>In the read phase, the DBMS maintains a separate read set and write set of tuples for each transaction. During this phase, accessed tuples are
copied to the read set and modified tuples are written to the write
set, which is only visible to the current transaction. Each entry in
the read or write set is encoded as {tuple, data, wts, rts}, where
tuple is a pointer to the tuple in the database, data is the data value
of the tuple, and wts and rts are the timestamps copied from the tuple when it was accessed by the transaction. For a read set entry, TicToc maintains the invariant that the version is valid from wts to rts in timestamp order.</span></p>
<p>The first step of the validation phase is to lock
all the tuples in the transaction’s write set in their primary key order
to prevent other transactions from updating the rows concurrently.
Using this fixed locking order guarantees that there are no deadlocks with other transactions committing at the same time.</p>
<p><span>The second step in the validation phase is to compute the transaction’s commit timestamp from the timestamps stored within each
tuple entry in its read/write sets.</span> For a
tuple in the read set but not in the write set, the commit timestamp
should be no less than its wts since the tuple would have a different version before this timestamp. For a tuple in the transaction’s
write set, however, the commit timestamp needs to be no less than
its current rts + 1 since the previous version was valid till rts.</p>
<p><span>In the last step, the algorithm validates the tuples in the transaction’s read set. If the transaction’s commit_ts is less than or equal
to the rts of the read set entry, then the invariant wts ≤ commit_ts
≤ rts holds. This means that the tuple version read by the transaction is valid at commit_ts, and thus no further action is required.
If the entry’s rts is less than commit_ts, however, it is not clear
whether the local value is still valid or not at commit_ts. It is possible that another transaction has modified the tuple at a logical time
between the local rts and commit_ts, which means the transaction
has to abort. Otherwise, if no other transaction has modified the
tuple, rts can be extended to be greater than or equal to commit_ts,
making the version valid at commit_ts.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, if all of the tuples that the transaction accessed pass validation, then the transaction enters the write phase. In this phase the transaction’s write set is written to the database.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>And so breaking that down, we see:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The transaction is executed, with writes buffered until commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>While</em> the transaction executes, timestamps are recorded which narrow the possible range of commit versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once validation begins, a final commit timestamp is chosen and checked for conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all other steps are successful, the transaction is finally persisted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Thus, the diagram looks something like:</p>

<div>

<p><img src="https://transactional.blog/images/blog/2025-decomposing-transactional-systems/diag-dbdiag-spans-md5-e90eb28ad5e40164e91264c7fe6eadb3.svg" alt="Diagram" width="364" height="65" )="">
</p>
</div>
<p>TicToc does <em>dynamic timestamp assignment</em>.  Instead of choosing a choosing a timestamp before execution, or proposing a timestamp right before commit, it narrows ranges of possible commit timestamps as it executes.</p>

Composing Transactional Systems
</h2> 
<p>A fun part of such a decomposition is that it can be inverted to raise fun questions.  Draw any made up diagram of a possible ordering or interleaving of execute, order, validate, and persist.  Now answer the question: how would I need to design a database such that it would decompose to this diagram?</p>
<p>From all the possible orderings and sets of concurrently executing steps, there’s at least 74 different types of databases that can exist.  We’ve covered only a few of those, but each of them derives some interesting property from its different ordering of the steps of transaction processing.  Looking for a novel transactional system to build and publish about?  Find an ordering which hasn’t been well explored in the literature before, design a system that executes transactions in that fashion, and then figure out what it’s uniquely good and bad at.</p>
