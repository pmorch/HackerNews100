<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="435"><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-best-essay-1.gif" width="121" height="18" alt="The Best Essay"><span size="2" face="verdana">March 2024<p>Despite its title this isn't meant to be the best essay. My goal
here is to figure out what the best essay would be like.</p><p>It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.
What made it special would be what it was about.</p><p>Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably
wouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be
vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be
surprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know.</p><p>The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell
people something surprising about.</p><p>That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences.
One is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping
into a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of
natural selection in an essay written in 1844.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#dddddd">1</span></a>]</span>
Talk about an
important topic you could tell people something surprising about.
If that's the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one
written in 1844. And indeed, the best possible essay at any given
time would usually be one describing the most important scientific
or technological discovery it was possible to make.
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#dddddd">2</span></a>]</span><p>Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing
this that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best
essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best
one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true.
It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this
sense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing
natural selection now. The best essay <i>now</i> would be one describing
a great discovery we didn't yet know about.</p><p>If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to
the question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with
the wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we
shouldn't waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making
discoveries in some specific domain. But I'm interested in essays
and what can be done with them, so I want to see if there's some
other question I could have asked.</p><p>There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the
one I started with. Instead of asking <i>what would the best essay
be?</i> I should have asked <i>how do you write essays well?</i> Though
these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer
to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay
writing. The second question forces it to be.</p><p>Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do
you do that well? How do you discover by writing?</p><p>An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a
question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't
have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like
one in the sense that it spurs some response.</p><p>How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to
choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.
Professional traders won't even trade unless they have what they
call an <i>edge</i> — a convincing story about why in some class of
trades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't
attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about
it or way of approaching it.</p><p>You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind
of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about
something other people take for granted can be edge enough.</p><p>If you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could
be worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an
important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed
insignificant at first. How can they <i>all</i> be finches? 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#dddddd">3</span></a>]</span><p>Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud
about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific
string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This
initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts
your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because
once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.</p><p>Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting
with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because
this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some
specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's
wrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay
writing is rereading what you've written and asking <i>is this correct
and complete?</i> You have to be very strict when rereading, not just
because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between
your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be
discovered.</p><p>The prize for being strict with what you've written is not just
refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make
it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the
reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when
you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><span color="#dddddd">4</span></a>]</span><p>Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step
in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional
questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process
continues recursively, as response spurs response. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><span color="#dddddd">5</span></a>]</span><p>Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which
means you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped,
which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point.
How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the
greatest combination of generality and novelty. I don't consciously
rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting;
but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><span color="#dddddd">6</span></a>]</span><p>If you're willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don't have to guess
right. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it
isn't good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time.
In this essay I've already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition
to countless shorter ones. Maybe I'll reattach it at the end, or
boil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we'll
see. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><span color="#dddddd">7</span></a>]</span><p>In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous
temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep
something that isn't right just because it contains a few good bits
or cost you a lot of effort.</p><p>The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is
<i>does it really matter what the initial question is?</i> If the space
of ideas is highly connected, it shouldn't, because you should be
able to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few
hops. And we see evidence that it's highly connected in the way,
for example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn
any conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where
you want to go, and you don't in an essay. That's the whole point.
You don't want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your
essays will be about the same thing. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><span color="#dddddd">8</span></a>]</span><p>The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually
feel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don't think about this when
I decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality.
Sticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I've
wandered too far and have to backtrack. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><span color="#dddddd">9</span></a>]</span>
But I think this is
the optimal solution. You don't want the hunt for novelty and
generality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what
you get.<p>Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it
sets an upper bound on the quality of essay you'll write. If you
do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow
from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only
place where there's room for variation.</p><p>It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though,
because you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're
doing things right, because doing things right means making
discoveries, and by definition you can't predict those. So the way
to respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which
initial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays
are for taking risks.</p><p>Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some
effort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third
paragraph, because any essayist's first impulse on hearing that the
best essay couldn't be about x would be to try to write it. But if
most questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.</p><p>Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering
how long I've been writing essays, it's alarming how novel that
question feels.</p><p>One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love
questions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming
counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three.
This essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there
is such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive,
though it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay
being better than another. And thinking about how to do something
so ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.</p><p>I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just
a taste of mine, but there's one aspect of it that probably isn't:
to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested
in it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch
for the novel insights that are the raison d'etre of the essay, you
have to care.</p><p>If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question,
then the optimal question varies from person to person. It also
means you're more likely to write great essays if you care about a
lot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the
probable overlap between the set of things you're curious about and
the set of topics that yield great essays.</p><p>What other qualities would a great initial question have? It's
probably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas.
And I find it's a good sign if it's one that people think has already
been thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I've barely thought
about how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I
rarely <i>choose</i> what to write about; I just start thinking about
something, and sometimes it turns into an essay.</p><p>Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be
thinking about and instead start working my way through some
systematically generated list of topics? That doesn't sound like
much fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial
question matters, I should care about it.</p><p>Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever
pops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your
head is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the
answer, because a mere list of topics wouldn't be any use if you
didn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you
need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't
generate those systematically. If only. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><span color="#dddddd">10</span></a>]</span><p>You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The
quality of the ideas that come out of your head depend on what goes
in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.</p><p>You can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning
about topics that are very different from one another. When I tell
people about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy
books about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the
topics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps
that's actually optimal in this business.</p><p>You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building
things, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's
important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who
make you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an
afternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart
people. I know because that's what a block of office hours at Y
Combinator consists of.</p><p>While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes
from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have
to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,
I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have
done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other
fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your
time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was
hard.</p><p>I'm not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to
those already doing it. If you've spent all your life so far working
on other things, you're already halfway there. Though of course to
be good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing
you'd probably have spent at least some time doing it.</p><p>Everything I've said about initial questions applies also to the
questions you encounter in writing the essay. They're the same
thing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just
as every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any
technique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good
whole essays.</p><p>At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels
like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every
answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you
start to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground,
you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just
as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's
not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be
asking the initial question of a new essay.</p><p>That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:
the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough
starting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though
if you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by
burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of
essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.</p><p>When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You
can either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees
end to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually
it requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously
at this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an
example of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that
the best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the
best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be
worth investigating further.</p><p>There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about
a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect
on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that
looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.
But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays
teach, and you can't teach people something they already know.
Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,
but an essay explaining it couldn't have the same effect on us that
it would have had on Darwin's contemporaries, precisely because his
ideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><span color="#dddddd">11</span></a>]</span><p>I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay
would be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would
contain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to
Aristotle and Feynman. That doesn't seem to be true. But if the
best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in this stricter
sense, what would it take to write essays that were?</p><p>The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen
kind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that
its discoveries aren't assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise
there will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers.
If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as
well, you have to write essays that won't stick — essays that,
no matter how good they are, won't become part of what people in
the future learn before they read them. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><span color="#dddddd">12</span></a>]</span><p>I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about
things people never learn. For example, it's a long-established
pattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes,
and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them
weren't worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you
can be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised
by it.</p><p>Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo
things — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions,
for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn
to avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless
topic.</p><p>Sometimes when we're slow to grasp things it's not just because
we're obtuse or in denial but because we've been deliberately lied
to. There are a lot of things adults </p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/lies.html"><u>lie</u></a> 
to kids about, and when
you reach adulthood, they don't take you aside and hand you a list
of them. They don't remember which lies they told you, and most
were implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source
of surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.<p>Sometimes it's systems that lie to you. For example, the educational
systems in most countries train you to win by 
</p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/lesson.html"><u>hacking the test</u></a>. But
that's not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and
after decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real
world to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will
work as long as the institutions remain broken. 
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f13n"><span color="#dddddd">13</span></a>]</span><p>Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers
already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted
culturally. "Everyone knows," for example, that it can be rewarding
to have </p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/kids.html"><u>kids</u></a>. But till you have them you don't know precisely what
forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never
have put into words.<p>I've written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn't do it
in a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the
stricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one's ideas
not sticking suggests that it's not worth making a deliberate attempt
to. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but
if you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future
generations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the
better. You've crossed into Darwin territory.</p><p>Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of
something even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And
there are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to
lots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate
aim.</p><p>I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I'm
always chasing. But I'm glad I understand where timelessness fits.</p><p>I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has
been a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get
advice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing
left to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get
advice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would
be nice. But when you step back and ask what's the best you can do
short of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns
out to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a
function of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them
is by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting
with the answers.</p><p>The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are the
alternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questions
depend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence.
You don't have to get an answer right the first time, but there's
no excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep
rewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.
It's a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I'm rewriting
as we speak.</p><p>But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly
on effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the
difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing
to get. That pool has no bottom.</p><p>How to get more questions? That is the most important question of
all.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
Darwin wouldn't have chosen to publish his ideas this way.
His 1844 essay, like the 1839 version that preceded it, was written more to work out
his ideas than to communicate them. But Lyell and Hooker's hands were 
forced by Alfred Wallace's independent
discovery of natural selection before Darwin had published anything.<p>[</p><a name="f2n"><span color="#000000">2</span></a>]
There might be some resistance to this conclusion on the
grounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by
a small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties
if you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide
where the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a 
handful of people sequestered at Los Alamos,
could an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
When you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor
question, that's an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to
pay attention to things that matter. So when you're very curious
about something random, that could mean you've unconsciously noticed
it's less random than it seems.<p>[</p><a name="f4n"><span color="#000000">4</span></a>]
Corollary: If you're not intellectually honest, your writing
won't just be biased, but also boring, because you'll miss all the
ideas you'd have discovered if you pushed for the truth.<p>[</p><a name="f5n"><span color="#000000">5</span></a>]
Sometimes this process begins before you start writing.
Sometimes you've already figured out the first few things you want
to say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide <i>everything</i>
they want to say, and write this down as an outline before they
start writing the essay itself. Maybe that's a good way to get them
started — or not, I don't know — but it's antithetical to the
spirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less
your ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.<p>[</p><a name="f6n"><span color="#000000">6</span></a>]
The problem with this type of "greedy" algorithm is that you
can end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is
preceded by a boring one, you'll overlook it. But I can't imagine
a better strategy. There's no lookahead except by writing. So use
a greedy algorithm and a lot of time.<p>[</p><a name="f7n"><span color="#000000">7</span></a>]
I ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and
discarding the rest.<p>[</p><a name="f8n"><span color="#000000">8</span></a>]
Stephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when
taking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about
some general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the
exam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.<p>Strictly speaking it's the graph of ideas that would be highly
connected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who
don't know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get
what I mean if I say "space".</p><p>[</p><a name="f9n"><span color="#000000">9</span></a>]
Too far doesn't depend just on the distance from the original
topic. It's more like that distance divided by the value of whatever
I've discovered in the subtree.<p>[</p><a name="f10n"><span color="#000000">10</span></a>]
Or can you? I should try writing about this. Even if the
chance of succeeding is small, the expected value is huge.<p>[</p><a name="f11n"><span color="#000000">11</span></a>]
There was a vogue in the 20th century for saying that the
purpose of art was also to teach. Some artists tried to justify
their work by explaining that their goal was not to produce something
good, but to challenge our preconceptions about art. And to be fair,
art can teach somewhat. The ancient Greeks' naturalistic sculptures
represented a new idea, and must have been extra exciting to
contemporaries on that account. But they still look good to us.<p>[</p><a name="f12n"><span color="#000000">12</span></a>]
Bertrand Russell caused huge controversy in the early 20th
century with his ideas about "trial marriage." But they make boring
reading now, because they prevailed. "Trial marriage" is what we
call "dating."<p>[</p><a name="f13n"><span color="#000000">13</span></a>]
If you'd asked me 10 years ago, I'd have predicted that schools
would continue to teach hacking the test for centuries. But now it
seems plausible that students will soon be taught individually by
AIs, and that exams will be replaced by ongoing, invisible
micro-assessments.<span color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell,

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
    <td> <p><span size="6" color="#CCCC00">O</span>f course, Reading Day had been different. Partly, there was the 
        simple fact of childhood. A boy of eight takes many extraordinary things 
        in stride. One day you can’t read and the next day you can. That’s 
        just the way things are. Like the sun shining.</p>
      <p>And then not so much depended upon it. There were no recruiters just 
        ahead, waiting and jostling for the lists and scores on the coming Olympics. 
        A boy or girl who goes through the Reading Day is just someone who has 
        ten more years of undifferentiated living upon Earth’s crawling 
        surface; just someone who returns to his family with one new ability.</p>
      <p>By the time Education Day came, ten years later, George wasn’t 
        even sure of most of the details of his own Reading Day.</p>
      <p>Most clearly of all, he remembered it to be a dismal September day with 
        a mild rain falling. (September for Reading Day; November for. Education 
        Day; May for Olympics. They made nursery rhymes out of it.) George had 
        dressed by the wall lights, with his parents far more excited than he 
        himself was. His father was a Registered Pipe Fitter and had found his 
        occupation on Earth. This fact had always been a humiliation to him, although, 
        of course, as anyone could see plainly, most of each generation must stay 
        on Earth in the nature of things.</p>
      <p>There had to be farmers and miners and even technicians on Earth. It 
        was only the late-model, high-specialty professions that were in demand 
        on the Outworlds, and only a few millions a year out of Earth’s 
        eight billion population could be exported. Every man and woman on Earth 
        couldn’t be among that group.</p>
      <p>But every man and woman could hope that at least one of his children 
        could be one, and Platen, Senior, was certainly no exception. It was obvious 
        to him (and, to be sure, to others as well) that George was notably intelligent 
        and quick-minded. He would be bound to do well and he would have to, as 
        he was an only child. If George didn’t end on an Outworld, they 
        would have to wait for grandchildren before a next chance would come along, 
        and that was too far in the future to be much consolation.</p>
      <p>Reading Day would not prove much, of course, but it would be the only 
        indication they would have before the big day itself. Every parent on 
        Earth would be listening to the quality of reading when his child came 
        home with it; listening for any particularly easy flow of words and building 
        that into certain omens of the future. There were few families that didn’t 
        have at least one hopeful who, from Reading Day on, was the great hope 
        because of the way he handled his trisyllabics.</p>
      <p>Dimly, George was aware of the cause of his parents’ tension, and 
        if there was any anxiety in his young heart that drizzly morning, it was 
        only the fear that his father’s hopeful expression might fade out 
        when he returned home with his reading.</p>
      <p>The children met in the large assembly room of the town’s Education 
        Hall. All over Earth, in millions of local halls, throughout that month, 
        similar groups of children would he meeting. George felt depressed by 
        the grayness of the room and by the other children, strained and stiff 
        in unaccustomed finery.</p>
      <p>Automatically, George did as all the rest of the children did. He found 
        the small clique that represented the children on his floor of the apartment 
        house and joined them.</p>
      <p>Trevelyan, who lived immediately next door, still wore his hair childishly 
        long and was years removed from the sideburns and thin, reddish mustache 
        that he was to grow as soon as he was physiologically capable of it.</p>
      <p>Trevelyan (to whom George was then known as Jawjee) said, “Bet 
        you’re scared.”</p>
      <p>“I am not,’ said George. Then, confidentially, “My 
        folks got a hunk of printing up on the dresser in my room, and when I 
        come home, I’m going to read it for them.” (George’s 
        main suffering at the moment lay in the fact that he didn’t quite 
        know where to put his hands. He had been warned not to scratch his head 
        or rub his ears or pick his nose or put his hands into his pockets. This 
        eliminated almost every possibility.)</p>
      <p>Trevelyan put <em>his </em>hands in his pockets and said, “My father 
        isn’t worried.”</p>
      <p>Trevelyan, Senior, had been a Metallurgist on Diporia for nearly seven 
        years, which gave him a superior social status in his neighborhood even 
        though he had retired and returned to Earth.</p>
      <p>Earth discouraged these re-immigrants because of population problems, 
        but a small trickle did return. For one thing the cost of living was lower 
        on Earth, and what was a trifling annuity on Diporia, say, was a comfortable 
        income on Earth. Besides, there were always men who found more satisfaction 
        in displaying their success before the friends and scenes of their childhood 
        than before all the rest of the Universe besides.</p>
      <p>Trevelyan, Senior further explained that if he stayed on Diporia, so 
        would his children, and Diporia was a one-spaceship world. Back on Earth, 
        his kids could end up anywhere, even Novia.</p>
      <p>Stubby Trevelyan had picked up that item early. Even before Reading Day, 
        his conversation was based on the carelessly assumed fact that his ultimate 
        home would be in Novia.</p>
      <p>George, oppressed by thoughts of the other’s future greatness and 
        his own small-time contrast, was driven to belligerent defense at once.</p>
      <p>“My father isn’t worried either. He just wants to hear me 
        read because he knows I’ll be good. I suppose your father would 
        just as soon not hear you because he knows you’ll be all wrong.”</p>
      <p>“I will not be all wrong. Reading is <em>nothing. </em>On Novia, 
        I’ll <em>hire </em>people to read to me.”</p>
      <p>“Because you won’t be able to read yourself, on account of 
        you’re <em>dumb!”</em></p>
      <p>“Then how come I’ll be on Novia?”</p>
      <p>And George, driven, made the great denial, “Who says you’ll 
        be on Novia? Bet you don’t go anywhere.”</p>
      <p>Stubby Trevelyan reddened. “I won’t be a Pipe Fitter like 
        your old man.”</p>
      <p>“Take that back, you dumbhead.”</p>
      <p>“You take <em>that</em> back.”</p>
      <p>They stood nose to nose, not wanting to fight but relieved at having 
        something familiar to do in this strange place. Furthermore, now that 
        George had curled his hands into fists and lifted them before his face, 
        the problem of what to do with his hands was, at least temporarily, solved. 
        Other children gathered round excitedly.</p>
      <p>But then it all ended when a woman’s voice sounded loudly over 
        the public address system. There was instant silence everywhere. George 
        dropped his fists and forgot Trevelyan.</p>
      <p>“Children,” said the voice, “we are going to call out 
        your names. As each child is called, he or she is to go to one of the 
        men waiting along the side walls. Do you see them? They are wearing red 
        uniforms so they will be easy to find. The girls will go to the right. 
        The boys will go to the left. Now look about and see which man in red 
        is nearest to you –”�</p>
      <p>George found his man at a glance and waited for his name to be called 
        off. He had not been introduced before this to the sophistications of 
        the alphabet and the length of time it took to reach his own name grew 
        disturbing.</p>
      <p>The crowd of children thinned; little rivulets made their way to each 
        of the red-clad guides.</p>
      <p>When the name ‘George Platen’ was finally called, his sense 
        of relief was exceeded only by the feeling of pure gladness at the fact 
        that Stubby Trevelyan still stood in his place, uncalled.</p>
      <p>George shouted back over his shoulder as he left, “Yay, Stubby, 
        maybe they don’t want you.”</p>
      <p>That moment of gaiety quickly left. He was herded into a line and directed 
        down corridors in the company of strange children. They all looked at 
        one another, large-eyed and concerned, but beyond a snuffling, “Quitcher 
        pushing” and “Hey, watch out” there was no conversation.</p>
      <p>They were handed little slips of paper which they were told must remain 
        with them. George stared at his curiously. Little black marks of different 
        shapes. He knew it to be printing but how could anyone make words out 
        of it? He couldn’t imagine.</p>
      <p>He was told to strip; he and four other boys who were all that now remained 
        together. All the new clothes came shucking off and four eight-year-olds 
        stood naked and small, shivering more out of embarrassment than cold. 
        Medical technicians came past, probing them, testing them with odd instruments, 
        pricking them for blood. Each took the little cards and made additional 
        marks on them with little black rods that produced the marks, all neatly 
        lined up, with great speed. George stared at the new marks, but they were 
        no more comprehensible than the old. The children were ordered back into 
        their clothes.</p>
      <p>They sat on separate little chairs then and waited again. Names were 
        called again and ‘George Platen’ came third.</p>
      <p>He moved into a large room, filled with frightening instruments with 
        knobs and glassy panels in front. There was a desk in the very center, 
        and behind it a man sat, his eyes on the papers piled before him.</p>
      <p>He said, “George Platen?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir,<sup>” </sup>said George, in a shaky whisper. All 
        this waiting and all this going here and there was making him nervous. 
        He wished it were over.</p>
      <p>The man behind the desk said, “I am Dr Lloyd, George. How are you?”</p>
      <p>The doctor didn’t look up as he spoke. It was as though he had 
        said those words over and over again and didn’t have to look up 
        any more.</p>
      <p>“I’m all right.”</p>
      <p>“Are you afraid, George?”</p>
      <p>“N – no, sir,” said George, sounding afraid even in 
        his own ears.</p>
      <p>“That’s good,” said the doctor, “because there’s 
        nothing to be afraid of you know. Let’s see, George. It says here 
        on your card that your father is named Peter and that he’s a Registered 
        Pipe Fitter and your mother is named Amy and is a Registered Home Technician. 
        Is that right?”</p>
      <p>“Y – yes, sir.”</p>
      <p>“And your birthday is 13 February,and you had an ear infection 
        about a year ago. Right?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Do you know how I know all these things?”</p>
      <p>“It’s on the card, I think, sir.”</p>
      <p>“That’s right.” The doctor looked up at George for 
        the first time and smiled. He showed even teeth and looked much younger 
        than George’s father. Some of George’s nervousness vanished.</p>
      <p>The doctor passed the card to George. “Do you know what all those 
        things there mean, George?”</p>
      <p>Although George knew he did not he was startled by the sudden request 
        into looking at the card as though he might understand now through some 
        sudden stroke of fate. But they were just marks as before and he passed 
        the card back. “No, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Why not?”</p>
      <p>George felt a sudden pang of suspicion concerning the sanity of this 
        doctor. Didn’t he know why not?</p>
      <p>George said, “I can’t read, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Would you like to read?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Why, George?”</p>
      <p>George stared, appalled. No one had ever asked him that. He had no answer. 
        He said falteringly, “I don’t know, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Printed information will direct you all through your life. There 
        is so much you’ll have to know even after Education Day. Cards like 
        this one will tell you. Books will tell you. Television screens will tell 
        you. Printing will tell you such useful things and such interesting things 
        that not being able to read would be as bad as not being able to see. 
        Do you understand?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Are you afraid, George?”</p>
      <p>“No, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Good. Now I’ll tell you exactly what we’ll do first. 
        I’m going to put these wires on your forehead just over the corners 
        of your eyes. They’ll stick there but they won’t hurt at all. 
        Then, I’ll turn on something that will make a buzz. It will sound 
        funny and it may tickle you, but it won’t hurt. Now if it does hurt, 
        you tell me, and I’ll turn it off right away, but it won’t 
        hurt. All right?”</p>
      <p>George nodded and swallowed.</p>
      <p>“Are you ready?”</p>
      <p>George nodded. He closed his eyes while the doctor busied himself. His 
        parents had explained this to him. They, too, had said it wouldn’t 
        hurt, but then there were always the older children. There were the ten- 
        and twelve-year-olds who howled after the eight-year-olds waiting for 
        Reading Day, “Watch out for the needle.” There were the others 
        who took you off in confidence and said, “They got to cut your head 
        open. They use a sharp knife that big with a hook on it,” and so 
        on into horrifying details.</p>
      <p>George had never believed them but he had had nightmares, and now he 
        closed his eyes and felt pure terror.</p>
      <p>He didn’t feel the wires at his temple. The buzz was a distant 
        thing, and there was the sound of his own blood in his ears, ringing hollowly 
        as though it and he were in a large cave. Slowly he chanced opening his 
        eyes.</p>
      <p>The doctor had his back to him. From one of the instruments a strip of 
        paper unwound and was covered with a thin, wavy purple line. The doctor 
        tore off pieces and put them into a slot in another machine. He did it 
        over and over again. Each time a little piece of film came out which the 
        doctor looked at. Finally, he turned toward George with a queer frown 
        between his eyes.</p>
      <p>The buzzing stopped.</p>
      <p>George said breathlessly, “Is it over?”</p>
      <p>The doctor said, “Yes,” but he was still frowning.</p>
      <p>“Can I read now?’ asked George. He felt no different.</p>
      <p>The doctor said, “What?” then smiled very suddenly and briefly. 
        He said, “It works fine, George. You’ll be reading in fifteen 
        minutes. Now we’re going to use another machine this time and it 
        will take longer. I’m going to cover your whole head, and when I 
        turn it on you won’t be able to see or hear anything for a while, 
        but it won’t hurt. Just to make sure I’m going to give you 
        a little switch to hold in your hand. If anything hurts, you press the 
        little button and everything shuts off. All right?”</p>
      <p>In later years, George was told that the little switch was strictly a 
        dummy; that it was introduced solely for confidence. He never did know 
        for sure, however, since he never pushed the button.</p>
      <p>A large smoothly curved helmet with a rubbery inner lining was placed 
        over his head and left there. Three or four little knobs seemed to grab 
        at him and bite into his skull, but there was only a little pressure that 
        faded. No pain.</p>
      <p>The doctor’s voice sounded dimly. “Everything all right, 
        George?”</p>
      <p>And then, with no real warning, a layer of thick felt closed down all 
        about him. He was disembodied, there was no sensation, no universe, only 
        himself and a distant murmur at the very ends of nothingness telling him 
        something – telling him – telling him –</p>
      <p>He strained to hear and understand but there was all that thick felt 
        between.</p>
      <p>Then the helmet was taken off his head, and the light was so bright that 
        it hurt his eyes while the doctor’s voice drummed at his ears.</p>
      <p>The doctor said, “Here’s your card, George. What does it 
        say?”</p>
      <p>George looked at his card again and gave out a strangled shout. The marks 
        weren’t just marks at all. They made up words. They were words just 
        as clearly as though something were whispering them in his ears. He could 
        hear them being whispered as he looked at them.</p>
      <p>“What does it say, George?”</p>
      <p>“It says – it says – ‘Platen, George. Born 13 
        February 6492 of Peter and Amy Platen in...’”� He broke off.</p>
      <p>“You can read, George,” said the doctor. “It’s 
        all over.”</p>
      <p>“For good? I won’t forget how?”</p>
      <p>“Of course not” The doctor leaned over to shake hands gravely. 
        “You will be taken home now.”</p>
      <p>It was days before George got over this new and great talent of his. 
        He read for his father with such facility that Platen, Senior, wept and 
        called relatives to tell the good news.</p>
      <p>George walked about town, reading every scrap of printing he could find 
        and wondering how it was that none of it had ever made sense to him before.</p>
      <p>He tried to remember how it was not to be able to read and 
        he couldn’t. As far as his feeling about it was concerned, he had 
        always been able to read. Always.</p></td>

Grayskull is a RISC-V alternative&nbsp;to GPUs that is designed to be easier to program and scale, and reportedly excels at handling run-time sparsity and conditional computation.</p><p>Off the back of this, Tenstorrent has also unveiled its Grayskull-powered DevKits - the standard Grayskull e75 and the more powerful Grayskull e150. Both are inference-only hardware designed for AI development, and come with TT-Buda and TT-Metalium software. The former is for running models right away, while the latter is for users who want to customize their models or write new ones.</p><p>The Santa Clara-based tech firm's milestone launch comes hot on the heels of a partnership with Japan's Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC). Tenstorrent's RISC-V and Chiplet IP will be used to build a state-of-the-art 2nm AI Accelerator, with the ultimate goal of revolutionizing AI performance in Japan.</p><h2 id="by-the-power-of-grayskull-3">By the power of Grayskull!</h2><p>The Grayskull e75 model is a low-profile, half-length PCIe Gen 4 board with a single Grayskull processor, operating at 75W. The more advanced e150 model is a standard height, 3/4 length PCIe Gen 4 board containing one Grayskull processor operating at up to 200W, and balancing power and throughput.</p><p>Tenstorrent processors comprise a grid of cores known as Tensix Cores and come with network communication hardware so they can talk with one another directly over networks, instead of through DRAM.</p><p>The Grayskull DevKits support a wide range of models, including BERT for natural language processing tasks, ResNet for image recognition, Whisper for speech recognition and translation, YOLOv5 for real-time object detection, and U-Net for image segmentation.</p><p>The Grayskull e75 and e150 DevKits are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tenstorrent.com/cards/" target="_blank" data-url="https://tenstorrent.com/cards/">available for purchase</a> now at $599 and $799, respectively.</p><h3 id="section-more-from-techradar-pro"><span>More from TechRadar Pro</span></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/virtually-unhackable-chip-could-make-gpu-more-power-efficient-and-much-faster-at-ai-by-combining-light-and-silicon-for-a-fundamental-mathematical-operation" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/virtually-unhackable-chip-could-make-gpu-more-power-efficient-and-much-faster-at-ai-by-combining-light-and-silicon-for-a-fundamental-mathematical-operation">Virtually unhackable' chip could make GPU power efficient and faster at AI</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/exclusive-nvidias-fastest-ai-chip-ever-is-finally-available-for-preorder-and-you-can-get-the-gh200-for-as-little-as-dollar499-per-hour" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/exclusive-nvidias-fastest-ai-chip-ever-is-finally-available-for-preorder-and-you-can-get-the-gh200-for-as-little-as-dollar499-per-hour">Nvidia's fastest AI chip ever is finally available for preorder</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/will-arm-start-to-build-its-own-chips-soon-strategic-cortex-x-collaboration-with-samsung-may-well-be-first-step-in-that-direction" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/will-arm-start-to-build-its-own-chips-soon-strategic-cortex-x-collaboration-with-samsung-may-well-be-first-step-in-that-direction">Will Arm start to build its own chips soon?</a></li></ul>

<p dir="auto">"Agents" originated in reinforcement learning, where they learn by interacting with an environment and receiving a reward signal. However, LLM-based agents today do not learn online (i.e. continuously in real time) via reinforcement.</p>
<p dir="auto">OpenAI created <a href="https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium">Gym</a> to standardize and simplify RL environments, but if you try dropping an LLM-based agent into a Gym environment for training, you'd find it's still quite a bit of code to handle LLM conversation context, episode batches, reward assignment, PPO setup, and more.</p>
<p dir="auto">LlamaGym seeks to simplify fine-tuning LLM agents with RL. Right now, it's a single <code>Agent</code> abstract class that handles all the issues mentioned above, letting you quickly iterate and experiment with agent prompting &amp; hyperparameters across any Gym environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Fine-tuning an LLM-based agent to play in a Gym-style environment with RL has never been easier! Once you install LlamaGym...</p>

<p dir="auto">First, implement 3 abstract methods on the Agent class:</p>

<p dir="auto">Some reminders:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>above code snippets are mildly simplified above but a fully working example is available in <a href="https://github.com/KhoomeiK/LlamaGym/blob/main/examples/blackjack.py"><code>examples/blackjack.py</code></a></li>
<li>getting online RL to converge is notoriously difficult so you'll have to mess with hyperparameters to see improvement
<ul dir="auto">
<li>your model may also benefit from a supervised fine-tuning stage on sampled trajectories before running RL (we may add this feature in the future)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>our implementation values simplicity so is not as compute efficient as e.g. <a href="https://github.com/flowersteam/lamorel">Lamorel</a>, but easier to start playing around with</li>
<li>LlamaGym is a weekend project and still a WIP, but we love contributions!</li>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This week I finished the most recent book in <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/categories/books/">my self-guided study of 20th century technology</a>, namely <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442262743&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ideas+factory"><em>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</em></a>, by Jon Gertner. As the title implies, it’s a chronicle of research and development wing of AT&amp;T, a history that lasts roughly from the 1920s to its demise in the 1980s.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First of all, the sheer list of things that were invented or discovered in these Labs is just insane by any measure. Physical things like the transistor,transistor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Echo">the first satellites</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mobile_phones#Cellular_concepts">cellular technology</a>, as well as less tangible inventions and ideas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>, advances in quality control, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">the Unix operating system</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language/)">the C programming language</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg" alt="A replica of a transistor"></p>

<p>In all eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs#Discoveries_and_developments">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="wicked-problems">Wicked Problems</h2>

<p>Gertner introduces his book by attempting to establish its value. First point: we have big problems today: “information overloads, infectious disease, and climate change, among others,” problems that some call “wicked problems.” Gertner is offering a history of how one very successful institution solved a serious of large-scale technical problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While our engineering prowess has advanced a great deal over the past sixty years, the principles of innovation largely have not. Indeed, the techniques forged at Bell Labs– that knack for apprehending a vexing problem, gathering ideas that might lead to a solution, and the pushing toward the development of a product that could be deployed on a massive scale– are still worth considering today…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>So what were these techniques, what was the process? For Mervin Kelly, a long-time and influential director of the Labs, “inventing the future wasn’t just a matter of inventing things for the future; it also entailed inventing ways to invent those things.”</p>

<p>The process was important at the Labs, especially to directors and upper-management. For <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/04/where-wizards-stay-up-late/">Kelly</a> in particular his field of expertise became the management of these sometimes-quirky scientists. He designed the Labs to literally require researchers in one field to walk past the offices of researchers in totally different fields, thus almost guaranteeing a sort-of cross pollination of ideas.</p>

<p>There was also a sort of egalitarian open-door office policy described by Gertner: “Some young employees would quake when they were told to go ask Shannon or Shockley a question. Still, Labs policy stated that they could not be turned away.”</p>

<p>But if forced to list out some principles, we can refer to a list that one of the important researchers at the Labs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Pierce">John Pierce</a>, wrote out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A technically competent management all the way to the top</li>
  <li>Researchers didn’t have to raise funds</li>
  <li>Research of a topic or system could be and was supported for years</li>
  <li>Research could be terminated without damning the researcher</li>
</ol>

<p>We could expand on #2 and especially on #3 and say that, thanks to its government-sanctioned monopoly and ties with the U.S. war efforts and national security apparatus, AT&amp;T could afford to run a well-funded research and development department with few enough strings to enable at least some of the scientists there to carry out what the Labs and director Kelly called “basic research,” “that is, research that generally had no immediate application to a product or company effort but… sought fundamental knowledge regarding the deeper nature of things, such as the behavior of electrons.” (Which reminded me of what Steven called “blue sky” research in <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/02/the-hacker-ethic/"><em>Hackers</em></a>.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Organization_Man"><em>The Organizational Man</em></a>, a supposedly-influential book on the topic that came out in 1956, praises Bell Labs for its belief in “idle curiosity.”</p>

<p>But there were of course numerous other things that made the Labs what it was, Gertner argues, like the culture of working with open doors, recording everything in formal notebooks, right down to the layout of the New Jersey offices.</p>

<p>All that said, Gertner’s emphasis on the importance of leadership in these creative settings definitely reminded me of the similar emphasis in <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/04/where-wizards-stay-up-late/"><em>Where Wizards Stay Up Late</em></a>, a history of ARPANET.</p>

<h2 id="the-people">The People</h2>

<p>Also similar to <em>Wizards</em> was Gertner’s inclusion of details about the influential individuals in the history of the Labs.</p>

<p>Early on in both the book and the organization’s story, Gertner describes the young recruits, mostly from small towns in the midwest, as having “a certain fearlessness about life,” which he illustrates with a story about what one young man who would go on to win a Nobel Prize in physics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Townes">Charles Townes</a>, did with the $100 that the Labs gave him to get from California to Manhattan by rail, which involves riding 3rd-class on trains through Mexico next to a man playing a Nazi accordion and renting a hut on the beach in a yet-to-be-discovered Acapulco for fifty cents a night.</p>

<p>There are not many other stories of this fearlessness, but given the scale and apparent impossibilities of these “wicked problems” we have to believe that these men (and yes, all the scientists and researchers in the book are men) had both a certain fearlessness and a zest for life. At one point Gertner writes that two upper managers literally ran up and down staircases. They “needed to get where [they] were going as fast as possible.”</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2YZnTL596Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>However there are also a good share of quirky researchers with seemingly no interest in leadership or power over others, who were often characterized by their ever-changing interests. Consider this story about John Pierce that makes me laugh every time I read it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was quite common for Pierce to suddenly enter or leave a conversation or a meal halfway through. Sometimes it was involuntarily– something in his makeup, “in the way his mind would click on and off,” as his colleague Bob Lucky… describes it. Other times it was by design. Lucky recalls that during a phone call Pierce might suddenly hang up in the middle of his own sentence, leaving the person on the other end with the impression that a technical glitch had ended the call. No one could imagine that he would hang up on himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gertner describes Pierce as an “instigator”– someone who poses questions or does other things that get others to investigate interesting problems from a new or helpful perspective. Another such researcher was Harry Nyquist, whose story I like too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…some lawyers in the patent department at Bell Labs decided to study whether there was an organizing principle that could explain why certain individuals at the Labs were more productive than others. They discerned only one common thread: Workers with the most patents often shared lunch or breakfast with a Bell Labs electrical engineer named Harry Nyquist. It wasn’t the case that Nyquist gave them specific ideas. Rather, as one scientist recalled, “he drew people out, got them thinking.” More than anything, Nyquist asked good questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But arguably the hero of the book, or at least the hero of these quirky researchers, is a man named Claude Shannon. Shannon’s adviser at MIT, a dean named Vannevar Bush, describes him: “He is shy, personally likable, and a man who should be handled with great care.” Gertner concludes: “There was, in other words, a quiet accord among the professors at MIT: People like Shannon come along so rarely that they must be protected.”</p>

<p>And boy did Shannon prove himself worthy of such attention. In 1948 Shannon published a paper called “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” in the Bell System Technical Journal, which basically invented and proved a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not really in a position to summarize information at this point, but as Wikipedia says, it seems to be a science of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory#Quantities_of_information">quantifying information</a> by calculating the information’s entropy.</p>

<p>I was fascinated enough by it to dive into another book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Theory-Introduction-James-Stone/dp/0956372856/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442269512&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=information+theory+james+stones"><em>Information Theory: A Tutorial Introduction</em></a>, which is dense and mathematical, but I’m liking it a lot. Maybe worthy of a subsequent blog post when I finish it.</p>

<h2 id="look-for-good-problems-not-good-ideas">Look for Good Problems, Not Good Ideas</h2>

<p>OK, so what’s at least one lesson we can take from the history of Bell Labs on an <em>individual level</em>? If I had to pick one it’d be to focus on problems and unknowns rather than ideas, solutions, or knowns.</p>

<p>Gertner writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he industrial lab was a challenge to the common assumption that its scientists were being paid to look high and low for good ideas. Men like Kelly and Davisson would soon repeat the notion that there were plenty of good ideas out there, almost two many. Mainly, they were looking for good problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later, about Kelly’s approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it was a radar technology for the military or solid-state research for the phone company, Kelly did not want to begin a project by focusing on what was known. He would want to begin by focusing on what was not known.</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In some Amish communities these days, e-bikes are beginning to outnumber buggies on the roads. Horse-drawn buggies, long a symbol of the Amish lifestyle, are finding less use as more people in Amish communities adopt electric-powered bicycles.</p>
<p>In small Amish towns across America such as Sugarcreek, Ohio, Napponee, Indiana, and Kalona, Iowa, e-bikes are gaining in popularity as a practical means of everyday transportation. In the Amish faith, members do not drive cars and trucks, so they have traditionally relied on horse-drawn buggies for commuting to work, shopping, and other local errands.</p>
<p>E-bikes are changing this tradition.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot quicker to jump on your bike and go into town than it is to bring your horse into the barn, harness it to the buggy, and go,” said David Mullett, owner of <a href="https://ebikesofholmescounty.com/">E-Bikes of Holmes County</a>, a popular bike shop in Holmes County, Ohio. “It’s a lot quicker and you travel faster too.”</p>
<p>A member of the Old Order Amish Church, Mullett has seen phenomenal growth in the popularity of e-bikes among the Amish in Holmes County, Ohio, which rivals Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, as one of the largest Amish settlements in the world.</p>
<p>“Back when I started the company (in 2016) only a small percentage of the Amish community were riding bikes in this area,” Mullett said. “Since 2017 to 2018, it really grew in our community.”</p>
<h4><span>From Push Scooters to E-Bikes</span></h4>

Source: amishamerica.com</p></div>
<p>Not all Amish ride bicycles of any type, let alone electric-powered ones. It depends on local church teachings. In Lancaster County, for instance, bike usage is confined largely to push scooters, a bike design unique to the Amish that resembles a full-size bicycle but without pedals or gears. Most local transportation there is still by horse-drawn buggies.</p>
<p>“Some (Amish) are starting to use e-bikes here,” said Randy Martin, owner of <a href="https://www.lancasterbicycleshop.com/">Lancaster Bicycle Shop</a>. “It varies quiete a bit from one district (of the church) to the other.” He confirmed, however, that most Amish there still use push scooters, if they ride at all.</p>
<p>Mullett explained why some Amish are using e-bikes while others are not.</p>
<p>“There are different denominations of Amish. Some don’t have any sort of bicycles. Each church can make their own set of guidelines. Just because one church has it doesn’t mean the neighboring church has allowed it. That’s not just for e-bikes but for anything.”</p>
<h4><span>Commuting to Work</span></h4>

<p>While many cyclists enjoy their bikes for recreation and fitness, for the Amish the e-bike is a practical choice for daily transportation.</p>
<p>“Commuting to work is probably the No. 1 way that electric bikes are being used,” Mullett said, nothing that he commutes by bike to the bike shop. “Some people are commuting eight to 10 miles, some only one or two miles, but they jump on their bike and go. With a traditional bike, that would never have been considered.”</p>
<p>An e-bike is faster than the traditional buggie and cheaper than hiring a non-Amish motorist to drive them to work, a common practice in Amish communities.&nbsp; They are allowed to ride in cars that they neither own nor drive.</p>
<p>“They would have had to hire a driver or the place of work would have had to hire a driver to bring in their employees,” Mullett said.&nbsp; “That still happens, but there are more people who commute to work every day on e-bikes.”</p>
<h4><span>Riding to Walmart</span></h4>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-0004.jpg?resize=740%2C555&amp;ssl=1" width="740" height="555" alt="Amish e-bikes at Walmart in Ohio" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Another common use for electric bikes is for shopping. The local Walmart store in Millersburg, Ohio, has covered parking for e-bikes and buggies that includes charging stations for bikes. Many Amish cyclists use trailers to carry groceries or use specially made storage bags like these <a href="https://ebikesofholmescounty.com/product/carry-all-bag/">Carry-All Pannier Bags</a> made locally and sold in Mullet’s shop.</p>
<p>“We sell a lot of trailers for kids, child carriers,” Mullett said. “Women can go shopping and take their kids along and put the groceries in the trailer as well for the commute home.”</p>
<p>Three-wheel versions of electric bikes, often called e-trikes, are another popular option. They are ideal for carrying cargo or for riders who aren’t as confident about balancing a bike.</p>

<h4><span>How the Amish Charge Their E-bike Batteries</span></h4>
<p>Traditionally, Amish homes and businesses did not have electricity. This raises the question of how do the Amish keep their e-bike batteries charged? The answer is that many homes and businesses in the same Amish communities that approve of e-bike use also have adopted solar power and natural-gas generators. Mullett’s bike shop, for instance, has all the modern trappings that use electricity including computers, printers, lights, and power tools. The store is totally off the grid, something that is important to Amish families, but it is not lacking in electric power. It has 24 solar panels on the roof, a natural-gas backup generator, powerful lithium batteries, and twin 5,500-watt inverters.</p>

<p>Many homes, shops, barns, and offices in Ohio’s picturesque Amish Country have similar electric systems, which has helped transform Amish life in recent years. Not only are most of his customers able to charge their e-bikes at home, but Mullett said many employers and other locations in the community provide charging stations.</p>
<p>“A lot of businesses are doing this (charging stations) as a favor for their customers,” Mullett said.</p>
<p>As an aside, Mullet noted that Amish communities are probably the “greenest” communities in America with their absence of gas-guzzling autosmobiles and widespread use of solar power, bicycles, and buggies.</p>
<h4><span>Safety Issues</span></h4>
<p>As with buggies, safety issues are a paramount concern to the Amish who ride e-bikes on roads shared with cars and trucks. Most roads in Ohio’s Amish Country are two-lane rural roads and do not have wide shoulders. Due to the hilly terrain, many of the roads are twisty and do not provide good visibility when motorists come over crests.</p>
<p>Adding to the problem is that when e-bikes first became popular many Amish did not have experience riding bicycles, so safe riding techniques had to be learned.&nbsp; Mullett said Amish community leaders and county government officials have cooperated to teach safe-riding habits and to make the roads safer. Wide shoulders suitable for buggies and bikes are being added to many roads.</p>
<p>“Safety vests and helmets are both gaining in popularity,” Mullett said.</p>
<p>At the same time, helmets pose special problems for Amish women. They grow their hair long and keep it wrapped in a bun covered with a cap. For this reason, most bike helmets do not fit Amish women. Mullett said he has talked with some helmet manufacturers and encouraged them to build helmets suitable for Amish women, so far without success. For now, far more men wear helmets than women.</p>
<h4><span>The Future of Amish Buggies</span></h4>
<p>Now that e-bikes have arrived in many Amish communities, what will happen to the traditional horse-drawn buggies? Mullet said he doesn’t foresee the end of buggies but thinks the popularity of e-bikes will continue to grow.</p>
<p>“Horse and buggies will probably always be a part of the Amish community, but bike transportation is becoming more popular than the horse and buggy in the denominations that have allowed it,” Mullett said.</p>
<p>Even with families who ride e-bikes during the week to work and shop, Mullett said they typically still take the buggy to church services on Sundays. Buggies are also better for longer commutes and for those people who, for various reasons, do not enjoy riding a bike.</p>
<h4><span>E-Bikes Are Part of a Changing Lifestyle for the Amish</span></h4>
<p>E-bikes may be the most visible change, but they are just one indication of a significant transformation in the everyday life of Amish people. Coupled with the use of power tools in their shops, solar power in their homes, and other modern innovations, daily life for the Amish people is changing perhaps more now than it has at any time in the past century or more. It’s still a very distinctive, faith-based culture that rejects much of the materialism and secularism of the broader Western culture, but change is still occurring.</p>
<p>Just as horse-and-buggies symbolized Amish life in the past, the e-bike is the symbol of changing times in many Amish communities today.</p>
<h4><span><strong>Lessons for the Rest of Us</strong></span></h4>
<p>Ironically, the Amish may now be ahead of most of the rest of American society when it comes to their embrace of e-bikes for routine, daily transportation. This is the way of e-bikes are increasingly being used in Europe and in parts of Asia. Not just for fun and recreation, but as a practical, serious means of transportation for short, everyday errands. Think about the benefits to public health if more people followed the Amish example and hopped on an e-bike for quick errands to the drug or grocery store. Imagine how much we could improve the environment if more of us rode e-bikes for short trips versus cranking up a gas-guzzling SUV or pickup truck?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s much we can learn from the Amish lifestyle, and that definitely includes their integration of e-bikes into their everyday lives.&nbsp;</p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Amazon S3 is the original cloud technology: it came out in 2006.
            "Objects" were popular at the time and S3 was labelled an "object store",
            but everyone really knows that S3 is for files. S3 is a cloud filesystem,
            not an object-whatever.</p>
            <p>I think idea that S3 is <em>really</em> "Amazon Cloud Filesystem" is a
            bit of a load bearing fiction. It's sort of true: S3 can store files. It's
            also a very useful belief in getting people to adopt S3, a fundamentally
            good technology, which otherwise they might not. But it's false: S3 is not
            a filesystem and can't stand in for one.</p>
            <h2>What filesystems are about, and module "depth"</h2>
            <p>The unix file API is pretty straightforward. There are just five basic
            functions. They don't take many arguments.</p>
            <p>Here are (the Python versions of) these five basic functions:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><span></span><span># open a file</span>
<span>open</span><span>(</span><span>filepath</span><span>)</span> <span># returns a `file`</span>

<span># read from that file (moving the position forward)</span>
<span>file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>=</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span># returns 100 bytes</span>

<span># write to that file (moving the position forward)</span>
<span>file</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"hello, world"</span><span>)</span>

<span># move the position to byte 94</span>
<span>file</span><span>.</span><span>seek</span><span>(</span><span>94</span><span>)</span>

<span># close the file</span>
<span>file</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Well, perhaps I should add an asterisk: I am simplifying a bit. There
            are loads more calls than that. But still, those five calls are the
            irreducible nub of the file API. They're all you need to read and write
            files.</p>
            <p>Those five functions handle a lot of concerns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>buffering</li>
                <li>the page cache</li>
                <li>fragmentation</li>
                <li>permissions</li>
                <li>IO scheduling</li>
                <li>and whatever else</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even though the file API <em>handles</em> all those concerns, but it
            doesn't <em>expose</em> them to you. A narrow interface handling a large
            number of concerns - that makes the unix file API a "deep" module.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://calpaterson.com/assets/wide-vs-narrow.svg" alt="diagram of a deep vs a shallow diagram">
            </figure>
            <p>Deep modules are great because you can benefit from their features -
            like wear-levelling on SD cards - but without bearing the psychic toll of
            thinking about any of it as you save a jpeg to your phone. Happy days.</p>
            <p>But if the file API is "deep", what sorts of things are "shallow"?</p>
            <p>A shallow module would have a relatively large API surface in proportion
            to what it's handling for you. One hint these days that a module is shallow
            is that the interface to it is YAML. YAML <em>appears</em> to be a mere
            markup language but in practice is a reuseable syntax onto which almost any
            semantics can be plonked.</p>
            <p>Often YAML works as the "Programming language of DevOps" and programming
            languages provide about the widest interface possible. Examine your YAML
            micro-language closely. Does it offer a looping construct? If so, it's
            likely Turing complete.</p>
            <p>But sometimes it is hard to package something up nicely with a bow on
            top. SQL ORMs are inherently a leaky abstraction. You can't use them
            without some understanding of SQL. So being shallow isn't inherently a
            criticism. Sometimes a shallow module is the best that can be done. But all
            else equal, deeper is better.</p>
            <h2>What S3 is about (it is deep too)</h2>
            <p>The unix file API was in place by the early 1970s. The interface has
            been retained and the guts have been re-implemented many times for
            compatibility reasons.</p>
            <p>But Amazon S3 <em>does not</em> reimplement the unix filesystem API.</p>
            <p>It has a wholly different arrangement and the primitives are only partly
            compatible. Here's a brief description of the calls that are analogous to
            the above five basic unix calls:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><span></span><span># Read (part) of an object</span>
<span>GetObject</span><span>(</span><span>Bucket</span><span>,</span> <span>Key</span><span>,</span> <span>Range</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>)</span> <span># contents is the HTTP body</span>

<span># Write an (entire) object</span>
<span>PutObject</span><span>(</span><span>Bucket</span><span>,</span> <span>Key</span><span>)</span> <span># send contents as HTTP body</span>

<span># er, that's it!</span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Two functions versus five. That's right, the S3 API is simpler than the
            unix file API. There is one additional concept ("buckets") but I think when
            you net it out, S3's interface-to-functionality ratio is even better than
            the unix file API.</p>
            <p>But something is missing. While you can partially read an object using
            the <code>Range</code> argument to <code>GetObject</code>, <strong>you
            can't overwrite partially</strong>. Overwrites have to be the whole
            file.</p>
            <p>That sounds minor but actually scopes S3 to a subset of the old usecases
            for files.</p>
            <h2>Filesystem software, especially databases, can't be ported to Amazon
            S3</h2>
            <p>Databases of all kinds need a place to put their data. Generally, that
            place has ended up being various files on the filesystem. Postgres
            maintains two or three files per table, plus loads of others for
            bookkeeping. SQLite famously stores everything in a single file. MySQL,
            MongoDB, Elasticsearch - whatever - they all store data in files.</p>
            <p>Crucially, these databases overwhelmingly <em>rely</em> on the ability
            to do partial overwrites. They store data in <a href="https://calpaterson.com/how-a-sql-database-works.html">"pages"</a> (eg 4 or 8 kilobytes long) in
            "heap" files where writes are done page by page. There might be thousands
            of pages in a single file. Pages are overwritten as necessary to store
            whatever data is required. That means partial overwrites are absolutely
            essential.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://calpaterson.com/assets/heap.svg" alt="diagram of a database heap file">
                <figcaption>
                    A heap file is full of pages (and empty slots). Pages are
                    overwritten individually as necessary.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Some software projects start with a dream of storing their data in a
            'simple' way by combining two well tested technologies: Amazon S3 and
            SQLite (or DuckDB). Afterall, what could be simpler and more
            straightforward? Sadly, they go together like oil and water.</p>
            <p>When your SQLite database is kept in S3, each write suddenly becomes a
            total overwrite of the entire database. While S3 can do big writes fast,
            even it isn't fast enough to make that strategy work for any but the
            smallest datasets. And you're jettisoning all the transactional integrity
            that the database authors have painstakingly implemented: rewriting the
            database file each time throws out all that stuff. On S3, the last write
            wins.</p>
            <h2>What S3 is good at and what it is bad at</h2>
            <p>The joy of S3 is that bandwidth ("speed") for reads and writes is
            extremely, extremely high. It's not hard to find examples online of people
            who have written to or read from S3 at over 10 gigabytes per second. In
            fact I once saturated a financial client's office network with a set of S3
            writes.</p>
            <p>But the lack of partial overwrites isn't the only problem. There are a
            few more.</p>
            <p>S3 has no rename or move operation. Renaming is <code>CopyObject</code>
            and then <code>DeleteObject</code>. <code>CopyObject</code> takes linear
            time to the size of the file(s). This comes up fairly often when someone
            has written a lot of files to the wrong place - moving the files back is
            very slow.</p>
            <p>And listing files is slow. While the joy of Amazon S3 is that you can
            read and write at extremely, extremely, high bandwidths, listing out what
            is there is much much slower. Slower than a slow local filesystem.</p>
            <p>But S3 is much lower maintenance than a filesystem. You just name the
            bucket, name the key and the cloud elves will sort out everything else.
            This is worth a lot as setting backups, replicating offsite, provisioning
            (which, remember is for IO ops as well as capacity) is pure drudgework.</p>
            <h2>Module depth is even more important across organisations</h2>
            <p>In retrospect it is not a surprise the S3 was the first popular cloud
            API. If deep APIs are helpful in containing the complexity between
            different modules with a single system (like your computer) they are even
            more helpful in containing the complexity of an interaction between two
            different businesses, where the costs of interacting are so much
            higher.</p>
            <p>Consider a converse example. Traditionally when one business wants to
            get it's computers working with those of another they call it
            "integration". It is a byword for suffering. Imagine you are tasked with
            integrating some Big Entreprise software horror into your organisation.
            Something like SAP. Is SAP a deep module? No. The tragedy of SAP is that
            almost your entire organisation has to understand it. Then you have to
            reconcile it with everything you're doing. At all times. SAP integration
            projects are consequently expensive, massive <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/millercoors-sues-hcl-tech-for-100-million-over-failure-to-implement-erp-project/">
            and</a> <a href="https://www.henricodolfing.com/2020/01/project-failure-case-study-leaseplan-sap.html">
            regularly</a> <a href="https://www.henricodolfing.com/2020/05/case-study-lidl-sap-debacle.html">fail</a>.</p>
            <p>There isn't much less complexity in S3 than there is in a SAP
            installation. Amazon named it the "Simple Storage Service" but the amount
            of complexity in S3 is <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/03/23/economics.html">pretty
            frightening</a>. Queueing theory, IO contention, sharding, the list of
            problems just goes on and on - in addition too all the stuff I listed above
            that filesystems deal with. (And can you believe they do it all
            on-prem?)</p>
            <p>The "simple" in S3 is a misnomer. S3 is not actually simple. It's
            deep.</p>

            <h2>Contact/etc</h2>
            
            <hr>
            <h2>Other notes</h2>
            <p>I don't mean to suggest in any way via this article that S3 is not
            <a href="https://calpaterson.com/amazon-premium.html">overpriced for what it is</a>. To rephrase a
            famous joke about hedge funds, it often seems like The Cloud is a revenue
            model masquerading as a service model.</p>
            <p>The concept of deep vs shallow modules comes from John Ousterhout's
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophy-Software-Design-2nd/dp/173210221X">excellent
            book</a>. The book is effectly a list of ideas on software design. Some are
            real hits with me, others not, but well worth reading overall. Praise for
            making it succinct.</p>
            <p>A few databases are explicitly designed from the start to us the S3 API
            for storage. <a href="https://event.cwi.nl/lsde/papers/p215-dageville-snowflake.pdf">Snowflake
            was.</a> So it's possible - but not transparently. But snowflake is one of
            the few I'm aware of (and they made this decision very early, at least by
            2016). If you know of others - let me know by email.</p>
            <p>It isn't just databases that struggle on S3. Many file formats assume
            that you'll be able to seek around cheaply and are less performant on S3
            than on disk. Zipfiles are a key example.</p>
            <h3>Other stuff about S3 that is a matter for regret</h3>
            <p>I genuinely like S3 so did not want to create the wrong impression by
            including a laundry list of complaints in the middle of the post but anyway
            here are the other major problems I didn't mention above:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The S3 API is <em>only</em> available as XML. JSON was around in
                    2006 but XML was still dominant and so it's probably not a surprise
                    that Amazon picked XML originally. It is a surprise that Amazon
                    never released a JSON version though - particularly when they made
                    the switch from SOAP to REST, which would have been a good
                    time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It's also a matter for regret that Amazon <a href="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.xsd">gave up</a>
                    on maintaining the XSD schema as this is one of the key benefits of
                    XML for APIs. The canonical documentation is just a website
                    now.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Criminally, Amazon - like many cloud service providers - have
                    never produced any kind of local test environment. In Python, the
                    more diligent test with the <a href="https://github.com/getmoto/moto">moto</a> library. moto is
                    maintained by volunteers which is weird given that it's a testing
                    tool for a commercial offering.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Amazon S3 <em>does</em> support checksums. For whatever reason
                    they are not turned on by default. Amazon makes many claims about
                    durability. I haven't heard of people having problems but equally:
                    I've never seen these claims tested. I am at least a bit curious
                    about these claims.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For years Amazon S3 held one other trap for the unwary: eventual
                    consistency. If you read a file, then overwrote it, you might read
                    it back and find it hadn't changed yet. Particularly because it
                    only happened sometimes, for short periods of time, this caused all
                    manner of chaos. Other implementors of S3 didn't copy this property
                    and a few years ago <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/">
                    Amazon fixed it in their implementation</a>.</p>
