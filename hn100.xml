<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span>Cornell Tech has announced a total of more than $10 million in gifts and grants from the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation, respectively, to support </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/"><span>arXiv</span></a><span>, a free distribution service and open-access archive for scholarly articles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The funding will allow the growing repository with more than 2 million articles to migrate to the cloud and modernize its code to ensure reliability, fault tolerance and accessibility for researchers.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“I am deeply grateful for this tremendous support from both the Simons Foundation and the NSF,” said </span><a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/people/greg-morrisett/"><span>Greg Morrisett</span></a><span>, the Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of Cornell Tech. “This investment ensures that the arXiv service will continue to scale, to serve an even broader constituency, and better serve the arXiv scientific community.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“This generous funding from the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation will allow arXiv to expand its critical growth in the scientific community, where it allows thousands of researchers to freely disseminate, exchange and explore their findings,” said </span><a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/people/ramin-zabih/"><span>Ramin Zabih</span></a><span>, arXiv faculty director and professor of computer science at Cornell Tech.</span><span> “By modernizing the code base and transitioning to the cloud, we are strengthening arXiv’s infrastructure and ensuring that it will continue to be a source of innovation in the sharing of scholarly publications. We are grateful to the Simons Foundation and the NSF for their support and for sharing in our vision for arXiv.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The next stage of arXiv’s development will include hiring multiple software developers to support the modernization effort. In parallel, faculty members in the Department of Computer Science, with funding provided by the NSF, will develop new search and recommendation techniques that can be tested and deployed on arXiv’s large and active user community, supported by state of the art privacy guarantees. In addition, arXiv will provide substantially better access to the visually impaired by producing HTML as well as PDF versions of its content.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“The arXiv has been a critical piece of research infrastructure for decades, and just as important, part of the foundation of open science that the world relies on every day,” said David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation. “Through our partner Cornell Tech, the foundation is proud to continue its investment in arXiv. This gift will help modernize the arXiv and ensure its sustainability for the community of scientists and mathematicians whose contributions have made it what it is.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>arXiv was founded in 1991 by then-Los Alamos National Laboratory physicist </span><a href="https://physics.cornell.edu/paul-ginsparg"><span>Paul Ginsparg</span></a><span>, Ph.D. ’81, prior to his return to Cornell in 2001. The repository is now maintained and operated by Cornell Tech, and serves researchers in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“The Simons Foundation has provided essential behind-the-scenes support for arXiv since 2011, as a natural partner in support of the research enterprise,” said Ginsparg, professor of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences, and of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. “The additional support to facilitate a transition to long-term sustainability should permit arXiv to enhance through an even longer period the transformative effects it has had on research communication over the past three decades.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In addition to the Simons Foundation’s ongoing support, arXiv is supported by academic and research libraries, universities, research organizations, professional societies and individual donors.</span></span></span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2023/1019-state-of-swift-and-swiftui-ios17/">https://blog.timac.org/2023/1019-state-of-swift-and-swiftui-ios17/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37947772">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Now that iOS 17 is available, let’s analyze its built-in apps to answer a few questions: How many binaries are in iOS 17? Which programming languages are used to develop these apps? How many apps are written with Swift? What is the percentage of apps using SwiftUI versus UIKit?</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>The methodology and tools to create this article have been detailed in my previous posts. If you are interested, please refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.timac.org/2022/0818-state-of-appkit-catalyst-swiftui-mac/">Apple’s use of AppKit, Mac Catalyst and SwiftUI in macOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">Evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">Apple’s use of Swift in iOS 10.1 and macOS 10.12</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before jumping into the details, let’s clarify a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I only analyzed what is commonly called ‘iOS’, i.e. everything above the kernel. The XNU kernel and low-level firmwares are not included. Note that this year, I analyzed the Secure Enclave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I counted the frameworks located inside the dyld shared cache, a mechanism introduced in iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep in mind that a developer can mix different programming languages to create one binary. One example is a Mac app I developed, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dependencies/id1538972026">Dependencies</a>, where I use Swift, Objective-C, C++, and C, the most appropriate programming language used to solve each specific problem. In this article, an app containing a single line of Swift code will be counted as using Swift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will see mentions of Objective-C and C++ but you might notice the absence of Objective-C++. The approach used here can’t really detect binaries built with Objective-C++. Such binaries are counted as using both Objective-C and C++.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, you should take this analysis with a grain of salt. While I believe the overall picture to be accurate, my approach has some limitations because I don’t have access to the iOS source code and relied on imprecise compilation artifacts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="number-of-binaries">Number of binaries</h2>
<p>Let’s first answer a simple question: How many binaries are in iOS 17? The number of binaries composing iOS continues to increase: iOS 17 contains 6030 binaries, up from 5403 in iOS 16. That’s 627 new binaries.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, there has been a significant increase in the number of apps adopting SwiftUI this year. Notable mentions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Preferences app with several of its bundles (StorageSettingsUI, WallpaperSettings, MultitaskingAndGesturesSettings, ThirdPartyApplicationSettings, ActionButtonSettings, …)</li>
<li>Several binaries related to Health (Health.app, HealthUI, MentalHealthUI, WorkoutUI, …)</li>
<li>The Home app, which appears to have undergone some major changes (Home.app, HomeEnergyUI, HomeUICommon, HomeDataModel, HomeAccessoryControlUI, …)</li>
<li>The support for the new Action button (ActionButtonSettings, ActionButtonConfigurationUI, …)</li>
<li>Additionally, several other important apps, such as Calendar and Reminders, are now using SwiftUI</li>
</ul>
<p>In iOS 16, only 4 apps used the SwiftUI-based app lifecycle. In iOS 17, this figure has grown to 14 apps:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/Batteries.app/Batteries
/Applications/ClarityCamera.app/ClarityCamera
/Applications/ClarityPhotos.app/ClarityPhotos
/Applications/FinanceUIService.app/FinanceUIService
/Applications/FTMInternal-4.app/FTMInternal-4
/Applications/MusicRecognition.app/MusicRecognition
/Applications/PASViewService.app/PASViewService
/Applications/Preferences.app/Preferences
/Applications/SafetyMonitorApp.app/SafetyMonitorApp
/Applications/ShazamEventsApp.app/ShazamEventsApp
/Applications/WorkoutRemoteViewService.app/WorkoutRemoteViewService
/private/var/staged_system_apps/Weather.app/Weather
/System/Library/CoreServices/AegirProxyApp.app/AegirProxyApp
/System/Library/CoreServices/ShortcutsActions.app/ShortcutsActions
</code></pre>
<p>The Swift and SwiftUI adoption continues its climb: iOS 17 now contains 385 binaries using SwiftUI. Likewise the number of binaries containing at least one line of Swift code increased by 50% between iOS 16 and iOS 17:</p>


<h2 id="evolution-of-the-programming-languages">Evolution of the programming languages</h2>
<p>By analyzing all major releases of iOS from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS 17, we can see the evolution of the programming languages used by iOS. Again please note that a single binary can be counted multiple times, so the sum of the binaries in this graph is greater than the total number of binaries:</p>


<p>Some trends can be better visualized by displaying percentages:</p>


<p>What can we learn from these graphs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective-C is still at the core of iOS and is used directly or indirectly by most apps</li>
<li>The adoption of Swift and SwiftUI continues to grow rapidly</li>
<li>The share of Objective-C, C and C++ continues to decrease</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uikit-versus-swiftui">UIKit versus SwiftUI</h2>
<p>Up until now, we compared SwiftUI to all binaries. SwiftUI being a UI framework, it would be fairer to compare it to other binaries displaying some UI. Native iOS apps can be built with 2 different UI frameworks: UIKit and SwiftUI (note that it is possible to mix both). My approach to count the number of binaries containing UI is not perfect but should give an approximate trend: I simply check if the binaries link against the UIKit or SwiftUI frameworks.</p>
<p>For the first time, the number of binaries exclusively using UIKit has decreased in comparison to the previous year:</p>


<p>By displaying percentages, we can confirm that SwiftUI is clearly increasing in Apple’s own apps:</p>


<h2 id="secure-enclave">Secure Enclave</h2>
<p>The Secure Enclave is a hardware-based security component, isolated from the main processor to provide an extra layer of security. It was initially introduced with the iPhone 5S to ensure the security of sensitive user data, playing a critical role for Touch ID, Face ID, and Apple Pay.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110354/"><code>What's new in Swift</code> session (5:35)</a> of the WWDC22, Apple stated that Swift is now suitable for restricted environments like the Secure Enclave Processor:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2023/1019-state-of-swift-and-swiftui-ios17/WWDC2022.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In iOS 17, the Secure Enclave contains 19 binaries, and to my surprise, none of them are using Swift:</p>


<p>So is Swift used in the Secure Enclave? Yes! It turns out that the <code>hibernation</code> binary in macOS Ventura is using Swift:</p>


<h2 id="raw-data">Raw Data</h2>
<p>You can download below the raw data I generated for all major releases of iOS from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 17.0.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even though we don’t have access to the iOS source code, we can determine the programming languages used to create the built-in apps in iOS and we can measure the evolution of these languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 17.</p>
<p>Swift and SwiftUI adoptions continue their growth: the number of binaries using these frameworks increased by 50% between iOS 16 and iOS 17. Another good sign of dogfooding is the more widespread use of the SwiftUI-based app lifecycle. Also for the first time, the number of binaries exclusively using UIKit has decreased in comparison to the previous year.</p>
<p>In the upcoming years, it will be interesting to observe whether Swift begins to spread into low-level firmware, such as the Secure Enclave. Currently, Swift is absent from the Secure Enclave in iOS, although macOS does incorporate it.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, this approach has obviously some limits and while I believe the overall picture to be accurate, I can’t guarantee that the results are perfectly exact.

  <p>My family wasn't poor by any stretch of the imagination, but I was raised to
avoid spending money whenever possible.</p>
<p>I was also taught "it's a poor craftsman that blames their tools", which
apparently means "take responsibility for your fuckups", but, to young-me,
definitely sounded more like "you don't deserve nice things".</p>
<p>I was also taught from an early age that I was born a sinner, incapable of doing
good by myself, and that all the earthly things were temptations, sent by the
devil to corrupt me (further I guess?) but also temporary, and that I shouldn't
attach myself.</p>
<p>I'm better now — thanks for asking.</p>
<p>But I'm sure you can see why "protestant ethics" primed me for head-first into
the pit of unpaid labor and burnout that is "F/OSS at large" (free and open
source software, for the kids in the back).</p>
<p>It's perfect: much like in the religious environment I grew up in, everyone is
<em>this close</em> to permanently losing it, and there's an infinite supply of
thankless work to be done, which means, and this is crucial: nothing you do
will ever be good enough.</p>
<p>In either place, there is no redeeming yourself.</p>
<p>And sure, okay, the <em>other</em> thing that attracted me to F/OSS was, of course, the
good parts: that you can look at how it's made, fix it up for yourself
and others, etc.</p>
<p>As someone most definitely somewhere on the spectrum, being able to stare at the
inner workings of complex systems unperturbed, was just... I liked it, You
know?</p>
<p>Things have changed since, to some extent.</p>
<p>The Early Unix Crowd lament having to think about languages other than C. We in
the DevOps mines would pay good money never to have to speak YAML again.</p>
<p>I get it: GCC 2.95 was an easier time.</p>
<p>But, like Andrew Morton famously said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's time to give up on it and just drink more coffee or play more tetris or
something, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Source: LWN, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/163881/">The end of gcc 2.95 support</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today still, if you try, if you <em>really</em> try, you <em>can</em> go in and try and
modify your favorite software.</p>
<p>But, and I wish 19-year-old me would've heeded that piece of advice, you always
need to keep in mind that you're either spending time or spending money.</p>
<p>Let me IMMEDIATELY add caveats there, because your gut reaction may be what mine
was back then: "Oh! you're one of <em>those</em>. The ones who put a number on everything,
and make decisions based on those numbers".</p>
<p>Of course not! There's no poetry in accounting. And little point in counting if
you're having a good time.</p>
<p>Besides, when you <em>are</em> 19 / still a student / unemployed, time is all you have
to spend, so the choice is made for you.</p>
<p>And of course, it's really hard to qualify all the second-order effects "spending
time performing unpaid labor for various F/OSS projects" has had on my career
(for the best), my health (for the worst), etc.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that to cause more anxiety over picking <em>which</em> thing to spend
your time on: I think of it more like a good reason to spend your time on a lot
of different things, and people, and ideas, because whether they go terribly
right or terribly wrong, there's a lesson to be learned.</p>
<p>And friend, do I have a lesson to share with you today.</p>

<p>...but it's not in-your-face about it. It's rather consistent across Linux (GNU
or not), macOS, Windows, and, now the most important shell of all: "the
browser".</p>
<p>And it's really good at diagrams. Nowadays you'd probably use something
source-defined like <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a> or one of the cool kids
like <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>, but draw.io is burnt into the memory
of The Old Ones.</p>
<p>Why? Because, like all good products, it started out with "solving a hard
problem" better than anyone else. The hard bit was "making a graph editor that
could render to SVG and display in non-SVG browsers", and if that sounds weird,
that's because this happened forever ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We created mxGraph in 2005 as a commercial project and it ran through to 2016
that way. Our USP was the support for non-SVG browsers, when that advantage
expired we moved onto commercial activity around draw.io.</p>
<p>Source: mxgraph README, <a href="https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph#history">History</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I think this spirit, of "taking the problem seriously", permeated throughout
almost the entire product and is one of the reasons draw.io felt so nice to use
compared to, well, anything else at the time.</p>
<p>What else was I supposed to use? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dia_%28software%29">Dia</a>?</p>

<p>That's not what SourceForge looked like when I got my start, but the smell is
the same.</p>
<p>Just look at those two lovingly hand-crafted .dmg files. No
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI/CD</a> there, just vibes.</p>
<p>Remember Pidgin? Adium? I can do this all day.</p>
<p>GitHub didn't just usher in a new era of collaboration, of new heroes and new
villains, it also sent to the grave SourceForge, and an entire aesthetic with
it.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't miss it.</p>

                        <h2>
                            <a id="draw-io-the-bad" href="#draw-io-the-bad">
                                draw.io - the bad
                            </a>
                        </h2>
                        
<p>But all good things must come to an end at some point, and for draw.io (and the
rest of the world, for slightly different reasons), that was 2016.</p>
<p>As the history section I quoted earlier covers: "when that advantage expired (in
2016), we (jgraph) moved onto commercial activity around draw.io".</p>
<p>Now, it's more subtle than that. draw.io is <em>still good</em>, and the dealbreaker
I'm about to cover pre-existed jgraph's shift to "commercial activity around
draw.io".</p>
<p>In fact, it's really important that there be a revenue source to fund continued
maintenance of draw.io, so, as long as it doesn't mess with the main product too
much, I'm happy!</p>
<p>But that's when, for me at least, draw.io stopped investing in "their own
engine" and fully committed to doing "whatever the browser does". The browser
being, need I say it,
<a href="https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio/blob/2d6f60db48561758d7749aa79357ccbbde789abd/image-export/Dockerfile#L9">Chrome</a>.</p>
<div>

<p>Of course, you could probably get Gecko to do it instead, but why go all the
trouble to end up with a result that looks different from what you get in the
Electron-based desktop app?</p>
</div>
<p>At least the docs, and I would expect no less from jgraph, whom I respect,
correctly describe draw.io's ability to do "rich text formatting" as simply
"being able to use HTML to style nodes":</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Style part of a text label</h3>
<p>Text labels in shapes and on connectors can be formatted with HTML, so you can
apply a style to part of a text label. For example, you can apply bold,
italicise, colour, or a link to just one word.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/text-styles#style-part-of-a-text-label">draw.io FAQ</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does this matter? Because once you let HTML into your product, a product
that, by nature, cares about the precise layout of things, you're fucked.</p>
<p>You're fucked because, although I don't believe it's <em>literally impossible</em> to
make your own browser (<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope">CW: Drew
DeVault</a>), it is
several orders of magnitude harder than the hard problem mxGraph solves in the
first place.</p>
<p>Which is why I keep defending Electron as "not that bad, actually, when you
really think about it" in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnaGZHe8wws">very old video I'm quite embarrassed
about</a>, and which thesis is
essentially: there's more to it than you probably think (but you're very welcome
to try).</p>
<p>Of course, in another universe, draw.io didn't take the shortcut and didn't just
say "you can just put HTML int here". In another universe, they only allowed
bold, italic, underline, font-size and font-family... and line spacing, and
letter spacing, and text alignment, and superscript and subscript and...</p>
<p>...okay you see my point about there being more to it than it seems now, but
point is: they could've picked a limited feature set and just written their own
text rendering engine.</p>
<p>And then you wouldn't need Chrome's DOM, its layout engine and the <a href="https://skia.org/docs/user/sample/pdf/">PDF backend
of its renderer</a> to do a "proper export"
from draw.io.</p>
<p>But they didn't! And you do.</p>
<p>Worse: <em>I</em> do, and the thing I <em>actually</em> do for this blog, because I've stopped
"just grabbing rectangular screenshots and pasting them onto my blog" a long
time ago (I blame HiDPI displays), is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a handwritten Rust app that..</li>
<li>..launches headless chrome</li>
<li>..loads draw.io in it (from a <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/hyper">hyper HTTP server</a>)</li>
<li>..asks draw.io to load the .drawio file (also over HTTP)</li>
<li>..asks chrome to print to PDF (this uses Skia's PDF backend)</li>
<li>..opens that PDF using <a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/">poppler</a></li>
<li>..exports it using <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/">cairo</a>'s SVG backend</li>
<li>..optimizes it using <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/svgcleaner">svgcleaner</a> (which is unmaintained and will soon stop compiling)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then you get one of these, which looks crisp at any resolution and can be
printed even if you don't have Iosevka installed on your computer:</p>

<p>My <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/series/dont-shell-out">Don't Shell Out</a> spends several chapters describing
how I've managed to get the "glib cinematic universe" ("gee lib", not
"slippery") to link statically on Windows, but I have since resigned myself to
only run it on macOS or Linux, where nix is available and solves just about as
many problems as it causes.</p>

<p>This works today, but I would sleep better if Chromium was no longer part of my
asset pipeline, because at some point I want to deploy this to servers instead
of running it locally (thus lowering the barrier to entry for other people to
collaborate with me).</p>
<p>The <em>other</em> reason I started looking into alternatives is because alternatives
started looking at me.</p>
<p>In 2023, I was contracted to do some very interested work related to Figma, none
of which I can talk about because I stupidly signed a very paranoidly-worded
contract, which I will never do again unless I am literally on the verge of
losing my home.</p>
<p>But! It forced me to, you know, actually learn Figma. And, it's a weird and
unfair comparison, of course, because draw.io is a diagramming tool and Figma is
an interface design tool, but this thing is just built different.</p>
<p>The first time I actually heard of Figma (this is how sheltered us software
engineers are) was when someone asked me how I felt about them compiling Rust
and C++ code to WebAssembly for a product that, fundamentally, feels like it
shouldn't really require more than a buttload of JavaScript (maybe even
TypeScript at that scale) and DOM crimes. Or perhaps canvas, if you <em>really</em>
do care about pixel perfection and you're hell-bent on re-inventing the wheel.</p>
<p>But care they did, and they didn't just reinvent the wheel: they changed the
game.</p>
<p><a href="https://madebyevan.com/">Evan Wallace</a> has fantastic write-ups about some of
the "casual genius" ideas he simply willed into existence during <a href="https://madebyevan.com/figma/">his tenure as
Figma co-founder</a>.</p>
<p>Things like <a href="https://madebyevan.com/figma/introducing-vector-networks/">vector
networks</a>, which
immediately impose themselves as clearly superior to the classical "vector path"
model <em>literally everyone else is using</em>.</p>
<p>Or like successfully <a href="https://madebyevan.com/figma/rust-in-production-at-figma/">migrating the server-side portion of their product from
TypeScript to Rust</a>,
resulting in 3.8x smaller memory usage, 6x smaller CPU usage, 10x faster file
serve time and 16.4x faster worst-case save time.</p>
<p>The Figma team didn't solve one hard problem, they solved dozens. All while
maintaining best-of-class UX and gaining the favor of designers everywhere.</p>
<p>It's <em>really</em> hard not to like them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figma_(software)#Proposed_acquisition_by_Adobe">Even Adobe agrees</a>.</p>

                        <h2>
                            <a id="the-worst-possible-business-strategy-protestant-ethics" href="#the-worst-possible-business-strategy-protestant-ethics">
                                The worst possible business strategy: protestant ethics
                            </a>
                        </h2>
                        
<p>But! It costs money. You get 3 files for free to fully explore the product: 
beyond that, you need to shell out for Figma Professional, which will cost you
$15/seat/month, unless you're comfortable with year-long commitments (I'm not),
at which point it falls to $12/seat/month.</p>
<p>And, I don't know if you remember from the intro but: I was raised on frugality.</p>
<p>You don't understand. I'm talking about an entire community for which couponing
qualifies as foreplay. I'm <em>barely</em> exaggerating.</p>
<p>And I had big plans!</p>
<p>In 2023 I announced I was building a team, so that I could "produce more
content": everyone hates this way of putting it, and the "content creator"
moniker, but "teacher" is a protected class and I haven't fully internalized the
"clown" label yet, so it's a happy middle ground.</p>
<p>And I did, for a bit! I paid two people for a few months, to help both with the
"content" part itself (helping with research, triage ideas, follow up on drafts
etc.) and on the "platform" part, because, part of the fun of "working here" is
that everything is custom-made and wonky (as evidenced by the draw.io asset
pipeline described above).</p>
<p>At any other company, this would be a nightmare (and whew, have I been there),
but here it's endearing and a feature: doing "as much as possible" yourself
means having a lot to write about: the machine feeds itself.</p>
<p>And I hate, <em>hate</em> per-seat per-month pricing, because everyone is trying to get
in on it, and for small business, it adds up. To a point where one might be
forgiven for asking themselves: "if I just bite the bullet and learn Kubernetes,
could I self-host all that and eventually save up money?".</p>
<p>This seems like hard work to get worse things. In other words: this is <em>exactly</em>
how I was raised.</p>
<p>Being a sinner from birth, I of course do not deserve nice things. Nor should I
desire them. I will use whatever's in front of me, and I will be glad about it.</p>
<p>If it's not suffering, it's not work.</p>
<p>And if it's not work, it's probably "of the devil".</p>
<p>Which brings us to Penpot.</p>

                        <h2>
                            <a id="penpot" href="#penpot">
                                Penpot
                            </a>
                        </h2>
                        
<p>Penpot is not just a product, it's an idea.</p>
<p>The headline, which takes up 10% of the viewport height on my browser, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring Design Freedom to your Product Team</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://penpot.app/">https://penpot.app/</a> at the time of this writing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by "Sign up, it's free!" and "Self-host install" calls to action.</p>
<p>The next line is "Penpot is the Open-Source Design &amp; Prototyping Tool for
Product Teams".</p>
<p>And at this point, you've used the labels "free" twice, and "open-source" once,
to market your thing, and, uh, let's say charitably: "I've been warned".</p>
<p>This is not <em>just</em> me being an asshole, by the way. There's a rich history of a
vocal minority going "you can't excuse everything by saying it's free software"
and being met with "PRs welcome kthxbye".</p>
<p>This is <em>tradition</em> at this point. Perhaps even sport.</p>
<p>Anyway: I was told a lot of good about Penpot. "Of the free alternatives to
Figma", I was told (and this is key), "it is by far the best".</p>
<p>But after spending a few hours trying to get anything done with it, my
assessment is that, if this is true, then it's really not worth checking out any
of the other alternatives.</p>
<p>And I will describe my user story, but only after you and I agree that you could
fix each individual issue I'll talk about, one by one, and it still wouldn't
detract from my core argument.</p>
<p>Deal? Deal.</p>
<p>So! The Penpot homepage talks about its desktop app: makes sense, draw.io
(although in a slightly different category, as I've already said) has one, Figma
has one, the Penpot userbase certainly would like one, and so <a href="https://sudovanilla.com/code/Korbs/Penpot-Desktop">somebody made
one</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this link still loads by the time you read this, because it is a
<a href="https://forgejo.org/">forgejo</a> instance which I can only assume runs on a
Raspberry Pi on someone's desk.</p>
<div>

<p>Just kidding, it's running on a Raspberry Pi <em>behind Cloudflare</em>. I guess
only client-side software is evil or something.</p>
</div>
<p>Anyway, the desktop app isn't official or officially supported (although to
their credit, Penpot, or I guess Kaleidos, sponsors sudovanilla. I have no idea
for how much).</p>
<p>The way you should run Penpot is to... well you should just pay for a seat on
their cloud offering but that's what we're trying <em>not</em> to do, so you're
supposed to self-host it.</p>
<p>The self-host page first suggests <a href="https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/getting-started/#install-with-elestio">paying someone else to run it for
you</a>,
a completely valid answer to that question (many people do that with Mastodon),
but since I've never heard of Elestio and I'm already going the road less
traveled... might as well go all the way.</p>
<p>Again the self-host page hammers what is essentially their only selling point:
it no cost money:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For too long, a critical piece of the software development pipeline has been
available solely via pricey proprietary SaaS subscriptions or Mac-only desktop
apps.</p>
<p>Penpot brings <strong>total freedom</strong> for teams by encouraging self-hosted deployments
so you can <strong>take advantage of your security and backup policies</strong>, as well as
<strong>extending and customizing</strong> your Penpot server the way you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis theirs, annoyingly).</p>
<p>I'm not copywriting professional, but even I can recognize a piece of art when I
see one.</p>
<p>Anyway, option 2 is "install with Docker", which gives you a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penpot/penpot/main/docker/images/docker-compose.yaml">docker-compose
file</a>,
good enough to run it on your MacBookPro for sure, but, and let me emphasize
this: <strong>absolutely nobody should be running anything in production using a
docker-compose file</strong>.</p>
<p>What you're meant to do is, of course, run it on Kubernetes, which is largely
the same (it's containers all the way down) except it's configured differently,
you can now think about scaling out (on several nodes), you have actual
health/liveness checks and policies for rolling out new versions, restarting,
etc.</p>
<p>It's k8s! We all love to hate it, but at least the industry has sorta
standardized around it, so that makes commiserating easier.</p>
<p>And because penpot is made up of three services (backend, exporter, frontend —
not counting postgres and redis), although you <em>could</em> technically deploy all
three of them separately, the idiomatic and era-appropriate thing to do at the
time of this writing is to use a helm chart, which lets you deploy several
resources at once.</p>
<p>Nobody told me, but there is one place generally accepted as "the helm chart
search engine", and it's <a href="https://artifacthub.io/">ArtifactHub</a>.</p>
<p>Searching for "penpot" will turn up two options: one by CodeChem (last updated 9
months ago), and one by TrueCharts (last updated 6 months ago).</p>
<p>I chose the former, not realizing it was pointing at the <code>1.16.0-beta</code> tag for
all three penpot images.</p>
<p>After much trial and error, I came up with the following <a href="">k3s manifest</a>:</p>

<p>So it's got that going for it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why the preview for the "wsl2-kernel" file is missing (the URL just
returns a 404): presumably one of the pieces is misconfigured in the helm chart,
because the cloud offering gets it right:</p>

<p>At first, exporting didn't work <em>at all</em> (it would just time out), but upgrading
to the non-beta 1.19.3 seems to have fixed some of it.</p>
<p>I can, for example, export to SVG now. It takes <em>several seconds</em>, and we end up
with this:</p>

            <picture>
                <source type="image/avif" srcset="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/penpot-svg-export.148dd5c96dcce2a0.avif">

            </picture>
            
<p>Looks fine! What's in there? For example, what SVG node type is it using for
"RAM stick #1"?</p>
<div translate="no"><p>XML</p><pre data-lang="xml"><i>&lt;</i><i>text</i> <i>xmlns</i>="<i>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</i>" <i>x</i>="<i>20.00000000000007</i>" <i>y</i>="<i>29.601562499999858</i>" <i>dominant-baseline</i>="<i>ideographic</i>" <i>textLength</i>="<i>72</i>" <i>lengthAdjust</i>="<i>spacingAndGlyphs</i>" <i>style</i>="<i>text-transform: none; font-family: Iosevka; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: 100; white-space: pre; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none solid rgb(0, 0, 0); direction: ltr; fill: rgb(0, 0, 0); fill-opacity: 1;</i>"<i>&gt;</i>RAM stick #1<i>&lt;/</i><i>text</i><i>&gt;</i>
</pre></div>
<p>Right. Just a text node. This means you need to have the "Iosevka" font
installed, which doesn't work for me: I want my SVG diagrams to be displayed
exactly the same everywhere, so I want them to be paths.</p>
<p>What if we use the same trick as with draw.io, and export to PDF first, then
use cairo to convert that to SVG?</p>

<p>It doesn't fucking work! We get "generic serif font" instead of Iosevka.</p>
<p>You wanna know why?</p>
<p>Well, it takes several seconds because what the penpot exporter is doing is,
that's right, spawning a chromium
instance and <a href="https://github.com/penpot/penpot/blob/a49bc07259aa9def304a44e90b3d34f97508c413/exporter/src/app/browser.cljs#L73-L82">printing to PDF</a>.</p>
<p>(But hey, <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a>!)</p>
<p>And I guess the thing that's supposed to give chromium access to the document's
"custom fonts" is broken in some way. Because they didn't <em>completely</em> fumble
this one: Penpot does have a proper "Custom Fonts" feature:</p>

<p>It even detects mismatched vertical metrics and points you at <a href="https://vertical-metrics.netlify.app/">this
service</a> to see for yourself, and
<a href="https://transfonter.org/">Transfonter</a> to fix it.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not Figma's "just <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956894-Access-local-fonts-on-your-computer">install this native
app</a>
and you can use all your fonts, even from a browser", but: someone, somewhere, cared about this!</p>
<p>However, it's also terrible, terrible news.</p>
<p>Even if it <em>did</em> work properly, we're back to just "doing whatever the browser
does" (the browser being, at least for now, universally, chromium) in terms of
text layout and rendering.</p>
<p>Which means export is <em>always</em> going to be slow, and if, like me, you're using
the platform-appropriate browser in your operating system (Firefox everywhere if
your fetish is Google-funded antitrust mitigations, and Edge on Windows + Safari
on macOS otherwise), it's not going to match exactly what you see in the editor.</p>
<p>I've also recreated the diagram in Figma, which was a <em>much</em> nicer experience,
and not just because Figma is the original and Penpot is the copy, but also
because... it works? Snapping works, and when 80% of your interaction with the
software is "moving/resizing things", that matters a lot.</p>
<p>Figma lets you adjust advanced stroke settings, so I can <em>actually</em> match
the draw.io default:</p>

            <picture>
                <source type="image/avif" srcset="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/figma-editor.7ba4bc5ba83c9465.avif">

            </picture>
            
<p>Exporting the frame to SVG is instant (it's all happening client-side) and
should look the same for everyone:</p>
<p><img src="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/adding-memory-figma.d4657ea8902cc3b5.svg" title="" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Because it's not using the SVG text node anywhere: it's using paths.</p>
<p>The "RAM stick #1" string is just this (extremely long, cut for your
convenience) SVG path:</p>
<div translate="no"><p>XML</p><pre data-lang="xml"><i>&lt;</i><i>path</i> <i>d</i>="<i>M20.896 34V23.71H23.584C23.836 23.71 24.0833 (cut) 23.71H101.466V34H100.374Z</i>" <i>fill</i>="<i>black</i>"/&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>And that happens to be exactly what I want, because, much like Figma, I care
about <em>precise</em> design (them, because it pays. me, because I can). Even if my
diagrams and figures are bad, I want them to look the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Penpot didn't solve that hard problem. It's several <em>huge</em> engineering efforts
away from solving that problem. In fact, I know they're <em>never</em> going to solve
that problem, because they turned it into a selling point.</p>
<p>See, Penpot isn't only bashing no "pricey SaaS subscriptions and macOS-only
apps" (which is don't-sue-me speech for Figma and
<a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>), it's saying how it's great that their
flexbox model exactly matches the CSS one, saving valuable time when developers
have to implement the designers'.. designs, as HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>Well, no shit! It <em>is</em> the CSS model, since they don't have a layout engine.</p>
<p>Figma is just from a different time, I guess.</p>
<p>A time when you could afford to have "design" and "implementation" be separate
jobs with separate expertise.</p>
<p>When you could design for things other than the web.</p>
<p>And when you could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Field#Starting_Figma_(2012)">get paid $100K to quit
school</a> and
focus full-time on tools like Figma, instead of whatever AI/ML slop everyone is
being served now.</p>
<p>Now that, I miss.</p>

<!-- cache hit 939:single/related:2baac0613a1284f273d3f0fa2635848a --><!-- empty -->
<p>The Federal Communications Commission today voted to move ahead with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/fcc-details-plan-to-restore-the-net-neutrality-rules-repealed-by-ajit-pai/">plan</a> that would restore net neutrality rules and common-carrier regulation of Internet service providers.</p>
<p>In a 3-2 party-line vote, the FCC approved Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-397309A1.pdf">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> (NPRM), which seeks public comment on the broadband regulation plan. The comment period will officially open after the proposal is published in the Federal Register, but the docket is already active and can be <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(proceedings.name:(%2223-320%22))">found here</a>.</p>
<p>The proposal would reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, a designation that allows the FCC to regulate ISPs under the common-carrier provisions in Title II of the Communications Act. The plan is essentially the same as what the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/fcc-votes-for-net-neutrality-a-ban-on-paid-fast-lanes-and-title-ii/">FCC did in 2015</a> when it used Title II to prohibit fixed and mobile Internet providers from blocking or throttling traffic or giving priority to Web services in exchange for payment.</p>
<p>The Obama-era net neutrality rules were eliminated during Trump's presidency when then-Chairman Ajit Pai <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/">led a repeal</a> that reclassified broadband as an information service, returning it to the less strict regulatory regime of Title I. The current FCC likely would have acted much sooner but there was a 2-2 deadlock until last month when the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/senate-confirms-biden-fcc-nominee-finally-giving-democrats-a-3-2-majority/">Senate confirmed</a> Biden nominee Anna Gomez to fill the empty spot.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>After the comment period, the FCC is likely to finalize the rulemaking and put the 2015 rules back in place. The broadband industry will likely then sue the FCC in an attempt to nullify the rulemaking.</p>
<h2>Chair: Broadband needs “expert agency”</h2>
<p>"Today, there is no expert agency ensuring that the Internet is fast, open, and fair... Today, we begin a process to make this right. We propose to reinstate enforceable, bright-line rules to prevent blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization," Rosenworcel said at the commission meeting.</p>
<p>Title II regulation isn't just about net neutrality, Rosenworcel said, arguing that the reclassification will give the FCC more authority to protect national security on broadband networks. "When we stripped state-affiliated companies from China of their authority to operate in the United States, that action did not extend to broadband services, thanks to the retreat from Title II. This is a national security loophole that needs to be addressed," she said.</p>
<p>Without Title II, the FCC has "limited authority to incorporate updated cybersecurity standards into our network policies," she said. The same is true of protecting privacy on broadband networks, she said.</p>
<p>"The law requires telecommunications providers to protect the confidentiality of the proprietary information of their customers," Rosenworcel said. "That means that these providers cannot sell your location data, among other sensitive information. Those privacy protections currently extend to voice customers but not broadband subscribers. Does that really make sense? Do we want our broadband providers selling what we do online? Scraping our service for a payday from new artificial intelligence models? Doing any of this without our permission?"</p>
<p>Disputing claims that the FCC is overstepping its authority, Rosenworcel said the "rules are legally sustainable because they track those that were upheld in court in 2016—from front to back."</p>

<p>An international team of scientists has discovered a huge spike in radiocarbon levels 14,300 years ago by analyzing ancient tree-rings found in the French Alps.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>The <a href="https://phys.org/tags/radiocarbon/" rel="tag">radiocarbon</a> spike was caused by a massive solar storm, the biggest ever identified.
</p><p>A similar solar storm today would be catastrophic for modern technological society—potentially wiping out telecommunications and satellite systems, causing massive electricity grid blackouts, and costing us billions of pounds.
</p><p>The academics are warning of the importance of understanding such storms to protect our global communications and energy infrastructure for the future.
</p><p>The <a href="https://phys.org/tags/collaborative+research/" rel="tag">collaborative research</a>, which was carried out by an international team of scientists, is published in <i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences</i> and reveals new insights into the sun's extreme behavior and the risks it poses to Earth.
</p><p>A team of researchers from the Collège de France, CEREGE, IMBE, Aix-Marseille University and the University of Leeds measured radiocarbon levels in ancient trees preserved within the eroded banks of the Drouzet River, near Gap, in the Southern French Alps.
</p><div data-thumb="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/researchers-identify-l-5.jpg" data-src="https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/researchers-identify-l-5.jpg" data-sub-html="Subfossil trees in the Drouzet river. Credit: Cécile Miramont">

    </div>

<p>The tree trunks, which are subfossils—remains whose fossilization process is not complete—were sliced into tiny single tree-rings. Analysis of these individual rings identified an unprecedented spike in radiocarbon levels occurring precisely 14,300 years ago. By comparing this radiocarbon spike with measurements of beryllium, a chemical element found in Greenland ice cores, the team proposes that the spike was caused by a massive solar storm that would have ejected huge volumes of energetic particles into Earth's atmosphere.
</p><p>Edouard Bard, Professor of Climate and Ocean Evolution at the Collège de France and CEREGE, and lead author of the study, said, "Radiocarbon is constantly being produced in the upper atmosphere through a chain of reactions initiated by cosmic rays. Recently, scientists have found that extreme solar events including <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solar+flares/" rel="tag">solar flares</a> and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/coronal+mass+ejections/" rel="tag">coronal mass ejections</a> can also create short-term bursts of energetic particles which are preserved as huge spikes in radiocarbon production occurring over the course of just a single year."


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>The researchers say that the occurrence of similar massive solar storms today could be catastrophic for modern technological society, potentially wiping out telecommunications, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/satellite+systems/" rel="tag">satellite systems</a> and electricity grids—and costing us billions of pounds. They warn that it is critical to understand the future risks of events like this, to enable us to prepare, build resilience into our communications and energy systems and shield them from potential damage.
</p><p>Tim Heaton, Professor of Applied Statistics in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds, said, "Extreme solar storms could have huge impacts on Earth. Such super storms could permanently damage the transformers in our electricity grids, resulting in huge and widespread blackouts lasting months. They could also result in permanent damage to the satellites that we all rely on for navigation and telecommunication, leaving them unusable. They would also create severe radiation risks to astronauts."
</p><p>Nine such extreme solar storms—known as Miyake Events—have now been identified as having occurred over the last 15,000 years. The most recent confirmed Miyake Events occurred in 993 AD and 774 AD. This newly-identified 14,300-year-old storm is, however, the largest that has ever been found—roughly twice the size of these two.

    </div>

<p>The exact nature of these Miyake Events remains very poorly understood as they have never been directly observed instrumentally. They highlight that we still have much to learn about the behavior of the sun and the dangers it poses to society on Earth. We do not know what causes such extreme solar storms to occur, how frequently they might occur, or if we can somehow predict them.
</p><p>Professor Bard said, "Direct instrumental measurements of solar activity only began in the 17th century with the counting of sunspots. Nowadays, we also obtain detailed records using ground-based observatories, space probes, and satellites. However, all these short-term instrumental records are insufficient for a complete understanding of the sun. Radiocarbon measured in tree-rings, used alongside beryllium in polar ice cores, provide the best way to understand the sun's behavior further back into the past."
</p><p>The largest, directly-observed, solar storm occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event. It caused massive disruption on Earth—destroying telegraph machines and creating a night-time aurora so bright that birds began to sing, believing the sun had begun to rise. However, the Miyake Events (including the newly discovered 14,300-yr-old <a href="https://phys.org/tags/storm/" rel="tag">storm</a>) would have been a staggering entire order-of-magnitude greater in size.

<p>Professor Heaton said, "Radiocarbon provides a phenomenal way of studying Earth's history and reconstructing critical events that it has experienced. A precise understanding of our past is essential if we want to accurately predict our future and mitigate potential risks. We still have much to learn. Each new discovery not only helps answer existing key questions but can also generate new ones."
</p><p>Cécile Miramont, Associate Professor of Paleoenvironments and Paleoclimates at IMBE, Aix-en-Provence University, said, "Finding such a collection of preserved trees was truly exceptional. By comparing the widths of the individual tree rings in the multiple <a href="https://phys.org/tags/tree+trunks/" rel="tag">tree trunks</a>, we then carefully pieced together the separate trees to create a longer timeline using a method called dendrochronology. This allowed us to discover invaluable information on past environmental changes and measure radiocarbon over an uncharted period of solar activity."

        <p>By analyzing fossilized dental plaque, scientists have found new evidence that early Europeans ate seaweed and other aquatic plants.</p>

<p>Today, dental hygienists diligently scrape plaque and tartar off our teeth during regular cleanings. But before modern dentisty, this debris simply built up on early humans’ teeth and gums.</p>

<p>Fortunately for archaeologists, some of that plaque has survived for thousands of years.</p>

<p>In a study published this week in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41671-2"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, researchers analyzed samples of preserved dental plaque from the remains of 74 early humans unearthed at 28 European archaeological sites. Some of the teeth were around 2,000 years old, while others were more than 8,000 years old, reports <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/europe/early-europeans-seaweed-dental-plaque-scn/index.html">CNN</a>’s Katie Hunt.</p>

<p>They found the chemical biomarkers of seaweed and aquatic plants in 26 samples, which suggests that early humans were eating—or, at the very least, chewing—these bounties from the sea. More specifically, they detected red, green and brown seaweed, as well as pondweed and a relative of the water lily.</p>

<p>The results indicate humans were eating aquatic plants as early as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period, through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period and into the early&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Middle-Ages">Middle Ages</a>. That timespan is significant, as archaeologists had long assumed that the introduction of farming during the Neolithic era meant that early humans largely abandoned such foods from the sea, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1004513?">statement</a> from the researchers.</p>

<p>Additionally, aquatic plants weren’t only a coastal menu specialty. The researchers also found evidence in teeth from a site in southeast Spain located nearly 50 miles from the water.</p>

<p>How early humans prepared these aquatic plants is unclear—did they eat them raw or cook them? Scientists also don’t know how much of their diets consisted of aquatic plants, as the biomarkers of other types of plants “tend to survive less well in archaeological contexts compared to algae,” study co-author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/people/research-staff/stephen-buckley/">Stephen Buckley</a>, an archaeologist at England’s University of York, tells CNN.</p>

<p>“We don’t necessarily get a full picture of all foods consumed, which can depend on prevailing environmental conditions,” he adds.</p>

<p>The team thinks early humans may have understood the nutritional benefits of seaweed and aquatic plants—just as we do now. These days, seaweed has&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/the-seaweed-superfood-revolution-could-end-world-hunger-and-save-the-planet/">been called a “superfood,”</a> thanks to its abundance, rapid growth and vitamin and mineral content.</p>

<p>“Seaweed is great,” says study co-author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/karenhardy/">Karen Hardy</a>, an archaeologist at the University of Glasgow, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2397961-people-around-europe-have-eaten-seaweed-for-thousands-of-years/"><em>New Scientist</em></a>’s Chen Ly. “It’s available, it’s nutritious, it’s local, it’s renewable.”</p>

<p>It’s also environmentally friendly and may help halt human-caused climate change by “absorbing carbon emissions, regenerating marine ecosystems, creating biofuel and renewable plastics as well as generating marine protein,” as&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/5848994/seaweed-climate-change-solution/"><em>Time</em></a>’s Mélissa Godin wrote in 2020.</p>

<p>The researchers hope their findings will encourage more people to start adding seaweed and aquatic plants to their diets.</p>

<p>“It would be a wonderful thing to think that people actually connected in and thought, ‘Well, if we ate it before, we can start eating it again,’” Hardy tells the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/17/seaweed-was-common-food-in-europe-for-thousands-of-years-researchers-find"><em>Guardian</em></a>’s Nicola Davis.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/Exein-io/pulsar">https://github.com/Exein-io/pulsar</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37942791">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">Pulsar is a security tool for monitoring the activity of Linux devices at runtime, powered by <a href="https://ebpf.io/" rel="nofollow">eBPF</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Pulsar core modules use eBPF probes to collect events from the kernel in a safe and efficient way. Pulsar events can be categorized in the four main following areas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>File I/O</strong>: I/O operations on disk and memory.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>: data from the network stack.</li>
<li><strong>Processes</strong>: processes information, including file execution and file opening.</li>
<li><strong>System Activity</strong>: device activity, including system calls.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Pulsar is built with a modular design that makes it easy to adapt the core architecture to new use cases, create new modules or write custom rules.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-quickstart" dir="auto"><a href="#quickstart">Quickstart</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><span>Warning</span><br>
A kernel 5.5 or higher with BPF and BTF enabled is required. Visit the official Pulsar website for the full <a href="https://pulsar.sh/docs/faq/kernel-requirements/" rel="nofollow">requirements</a> and <a href="https://pulsar.sh/docs/getting-started/installation" rel="nofollow">installation options</a> available.</p>
<p dir="auto">To download and install Pulsar, run the following in your terminal:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exein-io/pulsar/main/pulsar-install.sh | sh"><pre>curl --proto <span><span>'</span>=https<span>'</span></span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exein-io/pulsar/main/pulsar-install.sh <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Launch the pulsar daemon in a terminal <strong>with administrator privileges</strong>:</p>

<p dir="auto">That's pretty much it. At this point Pulsar is actively monitoring the activity of all the target processes, and checking it against the set of security policies defined in the rules file. You can test this by triggering a threat event, for example running the following command in another terminal:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/secret"><pre>ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/secret</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the pulsar terminal you should see something similar to:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[2023-02-07T14:29:09Z  THREAT  /usr/bin/ln (36267)] [rules-engine - { rule_name = &quot;Create sensitive files symlink&quot; }] File Link { source: /tmp/secret, destination: /etc/shadow, hard_link: false }"><pre><span>[2023-02-07T14:29:09Z  THREAT  /usr/bin/ln (36267)] [rules-engine - { rule_name = "Create sensitive files symlink" }] File Link { source: /tmp/secret, destination: /etc/shadow, hard_link: false }</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As you can see Pulsar identifies the previous command as a threat event.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how-does-it-work" dir="auto"><a href="#how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Behind the scenes, when an application performs an operation, it gets intercepted at kernel level by the Pulsar BPF probes, turned into a unique event object and sent to the userspace. There, the Pulsar rule engine processes the event against the set of rules defined in the rules file and, if there is a match, it emits a new event, marked as a threat. Finally a logger module prints threat events to the terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the example above, the event produced matched the following rule:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="- name: Create sensitive files symlink
  type: FileLink
  condition: (payload.destination IN [&quot;/etc/shadow&quot;, &quot;/etc/sudoers&quot;, &quot;/etc/pam.conf&quot;, &quot;/etc/security/pwquality.conf&quot;] OR payload.destination STARTS_WITH &quot;/etc/sudoers.d/&quot; OR payload.destination STARTS_WITH &quot;/etc/pam.d&quot;) AND payload.hard_link == &quot;false&quot;"><pre>- <span>name</span>: <span>Create sensitive files symlink</span>
  <span>type</span>: <span>FileLink</span>
  <span>condition</span>: <span>(payload.destination IN ["/etc/shadow", "/etc/sudoers", "/etc/pam.conf", "/etc/security/pwquality.conf"] OR payload.destination STARTS_WITH "/etc/sudoers.d/" OR payload.destination STARTS_WITH "/etc/pam.d") AND payload.hard_link == "false"</span></pre></div>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-recommended-using-the-official-installation-script" dir="auto"><a href="#recommended-using-the-official-installation-script">(Recommended) Using the official installation script</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The recommended approach to getting started with Pulsar is by using the official installations script. Follow the guide in the <a href="#quickstart">Quickstart</a> section.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-use-pre-built-binaries" dir="auto"><a href="#use-pre-built-binaries">Use Pre-built Binaries</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Another approach to install Pulsar is by using a pre-built binary. Binaries are available for the <a href="https://github.com/Exein-io/pulsar/releases/latest">latest release</a>. Use <code>pulsar-exec</code> for x86-64 (<code>pulsar-exec-static</code> for a static build) or <code>pulsar-exec-static-aarch64</code> for AArch64 platform. Using there approach you also need to download and setup the <a href="https://github.com/exein-io/pulsar/blob/main/scripts">helper scripts</a> to have a more convenient way to start in daemon/cli mode.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-build-from-source" dir="auto"><a href="#build-from-source">Build from source</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">We do not recommend build Pulsar from source. Building from source is only necessary if you wish to make modifications.

<p>In 2015, researchers reported a surprising discovery that stoked industry-wide security concerns—an attack called RowHammer that could corrupt, modify, or steal sensitive data when a simple user-level application repeatedly accessed certain regions of DDR memory chips. In the coming years, memory chipmakers scrambled to develop defenses that prevented the attack, mainly by limiting the number of times programs could open and close the targeted chip regions in a given time.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers devised a new method for creating the same types of RowHammer-induced bitflips even on a newer generation of chips, known as DDR4, that have the RowHammer mitigations built into them. Known as RowPress, the new attack works not by “hammering” carefully selected regions repeatedly, but instead by leaving them open for longer periods than normal. Bitflips refer to the phenomenon of bits represented as ones change to zeros and vice versa.</p>
<p>Further amplifying the vulnerability of DDR4 chips to read-disturbance attacks—the generic term for inducing bitflips through abnormal accesses to memory chips—RowPress bitflips can be enhanced by combining them with RowHammer accesses. Curiously, raising the temperature of the chip also intensifies the effect.</p>
<p>“We demonstrate a proof of concept RowPress program that can cause bitflips in a real system that already employs protections against RowHammer,” Onur Mutlu, a professor at ETH Zürich and a co-author of a recently published paper titled <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/pub/RowPress_isca23.pdf">RowPress: Amplifying Read Disturbance in Modern DRAM Chips</a>, wrote in an email. “Note that this is not in itself an attack. It simply shows that bitflips are possible and plenty, which can easily form the basis of an attack. As many prior works in security have shown, once you can induce a bitflip, you can use that bitflip for various attacks.”</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>DIMMs, bits, and cosmic rays</h2>
<p>The basic building block of DRAM (dynamic random access memory) is a storage cell. Each cell comprises a capacitor and a transistor and stores a single bit of data. When a bit is put into a memory cell, the transistor is used to charge or discharge the capacitor. A charged capacitor is represented with a 1, while a discharged capacitor is represented with a 0. Most often, DRAM cells are organized into a rectangular array of rows and columns.</p>

<p>These rows and columns are arranged into ranks and banks to form what’s known as the dual in-line memory module. Better known as a DIMM, this rectangular stick plugs into the computer motherboard. When a computer accesses a chunk of memory, it opens the rows to the cells storing the desired data and transfers it to the CPU.</p>

<p>Bitflips have long been known as a rare, naturally occurring phenomenon. They occur when an unexpected flow of electrons within a transistor’s gates changes the voltage between the source, or the part of the circuit where flow originates, and the sink, where the flow is received. During a 2003 election in Belgium, cosmic rays from outer space are widely believed to have caused bitflips that gave a political candidate an <a href="https://radiolab.org/podcast/bit-flip">additional 4,096 votes</a> before being corrected. (The number 4,096, which can also be expressed as 2<sup>12</sup>, suggests there was a bitflip in the 12th bit.)</p>
<p>Then, in 2014, discovered a previously unknown way to <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/%7Eyoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf">artificially induce bitflips</a> at will. When a computer repeatedly hammered a DRAM row, they found they could induce bitflips in adjacent rows. In RowHammer parlance, the row that gets hammered is known as the aggressor row. The row where bits are flipped is known as the victim row.</p>

                                  <p>Peter Thiel has worn many hats over the years: Silicon Valley founder, Trump megadonor, cryptocurrency booster, democracy skeptic.</p><p>But there is yet another facet to Thiel, one that has remained secret until now: FBI informant.</p><p>In the summer of 2021, Insider has learned, Thiel began providing information as a "confidential human source," or CHS, to Johnathan Buma, a Los Angeles-based FBI agent who specializes in investigating political corruption and foreign-influence campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles Johnson, a longtime associate of Thiel's and a notorious figure in the far-right movement that Thiel has subsidized for a decade, told Insider in a statement that he helped recruit the billionaire as an informant by introducing him to Buma.</p><p>A source with knowledge of Thiel's relationship to the FBI, whose identity is known to Insider but who insisted on anonymity, corroborated Johnson's account, telling Insider that Johnson brokered a relationship between Thiel and Buma. Insider was able to confirm through an additional source that the FBI added Thiel to its formal roster of registered informants.</p><p>Another source close to Thiel told Insider that while they could not confirm that Thiel was a CHS, Thiel did speak to Buma occasionally. The source said that any assistance Thiel might have provided to the FBI should be understood as part of Thiel's gradual distancing of himself from Trump and the broader MAGA movement, which has vigorously criticized the FBI and other federal law-enforcement agencies.</p><h2><strong>Valuable information on a recurring basis</strong></h2><p>The FBI maintains a vast network of informants to keep tabs on organized crime, terrorist threats, extremist groups, and other criminal and intelligence targets. These sources, according to the bureau's <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/confidential-human-source-policy-guide-1018pg/confidential-human-source-policy-guide-1018pg-part-01-of-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Confidential Human Source Policy Guide</a>, are more than casual tipsters.&nbsp;</p><p>Confidential human sources enter "into a relationship with the FBI, and that relationship will forever affect the life of that individual," the guide says. "[They] will be either an 'FBI source' or a 'former FBI source' and, in turn, his or her conduct or misconduct will reflect upon the FBI." As such, the process for recruiting and maintaining such sources is highly regulated, requiring multiple layers of approval. Only people who are able to provide "valuable information … on a recurring basis" are granted CHS status, according to the policy.</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

A Thiel spokesperson stopped responding to inquiries after being told that Insider was reporting on Thiel's relationship with the FBI.&nbsp;</p><p>The FBI's national press office and Scott Horton, an attorney who represents Johnathan Buma, both declined to comment.</p><h2><strong>No reporting on political ties</strong></h2><p>Thiel is a citizen of Germany, the United States, and New Zealand; as of last year,&nbsp; he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/15/technology/peter-thiel-malta-citizenship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">reportedly in the process</a> of acquiring yet another passport, from Malta. In 2016, he donated $1.25 million to Trump's campaign and endorsed him from the stage at the Republican National Convention. After Trump won, Thiel served on his transition team.</p><p>Johnson, who said that he was also an informant for Buma, told Insider that he believes that Thiel's reporting to the FBI was largely limited to foreign contacts and attempts by foreign governments to penetrate Silicon Valley. Thiel has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/15/peter-thiel-reportedly-says-the-fbi-and-cia-should-investigate-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">publicly called on the FBI to investigate Google's ties to the Chinese government</a>.</p><p>Thiel, Johnson said, was directed by the FBI not to report on his interactions with Donald Trump or other US political figures.</p><p>Many of the politicians that Thiel has bankrolled — including Trump, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Blake Masters, a former Arizona senatorial candidate — have repeatedly attacked the bureau and its leadership in public. In 2022, Vance, whose campaign and affiliated PACs received a total of $15 million from Thiel, falsely claimed that the FBI had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-falsely-claims-fbi-illegally-wiretapped-trump-ohio-rally-2022-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">illegally wiretapped Trump's phone</a>.

(Most but not all of Thiel's donations occurred in early 2021, before the launch of Vance's campaign and the many false claims he made over the course of the race.)</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

            <pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:01:36 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/19/north_korea_fake_freelance_avoidance/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/19/north_korea_fake_freelance_avoidance/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37940713">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>US and South Korean authorities have updated their guidance on how to avoid hiring North Korean agents seeking work as freelance IT practitioners.</p>
<p>Thousands of North Korean techies are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/17/fbi_korea_freelancers/">thought</a> to prowl the world’s freelance platforms seeking work outside the Republic. Kim Jong Un’s regime uses the workers to earn hard currency, and infiltrate organizations they work for to steal secrets and plant malware. The FBI has previously warned employers to watch for suspicious behavior such as logging in from multiple IP addresses, working odd hours, and inconsistencies in name spellings across different online platforms.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231018">updated advice</a> adds other indicators that freelancer you are thinking about hiring could be a North Korean plant, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeated requests for prepayment followed by “anger or aggression when the request is denied”;</li>

<li>Threats to release proprietary source codes if additional payments are not made;</li>

<li>Using a freight forwarder’s address as the destination for a company laptop rather than a home address, and changing that address frequently;</li>

<li>Evading in-person meetings or requests for drug tests;</li>

<li>Changing payment methods or accounts on freelance-finder platforms;</li>

<li>Having multiple online profiles for the same identity with different pictures, or online profiles with no picture.</li>
</ul>
<p>The updated guidance suggests requiring recruitment companies to document their background checking processes, to be sure that they can screen out North Korean stooges. Conducting your own due diligence on workers suggested by recruiters is also recommended.</p>
<p>Another piece of advice recommends you should “Keep records, including recordings of video interviews, of all interactions with potential employees.” North Korean freelancers, per previous advice, will be shy of video interviews.</p>

    

<p>The agencies also recommend technological measures including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing use of remote desktop protocol on all company devices and prohibit using remote desktop applications for work;</li>

<li>Locking down all administrative permissions;</li>

<li>Installing insider threat monitoring software on company devices;</li>

<li>Regularly geo-locating company laptops to verify they match the logins of employees' addresses;</li>

<li>Requiring freelancers to shut off commercial VPNs when accessing company networks;</li>

<li>Adopting zero-trust and need-to-know policies;</li>

<li>Avoid granting access to proprietary information, if possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plenty of that is solid advice for any IT shop under any circumstances.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/05/north_korea_phishing_attack_on_south/">South Korea accuses North of Phish and Ships attack</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/04/lazarus_group_lightlesscan_malware_upgrade/">North Korea's Lazarus Group upgrades its main malware</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/08/plutus_payroll_guilty_verdict/">Aussie tech worker payroll scheme operators found guilty of tax fraud</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The advice was published a day after the US Justice department <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-action-disrupt-illicit-revenue-generation">announced</a> the seizure of 17 website domains used by North Korean information technology workers in a scheme to defraud US and foreign businesses, evade sanctions, and fund the development of the North’s weapons program.</p>
<p>US authorities have previously seized $1.5 million of revenue generated by those sites.</p>

        


        

<p>North Korea has “flooded the global marketplace with ill-intentioned information technology workers,” said Special Agent in Charge Jay Greenberg of the FBI St. Louis Division.</p>
<p>“This scheme is so prevalent that companies must be vigilant to verify whom they're hiring. At a minimum, the FBI recommends that employers take additional proactive steps with remote IT workers to make it harder for bad actors to hide their identities. Without due diligence, companies risk losing money or being compromised by insider threats they unknowingly invited inside their systems.”</p>
<h3>Check Chinese professors, too</h3>
<p>The updated advice was issued the day after the nations of the Five Eyes alliance – Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/18/five_eyes_china_espionage/">warned</a> at a summit that China’s industrial espionage efforts have again increased.</p>
<p>As part of the Five Eyes announcement, Mike Burgess, director-general of security at the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, revealed that the agency recently detected and disrupted a Chinese operation involving a visiting professor who came to work at an unnamed Australian research institution but was first recruited by Chinese intelligence.</p>

        

<p>“The spymasters gave him money and a shopping list of intelligence requirements and sent him to Australia,” Burgess <a target="_blank" href="https://www.asio.gov.au/media-statement-emerging-technology-and-securing-innovation-summit">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>“The academic set his Australian students research assignments that specifically covered many of the intelligence requirements," he recounted.</p>
<p>“ASIO intervened and removed the professor from the country before any harm could be done,” Burgess said, adding “This sort of thing happens every day in Australia, just as it happens in all our countries.” ®</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-caveat-faq" dir="auto"><a href="#caveat-faq">Caveat FAQ</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Is the code as good as GitHub Copilot?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">For simple line completions yes. For simple function completions, mostly. For complex functions... maybe.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Is it as fast as GitHub Copilot?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">On my Macbook Pro with an Apple M2 Max, the 7b models are roughly as fast. The 34b models are not. Please consider this repo a demonstration of a very inefficient implementation. I'm sure we can make it faster; please do submit a pull request if you'd like to help. For example, I think we need debouncer because sometimes llama.cpp/GGML isn't fast at interrupting itself when a newer request comes in.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Can this be packaged as a simple Mac app?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Yes!, I'm sure it can be, I just haven't had the time. Please do submit a pull request if you're into that sort of thing!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Should there be a meta-model that routes to a 1b for autocomplete, 7b for more complex autocomplete, and a 34b for program completion?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Hmm, that seems like an interesting idea.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OK, but in summary, is it good?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Only if your network is bad. I don't think it's competitive if you have fast Internet. But it sure is awesome on airplanes and while tethering!</p>

<p>I’m a full-time instructor in Python and Pandas, teaching in-person courses at companies around the world (e.g., Apple and Cisco) and with a growing host of online products, including <a href="https://store.lerner.co.il/">video courses</a> and a <a href="https://bambooweekly.com/">paid newsletter with weekly Pandas exercises</a>. Like many online entrepreneurs, I’ve experimented with a host of different products over the years, some free and some paid.

<p>A number of years ago, I decided to advertise some of my products on Facebook. I ran a bunch of ads, none of which were particularly successful, mostly because I didn’t put a lot of effort into them. I decided to try other things, and basically forgot about my advertising account.</p>



<p>It was only a year or so ago that I thought that maybe, just maybe, I should do some advertising on Facebook (now Meta). I went to my advertising page, and was a bit surprised to see that my account had been suspended for violating Meta’s advertising rules. I decided that this was weird, but didn’t think about it too much more, and went on to do other, more productive things.</p>



<p>Just a few months ago, I again visited my ad management page, and again saw the notice that I was not allowed to advertise because I had violated their rules. This time, for whatever reason, I decided that I was going to look into this further. I didn’t see any indication of what rules I had broken, and I knew for a fact that I hadn’t done anything other than advertise courses in Python and Pandas. I didn’t quite know what to do, but there was a button marked, “Click here to appeal.” So I clicked it, assuming that someone at Meta would reach out to me, saying, “Whoops!”</p>



<p>Nope: About 30 minutes later, I got e-mail from Meta saying that they had reviewed my case, I had definitely violated their policy, and now I was <em><strong>banned for life</strong></em> from ever advertising on a Meta platform. Here’s the e-mail that I got:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x.png" alt="" width="620" height="445" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x.png 1134w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-300x215.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-1024x735.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></figure>



<p>Going to my advertising management page indeed brought up a similar message:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-1024x615.png" alt="" width="652" height="392" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-1024x615.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-300x180.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-768x461.png 768w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px"></figure>



<p>And of course, when I click on the “Business support home,” I get a truly scary message:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-1024x808.png" alt="" width="729" height="576" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-1024x808.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-300x237.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-768x606.png 768w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x.png 1520w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px"></figure>



<p>All of this seemed utterly bizarre to me. What could I possibly have said or done that would get me permanently restricted? And is there any way that I can get out of this situation?</p>



<p>I decided to turn to my network on (where else?) Facebook, to see if anyone had any ideas. I also turned to LinkedIn, in case someone there might have some insights.</p>



<p>The good news? I got an answer right away from a friend on LinkedIn. He told me that he also had problems advertising his Python training courses on Meta platforms because — get this —&nbsp;Meta thought that he was dealing in live animals, which is forbidden.</p>



<p>That’s right: I teach courses in Python and Pandas. Never mind that the first is a programming language and the second is a library for data analysis in Python. Meta’s AI system noticed that I was talking about Python and Pandas, assumed that I was talking about the animals (not the technology), and banned me. The appeal that I asked for wasn’t reviewed by a human, but was reviewed by another bot, which (not surprisingly) made a similar assessment.</p>



<p>As I said, that was the good news. So, what’s the bad news?</p>



<p>I’ve been in the computer industry for a while, and have no small number of contacts. Three friends who have worked at Meta (two current, one past) offered to check into this for me.</p>



<p>The first friend looked into it, and found that there was nothing to be done. That’s because Meta has a data-retention policy of only 180 days, and because my account was suspended more than one year before I asked people to look into it, all of the evidence is now gone. Which means that there’s no way to reinstate my advertising account.</p>



<p>Now, I’m not a big believer in “there’s nothing to be done,” especially when it comes to companies and software, both of which are created and managed by people. But this friend seemed convinced, so I moved onto a second one. He didn’t get any further. And the third friend? He didn’t seem to make any headway, either.</p>



<p>The bottom line seems to be that Meta’s AI made a mistake, a big one. (You can be sure that I’ll be using this example when I teach courses on machine learning.) The fact that both the original judgment and the appeal were handed by AI is pretty ridiculous.</p>



<p>But even more absurd is the fact that because I didn’t react to their ban within a certain amount of time, there now seems to be no way for me to undo it. Which means that when I start to advertise my courses again —&nbsp;and I’m actually planning to do so in the near future —&nbsp;Meta won’t be seeing any of my money, whereas companies like Google, who seem to employ at least <em>some</em> humans in their advertising department —&nbsp;will.</p>

<p>Google has been caught hosting a malicious ad so convincing that there’s a decent chance it has managed to trick some of the more security-savvy users who encountered it.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/malicious-keepass-ad-google.png" data-height="551" data-width="740" alt="Screenshot of the malicious ad hosted on Google."><img alt="Screenshot of the malicious ad hosted on Google." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/malicious-keepass-ad-google-640x477.png" width="640" height="477" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/malicious-keepass-ad-google.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/malicious-keepass-ad-google.png" data-height="551" data-width="740">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Screenshot of the malicious ad hosted on Google.</p><p>Malwarebytes</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the ad, which masquerades as a pitch for the open-source password manager Keepass, there’s no way to know that it’s fake. It’s on Google, after all, which claims to vet the ads it carries. Making the ruse all the more convincing, clicking on it leads to ķeepass[.]info, which when viewed in an address bar appears to be the <a href="https://keepass.info/">genuine Keepass site</a>.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png" data-height="585" data-width="953" alt="Screenshot showing keepass.info in the URL and Keepass logo."><img alt="Screenshot showing keepass.info in the URL and Keepass logo." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website-640x393.png" width="640" height="393" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png" data-height="585" data-width="953">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Screenshot showing keepass.info in the URL and Keepass logo.</p><p>Malwarebytes</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>A closer link at the link, however, shows that the site is <em>not</em> the genuine one. In fact, ķeepass[.]info —at least when it appears in the address bar—is just an encoded way of denoting xn--eepass-vbb[.]info, which it turns out, is pushing a malware family tracked as FakeBat. Combining the ad on Google with a website with an almost identical URL creates a near perfect storm of deception. </p>
<p>“Users are first deceived via the Google ad that looks entirely legitimate and then again via a lookalike domain,” Jérôme Segura, head of threat intelligence at security provider Malwarebytes, wrote in a <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/10/clever-malvertising-attack-uses-punycode-to-look-like-legitimate-website">post Wednesday</a> that revealed the scam. </p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Information available through Google’s Ad Transparency Center shows that the ads have been running since Saturday and last appeared on Wednesday. The ads were paid for by an outfit called Digital Eagle, which the transparency page says is an advertiser whose identity has been verified by Google.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keepass-digitaleagle.png" data-height="734" data-width="908" alt="Screenshot of Google Ad Transparency page displaying information for Digital Eagle, Inc."><img alt="Screenshot of Google Ad Transparency page displaying information for Digital Eagle, Inc." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keepass-digitaleagle-640x517.png" width="640" height="517" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keepass-digitaleagle.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keepass-digitaleagle.png" data-height="734" data-width="908">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Screenshot of Google Ad Transparency page displaying information for Digital Eagle, Inc.</p><p>Malwarebytes</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email, which was sent after hours. In the past, the company has said it promptly removes fraudulent ads as soon as possible after they’re reported.</p>
<p>The sleight of hand that allowed the imposter site xn--eepass-vbb[.]info to appear as ķeepass[.]info is an encoding scheme known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">punycode</a>. It allows unicode characters to be represented in standard ASCII text. Looking carefully, it’s easy to spot the small comma-like figure immediately below the k. When it appears in an address bar, the figure is equally easy to miss, especially when the URL is backed by a valid TLS certificate, as is the case here.</p>
<p>The use of punycode-enhanced malware scams has a long history. Two years ago, scammers used Google ads to drive people to a site that looked <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/with-help-from-google-impersonated-brave-com-website-pushes-malware/">almost identical</a> to brave.com, but was, in fact, another malicious website pushing a fake, malicious version of the browser. The punycode technique first came to widespread attention in 2017, when a Web application developer created a proof-of-concept site that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/chrome-firefox-and-opera-users-beware-this-isnt-the-apple-com-you-want/">masqueraded as apple.com</a>.
</p><p>There’s no sure-fire way to detect either malicious Google ads or punycode encoded URLs. Posting ķeepass[.]info into all five major browsers leads to the imposter site. When in doubt, people can open a new browser tab and manually type the URL, but that’s not always feasible when they’re long. Another option is to inspect the TLS certificate to make sure it belongs to the site displayed in the address bar.</p>

              <p>Bandcamp’s entire union bargaining team, the eight union members democratically elected by their peers to negotiate their first union contract, were laid off when Epic Games sold Bandcamp to music licensing company Songtradr on Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>Songtradr told 404 Media that it did not have any union membership information when it made its decision on which employees it would keep as part of the sale, but the union told me Songtradr invited them to a meeting with Songtradr’s CEO last week. 404 Media has viewed the invitation, which shows Bandcamp’s bargaining team were invited and that Songtradr’s CEO Paul Wiltshire planned to attend.</p><p>“Songtradr had no access to union membership information and we executed our employment offer process with full-consideration of all legal requirements,” Jalila Singerff, director of communications at Songtradr, told 404 Media in an email. “We carried out a comprehensive, full company evaluation that involved a detailed examination of each role. This evaluation considered several factors such as product groups, job functions, employee tenure, performance evaluations, the importance of roles for smooth business operations, and whether a similar function already existed at Songtradr including our experience of running it and associated requirements.”</p><p>Songtradr didn’t immediately respond to my question about inviting the union bargaining team to a meeting last week.&nbsp;</p><p>Epic Games, a fantastically wealthy company that owns the Unreal Engine, Epic Games Store, and in recent years has seen incredible profits thanks to the huge popularity of <em>Fortnite</em>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/arts/music/epic-games-bandcamp.html?ref=404media.co#:~:text=The%20world%20of%20independent%20music,online%20video%20games%20like%20Fortnite.">acquired Bandcamp</a> in 2022. At the time, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/bandcamp-joining-epic-games-to-support-fair-open-platforms-for-artists-and-fans?ref=404media.co">Epic said</a> that Bandcamp would “play an important role in Epic’s vision to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem for content, technology, games, art, music and more.” The union, Bandcamp United, won recognition in May 2023 through an election administered by the NLRB.</p><p>In September, a little more than a year after Epic acquired Bandcamp, Songtradr <a href="https://www.songtradr.com/blog/posts/songtradr-bandcamp-acquisition?ref=404media.co">announced</a>&nbsp; that it will acquire Bandcamp as Epic cut around 830 jobs across the company. Epic and Songtradr agreed to an “asset sale” of Bandcamp, meaning Songtradr is only buying parts of Bandcamp as opposed to the entire company. As part of this process, Epic has laid off about half of Bandcamp’s staff, the other half of the staff have accepted job offers to work on Bandcamp at Songtradr.</p><p>“On Monday, October 16, 2023 over half of Bandcamp was laid off as a result of Epic Games’ divestiture to Songtradr,” Bandcamp United said in a statement. “Of those laid off, 40 were in the union bargaining unit out of a total 67 members. None of the eight (8) democratically elected bargaining team members received a job offer.”</p><p>Bandcamp United said that the layoffs cut Bandcamp’s editorial team in half, with 12 out of 13 union-eligible support staff “made redundant.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Not all Bandcamp employees will receive offers from Songtradr,” Songtradr <a href="https://twitter.com/songtradr/status/1709986126117630051?s=20&amp;ref=404media.co">said</a> on October 5. “Bandcamp requires some adjustments to ensure a sustainable and healthy company that can serve its community of artists and fans long into the future.”</p><p>“It feels as though many of the aspects that make Bandcamp human—that make it a balm in an algorithm- and profit-driven music industry—have been gutted through these layoffs,” Atoosa Moinzadeh, a laid off member of Bandcamp’s editorial team, said in a statement.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how-it-works" dir="auto"><a href="#how-it-works">How it Works</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">LocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the <a href="https://github.com/localsend/protocol">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-getting-started" dir="auto"><a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">To start LocalSend from source code, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Install <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="nofollow">Flutter</a></li>
<li>Clone the LocalSend repository</li>
<li>Run <code>flutter pub get</code> to download dependencies</li>
<li>Run <code>dart run build_runner build -d</code> to generate code</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23922150/irs-direct-file-pilot-available-13-states-income-tax-2024">https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23922150/irs-direct-file-pilot-available-13-states-income-tax-2024</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37937894">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An Internal Revenue Service pilot might just eventually bring US citizens a free direct-file alternative to commercial options like TurboTax and H&amp;R Block. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-advances-innovative-direct-file-project-for-2024-tax-season-free-irs-run-pilot-option-projected-to-be-available-for-eligible-taxpayers-in-13-states">the agency announced</a> that 13 states are joining its pilot program for the 2024 filing season, four of which will also be able to integrate their state taxes into the pilot.</p><p>Since 2001, a partnership between companies like TurboTax maker Intuit and the IRS called the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/about-the-free-file-alliance">Free File Alliance</a> has given consumers a free alternative to paying for tax preparation. However, it turned out that when you try to get companies to offer an alternative to giving you money, they will <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines">do their best to hide that option</a>. When the IRS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/1/21045779/irs-turbotax-free-file-h-r-block-tax-preparation-new-rules">updated the agreement</a> to forbid companies from doing that — and give itself permission to create its own free file option — both <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/irss-free-file-partners-moving-forward-without-h-r-block">H&amp;R Block</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22581587/turbotax-parent-company-intuit-opts-out-irs-free-file-program">Intuit</a> left.</p><p>According to the IRS, these are the states joining the pilot:</p><div><ul><li><strong>States with state income tax: </strong>Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and New York</li><li><strong>States without state income tax: </strong>Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming</li></ul></div><p>The pilot doesn’t guarantee a nationwide rollout of the program. Danny Werfel, who heads the IRS, says this will test the government’s capacity to do this, adding that the Internal Revenue Service will work closely with participating states to gather the information it needs to see if the program works. </p><p>The IRS says its scope could change, but the pilot is starting small. Only some people can participate, depending on their income, tax credits, and deductions. For instance, if you’re filing a W-2 and have basic deductions like student loan interest or the standard deduction — the default one that everyone gets unless they need to deduct more — you can directly file. If you’re an independent contractor, though, it sounds like you may be stuck with your usual options.</p><p>Intuit seems to be worried. Shortly after this story was published, Rick Heineman, the company’s communications VP, emailed <em>The Verge</em> with an aggressive statement calling the IRS’s pilot “redundant” and “half-baked.” </p><p>“The Direct File scheme is a solution in search of a problem,” he wrote, adding that it could end up “costing billions of dollars in taxpayer money.”</p><p>Intuit, which profits from tax prep software, has lobbied against programs like this pilot <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4150900/intuit-lobbies-against-returns-free-tax-filing-system">for over a decade</a>. It’s insisted, then as now, that taxpayers already have free alternatives, but not everyone sees it that way. </p><div><p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23002219/ftc-turbo-tax-irs-free-tax-prep-software-intuit-misleading">Federal Trade Commission sued Intuit</a>, alleging false advertising around its “Free Edition” software, which the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/8/23864538/turbotax-intuit-ftc-deceptive-practices-free-tax-filing">FTC’s chief administration law judge ruled</a> was not truly free. As <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes"><em>ProPublica</em> noted in a 2019 report</a>, TurboTax customers are often told after entering their taxes that their tax situation doesn’t meet the free software’s criteria, and they must either pay for preparation or move on. Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23057463/intuit-141-million-agreement-new-york-attorney-general-turbotax-free">New York Attorney General Letitia James announced</a> that Intuit had agreed to pay out $141 million to customers in that state for similar reasons.</p></div><p>The IRS pilot, of course, also comes with limits. The agency says a “limited, controlled environment” is the “best way to test a new service offering” so that it can adjust the program before scaling it up later.</p><p><em><strong>Update October 18th, 2023, 2:07PM ET: </strong>Added a statement from Intuit, along with further context on TurboTax.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Since e-books first emerged as a way for readers to consume content digitally, publishers and authors have required content aggregators to apply Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to the e-books <img src="https://www.libraryjournal.com/binaries/content/gallery/Jlibrary/lj-sponsored-images/ebsco-logo-with-com.jpg/ebsco-logo-with-com.jpg/Jlibrary%3Atwofifty">they sell to libraries to prevent the unauthorized use, copying, and redistribution of these materials. While this practice has given publishers and authors peace of mind that sales won’t be lost to piracy or other unauthorized sharing, it has placed undue restrictions on readers who rely on institutional access to e-books.</p>

<p>For instance, DRM typically limits how much an e-book reader can print and how long they can check it out from the library. These limitations can make it difficult for students and academics to use e-books in their research. Some users might require more time with a particular resource, and yet this title might disappear from their device before they’ve had a chance to complete their work.</p>

<p>Even worse, DRM often limits the accessibility of materials for readers with disabilities. Downloaded content that is DRM-protected can only be opened with software that is compatible with the technology, such as Adobe DRM. This means that users can only read downloaded e-books in programs that support Adobe DRM, such as Adobe Digital Editions or Bluefire Reader.</p>

<p>When users have accessibility needs and use specific software to read e-books, these DRM-related limitations can have a big impact: forcing a user who reads with an assistive technology to use Adobe Digital Editions might mean they can’t read that book at all, if their screen reader or text-to-speech software isn’t compatible with Adobe Digital Editions. (Reading the title online is still possible, but for many users, this might not be a convenient option—and so they rely on the ability to download content.)</p>

<p>Although piracy is a serious issue for publishers, content aggregators have been arguing for years that offering DRM-free access to institutions would not add to the problem. “The malicious users aren’t logging into their library’s website to find DRM-free titles to pirate,” says Jon Elwell, director of content strategies for EBSCO. “They are just cracking the DRM.” Unfortunately, software that strips an e-book of its DRM protections is readily available online.</p>

<p>With this fact in mind, content aggregators have been working to convince publishers to let them sell DRM-free content to libraries—and these efforts are paying off. For example, EBSCO has been offering DRM-free content to libraries for more than a year, and the company now has more than 140,000 DRM-free titles available.</p>

<h3>Benefits of DRM-Free Content</h3>

<p>Why is this trend significant? With DRM-free e-books, library patrons have a much richer user experience. They are free to interact with the content just as they would with printed materials, yet with all of the benefits that a digital format enables—such as greater portability and accessibility.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.libraryjournal.com/binaries/content/gallery/Jlibrary/lj-sponsored-images/amanda-jones-1186891-unsplash.jpg/amanda-jones-1186891-unsplash.jpg/Jlibrary%3Athreehundred">“A DRM-free title is a digital book in its purest form,” Elwell observes. “If you want to chunk some sections up to share with a group you are working with, you can do it. If you want to download it so you can reference it later, you can do it. If you want to take notes and mark it up like a print book and have those notes to reference for the rest of your academic career, you can do it. You can even copy and paste sections to save yourself time. It allows the content to truly function as a digital title and to take advantage of everything that means.”</p>

<p>Not only does this remove barriers to research and scholarship, but DRM-free access also makes it easier for colleges and universities to offer e-books or e-book chapters for use by an entire class. “This marries well with course adoption,” Elwell notes.</p>

<p>A review of the usage data on DRM-free e-books suggests that users appreciate the flexibility this model provides. “We studied all of the content in the past year that was purchased and available in both 1-user and DRM-Free unlimited user models, and we found that DRM-Free content was getting significantly more use than the exact same titles in 1-user models,” Elwell says.</p>

<p>This increased usage benefits both libraries and publishers. “Usage is currency,” he explains. “If we know that we can enhance the value of an asset by ensuring that it’s used more frequently, that’s a good thing.”</p>

<h3>Key Considerations</h3>

<p>DRM-free content is relatively new at this scale, and publishers are still trying to figure out a pricing model that is sustainable for them. In turn, librarians are struggling to navigate this new landscape and come up with a purchasing model that makes the most sense for their institution.</p>

<p>While pricing for unlimited-user, DRM-free e-books is higher than the cost of traditional 1-user versions protected by DRM technology, DRM-free materials are also seeing more usage—and so the cost per use is ultimately lower. Even with all of the benefits afforded by DRM-free content, librarians might have to make tough choices about which titles to purchase in which formats.</p>

<p>Library purchasing agents should think carefully about what types of content they want to acquire DRM-free, based on how they expect readers will want to interact with these materials, Elwell advises. For example, a review of EBSCO data reveals that education and law are two subjects in particular where students prefer to download copies that remain on their devices, so they can continue to refer to these resources. If librarians are aware of this trend, they might consider buying DRM-free titles in these subject areas.</p>

<p>“Librarians can serve their patrons most effectively by investing strategically in DRM-free content and watching usage trends closely to make well-informed buying decisions,” Elwell concludes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To ensure digital sovereignty and democratise access to LLMs, SiloGen and TurkuNLP research group at the University of Turku launch a consortium with a key focus to develop the world’s largest open source language model, covering all official European languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to compute access totaling approximately 15 million GPU hours, the initiative is dedicated to ensure that data utilized in these models accurately represent European languages, also covering the English-speaking world. The initiative is conducted in close collaboration with key European institutions and agencies, and is committed to adhering to European regulations. Beyond Europe, the open source initiative will democratise access to LLMs and enable the development of use-case specific downstream applications.</p>

<p>The consortium, led by SiloGen and the TurkuNLP research group at the University of Turku, stands apart from many other initiatives in that it uniquely combines resources to build LLMs:</p>

<ul><li>World-class LLM team, including professors and leading scholars like <strong>Filip Ginter</strong>, <strong>Jussi Karlgren</strong>, <strong>Sampo Pyysalo</strong>, <strong>Magnus Sahlgren</strong>, <strong>Aarne Talman</strong> among others, as well as others involved out of Silo AI’s more than 150 PhDs and 300 AI experts,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Data resources covering all European languages and code, including <a href="https://hplt-project.org/">High-Performance Language Technology (HPLT) data</a>, and other collected and curated data, and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Access to compute, including software infrastructure to train LLMs and access to the<a href="https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/"> LUMI supercomputer </a>and other hardware and cloud services for LLM training.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to a world-class team, the consortium has access to, and experience with, the LUMI supercomputer, which as one of the European High-Performance Computing (EuroHPC) undertakings is the third largest supercomputer in the world and the largest in Europe. Having built LLMs on LUMI for more than a year, the team has developed a distinctive software layer for training LLMs effectively and efficiently on the AMD-based hardware. As part of the EU-funded HPLT project, the data for this initiative has been collected and curated since early 2022 to provide a representative basis for LLM development. Combining all of this with a total of 15 million GPU hours, Silo AI and TurkuNLP are uniquely positioned to train a family of language models, including the world's largest open LLM.</p>

<p><img alt="Sampo Pyysalo lähikuvassa." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2d0ab279-5ba5-494c-9bc6-3d56fa27050d" src="https://www.utu.fi/sites/default/files/inline-images/Sampo.Pyysalo-248.jpg" width="1000" height="740" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>University Research Fellow in data analysis Sampo Pyysalo is the principal investigator of the High Performance Language Technologies consortium at Turku.</em></p>

<p>“LLMs are rapidly reshaping how we access information and interact with technology. As their impact grows, it is increasingly important to assure that the models are developed in a transparent and reproducible manner and made openly available to ensure accountability and equal access to the technology. From a European perspective, it is also critical that models are designed from the outset to prioritize multilinguality and an equitable approach to all languages. The High Performance Language Technologies (HPLT) project is addressing these goals through the creation of open European data resources and language models and delighted to partner in this consortium with SiloGen and Silo AI, an industry leader with shared goals", says Sampo Pyysalo, University of Turku Research Fellow and HPLT principal investigator..</p>

<p><img alt="Peter Sarlin lähikuvassa." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0b39d04b-d7b0-40b5-8661-43ca59ded0e5" src="https://www.utu.fi/sites/default/files/inline-images/Peter%20Sarlin%2C%20CEO%20and%20Founder%20of%20Silo%20AI.jpg" width="1000" height="701" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>Peter Sarlin is the CEO and co-founder of Silo AI.</em></p>

<p>“We are honored to contribute to the development of open LLMs. The development of base models aligned with European values is imperative for our digital sovereignty. This initiative helps to ensure that underlying models are based on data and information representing the citizens and organisations of the region, and overall compliance with regulation, data privacy and other vital concerns. And eventually we need sovereignty on how downstream applications and value creation happen. This requires trusted and secure approaches to independent base models that enable fine-tuning for domain-specific needs. This way we can ensure digital sovereignty, while advancing technological development,” says <strong>Peter Sarlin</strong>, CEO and co-founder of Silo AI.</p>

<p>The TurkuNLP research group’s extensive experience in NLP and LLMs aligns with Silo AI’s and SiloGen’s commitment to contribute to world-class research on generative AI. The alignment, combined with the resources of the consortium, provides a robust foundation for redefining the boundaries of what is possible in the world of open source language models. Together with the LLM development platform, this opens a unique path for companies to create value using independent, trusted and secure base models with a possibility to finetune, instruct and control LLMs for domain-specific needs.</p>

<p><strong>TurkuNLP research group</strong><br><em>The TurkuNLP group of the University of Turku was founded in 2001 and has been carrying out research in natural language processing for over 20 years with a focus on machine learning applications to the automatic analysis and generation of text. TurkuNLP is the leading Finnish research group in large generative language models and one of the partners in the Horizon EU High Performance Language Technologies project, which is currently creating the next generation of European language models on the LUMI supercomputer.</em></p>

<p><strong>Silo AI&nbsp;</strong><br><em>Silo AI is one of Europe’s largest private AI labs – a trusted AI partner that brings competitive advantage to product R&amp;D. We build AI-driven solutions and products to enable smart devices, autonomous vehicles, industry 4.0, and smart cities. Silo AI provides its customers a unique access to world-class AI expertise, covering a team of more than 300 AI experts and more than 150 PhDs, as well as the Silo OS infrastructure to speed up AI development and deployment. Established in 2017, Silo AI is on a mission to build a European flagship AI company, with offices currently in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Canada.</em></p>

<p><strong>SiloGen</strong><br><em>SiloGen is a large-scale initiative with the aim of building generative AI technology for Europe’s digital sovereignty. It is gathering some of Europe’s leading generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) experts, as well as access to data sources, powerful computational resources and infrastructure to train, run and operate LLMs. SiloGen has been operational since late 2022 and is currently working on its technology at full speed with clients like Allianz, Sandvik and Tietoevry. Its core focus is to improve downstream and domain-specific applications and to ensure companies can utilize trustworthy models for private, confidential and proprietary data. As a trusted provider SiloGen offers base and specialized models as well as a development suite to ensure accurate, trustworthy and robust downstream applications</em>.&nbsp;<br>

<p>Apple has recently made bold <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=apple+carbon">claims</a> about respecting the environment across business decisions. ♻️ And it seems to be making strides in many areas, like using recycled materials in products and clean energy in many aspects of its operations. 🎉</p>



<p>That’s why a deviation from this posture at last month’s event stood out: Only iPhone 15 models benefit from a new feature that is designed to protect batteries, <em>despite the feature likely being possible on earlier models.</em> The new feature is: iPhone 15 (and 15 Pro) owners can limit their phones to not charge past 80%.<sup data-fn="05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38"><a href="#05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38" id="05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38-link">1</a></sup> That may not appeal to everyone, but doing so, according to Apple, reduces “the wear on your battery and improve[s] its lifespan by reducing the time your iPhone spends fully charged”. 🌎 👍</p>



<p>Wait, how can we assume that the feature is possible on earlier models? -&gt; Well, iPhones dating back at least to the iPhone 8 era <em>already</em> support a very similar “charge to 80%” option called Optimized Charging.<sup data-fn="a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160"><a href="#a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160" id="a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160-link">2</a></sup> The difference is that Optimized Charging operates by limiting your phone’s charging to 80% when your iPhone is normally idle (typically in the middle of the night).<sup data-fn="90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e"><a href="#90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e" id="90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e-link">3</a></sup> The <em>new</em> 80% charging feature (that’s limited to iPhone 15 models) doesn’t try to be as smart, and simply applies the limit all day long. (I asked Apple to comment on why this feature is not also available in previous models <sup data-fn="59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb"><a href="#59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb" id="59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb-link">4</a></sup> and will update this story if they respond.) Presumably there’s nothing preventing Apple from pushing a software update to enable this in older phones. </p>



<p>If batteries last longer that means less waste and healthier devices for those who want to make this trade off. This feature is driven by customer demand; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884725/apple-iphone-15-pro-optimized-charging-80-percent-how-it-works">there was even speculation</a> that it shipped as an “apparent response to the battery <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230812/p11#a230812p11">longevity complaints</a> that have proliferated around last year’s iPhone 14 models”. Comments across several articles <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/16n2m4t/comment/k1c2ybg/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">and</a> reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/16peac9/iphone_15_exclusive_feature/">threads</a> openly wonder why <em>only</em> iPhone 15 models get the feature. (After posting this article, I started listening to one of my favorite podcasts ATP, and John Siracusa also <a href="https://overcast.fm/+R7DVfvsX4/16:12">wondered out loud</a> why this is limited to iPhone 15 as well.) Meanwhile, Samsung phones’ similar Battery Protect feature works for models going back multiple years.<sup data-fn="9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5"><a href="#9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5" id="9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5-link">5</a></sup></p>



<p>It’s one thing when feature-gating is for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/07/13/iphone-ios-15-missing-features-old-phones/7948107002/">animated backgrounds in the Weather app</a> or features that are hardware constrained, but when it’s for something that can clearly reduce waste globally and protect customers’ devices, they should make an exception.</p>

<p>So for Earth’s-sake, please take the easy win and enable this for more phones, Apple.</p>







<p>There is very lively discussion on Reddit, where it’s trending at #1 both on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/17b7ua8/the_new_ios_option_to_charge_battery_to_up_to_an/">r/ios</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/17b8gu6/the_new_ios_option_to_charge_battery_to_up_to_an/">r/apple</a>. There are a bunch of worthy suggestions there on how to improve the feature even more, but one thing’s clear: iPhone users would love to see this come to more devices.</p>
