        <h2>OpenTF Announces Fork of Terraform</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Posted on: <time datetime="2023-08-25">August 25, 2023</time></p>
          <p> 
            Two weeks ago, HashiCorp announced they are changing the license to all their core products, including Terraform, to the Business Source License (BSL). In an attempt to keep Terraform open source, we published the <a href="https://opentf.org/">OpenTF manifesto</a>, and the community response was huge! Over 100 companies, 10 projects, and 400 individuals pledged their time and resources to keep Terraform open-source. The <a href="https://github.com/opentffoundation/manifesto">GitHub repository</a> for the manifesto already has over 2.5k stars, and the number is growing quickly!
          </p>
          <p>
            The manifesto outlined the intent of the OpenTF initiative in two steps — the first was to appeal to HashiCorp to return Terraform to the community and revert the license change they were making for this project. The second, in case the license was not reverted, was to fork the Terraform project as OpenTF.
          </p>
          <h4>The time is now!</h4>
          <p>
            Since no reversal has been done, and no intent to do one has been communicated, we’re proud to announce that <b>we have created a fork of Terraform called OpenTF</b>. Many engineers across a number of companies, sometimes even competing companies, have been working together over the last week to make this possible. It’s been an incredible experience, really!
          </p>
          <p>
            As outlined in our manifesto, we are keeping OpenTF:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Truly open source</b> - under a well-known and widely-accepted license that companies can trust, that won't suddenly change in the future
            </li>
            <li><b>Community-driven</b> - so that the community governs the project for the community, where pull requests are regularly reviewed and accepted on their merit and changes are proposed through a public RFC process
            </li>
            <li><b>Impartial</b> - so that valuable features and fixes are accepted based on their value to the community, regardless of their impact on any particular vendor
            </li>
            <li><b>Layered and modular</b> -  with a programmer-friendly project structure to encourage building on top, enabling a new vibrant ecosystem of tools and integrations</li>
            <li><b>Backwards-compatible</b> - so that the existing code can drive value for years to come</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Becoming part of a foundation</h4>
          <p>
            <b>We completed all documents required for OpenTF to become part of the Linux Foundation</b> with the end goal of having <b>OpenTF as part of Cloud Native Computing Foundation</b>. By making a foundation responsible for the project, we will ensure the tool stays truly open-source and vendor-neutral.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Terraform wasn’t open-source from the beginning, many of the tools that you are using right now for your Terraform workflows simply wouldn’t exist, thus, we believe the future for Terraform is OpenTF, developed fully in the open.
          </p>
          <h4>Roadmap</h4>
          
          <p>
            As previously outlined, we’ve been working on this fork for a number of days already, with over 10 engineers across multiple companies working on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>In short, here’s the current status</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Almost done with the repository-wide rename to OpenTF</li>
            <li>Selected initial steering committee members</li>
            <li>Performed initial adjustments and cleanup of community documents.</li>
            <li>Got CI/CD pipelines and multiple testing harnesses of end-to-end and snapshot tests to work and be green, to make sure that we stay backwards-compatible.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Expect the repository to be published very soon</b>, once we’re officially part of a foundation and have some basic community guardrails and processes in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>You might wonder why we already started work on this project so early?</b> It’s quite simple, really. If HashiCorp were to reverse their decision, worst case we’d just lose a week of work. But if, and that is what indeed happened, HashiCorp wasn’t to reverse their decision, we didn’t want to lose any time, so that <b>we could have a working OpenTF 1.6.0 release ready for you as soon as possible</b>. And that’s why we started work on this over a week ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the spirit of being as open as possible, <b>we’ve created a</b> <a href="https://github.com/opentffoundation/roadmap/milestones">public repository tracking our progress towards important milestones.</a> You can subscribe to the issues there to be notified as soon as the fork is public. If you have any questions, feel free to create additional issues on that repository - we’ll try to respond as quickly as possible.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>
          <b>When will I be able to see the fork?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re planning to publish the fork in the next 1-2 weeks. That doesn’t mean there will be a release by then, but the repository will be open. Releases (alpha and stable) should follow shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Will I be able to use OpenTF as a drop-in replacement for legacy Terraform?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Will OpenTF work with all the providers and modules Terraform works with?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What will be the first release of OpenTF?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first release will be 1.6.0-alpha, forked from the most recent commit that was still MPL-licensed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Who is maintaining OpenTF? Is there enough firepower behind the project?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, four companies pledged the equivalent of 14 full-time engineers (FTEs) to the OpenTF initiative. We expect this number to at least double in the following few weeks. To give you some perspective, Terraform was effectively maintained by about 5 FTEs from HashiCorp in the last 2 years. If you don’t believe us, look at their repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How can I contribute to OpenTF?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’d like to pledge resources as a company, please get in touch via email or PR on the manifesto repository. Otherwise, the best way to contribute right now is to spread the word! Once the repository is public and we have a contribution process in place, you’ll be able to do code contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Does OpenTF have a public roadmap? Can I affect it?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find current public roadmap on this <a href="https://github.com/opentffoundation/roadmap/milestones">GitHub repository</a>. We will put an RFC process in place for you to be able to contribute to the roadmap as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Will OpenTF be compatible with future Terraform releases?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenTF will be 100% interoperable with future Terraform releases until the community wishes otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Can OpenTF change its licensing model in the future?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once OpenTF becomes part of the foundation, it’s governed by the foundation and the project community. Its licensing model cannot change.

              <p>Instagram limited the reach of a <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-ads-illegal-content-drugs-guns-hackers/">404 Media investigation</a> into ads for drugs, guns, counterfeit money, hacked credit cards, and other illegal content on the platform within hours of us posting it. Instagram said it did this because the content, which was about Instagram’s content it failed to moderate on its own platform, didn’t follow its “<a href="https://help.instagram.com/313829416281232?ref=404media.co">Recommendation Guidelines</a>.” Later that evening, while that post was being throttled, I got an ad for “MDMA,” and Meta’s ad library is still full of illegal content that can be found within seconds.</p><p>This means Meta continues to take money from people blatantly advertising drugs on the platform while limiting the reach of reporting about that content moderation failure. Instagram's Recommendation Guidelines limit the reach of posts that "promotes the use of certain regulated products such as tobacco or vaping products, adult products and services, or pharmaceutical drugs."</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/Screenshot_20230823-170129--1--1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="2340" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/Screenshot_20230823-170129--1--1.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/Screenshot_20230823-170129--1--1.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/Screenshot_20230823-170129--1--1.png 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Meta reversed its decision <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwS47_OOeIg/?img_index=1&amp;ref=404media.co">on 404 Media’s post</a> after we appealed it and deleted the words “guns, meth, pills, and weapons” from our caption, which was describing the types of content that Instagram is taking money for and injecting into users’ feeds. </p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1232" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png 1600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w2400/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-24-at-8.41.35-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A screengrab of the post. We had to edit out the words "guns, meth, pills, and weapons" in order to comply with Instagram's rules.</figcaption></figure><p>As I reported earlier this week, most of these ads are for blatantly illegal products and services and link directly to Telegram accounts where drugs/guns/hacked accounts can be bought. A sampling of these ads can be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;q=%22t.me%22&amp;sort_data[direction]=desc&amp;sort_data[mode]=relevancy_monthly_grouped&amp;search_type=keyword_exact_phrase&amp;media_type=all">found in seconds by searching for “t.me” on Meta’s Ad Library</a>.</p><p>I have reported on content moderation for many years, and understand how difficult moderating content at scale can be. But the fact remains that the company has a massive, obvious problem with how it reviews and approves ads. An expert who studies content moderation told us that our investigation suggests Meta is not as sophisticated at reviewing and approving ads as it is at moderating normal posts on its platforms.</p><p>“You need to think about how much of an issue, historically, general content moderation has been,” Karan Lala of the Integrity Institute, made up of former integrity team workers at companies like Facebook told me. “The maturity of the different integrity teams is relevant to the kind of problems platforms have had in the past.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-25-at-7.29.56-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="864" height="1686" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-25-at-7.29.56-AM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-25-at-7.29.56-AM.png 864w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An ad we got hours after being throttled by Instagram.</figcaption></figure><p>In Meta’s case, its biggest ads-related issue has been with political ads. During the 2020 election campaign, it simply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/technology/facebooks-political-ads-block-election.html?ref=404media.co">banned all political ads</a> (months after the presidential election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/technology/facebook-ends-ban-on-political-advertising.html?ref=404media.co#:~:text=The%20social%20network%20had%20prohibited,been%20criticized%20for%20spreading%20misinformation.">it began allowing them again</a>).</p><p>“With ads, a lot of the issue has been regulatory: Election ads spreading misinformation,” Lala said. “Ads for spam, ads for low quality content. Moderation of that seems a little less developed. In theory, these integrity teams should be feeding into the same systems. Ads should theoretically be going through a review process … a lot of these things are something that just should be getting caught [at the review process.]”</p><p>Meta did not respond to a request for comment. At the time of this writing, there are thousands of ads on Instagram and Facebook that link to Telegram channels and groups. Many of the most recent ones are for groups selling acid, MDMA, and hacked credit cards.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>IBM has announced its latest <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTwZPWzPKAAxVhxgIHHerOCfwQFnoECB8QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fdownloads%2Fcas%2FWQX5N4RJ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0IJVJ4YHU88QUH0hX6To-R&amp;opi=89978449">TS1170</a> tape drive with 50TB cartridges, more than 2.5 times larger than LTO-9 cartridges.</p>



<p>IBM, which manufactures the LTO tape drives sold by itself, HPE, and Quantum, has its own proprietary tape formats used in its TS1100 series drives and Jx format media. The latest TS1170 drive supports 50TB JF media cartridges with 150TB compressed capacity through 3:1 compression. The prior <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2019/08/23/big-blue-developing-tape-drive-to-repel-quantum-computer-attacks/">TS1160</a>, announced in 2018, supported JE media with capacities of 20TB raw and 60TB compressed.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive.jpg" alt="IBM TS1170 tape drive" width="700" srcset="https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive.jpg 950w, https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive-300x150.jpg 300w, https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive-768x383.jpg 768w, https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive-696x347.jpg 696w, https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IBM-TS1170-tape-drive-842x420.jpg 842w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px"><figcaption>IBM TS1170 tape drive</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The TS1170 drive operates at 400MBps raw throughput and supports both 12gig SAS and 16gig FC connectivity. It is also recognized as LTFS-ready. However, JF media is not backwards-compatible with the earlier JE specification.</p>



<p>The new tape cartridge media, also called 3592 70F, uses <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/06/29/fujifilm-400tb-magnetic-tape-cartridge-future/">Strontium Ferrite</a> particle technology. Fujifilm has demonstrated a <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/16/ibm-and-fujifilm-580tb-tape-capacity-record/">580TB</a> raw capacity tape using Strontium Ferrite particles so there is a lot of runway for future capacity increases.</p>



<p>LTO-9 tapes hold 18TB raw and 45TB compressed, less than IBM’s JE format tapes. The <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/09/10/lto-changes-tape-roadmap-strategy-cuts-capacity-to-build-air-gapped-ransomware-defence-storage/">LTO tape roadmap</a> has a coming LTO-10 specification with 36TB raw/90TB compressed capacity. Where IBM uses a 3:1 compression ratio, the LTO group uses 2.5:1. An IBM TS4500 tape library, using the JF cartridges, will be able to hold the same amount of data as an LTO-9-based library but with more than three times fewer tapes thanks to IBM’s large capacity tape and greater compression. Even when LTO-10 tape technology arrives, the TS4500 will still have a better density in terms of TB per cartridge.</p>



<p>The LTO (Linear Tape-Open) organization was founded to provide an open industry standard format to replace various proprietary tape formats such as Quantum’s S-DLT and DLT. But since only IBM makes LTO tape drives and these drives use media from Sony and Fujifilm, IBM has a lock on the LTO tape format.</p>



<p>LTO group members HPE and Quantum are dependent upon IBM and can do nothing to get LTO tape cartridge capacity up to the IBM TS1170/JF level unless they develop their own drives. If they do this, they may have to lose some backwards-compatibility. With IBM’s dominant presence in the LTO space, competitors would need significant investment to establish a foothold.</p>

<h3>What is Factorio: Space Age?<author>kovarex</author></h3>

<p>
  <strong>Factorio: Space Age</strong> continues the player's journey after launching rockets into space. Discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms.
</p>

<p>
  Vanilla Factorio ends by launching the rocket into space, so I always expected it to be quite obvious what we are going to do next.
  Honestly the space platform related gameplay was actually planned a very long time ago, and we had shown a little bit in <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-74">FFF-74</a>.
  We had a similar kind of story with the Spidertron. Its concept was teased for the first time in <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-120">FFF-120</a>, just to be quietly abandoned and then revived 4 years later.
</p>

<p>
  But as you might or might not know, the name 'WUBE' is an abbreviation of Wszystko będzie, which means something like "Everything will be done eventually". We didn't abandon the plan, we just realized it would be way too ambitious to try to fit it into the 1.0 Factorio release, so it was eventually just postponed to the expansion. In retrospect, it was clearly a good idea.
</p>

<h4>The main structure</h4>
<p>
  Instead of sending one rocket to space, you have to send many, because you need to use them to transport materials to build big space platforms in orbit.
  The rocket is cheaper in Space Age to not make it drag forever, but you still are expected to build bigger in preparation of what is to come.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The space platforms are used on their own to generate space science, but mainly, they are eventually used to travel to different planets, and for automated interplanetary logistics.</li>
    <li>We decided to go with the approach of having a small number of predefined planets, which represent your progression through the game.</li>
    <li>The expansion contains 4 additional planets. Each of which has its own unique theme, resource, challenges and gameplay mechanics. Most of them also have different military targets.</li>
    <li>Every planet leads to production of specific science packs and its technologies.</li>
    <li>The order in which you exploit the planets is an impactful strategic choice.</li>
  </ul>


<p>
  <img width="258px" src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-373-technology-graph-smaller.png">
</p>

<h4>The rewards</h4>
<p>
  Since we have a lot of new challenges, we also had to balance the set of rewards you get for each stage of the game.
  We have a set of cool new things in the expansion, but the player is quite omnipotent at the end of the vanila playthrough so we had to make some tough decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Since the goal was to make the overall expansion experience as good as possible, we have rebalanced the tech tree. This means, that with Space Age enabled, some items that are available in vanilla are unlocked later on some planet. This specifically applies to artillery, cliff explosives (this is the masochist part of me speaking), Spidertron, best tier of modules, and some personal equipment upgrades.
</p>

<p>
  Based on testing, these changes made the choice of where and when to go even more meaningful.
  On the other hand, space will be available sooner and there will be some nice additions available directly on Nauvis (the vanilla planet).
</p>

<p>
  This implies that technically, you could just take your vanilla base, activate the expansion, and continue playing. But the best way to experience it will be to play with Space Age from start to finish.
</p>

<h4>Version 2.0 is not just about the expansion</h4>
<p>
  In the previous news about the expansion <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-367">FFF-367</a>, we declared that the content will be technically a mod taking advantage of the updated engine. What this means is that a lot of the improvements will be for all players, regardless of them having the expansion or not.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of things that will be in the 2.0 update are: the ability to control train systems better, better blueprint building, better flying robot behaviour and many more. It will all be covered in more details in future FFFs.
</p>

<h3>The good news and the bad news<author>kovarex</author></h3>

<p>
  Lets start with the (probably) bad news. Since we know where we are and what is the goal, we can start to approximate
  the date of releasing the expansion, which is planned to be about one year from now.
  It is still a long time, but at least it is getting more specific.
</p>

<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>
  In the previous post <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-367">FFF-367</a>, we declared a 7 step plan, where we were at step 4.
  Now we are at the end of step 5, and have started some things from step 6 already.
</p>

<p>
  It has been playable from start to finish for more than a year. This means that we have already made several improvement iterations based on the playthroughs behind us.
</p>

<p>
  We are doing 3 types of testing which were all very useful:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Just playing the game on our own and contemplating how it feels.</li>
    <li>Office LAN party, which is also a great way to test multiplayer.</li>
    <li>Individual testers. We had a few outside testers who played it from start to finish and gave us detailed feedback.</li>
  </ul>


<p>
  The feedback led us to make different kinds of changes, for example:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Two planets were way too repetitive and similar to Nauvis, and we had to do a complete overhaul to make them more different.</li>
    <li>The game was a little bit too slow and grindy, so we were speeding things up, which doesn't mean dumbing it down.
        The goal was to be able to finish it in non-speedrun mode in less than 80 hours for an experienced player.
        We were trying to keep the mechanics and just cut down on the recipe counts and costs.
    </li>
    <li>We improved many UIs related to the new (and sometimes old) parts of the game many times.</li>
  </ul><p>
  It was kind of annoying to redo so much, but based on the result and reactions, it was definitely worth it.
</p>

<p>
  This means, that we have something we are happy with, is pretty stable, and we don't expect any further brutal changes to come.
  We have a relatively stable list of tasks to be finished both for programmers and artists, which makes us confident that we can release a polished product in about a year.
</p>

<h4>The good news</h4>

<p>
  But then there is the (hopefully) good news! From now on, we are stopping the embargo on the expansion content, and <strong>we
  will be publishing Friday Facts every week</strong> about all the different aspects of the expansion until release!
</p>

<p>
  We will mostly show what we have done, or what we are working on. We are also looking forward to the feedback from the
  community which has proved useful so many times already. With the quantity of things we have, I'm confident that we
  won't run out of topics until the release.
</p>

<h3>
  There's a mod for that<author>Earendel</author>
</h3>

<p>
  A lot of people are going to make comparisons between the Space Age expansion and the <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration" target="_blank">Space Exploration</a> mod.
  I've worked on the game design for both: On Space Age I made the first space + planets prototype builds and plus I've been involved in most of the gameplay discussions since.
  On Space Exploration, well it's my mod, I made it.
</p>

<p>
  I think that makes me the most qualified to talk about how these two things are very different from the ground up.
  Sure there's some overlap in the broader topics: you go to space, you visit planets; but these similarities end up being fairly superficial when all of the decisions along the way are made with different design goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    Space Exploration is targeted at a small set of challenge-seekers, it's not for everyone by design. Space Age is targeted at all Factorio players with better approachability in mind.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Game Length:</strong>
    Space Exploration is a long-form adventure designed for players to gradually uncover many interconnected challenges over 150-500 hours (or more).
    Space Age challenges are more streamlined and self-contained for a faster pace of 60-100 hours (rough estimate).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Complexity:</strong>
    Space Exploration challenges ramp up to a very high difficulty towards the end.
    Some of the last challenges cannot be automated without a set of arithmetic combinators, so it is not expected that all players will be able to complete it.
    Space Age has a lot of different challenges but they never get too extreme and the usage of combinators is quite lightweight, so we expect that most players will be able to complete it.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Engine Support:</strong>
    There are so many things that Space Exploration just can't do because it's a mod.
    Space Age has very different capabilities because the game engine can be made to support it.
    Large parts of the expansion are focused on game mechanics that just aren't possible otherwise, so the gameplay will be unique and refreshing even if you're a Space Exploration veteran.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are many more differences that will become apparent when we look at individual features of the expansion in upcoming FFFs.
</p>

<p>
  As always, let us know what you think at the usual places. We look forward to seeing you all in the weeks to come :) .

By signing the pledge, the College Board promised not to “use  or disclose student information collected through an educational/school  service (whether personal information or otherwise) for behavioral  targeting of advertisements to students.”<br></p><p>Since  then, the College Board appears to have scrubbed references to the  Student Privacy Pledge from its website and is no longer listed as a  signatory. <br></p><p>The College Board Spokesperson said the company uses student data, with permission, to help students access and succeed in college. “Transparency is among our key data privacy principles,” the spokesperson said, providing a link to the company’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://privacy.collegeboard.org/.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://privacy.collegeboard.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a></span>.<br></p><p>If you want to attain <!-- -->higher education in the United States, the College Board is hard to avoid.

The College Board also runs standardized tests taken by children as young as kindergartners, and essentially writes the curriculum in some school districts. </p><p>The College Board, as powerful as <!-- -->a governmental institution in some regards, is a non-profit.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction:</h2>
<p dir="auto">Mental health issues are often misunderstood or not fully grasped by the general public. This lack of understanding can lead to fear, discomfort, and negative perceptions about mental health conditions. Media portrayals of mental health often perpetuate negative stereotypes, leading to misconceptions and fear. Overcoming mental health stigma requires a multi-faceted approach that involves education, raising awareness, promoting empathy and understanding, challenging stereotypes, and ensuring accessible and quality mental health care.
Mental health directly impacts an individual's overall well-being, quality of life, and ability to function effectively in daily life. Good mental health is essential for experiencing happiness, fulfilment, and a sense of purpose. Mental health and physical health are closely intertwined. Untreated mental health issues can lead to or worsen physical health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, weakened immune systems, and chronic conditions.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Core Rationale:</h2>
<div dir="auto"><p>Chatbots offer a readily available and accessible platform for individuals seeking support. They can be accessed anytime and anywhere, providing immediate assistance to those in need. Chatbots can offer empathetic and non-judgmental responses, providing emotional support to users. While they cannot replace human interaction entirely, they can be a helpful supplement, especially in moments of distress.</p><p>
NOTE: <em>It is important to note that while mental health chatbots can be helpful, they are not a replacement for professional mental health care. They can complement existing mental health services by providing additional support and resources.</em></p></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dataset:</h2>
<div dir="auto"><p>The dataset was curated from online FAQs related to mental health, popular healthcare blogs like WebMD, Mayo Clinic and Healthline, and other wiki articles related to mental health. The dataset was pre-processed in a conversational format such that both questions asked by the patient and responses given by the doctor are in the same text. The dataset for this mental health conversational AI can be found here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/heliosbrahma/mental_health_chatbot_dataset" rel="nofollow">heliosbrahma/mental_health_chatbot_dataset</a>.</p><p>
NOTE: <em>All questions and answers have been anonymized to remove any PII data and preprocessed to remove any unwanted characters.</em></p></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Model Finetuning:</h2>
<div dir="auto"><p>This is the major step in the entire project. I have used sharded Falcon-7B pre-trained model and finetuned it to using the QLoRA technique on my custom mental health dataset. The entire finetuning process took less than an hour and it was finetuned entirely on Nvidia A100 from Google Colab Pro. But, it could also be trained on free-tier GPU using Nvidia T4 provided by Colab. In that case, we have to ensure to use max_steps less than 150.
The rationale behind using sharded pre-trained model is mentioned in my blog post: <a href="https://medium.com/@iamarunbrahma/fine-tuning-of-falcon-7b-large-language-model-using-qlora-on-mental-health-dataset-aa290eb6ec85" rel="nofollow">Fine-tuning of Falcon-7B Large Language Model using QLoRA on Mental Health Dataset</a><br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2023-08-25</small>
        <p>Elixir is the thing I do most of my public writing and speaking about. It is my default programming language for the last 5-6 years. It suits my brain. Performs well for the kind of work I typically do. And using it I have experienced very few drawbacks. Rather than writing yet another post trying to widely summarize what I think is beneficial about the language I want to try and go a bit deeper on one particular aspect I like. Not incredibly technically deep, but unpack the concepts more thoroughly. I hope this will be a series of stand-alone posts. We will see. This time we unpack Elixir concurrency (and parallelism).</p>
<p>My origin story is steeped in PHP. In PHP the concurrency model is pretty much whatever your web server (mod_php) or app server (php-fpm?) decides it should be. PHP generally assumes a shared-nothing model and each request is clear of whatever work is done in the others. In this regard work can run concurrently but they can also not share anything without reaching for external files, databases, queues or similar.</p>
<p>Then I went to Python. Over in Python .. it depends. It is really bad at concurrency. Ordinary threading is available but enormously constrained by the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). The best solution seems to be just running more interpreters or using Python multiprocess which I believe forks new processes. I liked Python. I didn’t enjoy trying to do performant concurrency in Python though.</p>
<p>Elixir builds on Erlang. Fundamentally everything I’m writing about here is thanks to the Erlang virtual machine, aka. the BEAM, which has this stuff at its core. I will write in the context of Elixir. The things that are great here are also great about Erlang. Except possibly the Task module, which is kind of neat. That could also be done with Erlang but I don’t know if anyone has.</p>
<p>The BEAM is made to run a ton of lightweight processes. A type of green thread if you will. They take very little time to spawn, they take very little memory. A system can have millions of them. And if you need many millions of them you can bump the default limit. They are fundamentally a different thing from OS processes and threads. The BEAM itself is scheduled by the OS but on startup the BEAM creates threads for its schedulers. One per available CPU core by default. These in turn take care of scheduling processes. This is the source of concurrency and parallelism.</p>
<p>We won’t go into detail on the Actor model and how that works here but that is built on top of the fundamental primitive of a process. A process runs a function, the function only has access to its own local variables and private copies of whatever arguments were passed in. This is Functional Programming so everything is immutable. A process cannot change the values in another function. This function running in a process has two cool special bits of API it can use. It can receive messages and it can send messages. If the function runs to completion the Process goes bye-bye. If the process runs in an eternal loop checking for messages and only acts if a message comes in? Then we end up talking about the Actor model again which I said we won’t do. So lets move on.</p>
<p>A process runs on one of the schedulers. If many processes taking a long time creates a queue on one scheduler the other schedulers can start stealing work to balance it out. If a particular process goes through a lot of function calls (internally called reductions), say 4000 for example, without completing then the scheduler will pre-empt it. That means freeze it, mid-run, and send it back to the end of the work queue. This is called pre-emptive multitasking and it is what Linux does to the OS processes. In the BEAM nothing gets to hold up the line for very long. This is how it ensures low latency which is another topic I hope to unpack at a different time.</p>
<p>The immutable FP nature of Elixir and Erlang are pragmatic choices that were made to achieve a bunch of goals. It predates multi-core machines by a fair bit and they were targeting a different kind of concurrency, distributed systems made up of multiple machines, a cluster. The end result was accidentally convenient for achieving incredibly concurrency and parallelism on multi-core machines. Processes do not share state, they can only communicate asynchronously through message passing. This ensures it is safe to run them at the same time. Same time as in concurrent, executing the tasks during the same period of time. Also parallel, executing the tasks at the same time. All APIs that touch files or other constrained resources, stdin/stdout and such, have mechanisms for ensuring that contention is under control. The Erlang folks have spent a lot of time getting this right.</p>
<p>When I write my code I generally don’t need to care about this very much. Most web requests take place inside a single process. They might communicate on through to a database connection pool which involves more processes but overall I don’t need to care about the underlying primitives. I also don’t need to think about the Node.js way of racing to IO. Node.js can be highly concurrent. CPU-bound work is fine on the BEAM. It won’t disrupt the ability of other processes to get work done, both because multiple cores can do the work but also because if I spend many CPU cycles I will be pre-empted and other work can slip by. This is all handled by the web server I use, more than by me.</p>
<p>If I do want to do concurrent work there is the usual async/await mechanisms, implemented in the Task module. Not as weird as in JS. They just return a Task reference which is a helpful abstraction on top of the Process ID or PID. Then you can await on it to get a result or await on multiple to get multiple results. There is also a wicked function called Task.async_stream which will take an enumerable (list, map, stream or similar) and run a Task for each entry as a lazy stream. By default it has a concurrency matching the number of available cores (just like the schedulers). This is essentially a fancy shortcut for using all your machine has to offer in the service of getting the work done for tasks that are embarrassingly concurrent. It is very fun to use when bodging together scripts that you want to go fast.</p>
<p>Compared to PHP I have many more tools for interacting across the work that happens in my system. Process registries and groups, PubSub mechanisms for message passing, memory-based shared state accessed through safe mechanisms (ETS for example).</p>
<p>Compared to Python I can do multiple things at once in simple and useful ways. In a language that is as expressive and as dynamic (in the places I care about).</p>
<p>Compared to Javascript I can do multiple things at once easily without worrying about CPU-bound work holding up other requests and such. I get actual immutability instead of working really hard to pretend I do.</p>
<p>These comparisons are of course based on my understandings and experiences with the languages. I’ve stuck with languages I have some experience with but I don’t hang out with them on a regular basis currently. If I have misrepresented any of them, do let me know.</p>
<p>In summary; great options for concurrency and parallelism are not an afterthought in Elixir and Erlang. They are built into the very foundation of the runtime and the languages surface it to us. This matters for performance and practicality. Doing concurrency on the BEAM is not punishing, it is not risky. It is just what you end up doing by using it.</p>

<p>But this time I feel different. A tour at Onkalo, which lies 450m (1,480ft) below the ground, to see tunnels hewn in the living rock to store highly radioactive waste for 100,000 years, suddenly makes me nervous.</p>
</div></div><div><h3>Finland's plan to bury spent nuclear fuel for millennia</h3><div><p><em>Finland is on the verge of becoming the first nation to bury spent nuclear fuel rods deep underground for the long term. <br></em><em><br></em><em>Read about the science – and the controversies – behind the scheme in Erika Benke's accompanying <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230613-onkalo-has-finland-found-the-answer-to-spent-nuclear-fuel-waste-by-burying-it">in-depth article for BBC Future Planet.</a></em></p></div></div><div><p>I'm about to visit the world's first permanent storage site for spent nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>As I drive on a near-empty road in southwest Finland, I slow down trying to imagine what this picture-postcard Nordic countryside with huge pine trees would look like in 1,000 years. Or 10,000.</p>
<p>Will there be any people in the pretty houses dotted around Olkiluoto island? If so, will they speak Finnish? Will they use a language at all? And, most crucially, will they know about the potential danger lurking in the ground under their feet at Onkalo? <em>(Read more about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200731-how-to-build-a-nuclear-warning-for-10000-years-time">how to communicate a nuclear warning 10,000 years into the future</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Spent fuel rods from nuclear power stations are currently <a href="https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/PUB1963_web.pdf">kept in temporary storage facilities around the world. </a></p>
<p>Finland is the first country implementing what it hopes is a permanent solution. Starting in two or three years, highly <a href="https://www.tvo.fi/material/collections/20210504133144/7Q3CCzcNl/Safely_in_the_ancient_bedrock_-_final_disposal_of_nuclear_fuel_in_Finland_-_final.pdf">radioactive waste will be buried deep in the bedrock at Onkalo, </a>after being encased in cast-iron and copper cylinders and wrapped in bentonite clay.</p></div><div><p>Finland's solution to nuclear waste</p></div><div><p>I didn't feel remotely anxious when I spoke to people at Onkalo on the phone. But I feel apprehensive now. It helps that our hosts from Posiva, the company running the site, show us a safety video first. I watch it with fellow visitors, two German TV crews. </p>
<p>The video hits a tone of sensible down-to-earth pragmatism. Don't get separated from the group. In an emergency, follow your guide's instructions. It's an active construction site so watch out for vehicles and machines. If there's a fire, follow your guide to the nearest shelter. The video shows a group of people calmly walking into a fire-proof pod with its own oxygen supply. Once inside, their guide hands everybody a bottle of water. It all looks very organised. </p>
<p>"Have you ever been in an emergency down there?”, I ask one of our guides, Johanna Hansen, research and development coordinator at Posiva.</p>
<p>"Only one, but it was a false alarm," she replies with a smile.</p></div><div><p>Next we're asked to don our safety gear: a bright yellow high-visibility jacket, waterproof boots, a helmet with a visor and a belt with a torch. We're each handed a small pack containing an escape hood that will protect us from fire-related gases for 15 minutes. I'm relieved to hear that the helmets have a tracking device so people in the control room above the ground will always know where I am in the tunnels.</p>
<p>With that reassuring thought I walk through the turnstile at a security gate under the blazing midday sun and get into a car. Our guide drives into the service tunnel without hesitation. In a moment, everything turns very dark.</p>
<p>It takes 15 minutes to drive down to Onkalo's service station which lies 437m (1,430ft) below the ground. As the 4.5km-long (2.8 mile) tunnel begins to snake down, we see a standard traffic sign for a 20km/h (12mph) speed limit. There are also green signs on the tunnel wall at regular intervals indicating how far we are from the surface.</p></div><div id="future/article/20230824-the-descent-to-the-worlds-first-waste-nuclear-fuel-storage-site-p0g8jxsx"><picture><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0g8jxsx.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0g8jxsx.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0g8jxsx.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0g8jxsx.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0g8jxsx.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0g8jxsx.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="No nuclear waste is yet stored at Onkalo – but it is an active building site so required Erika to don safety equipment (Credit: Erika Benke)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0g8jxsx.jpg" alt="No nuclear waste is yet stored at Onkalo – but it is an active building site so required Erika to don safety equipment (Credit: Erika Benke)" id=""></picture><div><p>No nuclear waste is yet stored at Onkalo – but it is an active building site so required Erika to don safety equipment (Credit: Erika Benke)</p></div></div><div><p>It's a lot less scary than I thought it would be. I think what makes me relax is to see that we're not alone. The tunnel is narrow – it's for one vehicle – but when we pass a bay, we catch glimpses of trucks and cars. It's like driving in a busy construction site, just set in a cave.</p>
<p>We arrive at the service station surprisingly quickly: a spacious, well-lit chamber with crushed stone underfoot. There's a lot of heavy machinery and a row of large containers filled with construction materials. Two men standing on a cherry picker attached to harnesses are working on ventilation shafts in the ceiling. Two other workers are in conversation over containers surrounded by massive cables.</p>
<p>It feels oddly normal: people are going about their jobs as if they were in a factory above the ground. It's a pleasant 14C (57F) and the air is clean: a ventilation system has been installed and there's no smell of dust or moisture.</p>

<p>The water well drilling methods described here work well in digging/drilling through dirt, and clay, including really hard clay.&nbsp; They will not work if you need to drill through rock but, if the area you live in is flat or relatively flat, it is definitely worth a try.&nbsp; Many folks think they have to dig or drill their well into an aquifer.&nbsp; For irrigation and lawn watering, reaching an aquifer isn’t necessary.&nbsp; You only have to drill under the standing water level. It is very likely that you can drill your own well.&nbsp; Many successful wells have been drilled using this well drilling method.&nbsp; It is cheap.

<p>In these pages the “do it yourself water well drilling” technique is referred to as well drilling, but many call this technique “washing” or “jetting” a well.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is somewhat similar to the rotary bit method which most real water well drillers use for water bore drilling.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>The DIY technique involves water pumped down the center of a PVC schedule 40 pipe used as both a drill stem and a drill bit.&nbsp; At the bottom end of the PVC pipe a “drill bit” is fashioned by cutting teeth into the end of the PVC pipe.&nbsp; The pipe is rotated back and forth as the PVC pipe is slowly worked into the ground while the cuttings are brought to the surface by the upward flow of water in the annular space around the pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to dig your own well, try this technique.&nbsp;</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><!-- Ezoic - gen_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->



<p>Installing a well and a pump can save a lot of money, especially if you are now paying the local utility for irrigation water.&nbsp; You have probably noticed that just watering the lawn can get expensive.&nbsp; You can spend less money watering the lawn.&nbsp; Actually, you can spend almost no money watering the lawn.&nbsp; It is great for gardeners, too.<span data-ez-name="drillyourownwell_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>



<p>If you are a first time visitor to the site you will probably want to start out with either the “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/background/"><span>Background</span></a>” or the “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/basic-well-drilling-steps/"><span>Basic Well Drilling Steps</span></a>” pages.&nbsp; The bulk of the site is dedicated to drilling water wells using just two hoses for drilling fluid.&nbsp; Inexpensive PVC is used for the drill pipe, the drill bit, and the well screen.&nbsp; This DIY water well drilling technique is very cheap and many successful shallow wells have been installed using this technique.&nbsp;</p><p>When drilling a well by hand, it can be very helpful to at least be familiar with the techniques used by real well drillers – the kind with big powerful trucks and huge water tanks.&nbsp; What we do is extremely similar, almost identical.&nbsp; We can’t dig holes as wide or as deep but it is the same process.&nbsp; A local well drilling company was kind enough to let me video their process.&nbsp; Check it out at “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/real-well-drilling/">Real Well Drilling</a>.”</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_mid_content - mid_content --><!-- Ezoic - gen_mid_content - mid_content --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-640x360-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-640x360-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-426x240-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-426x240-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-384x216-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-384x216-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock -->



<p>There are several enhancements you can make to the basic DIY well drilling technique.&nbsp; To make the technique even more effective you can use the techniques described on the pages, “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/drilling-deeper-with-bentonite/">Drilling Deeper with BENTONITE</a>” and “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/drill-10-feet-deeper/">Drill 10 Feet Deeper</a>.”&nbsp; Additionally, converting to a metal drill bit will make your drilling more productive.&nbsp; These are all techniques that were sent in by users of the site and discovered as they drilled their wells.<span data-ez-name="drillyourownwell_com-box-4"></span></p>



<p>A gravel pack can increase a well’s production so there is a section on them.&nbsp; I don’t recommend you include a gravel pack on your first well but after you get the hang of the technique this is something you will probably want to check out the pages on <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/about-well-screens-and-gravel-packs/">gravel packs</a>.</p>



<p>Don’t go shopping for a pump without reading this page:  <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/which-pump/">Which Pump?</a>  You want a shallow well pump, also known as a suction pump.  Pool pumps and other types of transfer pumps will not work.</p>



<p>In the “Videos” section, you will find videos that show techniques used world wide.&nbsp; Some of these techniques, like the <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/the-baptist-method/">Baptist Method</a>, require very little drilling fluid and have been used for centuries.</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_long_content - long_content --><!-- Ezoic - gen_long_content - long_content --><p>We’ve been fortunate enough to receive some input from Bob Tabor, a real well driller who has been drilling wells all of his life.&nbsp; Please be sure and check out the page –&nbsp;<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/advice-from-a-real-well-driller/">“Advice from a REAL Well Driller.”</a></p>

<p>Somewhere, ol' Beelzebub is putting on his thickest coat because Apple has endorsed a right-to-repair bill, suggesting hell has frozen over. In a letter dated August 22, Apple showed its support for California's right-to-repair bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244">SB 244</a>, after spending years combatting DIY repair efforts.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/">TechCrunch</a>, the letter, written to California state Senator Susan Eggman, declared that Apple supports SB 244 and urged the legislature to pass it.</p>
<p>The bill requires vendors of consumer electronics and appliances to make sufficient documentation, parts, and tools for repairs available to customers and independent repair shops. The big exceptions are video game consoles and alarm systems.</p>
<p>The bill has been praised by right-to-repair activists like iFixit, who says the bill goes further than right-to-repair laws passed in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/minnesota-enacts-right-to-repair-law-that-covers-more-devices-than-any-other-state/">Minnesota</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/ny-passes-right-to-repair-will-require-tech-oems-to-share-tools-diagnostic-info/">New York</a>. Minnesota's law was considered the most all-encompassing right-to-repair legislation yet. Some activists, though, lamented that companies aren't required to sell parts and tools for devices not actively sold. California's bill, however, keeps vendors on the hook for three years after the last date of manufacture if the product is $50 to $99.99 and seven years if it's over $99.99.</p>
<p>The bill also allows a city, county, or state to bring a related case to superior court rather than only a state attorney general, as noted by iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california">blog post </a>Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Apple’s stipulations</h2>
<p>According to what appears to be a PDF of Apple's letter shared by sites including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843506/apple-california-right-to-repair-sb-244">The Verge</a>, Apple decided to support the SB 244 bill since it has requirements around "individual users’ safety and security, as well as product manufacturers’ intellectual property." It's signed by D. Michael Foulkes<strong>,</strong> director of state and local government affairs at Apple.</p>
<p>The letter notes that Apple was able to "engage" with the senators and staff on the bill.</p>
<p>It goes on to list the tech giant's conditions for continued support of the bill. Those conditions include that the bill not feature a requirement for manufacturers to enable repair providers to disable device security features.</p>
<p>Apple's letter also asked that the bill "focus on requiring manufacturers obligations to provide the documentation tools, and parts to enable the repairs performed by authorized repair channels, as opposed to a broader undefined scope of repairs." Apple also wants repair providers to mention when they're using "non-genuine or used" components.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The bill, as written, also requires non-authorized repairers to provide written notice of their lack of official vendor approval.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability at iFixit, told Ars Technica that while disclosing the use of third-party parts is reasonable, she's concerned that it "supports unnecessary fear-mongering around used and third-party parts."</p>
<p>"I also worry that lumping used and third-party parts together will contribute to further confusion. Apple's 'unable to verify' warnings already blur the line between those categories," she added.</p>
<p>California's final bill "should balance device integrity, usability, and physical safety" with the right to repair, Apple's letter reportedly says.</p>
<h2>Apple flip-flops</h2>
<p>Apple's letter is a reverse-course on the battle against right-to-repair efforts that it's been fighting for a decade, as noted via Repair.org Executive Director Gay Gordon-Byrne through a US PIRG press release Wednesday. That includes in California, where in 2019, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjvdb4/apple-is-telling-lawmakers-people-will-hurt-themselves-if-they-try-to-fix-iphones">Motherboard</a> reported that an Apple representative met with legislators, encouraging them to kill a right-to-repair bill over alleged consumer safety concerns. That bill was pulled soon after.</p>
<p>In 2017, then-Nebraska state Senator Lydia Brasch was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pgxgpg/apple-tells-lawmaker-that-right-to-repair-iphones-will-turn-nebraska-into-a-mecca-for-hackers">quoted</a> as saying an Apple representative told her that if Nebraska passed its right-to-repair bill, it would be the only state to do such a thing and become a "mecca" for hackers. In 2016, there were concerns of anti-repair behavior via "<a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/411395/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ios-crippling-error-53/">Error 53</a>," which could befall iOS devices that underwent an unauthorized repair.</p>
<p>Despite its past, Apple is sharing support for a California right-to-repair bill that it, apparently, deems fit. Ironically, Apple's letter attempts to frame itself as a bit of a right-to-repair leader, pointing to its Authorized Repair Provider Program launched in 2016, the Independent Repair Provider Program it debuted in 2019, and its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/apple-will-soon-send-parts-and-tools-to-users-who-want-to-repair-their-phones/">Self-Service Repair Program</a> introduced in 2022. The latter, however, is far from covering all of the consumer electronics Apple makes and has its own <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/macbook-self-repair-program-highlights-apples-flawed-repairability-progress/">criticisms</a>.</p>
<p>As noted by TechCrunch, this week it's rare to see a vendor speak out on the right to repair rather than speaking through an industry group. No other big name in tech has shared public support for SB 244.</p>
<p>So why now?</p>
<p>Nathan Proctor, senior director of US Public Interest Research Group's (PIRG's) Right to Repair Campaign, wagered a guess to Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>My best guess is that it's because we were able to pass a bill in Minnesota, and it has become clear that we have the ability to pass these bills. At that point, you can either try to have some input, maybe get some good PR while you are at it ... because you can't stop us. We are glad that the company has decided to do the right thing, whatever the reason.</p></blockquote>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  This book gives a thorough introduction to topological data analysis (TDA),
the application of algebraic topology to data science. Algebraic topology is
traditionally a very specialized field of math, and most mathematicians have
never been exposed to it, let alone data scientists, computer scientists, and
analysts. I have three goals in writing this book. The first is to bring people
up to speed who are missing a lot of the necessary background. I will describe
the topics in point-set topology, abstract algebra, and homology theory needed
for a good understanding of TDA. The second is to explain TDA and some current
applications and techniques. Finally, I would like to answer some questions
about more advanced topics such as cohomology, homotopy, obstruction theory,
and Steenrod squares, and what they can tell us about data. It is hoped that
readers will acquire the tools to start to think about these topics and where
they might fit in.

Now to find the workers" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p>The next step is less certain. America is building factories, but can it find the workers to operate them? With the jobless rate near a five-decade low, firms are already struggling to find staff. As scores of new factories are built, the gaps will grow.</p><p>Semiconductors are the most important test case for America’s manufacturing revival. Over the past couple of decades makers of computer chips have largely left America. The country still has world-class semiconductor researchers and designers, but has been denuded of a workforce that turns silicon wafers into electronic circuits at scale. Hoping to reverse that tide, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/07/how-real-is-americas-chipmaking-renaissance" data-tegid="brff2rkrgi069ogkulbpmfvc7ji6891v"><small>CHIPS</small> Act</a> passed last year will see the government dole out $50bn over the next half-decade.</p><p>A baseline estimate from the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade body, is that by 2030 America’s chip sector will face a shortage of 67,000 technicians, computer scientists and engineers, and about 1.4m such workers throughout the wider economy. Set this against the total of roughly 70,000 students who complete undergraduate degrees in engineering in America each year, and the scale of the deficit becomes apparent. Whatever the precise gap, it marks the difference between foundries running at full capacity with labour bills under control, or ending up mired in high costs and low productivity.</p><p>One of the sites at the centre of America’s ambitions offers an early glimpse of the problem. The Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (<small>TSMC</small>), the world’s largest maker of chips, plans to invest $40bn in two factories in Phoenix, Arizona, greatly boosting America’s ability to craft large volumes of ultra-small semiconductors. If it is successful, it will suggest that America can reclaim a position at the cutting-edge of chip production.</p><p>The first of <small>TSMC‘s </small>factories was due to start production next year. But in July it announced that the launch would be put back to 2025 because it could not find enough workers with the expertise to install equipment at such a high-tech facility. Mark Liu, <small>TSMC</small>’s chairman, said the firm would send technicians from its home base in Taiwan to train its American staff.</p><p>“My nightmare is investing in all of this infrastructure and then not being able to build the workforce,” says Shari Liss of <small>SEMI </small>Foundation, a microelectronics lobbying group. The fact that many share her worry is at least a useful spur. A report in January from the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, said America needed a “surge of national, state and local actions” to provide enough workers for the chips sector. The outlines of that are taking shape.</p><p>The most immediate hole, as illustrated by <small>TSMC</small>’s troubles, is in the construction industry. The Commerce Department reckons that about 100,000 builders may be needed for the first phase of investments in semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs. The government cannot conjure such a labour force out of thin air. But it has made its subsidies contingent on companies explaining the steps they will take to recruit and train construction workers.</p><p>An official in the Commerce Department says the government wants companies to collaborate on building up a construction workforce. “Workers that are trained for one project will then be beneficial for other fabs that get built,” the official says. In this respect <small>TSMC</small>’s plan to import Taiwanese trainers is less a bug than a feature, helping to transmit knowledge.</p><p>Once the fabs are built, they will need technicians to operate them. Such workers, responsible for tasks like inspecting tools and products, have historically required two years of training at a community college or a vocational school. But companies and educators have started experimenting with much shorter courses.</p><p>Most eye-catching are quick-start programmes that promise to churn out technicians in just ten days, offered by Maricopa Corporate College in Arizona and Portland Community College in Oregon. The Portland college, supported by Intel, an American chipmaker, offers students stipends of $500 a week, and the one in Arizona guarantees its students interviews with <small>TSMC</small>. Still, no company is about to put candidates with just ten days of training anywhere near the multi-million-dollar machinery inside their fabs.</p><p>The more realistic goal is to whet people’s appetites for a career in semiconductors. “Our intent is to reach out to people who may think they lack the skills for this type of job,” says Gabriela Cruz Thompson of Intel. She notes that the firm has been more successful at recruiting women and minorities to the quick-start programmes than to traditional two-year courses. </p><p>There may soon be more in-between options. This autumn Columbus State Community College in Ohio, where Intel is building two fabs, will offer a first-of-its-kind one-year programme. The aim is for students to “finish job-ready” for Intel.</p><p>The next rung up the work ladder in fabs are the engineers who run them. Universities near some of the plants under construction, including Arizona State and Ohio State, have expanded their offerings of semiconductor courses as part of degrees in engineering and physical sciences. Leading the charge is Purdue University in Indiana: last year it launched a semiconductor degree programme for both undergraduates and graduates.</p><p>The aim of Purdue’s “lab-to-fab” model is to collaborate more closely with companies. As part of a $49m upgrade of its “cleanroom” facility, it gives students access to the sorts of conditions and materials they would encounter in commercial enterprises, along with testing their mettle in the head-to-toe bunny suits they must wear to keep chips free of contamination.</p><p>This summer Purdue introduced an eight-week course that included a $10,000 stipend for students, funded by companies that hope to attract would-be workers before they are seduced by Silicon Valley. And in an industrial park at the south-west edge of campus, SkyWater, an American chip foundry, will build a $2bn fab. “Students will be able to wake up in their dorm, turn right and go to their classes, and then turn left and do an internship,” says Mung Chiang, president of Purdue. </p><h2>Fab opportunities</h2><p>Ms Cruz Thompson says that Intel expected 100 or so people to register for quick-start courses. But about 900 did. At Purdue enrolment has also been very strong. In May Handshake, a job platform for recent graduates, reported that applications for full-time jobs at semiconductor companies were up by 79% compared with last year, versus 19% in other sectors. “Students…realise that chips are the new oil,” says Vijay Raghunathan, Purdue’s director of semiconductor education.</p><p>Unfortunately, America is limiting its access to one obvious source of talent. Immigrants account for about 40% of highly skilled workers in America’s semiconductor industry. They are funnelled through a couple of visa programmes, with strict caps. Those caps are fixed, meaning that as the industry expands they will become more restrictive. Politicians on the right, including Donald Trump, have floated eliminating the visa openings altogether.</p><p>America’s chip firms are already configured for a small but skilled workforce. As they outsourced manufacturing abroad they grew more specialised at home, putting America at the commanding heights of the global industry. Qualcomm, Nvidia and others became world leaders in developing and designing advanced chips. It was a highly profitable division of labour.</p><p>Now America is trying to retake a foothold in the industry’s lower tiers, relearning basic skills such as cutting wafers into chips and packaging them in hard plastic casing. The political imperative is to guard against excessive reliance on China. For companies there is also a logic in diversifying supply chains and bringing manufacturing closer to research operations.</p><p>The welcome news for those wanting to bring about this shift is that colleges and universities are tilting in their direction. But it remains a gargantuan gamble: not so much on the future as on bringing America back to a manufacturing past that it once made commercial sense to leave behind. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div><p>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "Chipping in"</p><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Kicking up a storm: Saudi Arabia upends global sports" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1684" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/16/21/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/32/42/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/48/63/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/64/84/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/96/126/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/128/168/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/336/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/473/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/505/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/631/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/1097/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/1263/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/1441/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20230812_DE_EU.jpg"></figure></div><div orientation="vertical"><h3 orientation="vertical">From the August 12th 2023 edition</h3><p orientation="vertical">Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-08-12" data-analytics="sidebar:weekly_edition"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M12 1c6.075 0 11 4.925 11 11s-4.925 11-11 11S1 18.075 1 12 5.925 1 12 1zm.142 4.5l-1.008 1.062c3.33 3.276 4.194 4.14 4.608 4.5-1.602-.018-3.168-.018-10.242-.018v1.584c7.074 0 8.73 0 10.242-.018-.432.36-1.314 1.206-4.608 4.536l1.008 1.044 6.354-6.354L12.142 5.5z" fill="#2E45B8" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></g></svg><span>Explore the edition</span></a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

Améliorer l'article sur sympy jacobian pour parler du fait que scipy fait l'estimation de la dérivée alors qu'on peut des fois la calculer sans problème avec sympy.

Au delà des réseaux de neurones, beaucoup d'algorithmes d'optimisation demande le calcul du gradient, c'est à dire du vecteur qui va contenir toutes les dérivées partielles. La fonction `scipy.optimize.optimize` de la bibliothèque Numpy/Scipy va estimer le gradient en un point $x$ avec la formule suivante :   
$$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} $$  
On peut obtenir un résultat numérique de la dérivée de $f$ au point $x$, mais ce sera une approximation, et il faudra appeler deux fois la fonction $f$, ce qui peut être coûteux. -->

<p>---&gt; <a href="https://vmartin.fr/comprendre-la-differenciation-automatique-en-30-lignes-de-python-fr.html">French version of this article</a></p>
<p>I'm a Machine Learning engineer and I use libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch in my work to train my neural networks. And it's been a while since I wanted to write the simplest piece of code to perform what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation</a> which is at the heart of neural network training.<br>
In this article, I will try to iteratively build the simplest code to calculate derivatives automatically on scalars.</p>
<p>In the following Python code, the sum between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will be performed and the result (<code>8</code>) will be assigned to the variable <code>z</code>. After the assignment, the <code>z</code> variable keeps no track of the variables used, so there is no way to automatically update the value of <code>z</code> if the value of <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> changes. Even less possible to understand the link between each variable to calculate a derivative automatically.</p>



<h2>The <code>Tensor</code> class</h2>
<p>The idea is to create a new type, a <code>Tensor</code>, which will allow us to do <strong>symbolic calculation</strong> on our variables.<br>
Let's start by creating a <code>Tensor</code> class where the addition operation is redefined.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>

<p>In this example, we create a <code>Tensor</code> class that can store a value, and we redefine addition to create a new <code>Tensor</code> when we perform an addition between two <code>Tensors</code>. There is no symbolic computation mechanism yet that will allow <code>z</code> to have a trace that it is the result of the addition between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.<br>
We will add this behavior by using <strong>a binary tree</strong>. Each tensor will be able to contain the other two tensors and the operation that produced it. To do this, we introduce the Children tuple which will contain these three pieces of information.</p>

<p>Now a tensor, in addition to containing a numerical value, will contain the tuple <code>children</code> allowing it to keep track of the calculation. In this example, in addition to introducing the <code>Children</code> type, we have added the multiplication method to tensors. The <code>forward</code> method to the <code>Tensor</code> class has also been added to be able to <strong>execute the computation graph</strong> and compute the actual value of the tensors. The tensor <code>z2</code> can be modeled by the following computation graph.</p>
<!-- ![Pelican](imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyzz1.png =100x20) -->

<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyz1z2.png" alt="Computation graph of the tensor z2" width="300"></p>
<p>We can check that it works as expected by first creating the graph without specifying any values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>z1</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span>
<span>z2</span> <span>=</span> <span>z1</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z2</span><span>)</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:None T:None</span>
<span># T:None</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Then the values of the leaves of the tree (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) can be changed and the value of <code>z2</code> calculated. The call to <code>z2.forward()</code> will cause the <code>forward</code> method of <code>z</code> and <code>y</code> to be called, and these calls will browse the graph to recursively calculate the value of <code>z2</code>.  </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>y</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z2</span><span>.</span><span>forward</span><span>())</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:40</span>
</code></pre></div>



<h2>Adding Automatic Differenciation</h2>
<p>To add automatic differentiation to an arbitrary computation graph, we simply add the derivative for the basic operations supported by our <code>Tensor</code> class. Recursive calls to the <code>grad</code> function will traverse the computation graph and decompose a complex function to be derived into a combination of simple functions.</p>

<p>We can now derive <code>z2</code> as a function of the variable of our choice:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>z2</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:3 T:5</span>
<span># T:13</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Here, <code>g</code> is not just a value, <strong>it is a new computational graph</strong> that represents the partial derivative of <code>z2</code> as a function of <code>y</code>. Since the value of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> was defined when <code>grad</code> was called, the value of <code>g</code> could be calculated. The calculation graph of <code>g</code> can be represented by this diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyz1z2_grad.png" alt="Computation graph of the partial derivative of z2 in function of y" width="300"></p>
<p>Literally $g = \frac{\partial z_2}{\partial y} = x + 2*y$, and when <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are 3 and 5 respectively, then <code>g</code> is 13.</p>
<h3>Enabling the <code>Tensor</code> class to handle more complex formulas</h3>
<p>To be able to use more complex formulas, we will add more operations to the <code>Tensor</code> class. We add subtraction, division, exponential and negation (<code>-x</code>).<br>

<p>For each operation added to the <code>Tensor</code> class, the corresponding derivative has been included in the <code>grad</code> method. Also, we have modified <code>forward</code> to handle more cases, especially to handle operations that require only one term like exponential or negation.    </p>
<p>Now let's create a more complex formula and derive it!<br>
Let's try to derive $z$ :</p>
<p>$$z = \frac{12 - (x * e^{y})}{45 + x * y * e^{-x}}$$
<!-- $$z = (12 - (x * exp(y))) / (45 + x * y * exp(-x) )$$ --></p>
<p>We just have to write this equation using our <code>Tensor</code> class:  </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>12</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>()))</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span><span>x</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This will generate for the tensor <code>z</code>, the following computation graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe.png" alt="Computation graph of z" width="300"></p>
<p>We can now easily calculate the partial derivative of <code>z</code> as a function of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with the following code: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span> <span># T:-3.34729777301069</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>))</span> <span># T:-9.70176956641438</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This will generate the following two graphs:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe_grad_x.png" alt="Computation graph of derivative of z in function of x"><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe_grad_y.png" alt="Computation graph of derivative of z in function of y"></p>
<p>Finally, to check that our automatic derivation system works, we can compare the numerical calculation of our derivatives with the calculation done by the Sympy library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>sympy</span> <span>as</span> <span>sym</span>

<span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>'xs'</span><span>)</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>evalf</span><span>(</span><span>subs</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>}))</span> <span># -3.34729777301069</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>evalf</span><span>(</span><span>subs</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>}))</span> <span># -9.70176956641438</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>The result obtained with the Sympy library is strictly the same as with our <code>Tensor</code> class !</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements &amp; Optimizations</h2>
<p>We have just created the simplest automatic differentiation system that exists, and probably also the slowest. We can add more complex operations if we want, as long as we know how to derive them. As it is, this class can only handle scalars; for such a library to be most useful, one would have to add <strong>operations on arrays</strong> of arbitrary sizes. <br>
<!-- Un grand atout des bibliothèques de différenciation automatique telles que <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a> ou <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch">PyTorch</a>  -->
Also, looking at the graphs, we can see that some optimizations are possible:
</p><ul>
<li>If we are in a multiplication node and one of the two <code>children</code> is 0, we <strong>should not explore further</strong>. Because we know that whatever is multiplied by 0, will always be 0.   </li>
<li>When traversing the tree to perform a derivative with respect to a tensor <code>x</code>, if we are in a node that does not depend on <code>x</code> and whose children do not depend on <code>x</code>, we could stop the traversal at this step and <strong>consider the current node as a constant</strong>. This type of optimization could greatly improve the computational speed for graphs with many nodes and different variables.  </li>
<li>By looking at the graph we can see that some operations are repeated. We can imagine <strong>to set up a cache</strong> to avoid repeating the computations several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this article has helped you understand how automatic differentiation is performed for neural network optimization and learning.<br>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It has been five months since my <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/03/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-march-2023.html">last
general
update</a>
on the Rust compiler’s performance. Let’s see what has happened in that time.</p>

<h2 id="big-wins">Big wins</h2>

<p>Let’s start with some big improvements. The information about metrics at the
top of <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2022/10/27/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-october-2022.html">this
post</a>
still applies.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107925">#107925</a>: Incremental
compilation uses a hashing algorithm to detect when code fragments have changed
and need recompilation. In this PR, <a href="https://github.com/thomcc">@thomcc</a>
changed the algorithm from SipHash-2-4 to SipHash-1-3, which is faster and
lower quality, but still good enough for the purposes of incremental
compilation. (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash">Wikipedia page</a> says
“The recommended parameters are SipHash-2-4 for best performance, and
SipHash-4-8 for conservative security. A few languages use Siphash-1-3 for
performance at the risk of yet-unknown DoS attacks.” Incremental compilation
seems like an unlikely target for such attacks.) This gave a mean wall-time
reduction of 1.63% across all benchmark results, with the improvements mostly
coming in incremental builds.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109474">#109474</a>: In this PR,
<a href="https://github.com/nikic">@nikic</a> upgraded the LLVM version used by the
compiler to LLVM 16. This gave a mean wall-time reduction of 1.19% across all
benchmark results. It’s unclear how much of the improvement is because LLVM
itself is faster (which would make rustc’s back-end faster) and how much is
because LLVM is producing higher quality code (which would make all of rustc
faster). Either way, it’s great work by the LLVM developers!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113734">#113734</a>: In this PR,
<a href="https://github.com/cjgillot">@cjgillot</a> tweaked how some lints are run. This
gave a mean wall-time reduction of 1.05% across all benchmark results, with
the improvements mostly coming in incremental builds.</p>

<p>Any change that results in a 1% across-the-board win is a big improvement, so
it’s great to see three of them. (I pay close attention but it’s possible that
I have overlooked other big improvements.)</p>

<h2 id="codegen-units">Codegen units</h2>

<p>I spent a lot of time trying to improve the parallelization done by the Rust
compiler’s back-end, without much success. A lot of the work related to how the
compiler breaks code into chunks for parallel processing, and how it must
predict how long these chunks will take to compile. I did get two wins of note.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112448/">#112448</a>: In this PR I
introduced a minimum CGU size in non-incremental builds. This reduced peak
memory usage across several benchmarks by up to 19%, with most of the
improvements in the 2-9% range. It also reduced binary sizes by 48% in one
extreme example, and up to 8% across numerous other benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113777">#113777</a>: In this PR I adjusted
the CGU merging algorithm to minimize the duplication of inlined functions,
giving icount, peak memory, and binary size wins of a few percent on several
benchmarks.</p>

<p>I wrote in more detail about my efforts in a <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/07/11/back-end-parallelism-in-the-rust-compiler.html">blog
post</a>
in July. In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/14wcezs/backend_parallelism_in_the_rust_compiler/">Reddit
discussion</a>
several people suggested data analysis to improve the estimates. So I collected
data, put it in <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/07/25/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-data-analysis-assistance-requested.html">another blog
post</a>,
and requested assistance because I am no data scientist. I got some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/158tcel/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/">excellent
responses</a>,
many of which suggested that larger data sets would be helpful. I then
published a <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/08/01/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-data-analysis-update.html">follow-up blog
post</a>
with larger data sets, and received some more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/15f3cob/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/">good
responses</a>.
For people interested in compilers and data science there will be plenty of
interesting reading there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to improve the compiler further, despite trying a
number of different estimation functions from the analyses. Normally when you
implement a parallel algorithm, the exact way you divide the problem into
pieces doesn’t affect the answer. But that isn’t true for codegen unit
formation! The functionality of the generated code doesn’t change, but the
quality of that code (and its size) can very much change. This makes it really
challenging to improve, because there are multiple metrics in conflict. Almost
any change that improves one metric regresses another. It’s quite possible that
there are potential improvements remaining, but I don’t know how to attain
them, and I’m not planning on working on this area any further.</p>

<h2 id="other-presentations">Other presentations</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Kobzol">Jakub Beránek</a> has been extremely productive
recently, and published multiple interesting blog posts describing his work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One about his <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/07/30/optimizing-rust-ci-2023.html">improvements to the CI used for
rustc</a>,
some of which sped up the compiler.</li>
  <li>One about <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/08/18/rustc-benchmark-suite.html">the rustc-perf benchmark
suite</a>
that we use to measure the compiler’s performance.</li>
  <li>One about
<a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/cargo/2023/08/12/rust-llvm-optimization-remarks.html">cargo-remark</a>,
an experimental tool to help you understand how your Rust code is being
optimized by LLVM.</li>
  <li>One about
<a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/cargo/2023/07/28/rust-cargo-pgo.html">cargo-pgo</a>,
which makes it easier to use PGO and BOLT to speed up your Rust programs.</li>
</ul>

<p>He also got a new <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector/runtime-benchmarks">runtime benchmarking
suite</a>
up and running within rustc-perf, to complement the existing compile-time
benchmarking suite. This is a long-desired feature that is now running on
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=03a119b0b0e310d22d94399b24ed030056050f13&amp;end=443c3161dd04f4c1b656a626f9079921bee9c326&amp;stat=instructions%3Au&amp;tab=runtime">every merge</a>.
It’s still experimental and the benchmarks could be improved, but it’s a huge
step towards reliable detection of changes to codegen quality. I believe Jakub
will write a new blog post about this soon.</p>

<p>Finally, I gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2vJ8Faundw">a short talk</a> at
<a href="https://2023.rustnl.org/">RustNL 2023</a> about parallelism in the compiler. It’s
a nice overview, but please note that my estimate of “next month” for the
parallel front-end was too optimistic. I have learned my lesson, and I won’t
give a new prediction for when that feature will ship.</p>

<h2 id="my-improvements">My improvements</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110527">#110527</a>: In this PR I avoided
constructing a data structure when it wasn’t necessary, for a few sub-1% icount
wins.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111088">#111088</a>: The compiler has a
<code>FileEncoder</code> type used for writing various things to file. It has an internal
buffer that had a variable size, but in practice the buffer size was always 8
KiB. In this PR I fixed the size to 8 KiB, which meant some checks could be
hardwired in the generated code, giving sub-1% icount wins on a few benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111963">#111963</a>: The compiler can
derive impls for various built-in traits: <code>Clone</code>, <code>Default</code>, <code>Debug</code>,
<code>PartialEq</code>/<code>Eq</code>, <code>PartialOrd</code>/<code>Ord</code>, and <code>Hash</code>. The derived functions were
marked <code>#[inline]</code>, except for <code>Debug::fmt</code> (which makes sense given that it is
typically not used on hot code paths) and <code>Hash::hash</code>. This PR added an inline
marking to <code>Hash::hash</code>, giving sub-1% icount wins on a number of benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113116">#113116</a>: In this PR I made a
series of micro-optimizations in and around codegen unit formation, giving
sub-3% icount wins on a few benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113609">#113609</a>: In this PR I added a
cache that avoids the need for some repetitive HIR traversals during linting.
It gave icount wins of up to 6% across a number of benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/114611">#114611</a>: This is a fun one.
<a href="https://github.com/Dragon-Hatcher">@Dragon-Hatcher</a> created a very unusual
Rust program: a chess engine that computes things at compile time only using
Rust’s Turing-complete trait system. (They also have a TypeScript version of
the same program.) This causes vast numbers of trait obligations to be
generated for the compiler’s trait solver. In this PR I made some small changes
to a de-duplication step that runs on collections of these obligations, which
reduced both the compile time and peak memory usage of this crate by almost 7x!
It also gave icount wins of up to 4% across a number of secondary benchmarks.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that some recent improvements I made to Cachegrind,
were very helpful with all of the above PRs. I wrote about these changes in a
<a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/05/03/valgrind-3.21-is-out.html">previous
post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="general-progress">General Progress</h2>

<p>For the period 2023-03-22 to 2023-08-24 we had some excellent overall
performance results.</p>

<p>First,
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=wall-time&amp;nonRelevant=true">wall-time</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There were 513 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>454 of these were improvements, and 59 were regressions. The mean change was
a reduction of 7.13%, and many of the reductions were in the double digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=max-rss&amp;nonRelevant=true">peak memory usage</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Again, there were 513 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>492 of these were improvements, and 21 were regressions. The mean change was
a 10.53% reduction, and many of the reductions were again in the double
digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=size%3Alinked_artifact&amp;nonRelevant=true">binary
size</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There were 316 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>178 of these were improvements, and 138 were regressions. The mean change was
a 0.02% reduction, i.e. the wins and losses balanced out. Most of the changes
were in the single digits.</li>
  <li>If we restrict things to <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=size%3Alinked_artifact&amp;nonRelevant=true&amp;incrFull=false&amp;incrUnchanged=false&amp;incrPatched=false&amp;debug=false&amp;doc=false">non-incremental release
builds</a>,
which is probably the most interesting case for binary size, there were 24
improvements, 18 regressions, and the mean change was a reduction of 2.65%.</li>
</ul>

<p>For all three metrics, all but a handful of results met the significance
threshold. I haven’t bothered separating those results because they made little
difference to the headline numbers. As always, these measurements are done on
Linux.</p>

<p>Overall these are excellent results which will translate into meaningful speed
and memory usage improvements for many Rust users, and continue a long line of
steady improvements over a number of years. Thank you to everyone who
contributed!</p>

<h2 id="bigger-improvements">Bigger improvements?</h2>

<p>In a Reddit discussion one person
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/158tcel/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/jtcrlwi/">questioned</a>
the value of incremental improvements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to ask: are optimizations like these the right path forward?</p>

  <p>I don’t mean to diminish your work, i’ve been reading your posts for a long
time and i know a lot of effort goes into improving rustc and how many
experiments don’t pan out but i always get the impression that even when they
do, it’s a couple percent at most and often only on specific benchmarks.</p>

  <p>This doesn’t seem to be the path towards the 10x improvements which many
people wish for. Is something like that even possible and what architectural
changes would be necessary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I admit this question tested my patience. (Have I thought of making big
improvements instead of small improvements? Yes. Yes, I have.) But I will
assume it was asked in good faith, and provide some thoughts in response.</p>

<p>Anyone waiting for 10x improvements is likely to be disappointed. I don’t see
that happening, except for the occasional unusual program (such as the chess
engine case mentioned above).</p>

<p>The compiler is a large, mature project. It’s well over 10 years old, and
hundreds of thousands of lines. Projects like that tend to not get quantum
leaps in performance. Many small improvements is more typical.</p>

<p>Rust is a difficult language to compile quickly. Brian Anderson has a whole
series of blog posts about this:
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/rust-compilation-model-calamity/">1</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/generics-and-compile-time-in-rust/">2</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/rust-huge-compilation-units/">3</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/reasons-rust-compiles-slowly/">4</a>. Some of the
points made are now out of date, and I find the overall a tone a little
sensationalistic, but there is some truth to it. In short, there were numerous
design trade-offs made during Rust’s design, and compile times got the short
end of the stick almost every time.</p>

<p>There have been a number of large improvements in the past, and there may be
some more coming. There have also been some failed attempts at large
improvements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incremental compilation can make a huge difference, perhaps not 10x, but
certainly 3-5x in many cases. The implementation has its issues (it has
been temporarily disabled a couple of times due to bugs) but many people
are benefiting from it every day.</li>
  <li>The parallel back-end makes a huge difference. Try compiling with
<code>codegen-units=1</code> and you’ll get slightly higher code quality but it might
take 2x or more longer. There are many trade-offs with this kind of thing,
though, as I touched on earlier.</li>
  <li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/evaluating-pipelined-rustc-compilation/10199">Pipelined
compilation</a>
greatly increased inter-procedural parallelism, giving speedups of up to
1.8x.</li>
  <li>The parallel front-end is under active development, and will hopefully be
shipped soon. We have seen 2x speedups in some cases. Getting it working
has been a multi-year effort; it’s a difficult project.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">Cranelift backend</a>
has been in development for a number of years. A primary goal is to improve
compile times. It is a large piece of work, and is still experimental.</li>
  <li><a href="https://davidtw.co/media/masters_dissertation.pdf">Polymorphization</a> is an
optimization that aims to reduce the cost of monomorphization of generic
code. There is a partial implementation that provide modest speed
improvements and is not stable enough to be on by default. I think this is
basically because compilers are complex and sometimes reasonable ideas are
just really hard to get working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compilers involve giant tree structures, with lots of allocations, pointer
chasing, and data-dependent multi-way branches. All the things that modern
microarchitectures handle poorly. There is research into different designs that
avoid these problems, but they involve data structures that can be highly
non-ergonomic. And it’s hard to radically change the data structures used in a
mature compiler.</p>

<p>All of this ignores what might be called performance “dark matter”: the many
bug fixes and functional improvements that have gone into the compiler without
regressing performance. (Or that did slightly regress performance, but which
have been balanced out by other improvements.) A great example of this is the
NLL borrow checker that shippped in 2018, which I think is the single biggest
improvement to Rust since 1.0. It was performance neutral, but only because a
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/11/06/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018-nll-edition/">great deal of
work</a>
went into its performance before shipping, which resulted in some cases
reducing compile times and peak memory use by <strong>50x</strong>. Another good example is
the excellent error messages that the compiler is famous for; a lot of care
goes into keeping those as cheap as possible.</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer that small improvements add up, in just about any part of
life, and compiler performance is no difference. I have a knack for finding
these improvements and the persistence to keep at it. I’ve been writing these
posts for a long time, and I typically report 3-10% improvements every 3-6
months, due to my work and that of many others. Visit the <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/dashboard.html">performance
dashboard</a> and you’ll see things
like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://nnethercote.github.io/images/2023/08/25/dashboard-debug.png" alt="Graph showing improving debug compile times since Rust 1.28"></p>

<p>The improvements over time have been consistent enough that there has been
<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/log.20scale.20for.20the.20dashboard">discussion</a>
about whether the y-axis scale on these graphs should be linear or logarithmic.
I’d love to have 10x wins, but in their absence, a steady grind of small
improvements is absolutely worthwhile.</p>

Chromosome X and Y components of the assembly string graph built from HiFi reads, detected based on node sequence alignments to T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38 references. Each node is colored according to the excess of paternal-specific (blue) and maternal-specific (red) k-mers, obtained from parental Illumina reads, indicating if they exclusively belong to chromosome Y or X, respectively. Most complicated tangles are localized within the heterochromatic satellite region on the Y q-arm. The X and Y subgraphs are connected in PAR1 and PAR2. Graph discontinuities are due to a lack of HiFi sequence coverage in these regions caused by contextual sequencing bias, with 9 out of 11 observed breaks falling within PAR1 on either chromosome (5 out of 5 for chromosome Y). Note that for visualization purposes the length of shorter nodes is artificially increased making the extent of the tangles appear larger than reality. <b>b</b>. The effects of manual pruning and semi-automated ONT read integration is illustrated from top to bottom. Top, zoomed in view of a tangle encoding the P1–P3 palindromic region in Y (approx. 22.86–27.08 Mb, see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06457-y#Fig4">4</a>). Middle, corresponding subgraph following the manual pruning and recompaction. Nodes excluded from the curated “single-copy” list for automated ONT-based repeat resolution are shown in yellow. Three hairpin structures are highlighted, which form almost-perfect inverted tandem repeats encompassing the entire P3 and two P2 (red) palindromes. Node outlines in the palindromes are colored according to the palindromic arms as in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06457-y#Fig4">4</a>. Bottom, corresponding subgraph following the repeat resolution using ONT read-to-graph alignments. Remaining ambiguities were resolved by evaluating ONT read alignments to all candidate reconstructions of the corresponding sub-regions. <b>c</b>. PAR1 subgraph labeled with HiFi read coverage on each node. Gaps (green edges) and uneven node coverage estimates indicate biases in HiFi sequencing across the region.

Each bar represents read counts in every 20 kb bin supporting the reference in forward direction (light green) or reverse direction (dark green). Multiple spikes in reverse direction (black asterisks) in GRCh38-Y indicate inversion polymorphisms relative to HG002, likely due to differences between the haplogroups. Such spikes in coverage are not observed on T2T-X and T2T-Y, which confirm the structural and directional accuracy of the HG002 assemblies. A 3 kb inversion of the unique sequence between the P5 palindromic arms was identified as erroneous in T2T-Y (red asterisk), but was confirmed to be polymorphic in the population and left uncorrected in this version of the assembly.</p></div><div data-test="supp-item" id="Fig9"><h3><a data-track="click" data-track-action="view supplementary info" data-test="supp-info-link" data-track-label="extended data fig. 3 large structural differences " href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06457-y/figures/9" data-supp-info-image="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06457-y/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6457_Fig9_ESM.jpg">Extended Data Fig. 3 Large structural differences between T2T-Y and previous GRCh Y assemblies.</a></h3><p><b>a</b>-<b>b</b>.

WC, roughly equal mixture of plus and minus reads; WW, all reads mapped in minus orientation; CC, all reads mapped in plus orientation.

Recurrent change in strand state over the same region in multiple Strand-seq cells indicates misassembly. Similarly, collapsed or incomplete assembly of a certain genomic region will result in a recurrent strand state change as observed for GRCh38-Y (black arrowheads).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>On a recent cross-country trip—I (Paul) drove from California to Illinois and back again. On the drive, I saw a sign I had never seen before: In a McDonald’s window it said </span><strong>$1,000 SIGNING BONUS</strong><span>. That was not a thing when I was a teenager doing minimum-wage jobs. No one paid you $1,000 signing bonuses to work for fast-food restaurants.&nbsp;</span></p><p>These bonuses have been around for a few years now, having started during Covid when the U.S. workforce fell into a wormhole and disappeared. But instead of going away, they persist, and bonuses have seemingly gotten even larger.&nbsp;</p><p>This got us thinking, unsurprisingly. It ties into a theme we have been rolling around, one we’re passionate about. Explaining what is going on, why it is important, and its relevance for investing will require some groundwork, so bear with us for a few paragraphs.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a persistent structural imbalance in the U.S. workforce: too few people for all the jobs, for the most part. It resists all efforts to reduce it, driven by a host of factors, including demand growth, an aging society, retirements, lower immigration, and skill mismatches, all of which conspire to create an unprecedented shortage of workers.</p><p>You can see some of this in the participation rate among U.S. workers.

While the U.S. civilian labor force is larger than it was pre-Covid, so is the U.S. economy. If the labor force had continued to grow more or less in line with history and GDP, we’d have almost 5 million more workers out there. But we don’t. The gap is shrinking—it was closer to 7 million a year ago—but it is still a very large number, and, given retirements, skill mismatches, and aging, it seems unlikely we will close that gap quickly, if ever.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png" width="865" height="555" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:555,&quot;width&quot;:865,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F681cafaf-d4b8-4e1f-a5c6-7f6ece0adc4f_865x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It is important to be nuanced about this. The missing jobs are not in all areas. Arguably, we still have too many people in technology company middle management. For example, all eight of the Google-based authors of the seminal “transformers” paper that helped spark the current wave of large language models have now left Google to start various AI companies. As a friend and long-ago former Google employee reminded us, that is more people than there were senior vice presidents at Google in 2004. Technology is not, with a few exceptions, where jobs are going wanting.&nbsp;</p><p>But almost everywhere else needs people. Badly. Across retail, restaurants, manufacturing, trades, and on and on, companies are struggling to hire. And this brings us back to the cross-country trip observation and that “signing bonus” sign in a McDonald’s window.</p><p><span>The absence of human workers has become a limiting factor on economic growth in the U.S. Absent a wave of immigration, which creates its own problems, politically and otherwise, and doesn’t necessarily fill the observed skill gaps, something needs to change. Historically, when this has happened—labor became more expensive than capital—economies have responded with automation, so we </span><em>should</em><span> expect that again today.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, as promised, let’s circle back from demography and economics to technology, investments, and automation. As we’ve </span><a href="https://skventures.substack.com/p/societys-technical-debt-and-softwares" rel="">written previously</a><span>, what’s important about this wave of automation is how it is more skewed toward jobs that can be described as requiring “tacit knowledge,” where we know what to do but can’t always create programmatic ways of doing things. These jobs are not assembly lines, so simply throwing capital (orthodox automation) at the problem doesn’t work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>That is why, in a sense, the current wave of AI has come along at the </span><em>perfect</em><span> time. It is the first automation technology to be applicable to tacit knowledge, to tasks where we can’t describe in a linear ABC way how inputs turn into outputs. To that way of thinking, we should </span><em>embrace</em><span> and not fear the current wave of technological change, in that it can help with the observed shortages in U.S. workers, and do so in a replicable and continuous way, not unlike traditional automation.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The trouble is—not to put too fine a point on it—current-generation AI is mostly crap. Sure, it is terrific at using its statistical models to come up with textual passages that read better than the average human’s writing, but that’s not a particularly high hurdle. Most humans are terrible writers and have no interest in getting better. Similarly, current LLM-based AI is very good at comparing input text to rules-based models, impairing the livelihood of cascading stylesheet pedants who mostly shouted at people (fine, at Paul) on StackExchange and Reddit. Now you can just ask LLMs to write that code for you or check crap code you’ve created yourself.</p><p>But that’s not enough. We are quickly reaching the limits of current AI, whether because of its tendency to hallucinations, inadequate training data in narrow fields, sunsetted training corpora from years ago, or myriad other reasons. We are pushing against the limits of what current AI can do, and that has unintended consequences, which we will return to in a moment. Most observers haven’t realized this yet, but they will.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Our view is that we are at the tail end of the first wave of large language model-based AI. That wave started in 2017, with the release of the transformers paper (“</span><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46201/" rel="">Attention is All You Need</a><span>”) by those Google researchers, and ends somewhere in the next year or two with the kinds of limits people are running up against. It ends partly because of constraints inherent in the current approach, but also because of technological and cost limits related to training models, whether wide or narrow. This wave has been terrific for a few companies, especially Nvidia, but it will be thought of in the future as mostly about piping the AI house, at most. The key component of this current wave is that it is characterized by scarcity—training data, models, chips, and AI engineers—and the accompanying high costs that scarcity brings.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Before explaining which waves come next, and what that will mean, we will now digress into why it’s so important we rethink how we think about automation. Because there is a huge risk that we don’t, and this opportunity goes wanting. And that is to take nothing away from legitimate concerns, like existential risk, but we have a near-term problem: The workforce wormhole is eating the economy.&nbsp;</p><p><span>In an important 2019 paper (“</span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.2.3" rel="">Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor</a><span>”) by Acemoglu and Restrepo, the authors develop and test important ideas about the nature of automation. While the models are highly quantitative, they can be summarized in simpler terms. In essence, the authors show that for automation to have widespread benefits it must deliver high productivity gains to more than compensate for the high displacement of workers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here are the authors from the paper itself: ”...automation always reduces the labor share in value-added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity”. Of course, there are opposing forces, as they say: “The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage”. In other words, and this is a trope often delivered nuance-free by technology boosters, </span><em>technology’s displacement effects can be outweighed if new tasks are created where labor has an advantage over automation</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This is a huge “if.” Not all waves of automation create jobs as speedily as they displace them. And, even more importantly for our purposes, not all waves of automation deliver bursts of productivity that compensate for the displacement. Acemoglu and Restrepo coined the phrase “so-so automation” for a particularly insidious and increasingly common form of tech-enabled automation, where there is high worker displacement without commensurate productivity gains impact—where minimal human flourishing is created.&nbsp;</p><p>Has this happened? All the time, Acemogul and Restrepo show. And, worryingly, it is happening increasingly frequently in recent decades, blinding us to the effects of so-so automation on productivity gains:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.</p></blockquote><p><span>You can see their idea in schematic terms in the following 2x2 grid. So-so automation is in the top right; the kind of automation we want, which we think of as flourishing, is in the bottom right quadrant. We should never confuse these two forms of automation, given that high worker displacement must be more than compensated for by high productivity gains if we are to avoid massive economic disruption, especially in an economy where workers are scarce and inflexible, as we have already discussed. The box in the lower right should be our goal, call it, by way of contrast with so-so, </span><em>“Zoso” automation</em><span> (Yes, that is a Led Zeppelin pun; yes, Led Zeppelin’s best song is still “Kashmir”), where we get worker displacement, but we also get even more explosive productivity growth.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png" width="1456" height="821" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>How do we know if something is so-so vs Zoso automation? One way is to ask a few test questions:</p><p>1. Does it just shift costs to consumers?</p><p>2. Are the productivity gains small compared to worker displacement?</p><p>3. Does it cause weird and unintended side effects?</p><p>Here are some examples of the preceding, in no particular order. AI-related automation of contract law is making it cheaper to produce contracts, sometimes with designed-in gotchas, thus causing even more litigation. Automation of software is mostly producing more crap and unmaintainable software, not rethinking and democratizing software production itself.&nbsp; Automation of call centers is coming fast, but it is like self-checkout in grocery stores, where people are implicitly being forced to support themselves by finding the right question to ask.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is a problem. These are all examples of so-so automation. They are happening all over, and they are typical of much of what many investors are investing in and many entrepreneurs are creating. These products and services will, inevitably, displace a huge number of people, but they </span><em>will not</em><span> drive human flourishing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So, what does this mean? It means we need much better AI. Or we need much worse AI. The second point first: Much worse AI would have minimal worker displacement effects, making it less economically fraught in its effects, and given that the U.S. economy can work within those limits. We are in a middle zone, however, with AI able to displace huge numbers of workers quickly, but not provide compensatory and broader productivity benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings us back to our wave theory of what is happening in AI. As we wrote above, we think, contrary to hyperbole, we are already at the tail end of the current wave of AI. We are bumping against many of its limits, which is, in turn, constraining the state space of what can be done with AI that drives explosive productivity growth versus so-so automation.&nbsp;</p><p>What comes next? In our view, the next wave will last until perhaps 2030, with a diversity of new models (like tree of thoughts models), ubiquitous/cheap GPUs, and an inevitable commoditization of LLMs with an accompanying explosion of open source. At the same time, the current era of massive, intermittently-updated models will seem quaint, like mainframe computers. The next generation will be lighter weight and much more specific, a good example of which is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where the old LLM mainframe becomes mostly a syntax and grammar generator. All the action is local and informed by proprietary data, whether real-time or historical, or both.</p><p>To get from here to there a bunch of things have to change. For starters, we need far better tools. For example, our current generation of developer tools are perfectly adapted for a world that no longer exists, and they are mostly being kludged with new features that make them more narrowly useful, rather than redesigned altogether. Without a change in the tooling, we cannot see past recency bias into the kinds of service that might drive explosive productivity growth. We will be trapped in that box of so-so automation.</p><p><span>We also need to stop thinking in such siloed terms about technology. It is possible that, with the right tools, the most explosive growth in flourishing-promoting automation will be in areas other than those where the last few waves played out, that is, outside white-collar office work. For example, there are early signs that, with minor advances, huge gains are possible in life sciences. We are already seeing new drugs and targets, new ways of </span><a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news/a-new-ai-tool-predicts-gene-expression-in-a-single-cell-71295?utm_campaign=TS_DAILY_NEWSLETTER_2023&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=271255795&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XITrAwTC_XX04YVnkpOAQpHWO2bKW2dZHyUrguBKPQQScHKlSSg76z1Iooq9ZaKvWWH9TnzGFVCcrJZ69RvwqqLmCHA&amp;utm_content=271255795&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">analyzing cell types and gene expression</a><span>, and so on. Our blinkers must not prevent us from being open to the idea that true Zoso automation will come mostly in unexpected areas, like biology.&nbsp;</span></p><p>At an even higher level, however, we need to break free from decades of recent thinking about what automation is for. As Acemoglu and Restrepo show in their 2019 paper, the productivity benefits of recent technology-related automation have been declining, with more and more of it being directed at low productivity displacement.&nbsp;</p><p>Decades ago, business theorist Michael Hammer made bank promoting the idea of using technology to reengineer society. It didn’t happen, partly because there was no way to do it with then-current technology, but mostly because reengineering became a consultant code word for cost-cutting and layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>This time can be different. By realizing where we are in AI waves, and by recognizing the limits of current technology, we can see why the limits of current LLMs already dictate what, how, and when we automate. Whether we do so will dictate whether this next wave leads to explosive improvements or just incremental so-so automation.&nbsp; We need to look past the limits of current AI technology if we are to break free from the past few decades of so-so automation and compensate for the gravitational forces dragging the U.S. workforce into that wormhole.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some paper and bamboo straws contain so-called "forever chemicals" that could make them a less-than-ideal alternative to plastic, researchers have found. </p><p>Scientists in Belgium recently tested dozens of straws from supermarkets, retail stores and fast-food restaurants in the country, and found that the majority contained PFAS — a family of synthetic chemicals used in the manufacture of consumer products because they can resist stains, grease and water.</p><p>The researchers sampled 39 brands of straws made of paper, bamboo, glass, stainless steel and plastic.&nbsp;Of those, 27 were found to contain PFAS, though the concentrations were low.  </p><p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19440049.2023.2240908" target="_blank">results</a> were published Thursday in the journal Food Additives and Contaminants.</p><p>PFAS, an acronym for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they linger almost permanently in air, water and soil. They are frequently detected in food wrappers, cosmetics, carpet, furniture and textiles such as raincoats or workout clothes. </p><p>Of the straws tested in the study, those made of paper were the most likely to contain PFAS: The chemicals were detected in 18 out of 20 brands. Four out of five bamboo straws sampled contained PFAS, compared to three out of four plastic straws and two out of five glass straws. All five stainless steel straws analyzed were PFAS-free.</p><p>Previous <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653521007074?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">research</a> in the U.S. has also detected PFAS in paper and other plant-based straws, among many other types of cookware and packaging.</p><p>Exposure to PFAS can be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html" target="_blank">associated</a>&nbsp;with low birth weight, high cholesterol,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.c-8medicalmonitoringprogram.com/" target="_blank">thyroid disease</a> and an&nbsp;increased risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33780327/" target="_blank">kidney</a> and <a href="https://www.jhep-reports.eu/article/S2589-5559(22)00122-7/fulltext" target="_blank">liver</a> cancers, but researchers are still learning about these health risks and aren't sure which levels of exposure are problematic.</p><p>Thimo Groffen, an author of the new study and environmental scientist at the University of Antwerp, said it’s not clear whether the manufacturers of the straws he analyzed are intentionally adding PFAS as a waterproof coating. Other possibilities, he said, are that PFAS accidentally winds up in straws during the production process, or that bamboo straws have trace amounts of PFAS due to plants being grown in contaminated soil.</p><p>Graham Peaslee, who studies PFAS at the University of Notre Dame and was not involved in the new research, said it's possible manufacturers aren't testing for the chemicals in their own products.</p><p>“All the straw manufacturers should take warning and say, ‘Hey, do we use this stuff?’ Because at the moment, they’re not even asking that question,” Peaslee said.</p><p>Groffen said straw users probably don't need to panic about their individual risk.</p><p>“This is just one very small source of additional exposure which could be easily avoided, but I don’t expect straws themselves to be very harmful," he said.</p><p>But he added that because PFAS accumulate in the body, people should ideally reduce exposures where they can: “It all adds up together with other exposure routes and the combination could cause health effects,” he said.</p><h2>Does PFAS leach into food and water?</h2><p>There is no federal limit for PFAS in food packaging in the U.S., though some states have their own restrictions. The Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/process-contaminants-food/authorized-uses-pfas-food-contact-applications" target="_blank">allows PFAS to be used</a> in certain food processing equipment and as a grease-proofing agent in paper food packaging.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, has proposed<strong> </strong>limits for PFAS in drinking water but not yet issued a final rule. </p><p>Keith Vorst, director of the Polymer and Food Protection Consortium at Iowa State University, said some of the straws in the study exceeded the proposed EPA concentrations for water. However, he pointed out that the researchers didn’t test whether PFAS leaches from the straws into beverages, or whether using a straw necessarily causes someone to ingest the chemicals.</p><p>Plus, Vorst said, he has detected far higher concentrations of PFAS in drink carriers, take-home containers and microwave popcorn bags. </p><p>“I have a little fear about, ‘OK, now let’s focus on straws’ when we have much, much bigger issues that are contaminating the environment,” he said.</p><p>Peaslee said the amount of PFAS that transfers from packaging to food and drink is generally minimal, especially if the items aren't in contact for very long.</p><p>“If you let a straw sit for a day, you’ll get some in the water, but how many of us leave our straw in the water for a day and then still drink out of it?” he said.</p><h2>Weighing the harms of paper versus plastic straws</h2><p>Various states, including California, Colorado, New York and Oregon, have banned plastic straws from food establishments in the last five years, and chains like Starbucks have phased them out. </p><p>The main reason is that the straws generally can't be recycled, so they wind up in landfills, get burned in incinerators or become litter that contaminates oceans, rivers, lakes and streams. Since plastic doesn't decompose easily, it can persist in the environment for up to 200 years, threatening the lives of marine mammals.</p><p>Paper and bamboo straws have risen in popularity as alternatives, but researchers said the cure is sometimes not much better than the disease.</p><p>“If they come with PFAS on them, they’re not so eco-friendly anymore," Peaslee said. </p><p>PFAS can leach out of landfills into water and soil, and have toxic effects on animals, including liver damage or reproductive issues. Groffen's study detected one particular compound that's highly soluble in water, trifluoroacetic acid, in five paper straws and one bamboo straw. </p><p>But Groffen said plant-based straws are still better for the environment than plastic.</p><p>"I still would expect plastic straws to be more harmful to the environment because of course you also have the degradation of the plastics into microplastics that can be consumed by animals," he said.</p><p>The researchers interviewed<strong> </strong>agreed that stainless steel straws are preferable over paper, bamboo or plastic, but they questioned whether people will adopt them widely.</p><p>“If we could all switch to stainless steel, that’d be great," Vorst said. "I don’t think it’s practical.”</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/aria-bendix-ncpn1294089"><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2022_46/3581042/aria-bendix-byline-jm.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581042/aria-bendix-byline-jm.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581042/aria-bendix-byline-jm.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/aria-bendix-ncpn1294089">Aria Bendix</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/ariabendix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:aria.bendix@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Accordingly, it is likely that the three colonies where rapid loss of fast ice occurred prior to this date will have experienced total or near total breeding failure, as emperor penguin chicks do not develop waterproof feathers until fledging. Some chicks may have survived on grounded icebergs (as may have occurred on Smyley Island; see below), but the percentage of the chicks that&nbsp;may have survived on these refugia is impossible to say from satellite images, which are of insufficient resolution to discriminate chicks from adults. However, as staining from three of the colonies disappeared entirely before December it is likely adult emperors abandoned these sites shortly after unsuccessful breeding.</p><p>Between the initial collection of Sentinel2 data in Antarctica in 2018 until 2022 the archive of imagery shows only one of the five colonies had witnessed sea ice break up earlier than December (Bryant Peninsula; 2010). One instance of break up in the five colonies in the 4 years of imagery is a likely hood on 0.04. In 2022 the loss of four out of the five sites led to an early break-up a likelihood of 0.80.</p><p>Below are reports for each of the five individual emperor penguin colonies in the central and eastern Bellingshausen Sea.

In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the sea ice in the bay did not break up until the New Year. A population estimate from WorldView3 imagery on 20th November 2021 (image ID 21NOV20142220) gave an estimate of ~3000 pairs. In September 2022 the colony was once again visible in Sentinel2 imagery, but very small—consisting of just 4 brown pixels. Between the 31st of October and the 4th of November the land-fast sea ice in the bay broke up. This ice had entirely dissipated by early December and no sign of any staining from guano could be found in the local area.</p><h3 id="Sec4">Smyley Island colony</h3><p>Smyley Island colony was discovered in 2009 by Landsat satellite imagery. Very High-Resolution satellite imagery has been taken of it during most years since then to reveal that numbers vary between 1000 and 6500 breeding pairs with a 10 years average of 3500 pairs (British Antarctic Survey data unpublished, in prep). These satellite records shows that the land-fast sea ice at the colony location remained intact until at least early December except in 2022, when the fast ice broke up some time in mid-November. In this year, the colony had split into two groups approximately four kilometres apart. In Sentinel2 imagery from early December, the sea ice had clearly broken up leaving only loose pack ice and a few large bergs. It appears that at least some of the penguins had moved onto the foot of a large berg which was grounded near the coast. Whether any of the chicks survived on the berg is unknown.</p><h3 id="Sec5">Bryant Coast colony</h3><p>The Bryant Coast colony was discovered in Landsat imagery in 2014. It has had a number of population estimates by VHR satellite imagery with numbers ranging from ~2000 in 2014 to 0 in 2010, which was the only year that birds were absent from the site. From 2010 to 2021, inclusive, multi-year fast ice persisted at the site, providing a stable platform for emperor penguins throughout the year. In 2022 the colony was visible in mid-November in Sentinel2 imagery but appeared smaller than normal. By the 25th of November, the sea-ice edge was approaching the colony location and by the 29th the fast ice had broken into pack. There was still evidence of brown staining on some of the broken pack ice. However, a few days later on the 2nd of December this brown staining had disappeared from the pack ice, suggesting the abandonment of the colony. No other evidence of the colony could be found in the local area.</p><h3 id="Sec6">Pfrogner Point colony</h3><p>Pfrogner Point colony was discovered in 2019 and only one VHR satellite population estimate has been conducted, estimating the population at 1200 pairs. It is one of the few emperor colonies that is situated on an ice shelf<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Fretwell, P. T., Trathan, P. N., Wienecke, B. &amp; Kooyman, G. L. Emperor penguins breeding on iceshelves. PLoS ONE 9, e85285 (2014)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00927-x#ref-CR16" id="ref-link-section-d95482762e605">16</a></sup>, as in all years of the Sentinel2 record (2018–2022), the colony has been located for at least some of the year in a creek on the ice tongue or on the shelf itself. In 2022, the brown stain of the colony was visible by Sentinel2 in the ice creek on at least three dates in October (9th, 22nd, 29th), although in all instances the staining was small and only encompassed between 7–10 pixels.</p><p>However, by 8th November the stain had disappeared and did not return in Sentinel2 later images. The abandonment of the colony was confirmed by VHR imagery captured later in the month (26th November). By the 12th December 2022, all the sea ice had dissipated. This confirmed that no penguins were visible, either on the shelf or the surrounding sea ice by this time. The reason for abandonment of the colony site if difficult to say with certainty.</p><p>The VHR imagery also revealed that the ice cliff leading onto the shelf was ~4.5 metres high (estimated from sun angle and shadow length) and that a snow ramp between the sea ice and the ice shelf existed at the foot of the ice creek. Earlier Sentinel2 images, in early October, show that the sea ice beneath the ramp appeared to have broken up to the ice cliff or just short of it. This would have removed the snow ramp and with it access colony. After this, the emperors would have to abandon the colony as they would not have been able to get back to their chicks. This did not happen in previous years as, due to the geometry of the ice shelf, the edge of the ice cliff was father back inside the creek which protected it from sea ice loss.</p><h3 id="Sec7">Rothschild Island colony</h3><p>Rothschild Island colony is the furthest north of the five sites, located in a bay between Alexander Island and Rothschild Island. It is a small colony, averaging ~700 breeding pairs. As of 5th of December fast ice beneath the colony remained intact, although several open water patches opened up close to the colony. Counts from aerial imagery taken from helicopters from the cruise ship Commandant Charcot on 20th November, showed that there were 820 chicks and 228 adults at the site. Subsequent Sentinel2 imagery confirmed that fast ice persisted at the site until 17th December and only began to break up on the 30th December. This confirms that some fledging was successful at this location in 2022 despite being in the in the centre of the negative sea ice anomaly. The location of the colony is in an embayment between Rothschild and Alexander islands and the presence of many icebergs suggest shallow water. The geometry of the bay and the presence of icebergs may have helped to stabilise the sea ice at this location and afforded protection from breakout until after the chicks had fledged.</p></div></div><div id="Sec8-section" data-title="Discussion"><h2 id="Sec8">Discussion</h2><div id="Sec8-content"><p>Since the use of satellite imagery to monitor emperor penguins first started in 2009, there have been isolated cases of catastrophic breeding failure due to fast ice loss across Antarctica. For a few marginal colonies, such as the colony at Leda Bay in Marie Byrd Land, this happens regularly<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="LaRue, M.

However, as yet, there has been no record of a widespread failure of breeding emperor penguins due to a regional sea ice loss affecting multiple sites before fledging in early December. Moreover, only one of the sites in our study region had experienced catastrophic breeding failure prior to 2022 (Bryant in 2010). Our finding of probable breeding failure across multiple, non-blinking, sites in a single season is without precedent.</p><p>Emperor penguins are known to adapt to breeding failures caused by localised sea ice loss by moving to alternative, more stable, sites in the following year. For example, at Halley Bay in Weddell Sea, the loss of local sea ice from 2016 onward resulted in the emperor penguins relocating their colony to Dawson Lambton Glacier, 85 km to the south, where the sea ice had remained stable<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Fretwell, P.

However, such a strategy will not be possible if breeding habitat becomes unsuitable at a regional scale, unless local refugia such as the one identified at Rothschild Island persist.</p><p>How sea ice, and in particular land-fast sea ice, will react to future anthropogenic induced climate warming is unclear and difficult to predict. Although it is difficult to link specific extreme seasons to climate change, a longer-term decline in sea ice extent is expected from the current generation of climate models<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Roach, L.

Since 2016, Antarctica has experienced the four lowest sea ice extents observed in the 45 year satellite record, with the two lowest years in 2021/22 and 2022/23. Whether these continent-wide conditions are symptomatic of an ongoing trend or a more episodic phenomenon is as yet unknown, and this question is currently a priority for climate and sea ice scientists. The regional anomaly in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas is likely to have been influenced by the Triple-Dip La Niña that is affecting many areas of the southern Pacific<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="WMO.

It is expected that as the La Niña weakens and SAM turns positive, sea ice extent in the region may grow. Nonetheless, our findings show a clear link between negative sea ice anomalies and emperor penguin breeding failures that may represent a snapshot of a future, warming Antarctica where such events become more frequent and widespread, with grave consequences for emperor penguin population viability.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9-section" data-title="Methods"><h2 id="Sec9">Methods</h2><p>The locations and presence of emperor penguins was assessed using two satellite imagery platforms. The primary source was ESAs Sentinel2 platform, part of the Copernicus programme. These data were accessed through the Copernicus Sentinel Hub, viewed in Sentinel Playground [apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground/] and downloaded using the Sentinel Hub EO browser [<a href="https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/">https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/</a>]. Sentinel2 imagery has been taken continuously in Antarctica since 2018 and collection can vary between several times per week to several times per month. All imagery taken between August and the end of December 2022 was assessed manually for the presence of emperor penguins at each of their five colony locations in the Bellingshausen Sea. Sentinel2 imagery has a spatial resolution of 10 m in the visible bands and groups of emperor penguins can easily be distinguished on the sea ice as they leave distinctive brown guano stains on the ice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Fretwell, P.

Here we assume that the presence of brown pixels is indicative of penguin guano staining and hence the location of their colony. This staining may exist for several days after abandonment until the next snowfall, so it possible that there is some lag in the dates reported here. To ensure the best contrast when using the Sentinel Playground browser, the custom parameters [B08*0.8,B04*0.8,B03*0.8] were used. These data were supplemented using Very High-Resolution WorldView3 data from MAXAR, with a spatial resolution of 0.31 m at two sites; Pfrogner Point and Rothschild Island. At Pfrogner Point (image ID 10300100DE30A800 26th November 2022) this image was used to confirm that no penguins were present. At Rothschild Island, the WorldView3 image could confirm the presence of emperors and enable a rough count of individuals. This count was later confirmed and re-counted by oblique hand-held aerial survey from the helicopters of the ship Commandant Charcot.

<p>Minneapolis, MN – High-tech surveillance video and audio communication from a Minnesota State Patrol helicopter, obtained and first published by Unicorn Riot, reveals some of the planning and tactics behind the largest mass arrest in recent Minnesota history. On Nov. 4, 2020, a multi-agency law enforcement operation kettled and <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2022/reportbacks-from-the-646-detained-during-minnesotas-largest-mass-arrest/">arrested at least 646 people</a> during a post-election-day <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2020/protesters-demand-elections-remain-untampered-across-united-states/">protest</a> calling for then-President Donald Trump to not ‘steal the vote.’</p>
<p>In an exclusive release, viewers are taken inside Minnesota State Patrol’s Bell 407 helicopter, <a href="https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=119SP">N119SP</a>, to see and hear the operations of authorities as around 700 peaceful protesters marched onto Interstate 94 in Minneapolis. Watch a condensed video highlighting the chopper’s camera capabilities alongside the audio communications <a href="https://vimeo.com/855175964">below</a>, and the <a href="https://vimeo.com/855179182">full hour-long video</a> further down in the article. </p>

<h2>High-Tech Surveillance Cameras &amp; Audio Comms</h2>
<p>The hour-long video obtained by Unicorn Riot records from when the protest marched onto the interstate until the authorities had the large crowd effectively boxed in, and stops at the hour mark. This is our third exclusive release of videos from <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/exclusive-state-patrol-spy-plane-over-protest-video/">State Patrol</a> and <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/shame-games/">Minneapolis Police</a> during and after the mass arrest on Nov. 4, 2020.</p>
<p>The State Patrol has two helicopters that are <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/aerial-surveillance-in-twin-cities-frustrates-alarms-residents/">frequently providing aerial surveillance</a> above the Twin Cities metro for a wide variety of reasons. Whether to assist police in tracking suspects, follow traffic patterns and accidents, or providing surveillance of protests, the abilities of the state’s aircraft is powerful. Publishing this video will help the public understand what the helicopters are doing, and more specifically, what N119SP is doing, while above protests. </p>

Because the protest was at night and it was dark out, the video mostly stays in infrared mode (IR) (showing heat emanating from people, vehicles, and buildings). At time to get more clarity, the video switches between other high-tech surveillance modes including high definition zoom video and a ‘blend’ mode which combines both image types for an increasingly revealing composite.</p>
<p>The chopper used their overhead spotlight to shine down on the protesters and surrounding area. Someone identified as trooper nine ran the comms from N119SP and provided several warnings to officers on the ground about random events that occurred. </p>

<p>Radio scanner audio traffic is heard alongside the video and features law enforcement communications to and from troopers on the scene, revealing details into their planning in relation to the large protest. </p>
<p>Troopers are heard giving and relaying orders of where to block off roads and exits to detour traffic from the protest and ordering Mobile Response Teams [<a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/msp/dashboard/Pages/specialty-units.aspx">MRT</a>] and Special Response Teams [<a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/msp/dashboard/Pages/specialty-units.aspx">SRT</a>] to the area. MRTs are units of troopers that respond to civil unrest. SRTs are units of troopers providing tactical SWAT operations. </p>
<p>Eight minutes into the recording, troopers radioed that they were set to let the protesters off the freeway, <strong>“at some point we will have to give those dispersal orders and give them a exit.”</strong> </p>
<p>Just three minutes later at 7:51 p.m., they reversed that decision, saying, <strong>“car 25 to all MRT units, there will be no dispersal orders. Ah, we’re just gonna take ‘em on the freeway breach.”</strong></p>
<p>About twenty minutes into the video, a trooper can be heard calling for <strong>“all available trooper resources,”</strong> and saying <strong>“they should be geared up when they get down here. In their personal protective gear.”</strong> </p>

<p>Not long after being kettled, some protesters started to escape the police by running up the interstate embankment and scaling a fence. Trooper nine saw this, zoomed in with the camera and relayed over the radio, <strong>“people at the back of the group are starting to jump the fence and exit the freeway onto 9th Street.”</strong> </p>
<p>The fence jumping continued and other troopers chimed in to ask if they had <strong>“any leeway to push”</strong> the protesters toward a different location to prevent escapes. Minneapolis Police officers were lined near the fences along with a unit of Mounted Police not long after.</p>

<p>Press began to gather on the roof of a nearby apartment building to document the massive police operation. </p>
<p>Upon seeing this, trooper nine illuminated the roof with the chopper spotlight and radioed, <strong>“you’ve now got people on the top of the building south of 9th Street, overlooking the crowds.”</strong> They continued to track the building even after the subjects left the roof.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the video, a green laser was pointed at the helicopter, to which trooper nine responded by asking over the radio <strong>“did you log, yet another, green laser strike from the group?”</strong> </p>
<p>Other troopers are then heard telling arresting officers to check all the belongings of the arrestees. Trooper nine chimed in again moments later, <strong>“if you come across the guy with the green laser, let’s take him with the gross misdemeanor.”</strong> </p>

<p>Authorities ended up <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/demands-to-drop-the-charges-on-amina-and-the-646-mass-arrested/">arresting and charging</a> then-19-year-old college student, Amina McCaskill. Prosecutors charged her with felony, second-degree riot armed with a dangerous weapon, the weapon being the laser. </p>
<p>Many months later, McCaskill’s charges were dropped. McCaskill’s case was comparable to <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2017/action-drop-charges-louis-hunter/">Louis Hunter’s charge</a> in 2016 after <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/tag/philando-castile/page/4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philando Castile</a> was fatally shot by police and thousands of protesters shut down I-94 in St. Paul. A riot on I-94 left dozens injured and over <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2016/protesters-blockade-interstate-20-arrests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 arrested</a>. Like McCaskill, Hunter was the single protester charged with a felony. Both Hunter and McCaskill are Black.</p>

<p>This is the third exclusive release of government videos from the two day span of Nov. 4 and Nov. 5, 2020. The first exclusive release was of <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/exclusive-state-patrol-spy-plane-over-protest-video/">video from the State Patrol’s spy plane Cirrus SR22, N115SP,</a> hovering over a protest the day after the mass arrest, on Nov. 5, 2020.</p>

<p>The second release was of body camera footage from a unit of Minneapolis Police <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/shame-games/">denigrating their own central command community engagement officer</a> as they were on an overpass of I-94 on Nov. 4. Another release featuring over 32 hours of body camera footage from officers on the ground during the mass arrest is to be released soon.</p>

<h2>Background on the 646+ and Related Coverage</h2>
<p>Nearly 1,000 people converged on the West Bank of Minneapolis for the Nov. 4, 2020, protest entitled The People’s Mandate. From families with children, to the less abled and elders, a litany of community members showed up to the organized march the night after a tumultuous presidential election. The family-friendly protest started with a rally with speakers and then a short march which planned to get on the interstate at Cedar Ave. and get off at the next exit, 25th Ave. and Riverside Ave. </p>
<p>However, law enforcement agencies who amassed with hundreds of officers wouldn’t allow the group to exit. Coming off the summer of the <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/georgefloyd/">George Floyd Uprising</a>, police tactics became more aggressive and sometimes violent. </p>
<p>Once the crowd was on on I-94, authorities used the opportunity to practice inter-agency communication and tactics for the then-upcoming Operation Safety Net, a convergence of local, state, and military forces working together to occupy sections of the Twin Cities metropolitan area during the <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/derek-chauvin-trial/">murder trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin</a> which started in March 2021.</p>
<p>Moreover, the night before the mass arrest, Minneapolis Police violently arrested over a dozen people who were participating in an <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2020/election-night-mobile-dance-party-blockades-uptown-police-arrest-14/">election night mobile dance party</a> in Uptown Minneapolis. Playing music, about 50 people danced through the streets, putting up barricades and spray painting political messaging on boarded-up businesses. <a href="https://vimeo.com/476770817">Watch Unicorn Riot video from the dance party and arrests here</a>.</p>
<center><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476770817?h=dce977a7a4&amp;color=FFEE00&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="640" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>
<p>After the large crowd entered I-94 on Nov. 4, many were shocked to see that the authorities had surrounded and effectively ‘kettled’ them. Once boxed in, the detainment and processing operation took over five hours for the authorities to complete. Authorities shut down large sections of both I-94W and I-94E for the most of the operation. </p>
<p>Unicorn Riot was live from the frontline of the protest and police lines for six and a half hours during the night of the protest-turned-mass arrest. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivTAS3L8j_8">Watch the YouTube stream</a> below.</p>

<p>The day after the mass arrest, organizers held a press conference outside of the Minnesota Governor’s Residence to decry the police actions and demand all charges be dropped. It was this presser in which we first published the capabilities of the State Patrol’s spy planes as we <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/exclusive-state-patrol-spy-plane-over-protest-video/">published exclusive video</a> from their Cirrus CR22 aircraft. Unicorn Riot live streamed the presser and interviewed several organizers afterwards. Watch in full in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jDxqV6ogI">YouTube video below</a>. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
				The Ig Nobel Prizes are often treated as a joke, but their recipients are often working on surprisingly illuminating scientific fields. Japanese researcher Higashiyama Atsuki, who won his Ig Nobel in 2016 for his work on the effect of viewing objects between one’s own legs, continues to explore areas that clarify the connections between the body and the brain. 
				</p><div>
  				 <h2>The “Between-Legs Effect” Wins Ig Nobel Prize</h2>
<p>In 2016 Higashiyama Atsuki received an English-language letter in the mail informing him that his study on the effect of viewing things upside down between one’s legs (the so-called “between-legs effect”), which had originally been published 10 years earlier, had been selected as a candidate for the Ig Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>He ignored it, thinking it must have been a prank of some kind. Then he received another letter, this time in Japanese. The contents of the letter asked him to indicate if he would accept the prize if it were awarded to him. “Imagine that,” he remembers thinking. “It was true!”</p>
<p>The Ig Nobel Prize awards ceremony was held in the Sanders Theatre at Harvard University between acts of an opera. The prize he was awarded was a large clock that was equipped with a hand that indicated the sixty-first second — the “leap second”—and minute and hour hands that puzzlingly indicated seconds. The prize money was $10 trillion, although the unit of currency was not US dollars but rather Zimbabwe dollars, which had been discontinued at the time he received the prize. In fact, the prize money was worth about ¥170.</p>
<p>“It was an extremely humorous awards ceremony,” remarks Higashiyama, “which was fitting to the occasion.”</p>

<p>Higashiyama began his “between-legs effect” research in 1996. Since he was younger he sensed that there were numerous constraints in the world of psychological research in Japan, and as a result he intentionally submitted his work to English-language publications to increase his chances of publication. “Although my work was quite dull,” he comments, “if I published it in English there were people who would read it. This more than anything else made me happy.”</p>
<p>What exactly was this research that he modestly describes as “dull”?</p>
<h2>Optical Illusion Disappears When Positioned Sideways</h2>
<p>“Viewing things between one’s legs,” Higashiyama explains, “entails bending at the waist and looking at one’s surroundings upside down from between the legs. When one does this, distances and colors appear differently.”</p>
<p>At Higashiyama’s urging, I bend forward and take a look at a forest through my legs. Viewed in this way, the entire scene seems farther away, the trunks, branches, and leaves of the trees seem to be smaller, and the distances between all the various objects in sight seem to shrink in size as well. It also seems that the shapes and colors are clearer than when viewed in the normal way.</p>
<p>When I express surprise at the wonders of the human sense of sight, Higashiyama counters: “It isn’t sight per se, but rather the influence of the body.”</p>
<p>“In our research,” he continues, “we refer to things we can see as ‘visual information,’ while we refer to phenomena that occur as a result of changing the position of the body as ‘physical information.’ The ‘between-legs effect’ is strongly affected by this physical information. This is what I have found through a process of collecting data and repeated experimentation.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443771/2443771.jpg" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443771"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443771/2443771.jpg" data-libid="2443771" alt="Higashiyama demonstrating between-the-legs viewing. (©&nbsp;Power News)"></a><br><span>Higashiyama demonstrating between-the-legs viewing. (©&nbsp;Power News)</span></p>
<p>While still in his early thirties, Higashiyama began studying the “horizontal-vertical illusion” in an attempt to identify the relationship between physical and visual information. The horizontal-vertical illusion is a phenomenon in which the vertical line appears longer when a horizontal line and a vertical line of the same length are drawn. For example, it has been shown that when a building that is in fact 10 meters both along its frontage and in height is viewed, it seems to the viewer that the height is 1.4 times the width, making the building look 14 meters tall.</p>
<p>This has been included in textbooks and has led to the widespread belief that visual information causes optical illusions. But Higashiyama thought that they may be caused by physical information as well, so he had multiple students view a building and asked them how it appeared to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443772/2443772.png" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443772"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443772/2443772.png" data-libid="2443772" alt="The vertical and horizontal bars are of the same length, but the horizontal-vertical illusion makes the vertical bar look 1.4 times longer."></a><br><span>The vertical and horizontal bars are of the same length, but the horizontal-vertical illusion makes the vertical bar look 1.4 times longer.</span></p>
<p>The results he obtained came as a shock.</p>
<p>“When they viewed the building from a normal standing position, its appearance to them was exactly as explained in textbooks,” Higashiyama explained. “That is, the vertical measurement appeared longer than it is in reality. But when I had them view it while lying on their side, some of them reported that the vertical and the horizontal lengths looked the same. In other words, we discovered that when lying on one’s side, the horizontal-vertical vertical illusion does not occur.”</p>
<p>No textbook includes mention of one’s visual perception changing when one is in a different physical position. What was shocking about his discovery was that even this small deviation from reality might call all textbooks into question.</p>
<p>This was how Higashiyama arrived at the conclusion that it was necessary to study whether the horizontal-vertical illusion was due to visual or physical information by supplementing his initial results with experiments in which volunteers viewed objects upside down from between their legs.</p>
<h2>Myth Arose in Nineteenth Century Textbooks</h2>
<p>When most people hear “viewing between one’s legs” they probably think of <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/guide-to-japan/gu900078/">Amanohashidate</a>, a tourist spot overlooking Miyazu Bay in northern Kyoto Prefecture. Ancient texts state that Izanagi, the deity that created Japan, linked heaven and the earth with a ladder known as the <em>ama no hashidate</em>. Based on this ancient legend, people look at the scenery there upside down from between their legs in order to experience the illusion that the land bridge across the bay presents a stairway to the heavens. There are also regions of Japan where the folklore says that one can see ghosts, the world of spirits and demons, or the future by looking upside down through one’s legs. This fascination with looking through one’s legs comes from the fact that it allows people to see the world in a way that is different from normal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443773/2443773.jpg" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443773"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443773/2443773.jpg" data-libid="2443773" alt="Between-the-legs viewing at Amanohashidate. (🄫 Pixta)"></a><br><span>Between-the-legs viewing at Amanohashidate. (🄫 Pixta)</span></p>
<p>The fact that this phenomenon was known in antiquity led to attention from researchers in the past. Papers written on the subject of between-the-legs viewing were published in Japan prior to World War II. Even outside Japan, there is a textbook on experimental psychology published toward the end of the nineteenth century that mentioned the “between-legs effect.”</p>
<p>But as far as Higashiyama was concerned, these older works lacked sufficient objective data and contained poor evidence.</p>
<p>Thinking that he had to take the time to research the issue for himself, Higashiyama had over 200 students participate in an experiment, many from Ritsumeikan University.</p>
<p>The experiment consisted of the following: In step 1, he had them view a scene standing up in the normal way. In step 2, he had them view the same scene through “prism goggles” that made the scene look upside down. The third step had them take off the prism goggles and look at the scene again, this time through their legs. Finally, in the fourth step, the students looked at the scene through their legs while wearing the prism goggles. A minimum of 50 students performed each of the four steps. Then, he interviewed the students to discover how the scenes appeared to them.</p>
<p>The key to this experiment was the use of the prism eyeglasses. The results showed that in step 2 the scenes appeared similar to how they appeared in step 1, but that in steps 3 and 4 objects that seemed to be far away appeared smaller than they did in step 1. In other words, the between-legs effect was found to be mainly due to physical information rather than visual information.</p>
<h3>Experimenting with 200 Student Volunteers</h3>

<p>“We clearly established that the physical factor is strongly linked to the between-legs effect,” says Higashiyama.</p>
<p>Speaking from the perspective of a psychologist specializing in spatial perception, Higashiyama further states that “The physical factor must not be ignored in the field of psychology. I believe that finding evidence of this factor is of extreme importance in the world of psychology, where the physical is often overlooked.”</p>
<h2>Psychology Without Evidence</h2>
<p>Higashiyama has misgivings about current-day psychology.</p>
<p>Many studies place importance on overt, conscious actions like seeing and listening. And some psychologists conclude that people are of one personality type or another based on questionnaires that lack evidence, and which are therefore indistinguishable from fortune-telling.</p>
<p>“So, people have biases in their understanding,” explains Higashiyama. “The same importance as placed on sight and hearing has to be placed on physical information as well, and conclusions must be based on evidence. Researchers need to be aware of the fact that the field of psychology runs the risk of changing people’s lives.”</p>
<p>Looking back to that day in 2016, in spite of the fact that Higashiyama finally realized that being selected as a candidate for the Ig Nobel Prize was not a joke, he hesitated to accept the prize. What convinced him was young people.</p>
<p>“My research is dull and is rarely praised,” says Higashiyama. “But I wanted to let the next generation of researchers and students know that someone was paying attention. If accepting the Ig Nobel Prize could achieve this goal, I thought, then so be it.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443774/2443774.jpg" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443774"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443774/2443774.jpg" data-libid="2443774" alt="The Ig Nobel Prize certificate presented to Higashiyama.

<p>After receiving the prize, the Alumni Association at Ritsumeikan University began talking about between-the-legs viewing, and Higashiyama suddenly found that he had far more invitations to lecture on his findings at conferences held by academic associations in fields like medicine and economics. And he was the subject of increased media interest as well.</p>
<p>“I was happy that I had so many opportunities to discuss the details of the research I’d been conducting for so long,” he says.</p>
<p>What Higashiyama always keeps in mind while conducting his research is identifying evidence, as well as avoiding becoming totally immersed in a single research topic by involving himself in multiple projects at the same time. If he reaches an impasse in one study, he can shift his attention to something else, which often leads to new ideas, he says. Although this method means that it may take longer for him to complete each project, he says that his sense of satisfaction far outweighs the extra burden.</p>
<p>Currently, Higashiyama is working on a project called “The perception of the direction of the arms and body and the effect of adapting to that direction.”</p>
<p>Higashiyama explains: “The subject lifts upward his forward outstretched arms with his eyes open. He holds that pose for a short while and then returns his arms to the horizontal position. This is simple for subjects to do. Then he performs the same movements but now with his eyes closed. This time, his arms do not return to the horizontal position but rather are angled slightly upward. This showed that vision cancels out physical adaptation.”</p>
<p>Higashiyama’s lifelong research interest is the relationship between the visual and the physical. When asked what his greatest joy in his research is, he responds as follows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443775/2443775.jpg" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443775"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443775/2443775.jpg" data-libid="2443775" alt="Professor Emeritus Higashiyama Atsuki. (©&nbsp;Power News)"></a><br><span>Professor Emeritus Higashiyama Atsuki. (©&nbsp;Power News)</span></p>
<p>“I’m most happy when I talk about my research and the person I am talking to seems interested in it. When I won the Ig Nobel Prize, it was a pleasure to know that people from around the world thought my research into the between-legs effect was interesting.”</p>
<p>The term “pleasure” is one that is without a doubt highly significant to most researchers. To this day, Higashiyama continues to collect data and repeat experiments in an effort to feel that “pleasure” once again.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 21:57:25 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-proof-of-work-defense-for-onion-services/">https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-proof-of-work-defense-for-onion-services/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37255079">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we are officially introducing a proof-of-work (PoW) defense for onion services designed to prioritize verified network traffic as a deterrent against denial of service (DoS) attacks with the release of Tor 0.4.8.</p>
<p>Tor's PoW defense is a dynamic and reactive mechanism, remaining dormant under normal use conditions to ensure a seamless user experience, but when an onion service is under stress, the mechanism will prompt incoming client connections to perform a number of successively more complex operations. The onion service will then prioritize these connections based on the effort level demonstrated by the client. We believe that the introduction of a proof-of-work mechanism will disincentivize attackers by making large-scale attacks costly and impractical while giving priority to legitimate traffic. Onion Services are encouraged to update to version <a href="https://forum.torproject.org/t/stable-release-0-4-8-4/8884">0.4.8.</a></p>
<h2>Why the need?</h2>
<p>The inherent design of onion services, which prioritizes user privacy by obfuscating IP addresses, has made it vulnerable to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/">DoS attacks</a> and traditional IP-based rate limits have been imperfect protections in these scenarios. In need of alternative solutions, we devised a proof-of-work mechanism involving a client puzzle to thwart DoS attacks without compromising user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Proof of work acts as a ticket system that is turned off by default, but adapts to network stress by creating a priority queue. Before accessing an onion service, a small puzzle must be solved, proving that some "work" has been done by the client. The harder the puzzle, the more work is being performed, proving a user is genuine and not a bot trying to flood the service. Ultimately the proof-of-work mechanism blocks attackers while giving real users a chance to reach their destination.</p>
<h2>What does this mean for attackers and users?</h2>
<p>If attackers attempt to flood an onion service with requests, the PoW defense will kick into action and increase the computational effort required to access a .onion site. This ticketing system aims to disadvantage attackers who make a huge number of connection attempts to an onion service. Sustaining these kinds of attacks will require a lot of computational effort on their part with diminishing returns, as the effort increases.</p>
<p>For everyday users, however, who tend to submit only a few requests at a time, the added computational effort of solving the puzzle is manageable for most devices, with initial times per solve ranging from 5 milliseconds for faster computers and up to 30 milliseconds for slower hardware. If the attack traffic increases, the effort of the work will increase, up to roughly 1 minute of work. While this process is invisible to the users and makes waiting on a proof-of-work solution comparable to waiting on a slow network connection, it has the distinct advantage of providing them with a chance to access the Tor network even when it is under stress by proving their humanity.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Over the past year, we have put a lot of work into mitigating attacks on our network and enhancing our defense for onion services. The introduction of Tor's PoW defense not only positions onion services among the few communication protocols with built-in DoS protections but also, when adopted by major sites, promises to reduce the negative impact of targeted attacks on network speeds. The dynamic nature of this system helps balance the load during sudden surges in traffic ensuring more consistent and reliable access to onion services.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="block-system-main">

  
      
  
  <div>
    <div><div><p>Experiences porting FreeBSD 14 to run on the Firecracker VMM</p></div>
<div><div><p>A large amount of fantastic open source software originates from “scratching an itch”. Such was the case with <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/" target="_blank" title="Firecracker on github" rel="nofollow">Firecracker</a>.&nbsp;In 2014, Amazon launched AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" title="AWS Lambda" rel="nofollow">Lambda</a> as a “serverless” compute platform: Users can provide a function — say, ten lines of Python code — and Lambda provides all of the infrastructure between an HTTP request arriving and the function being invoked to process the request and generate the response.</p><p><span>To provide this service efficiently and securely, Amazon needed to be able to launch virtual machines with minimal overhead. Thus was born Firecracker: A Virtual Machine Monitor which works with Linux KVM to create and manage “microVMs” with minimal overhead.</span></p></div><div>
    <div><p>Why FreeBSD on Firecracker?</p></div><div><p><span>In June 2022, I started work on porting FreeBSD to run on Firecracker. My interest was driven by a few factors. </span></p><p><span>First, I had been doing a lot of work on speeding up the FreeBSD boot process and wanted to know the limits that could be reached with a minimal hypervisor. </span></p><p><span>Second, porting FreeBSD to new platforms always helps to reveal bugs — both in FreeBSD and on those platforms. </span></p><p><span>Third, AWS Lambda only supports Linux at present; I’m always eager to make FreeBSD more available in AWS (although adoption in Lambda is out of my control, Firecracker support would be a necessary precondition). </span></p><p><span>The largest reason, however, was simply because it’s there. Firecracker is an interesting platform, and I wanted to see if I could make it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div>  </div><div>
    <div><p>Launching the FreeBSD Kernel</p></div><div><p><span>While Firecracker was designed for Lambda’s needs — launching Linux kernels — there were patches available from 2020 that added support for the PVH boot mode in addition to “linuxboot”. FreeBSD had support for PVH booting under Xen, so I decided to see if that would work. </span></p><p><span>Here I ran into the first problem: Firecracker could load the FreeBSD kernel into memory but couldn’t find the address at which to start running the kernel (the “kernel entry point”). According to the PVH boot protocol, this value is specified in an ELF Note — a piece of special metadata stored in ELF (Executable and Linker Format) files. It turned out that there are two types of ELF Notes: PT_NOTEs and SHT_NOTEs, and FreeBSD wasn’t providing the one Firecracker was looking for. A small change to the FreeBSD kernel linker script fixed this, and now Firecracker was able to start executing the FreeBSD kernel.</span></p><p><span>That lasted for about 1 microsecond.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div>  </div><div><p><span>FreeBSD has wonderful debugging functionality, but if your kernel crashes before the debugger is initialized or the serial console is set up, you’re not going to get much help. In this case, the Firecracker process exited, telling me that the FreeBSD guest hit a triple-fault — but that’s all I knew.</span></p><p><span>It turned out, however, that this was enough information to get me started, given a bit of creativity. If the FreeBSD kernel execution reached a hlt instruction, the Firecracker process would keep running but use 0% of the host’s CPU time (since it was virtualizing a halted CPU). As such, I could distinguish between “FreeBSD is crashing before this point” and “FreeBSD is crashing after this point” by inserting a hlt instruction — if Firecracker exited, I knew that it was crashing before reaching that instruction. Thus started a process I referred to as “kernel bisection” — rather than bisecting a list of commits to find one which introduced a bug (as in <strong>git bisect</strong>) I would do a binary search through the kernel startup code to find the line of code that was making FreeBSD crash.</span></p></div><div><p><span>The first thing I discovered in this process was Xen hypercalls. The PVH boot mode originated as the Xen/PVH boot mode, and FreeBSD’s PVH entry point was, in fact, an entry point specifically for booting under Xen — and the code made the quite reasonable assumption that it was, indeed, running inside Xen and could thus make Xen hypercalls. KVM (which provides the kernel functionality used by Firecracker) is not Xen, of course, so it doesn’t provide those hypercalls; attempting to use any of them resulted in the virtual machine crashing. As an initial workaround, I simply commented out all the Xen hypercalls; later, I added code to check <strong>CPUID</strong> for a Xen signature before making calls e.g., to write debugging output to the Xen debug console.</span></p><p><span>There was one Xen hypercall that provided essential functionality, however: Retrieving the physical memory map. (Of course, inside a hypervisor, the “physical” memory is only virtually physical. It’s turtles all the way down.) Here, we’re saved by the fact that Xen/PVH was retroactively declared to be version 0 of PVH boot mode: From version 1 onwards, a pointer to the memory map is passed via the PVH <strong>start_info</strong> page (a pointer to which is provided in a register when the virtual CPU starts executing). I had to write code to make use of the PVH version 1 memory map instead of relying on a Xen hypercall to get the same information, but that was easy enough. </span></p><p><span>Another related issue arose from how Xen and Firecracker arrange structures in memory: Whereas Xen loads the kernel first and then places the <strong>start_info</strong> page at the end, Firecracker placed the <strong>start_info</strong> page at a fixed low address and then loaded the kernel afterwards. This would have been fine but that FreeBSD’s PVH code – having been written with Xen in mind — assumed that the memory immediately after the <strong>start_info</strong> page would be free for use as scratch space. Under Firecracker, that very quickly meant overwriting the initial kernel stack — not an optimal outcome! A change to FreeBSD’s PVH code to assign scratch space after all the memory regions initialized by the hypervisor fixed this problem.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>On x86 platforms, FreeBSD normally makes use of ACPI to learn about (and in some cases control) the hardware on which it is running. In addition to discovering things via ACPI which we might commonly think of as “devices” — disks, network adapters, etc. — FreeBSD also learns about fundamental things like CPUs and interrupt controllers via ACPI.</span></p><p><span>Firecracker, being deliberately minimalist, does not implement ACPI, and FreeBSD gets upset when it can’t figure out how many CPUs it has or where to find their interrupt controllers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, FreeBSD has support for the historic Intel MultiProcessor Specification, which provides this critical information via an “MPTable” structure; it’s not part of the GENERIC kernel configuration, but for running in Firecracker, we want to use a stripped-down kernel configuration anyway, so it was easy to add <strong>device mptable</strong> to make use of what Firecracker provides.</span></p><p><span>Except… it didn’t work. FreeBSD still couldn’t find the information it needed! It turned out that Linux has bugs in how it finds and parses the MPTable structure — and Firecracker, being designed to boot Linux, provided the MPTable in a way that Linux supported but was not in fact compliant with the standard. FreeBSD, having an implementation independently written to follow the standard, failed both to find the (incorrectly located) MPTable and to parse the (invalid) MPTable once it was found.</span></p><p><span>So now FreeBSD has a new kernel option: You can add <strong>options MPTABLE_LINUX_BUG_COMPAT</strong> to your kernel configuration if you need bug-for-bug compatibility with Linux’s MPTable handling — and with that, FreeBSD managed to boot a bit further in Firecracker.</span></p></div><div><p><span>One of the few emulated devices — as opposed to virtualized devices like the Virtio block and network devices — provided by Firecracker is the serial port. In fact, in a common configuration, when you launch Firecracker, the standard input and output of the Firecracker process become the serial port input and output of the VM, making it seem like the guest OS is just another process running inside your shell (which, in a certain sense, it is). At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work.</span></p><div><p><span>By this point in the process of bringing up FreeBSD inside Firecracker I was able to boot a FreeBSD kernel with a root disk compiled into the kernel image — I didn’t have the virtualized disk driver working yet — and read all the console output from the kernel. After all the kernel console output, however, FreeBSD entered the userland portion of the boot process, and I got 16 characters of console output — and then it stopped.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Funnily enough, I’d seen that exact symptom over ten years earlier, when I was first getting FreeBSD working on EC2 instances. A bug in QEMU resulted in the UART not sending an interrupt when the transmit FIFO emptied; FreeBSD wrote 16 bytes to the UART and then wouldn’t write anymore because it was waiting for an interrupt which never arrived. Modern EC2 instances run on Amazon’s “Nitro” platform, but in the early days they used Xen and devices were emulated using code from QEMU. Somehow, a decade after this bug was fixed in QEMU, exactly the same bug was implemented in Firecracker; but luckily for me, the workaround I put into the FreeBSD kernel —&nbsp;<strong>hw.broken_txfifo=”1”</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;— was still available, and adding that loader tunable (which, since Firecracker loads the kernel directly without going through the boot loader, meant compiling the value into the kernel as an environment variable) fixed the console output.</p></div><p><span>I then found that the console input was also broken: FreeBSD didn’t respond to anything I typed into the console. In fact, tracing the Firecracker process, I found that Firecracker wasn’t even reading from the console — because Firecracker thought that the receive FIFO on the emulated UART was full. This turned out to be another bug in Firecracker: While initializing the UART, FreeBSD fills the receive FIFO with garbage to measure its size and then flushes the FIFO by writing to the FIFO Control Register. Firecracker didn’t implement the FIFO Control Register, so it was left with a full FIFO and quite sensibly didn’t try to read any more characters to put into it. Here, I added another workaround to FreeBSD: If <strong>LSR_RXRDY</strong> is still asserted after we try to flush the FIFO via the FIFO Control Register — which is to say, if the FIFO didn’t empty as requested — we now proceed to read and discard characters one by one until the FIFO empties. With this, Firecracker now recognized that FreeBSD was ready to read more input from the serial port, and I had a working bidirectional serial console.</span></p></div><div><p><span>While a system without disks or network could be useful for some purposes, before we can do very much with FreeBSD, we’re going to want those devices. Firecracker supports Virtio block and network devices and exposes them to virtual machines as mmio (memory-mapped I/O) devices. First step to getting these working in FreeBSD: Add <strong>device virtio_mmio</strong> to the Firecracker kernel configuration.</span></p><p><span>Next up, we need to tell FreeBSD how to find the virtualized devices. FreeBSD expected <strong>mmio</strong> devices to be discovered via FDT (Flattened Device Tree), which is a mechanism commonly used on embedded systems; but Firecracker passes device parameters via the kernel command line with directives such as <strong>virtio_mmio.device=4K@0x1001e000:5</strong>. Second step to getting these working in FreeBSD: Write code for parsing such directives and creating <strong>virtio_mmio</strong> device nodes. (Once we create the device node, FreeBSD’s regular process for device probing kicks in and the kernel will automatically determine the type of Virtio device and hook up the appropriate driver.)</span></p><p>If we have multiple devices however — say, a disk device and a network device — another problem arises: Firecracker passes directives the way Linux expects — as a series of key=value pairs on the kernel command line — while FreeBSD parses the kernel command line as environment variables… meaning that if there were two <strong>virtio_mmio.device=</strong> directives passed on the command line, only one was retained. To fix this, I rewrote the early kernel environment parsing code to handle duplicate variables by appending a numbered suffix: We end up with <strong>virtio_mmio.device=</strong> for one device and <strong>virtio_mmio.device_1=</strong> for the second device.</p><div><p><span>With this, I finally had FreeBSD booting and discovering all of its devices — but one more problem arose with disk devices: If I shut down the virtual machine uncleanly, on the next boot the system would run fsck on the filesystem, and the kernel would panic. It turned out that fsck is one of very few things in FreeBSD that will cause non-page-aligned disk I/Os, and FreeBSD’s Virtio block driver was causing a kernel panic when trying to pass unaligned I/Os to Firecracker.</span></p></div><p>When an I/O crosses a page boundary — as will happen with page-sized I/Os which aren’t aligned to page boundaries — the physical I/O segments will typically not be contiguous; most devices can handle I/O requests which specify a series of segments of memory to be accessed. Firecracker, being extremely minimalist, does not do this: Instead, it accepts only a single data buffer — meaning that a buffer that crosses a page boundary can’t simply be split into pieces the way it would with other Virtio implementations. Fortunately, FreeBSD has a system in place specifically for taking care of device complications like this: <strong>busdma</strong>.</p><p><span>This was probably the hardest part of getting FreeBSD running in Firecracker, but after several attempts, I think I finally got it right: I modified FreeBSD’s Virtio block driver to use <strong>busdma</strong>, and now unaligned requests are “bounced” (aka. copied via a temporary buffer) in order to comply with the limitations of the Firecracker Virtio implementation.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Once I had FreeBSD up and running in Firecracker, it rapidly became clear that there were some improvements to be made. One of the first things I noticed was that, despite having 128 MB of RAM in the virtual machine I was testing, the system was barely usable, with processes being frequently killed due to the system running out of memory. The <strong>top(1)</strong> utility showed that almost half of system memory was in the “wired” state, which seemed odd to me; so I investigated further, and found that busdma had reserved 32 MB of memory for bounce pages. This was clearly far more than needed — given Firecracker’s limitations and the fact that bounce pages are generally not allocated contiguously, each disk I/O should use at most a single 4 kB bounce page — and I was able to reduce this memory consumption to 512 kB with a patch to <strong>busdma</strong> which limited its bounce page reservations for devices which supported only a small number of I/O segments.</span></p><ul><li><span>FreeBSD’s kernel random number generator usually obtains entropy from hardware devices, but in virtual machines this may not be an effective source. As a backup source of entropy, on x86 systems we make use of the <strong>RDRAND</strong> instruction to obtain random values from the CPU; but we were only obtaining a very small amount of entropy on each request and were only requesting entropy once every 100 ms. Changing the entropy gathering system to request enough entropy to fully seed the Fortuna random number generator shaved 2.3 seconds off the boot time.</span></li><li><span>When FreeBSD first boots, it records a Host ID for the system. This is typically obtained from hardware via the <strong>smbios.system.uuid</strong> environment variable, which the boot loader sets based on information from BIOS or UEFI. Under Firecracker, however, there is no boot loader — and thus no ID being provided. We had a fallback system in place that would generate a random ID in software on systems that didn’t have a valid hardware ID; but we also printed a warning and waited 2 seconds to allow the user to read it. I changed this code to print the warning and wait 2 seconds if the hardware provided an invalid ID, but proceed silently and quickly if the hardware simply didn’t provide an ID.</span></li><li>IPv6 mandates that systems wait for “Duplicate Address Detection” before using an IPv6 address. In <strong>rc.d/netif</strong>, after bringing up interfaces, we were waiting for IPv6 DAD if any of our network interfaces had IPv6 enabled. There’s just one problem with that: We <em>always</em> have IPv6 enabled on the loopback interface! I changed the logic to only waiting for DAD if we had IPv6 enabled on an interface other than the loopback interface and sped up the boot process by 2 seconds — if another system is trying to use the same IPv6 address as us on our lo0, we have bigger problems than an address collision!</li><li><span>&nbsp;When rebooting, FreeBSD printed a message (“<strong>Rebooting...</strong>”) and then waited 1 second “for printf’s to complete and be read”. This seemed minimally useful, since people can usually tell that the system is rebooting — there is now a <strong>kern.reboot_wait_time sysctl</strong> which defaults to zero.</span></li><li><span>When shutting down or rebooting, the FreeBSD BSP (CPU #0) waits for the other CPUs to signal that they have stopped… and then waited an extra 1 second to make sure that they had a chance to stop. I removed the extra second of wait time.</span></li></ul><p>Once the low-hanging fruit was out of the way, I pulled out <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/papers/bootprofiling.pdf?utm_source=emailmarketing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=here_is_your_julyaugust_2023_issue_of_the_freebsd_journal&amp;utm_content=2023-08-21&amp;utm_campaign=here_is_your_julyaugust_2023_issue_of_the_freebsd_journal&amp;utm_content=2023-08-21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=emailmarketing" target="_blank" title="Profiling the FreeBSD kernel boot" rel="nofollow">TSLOG</a> and started looking at flamecharts of the boot process. Firecracker is a great environment for doing this, for two reasons: First, the minimalist environment eliminates a lot of noise, making it much easier to see what’s left behind; and second, having Firecracker launch virtual machines extremely quickly made it possible to test changes to the FreeBSD kernel very rapidly — often well under 30 seconds to build a new kernel, launch it, and generate a new flamechart.</p></div><div><p><span>Investigation with TSLOG revealed a number of available optimizations:</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>lapic_init</strong> had a 100000-iteration loop to calibrate how long <strong>lapic_read_icr_lo</strong> took to execute; cutting this down to 1000 iterations shaved off 10 ms.</span></li><li><span><strong>ns8250_drain</strong> called DELAY after each character was read; changing this to check for <strong>LSR_RXRDY</strong> and only DELAYing if nothing was already available to be read shaved off 27 ms.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD makes use of a CPUID leaf which most hypervisors use to advertise the TSC and local APIC clock frequencies; Firecracker, unlike VMWare, QEMU, and EC2, did not implement this. Adding support for this CPUID leaf to Firecracker shaved 20 ms off the FreeBSD boot time.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD was setting <strong>kern.nswbuf</strong> (which controls the number of buffers allocated for a variety of temporary purposes) to 256 regardless of the size of the system; changing this to 32 * mp_ncpus shaved 5 ms off the boot time on a small (1 CPU) virtual machine.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD’s <strong>mi_startup</strong> function, which kicks off machine-independent system initialization routines, was using a bubblesort to order the functions it called; while this was reasonable in the 90s given the small number of routines needing to be ordered at that point, there are now over 1000 such routines and the bubblesort was getting slow. Replacing it with a quicksort will save 2 ms. (Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023).</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD’s <strong>vm_mem</strong> initialization routine was initializing <strong>vm_page</strong> structures for all available physical memory. Even on a relatively small VM with 128 MB of RAM, this meant initializing 32768 such structures — and took a few ms. Changing this code to initialize <strong>vm_page</strong> structures “lazily” as the memory is allocated for use will save 2 ms. (<span>Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023</span>.)</span></li><li><span>Firecracker was allocating VM guest memory via an anonymous mmap, but Linux was not setting up the paging structures for the entire VM guest address space. As a result, the first time any page was read, a fault would occur taking roughly 20,000 CPU cycles to be resolved while Linux mapped in a page of memory. Adding the <strong>MAP_POPULATE</strong> flag to Firecracker’s <strong>mmap</strong> call will save 2 ms. (<span>Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023</span>.)</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span>FreeBSD boots under Firecracker — and does so extremely quickly. Including uncommitted patches (to FreeBSD and also to Firecracker), on a virtual machine with 1 CPU and 128 MB of RAM, the FreeBSD kernel can boot in under 20 ms; a flame chart of the boot process appears in Figure 1.</span></p></div><div>

Due to the history of PVH boot mode originating from Xen, the code used for PVH booting is still mixed up with Xen support; separating those will simplify things significantly. Similarly, it’s currently impossible to build a FreeBSD arm64 kernel without PCI or ACPI support; finding the bogus dependencies and removing them will allow for a smaller FreeBSD/Firecracker kernel (and also shave off a few more microseconds from the boot time – we spend 25 us checking to see if we need to reserve memory for Intel GPUs).</span></p><p><span>More aspirationally, it would be great to see if Firecracker could be ported to run on FreeBSD — at a certain point, a virtual machine is a virtual machine, and while Firecracker was written to use Linux KVM, there’s no fundamental reason why it shouldn’t be possible to make it use the kernel portion of FreeBSD’s bhyve hypervisor instead.</span></p><p><span>Anyone wanting to experiment with FreeBSD in Firecracker can build a FreeBSD 14.0 kernel with the amd64 <strong>FIRECRACKER</strong> kernel configuration, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/tree/feature/pvh" target="_blank" title="feature/pvh branch of firecracker" rel="nofollow">feature/pvh branch</a>&nbsp;from the Firecracker project; or if that branch no longer exists it means the code has been merged into the mainline Firecracker tree.</span></p><p><span>If you try out FreeBSD on Firecracker — especially if you end up using it in production — please let me know! I started this project mainly out of interest, but I’d love to hear if it ends up being useful.</span></p></div><div><p><em>This article originally appeared in the July/August issue of the <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/past-issues/containers-and-cloud/" target="_blank" title="FreeBSD Journal" rel="nofollow">FreeBSD</a> Journal.</em></p></div></div>
