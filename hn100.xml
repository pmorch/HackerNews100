                    <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The head of Minnesota's state investigations agency says the U.S. attorney's office has cut off its access in the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent.</p>

<p>"The investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation," Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.</p>
<p>It had been decided that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension would investigate Good's shooting death along with the FBI, but that later was changed by the U.S. Attorney's office, according to Evans.</p>
<p>The BCA "has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation," Evans wrote.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="AI Coding Assistants Are Getting Worse"><p><span>In recent months, I’ve noticed a troubling trend with AI <a data-linked-post="2671645555" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/vibe-coding" target="_blank">coding assistants</a>. After two years of steady improvements, over the course of 2025, most of the core models reached a quality plateau, and more recently, seem to be in decline. A task that might have taken five hours assisted by AI, and perhaps ten hours without it, is now more commonly taking seven or eight hours, or even longer. It’s reached the point where I am sometimes going back and using older versions of <a data-linked-post="2672500550" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/large-language-model-performance" target="_blank">large language models</a> (LLMs).</span></p><p>I use LLM-generated code extensively in my role as CEO of <a href="https://www.carringtonlabs.com/" target="_blank">Carrington Labs</a>, a provider of predictive-analytics risk models for lenders. My team has a sandbox where we create, deploy, and run AI-generated code without a human in the loop. We use them to extract useful features for model construction, a natural-selection approach to feature development. This gives me a unique vantage point from which to evaluate coding assistants’ performance.</p><h2>Newer models fail in insidious ways</h2><p>Until recently, the most common problem with AI coding assistants was poor syntax, followed closely by flawed logic. AI-created code would often fail with a syntax error or snarl itself up in faulty structure. This could be frustrating: the solution usually involved manually reviewing the code in detail and finding the mistake. But it was ultimately tractable.</p><p>However, recently released LLMs, such as <a data-linked-post="2673933939" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/gpt-5-trough-of-disillusionment" target="_blank">GPT-5</a>, have a much more insidious method of failure. They often generate code that fails to perform as intended, but which on the surface seems to run successfully, avoiding syntax errors or obvious crashes. It does this by removing safety checks, or by creating fake output that matches the desired format, or through a variety of other techniques to avoid crashing during execution.</p><p>As any developer will tell you, this kind of silent failure is far, far worse than a crash. Flawed outputs will often lurk undetected in code until they surface much later. This creates confusion and is far more difficult to catch and fix. This sort of behavior is so unhelpful that modern <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> languages are deliberately designed to fail quickly and noisily.</p><h2>A simple test case</h2><p>I’ve noticed this problem anecdotally over the past several months, but recently, I ran a simple yet systematic test to determine whether it was truly getting worse. I wrote some <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/python">Python</a> code which loaded a dataframe and then looked for a nonexistent column.</p><blockquote>df = pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’)<br>df['new_column'] = df['index_value'] + 1 #there is no column ‘index_value’</blockquote><p>Obviously, this code would never run successfully. Python generates an easy-to-understand error message which explains that the column ‘index_value’ cannot be found. Any human seeing this message would inspect the dataframe and notice that the column was missing.</p><p>I sent this error message to nine different versions of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, primarily variations on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/gpt-4">GPT-4</a> and the more recent GPT-5. I asked each of them to fix the error, specifying that I wanted completed code only, without commentary.</p><p>This is of course an impossible task—the problem is the missing data, not the code. So the best answer would be either an outright refusal, or failing that, code that would help me debug the problem. I ran ten trials for each model, and classified the output as helpful (when it suggested the column is probably missing from the dataframe), useless (something like just restating my question), or counterproductive (for example, creating fake data to avoid an error).</p><p>GPT-4 gave a useful answer every one of the 10 times that I ran it. In three cases, it ignored my instructions to return only code, and explained that the column was likely missing from my dataset, and that I would have to address it there. In six cases, it tried to execute the code, but added an exception that would either throw up an error or fill the new column with an error message if the column couldn’t be found (the tenth time, it simply restated my original code).</p><blockquote>This code will add 1 to the ‘index_value’ column from the dataframe ‘df’ if the column exists. If the column ‘index_value’ does not exist, it will print a message. Please make sure the ‘index_value’ column exists and its name is spelled correctly.”,</blockquote><p>GPT-4.1 had an arguably even better solution. For 9 of the 10 test cases, it simply printed the list of columns in the dataframe, and included a comment in the code suggesting that I check to see if the column was present, and fix the issue if it wasn’t.</p><p>GPT-5, by contrast, found a solution that worked every time: it simply took the actual index of each row (not the fictitious ‘index_value’) and added 1 to it in order to create new_column. This is the worst possible outcome: the code executes successfully, and at first glance seems to be doing the right thing, but the resulting value is essentially a random number. In a real-world example, this would create a much larger headache downstream in the code.</p><blockquote>df = pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’)<br><span>df['new_column'] = df.index + 1</span></blockquote><p>I wondered if this issue was particular to the gpt family of models. I didn’t test every model in existence, but as a check I repeated my experiment on Anthropic’s Claude models. I found the same trend: the older Claude models, confronted with this unsolvable problem, essentially shrug their shoulders, while the newer models sometimes solve the problem and sometimes just sweep it under the rug.</p><p> <img alt="A chart showing the fraction of responses that were helpful, unhelpful, or counterproductive for different versions of large language models.

But I have an educated guess. I believe it’s the result of how the LLMs are being trained to code. The older models were trained on code much the same way as they were trained on other text. Large volumes of presumably functional code were ingested as training data, which was used to set model weights. This wasn’t always perfect, as anyone using AI for coding in early 2023 will remember, with frequent syntax errors and faulty logic. But it certainly didn’t rip out safety checks or find ways to create plausible but fake data, like GPT-5 in my example above.</p><p>But as soon as AI coding assistants arrived and were integrated into coding environments, the model creators realized they had a powerful source of labelled training data: the behavior of the users themselves. If an assistant offered up suggested code, the code ran successfully, and the user accepted the code, that was a positive signal, a sign that the assistant had gotten it right. If the user rejected the code, or if the code failed to run, that was a negative signal, and when the model was retrained, the assistant would be steered in a different direction.</p><p>This is a powerful idea, and no doubt contributed to the rapid improvement of AI coding assistants for a period of time. But as inexperienced coders started turning up in greater numbers, it also started to poison the training data. AI coding assistants that found ways to get their code accepted by users kept doing more of that, even if “that” meant turning off safety checks and generating plausible but useless data. As long as a suggestion was taken on board, it was viewed as good, and downstream pain would be unlikely to be traced back to the source.</p><p>The most recent generation of AI coding assistants have taken this thinking even further, automating more and more of the coding process with autopilot-like features. These only accelerate the smoothing-out process, as there are fewer points where a human is likely to see code and realize that something isn’t correct. Instead, the assistant is likely to keep iterating to try to get to a successful execution. In doing so, it is likely learning the wrong lessons.</p><p>I am a huge believer in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a>, and I believe that AI coding assistants have a valuable role to play in accelerating development and democratizing the process of software creation. But chasing short-term gains, and relying on cheap, abundant, but ultimately poor-quality training data is going to continue resulting in model outcomes that are worse than useless. To start making models better again, AI coding companies need to invest in high-quality data, perhaps even paying experts to label AI-generated code. Otherwise, the models will continue to produce garbage, be trained on that garbage, and thereby produce even more garbage, eating their own tails.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Bose has also moved that date back to May 6th, 2026.</p><p>When cloud support ends, an update to the SoundTouch app will add local controls to retain as much functionality as possible without cloud services. Users will still be able to stream music to SoundTouch speakers with Bluetooth, AirPlay, and Spotify Connect (plus physical AUX connections). Remote control features and grouping speakers will also continue to work, and users will still be able to set up and configure their SoundTouch speakers.</p><p>Now that the smart speakers’ API is being open-sourced, users can also create their own compatible SoundTouch tools to help fill in any gaps left by the lack of cloud services. While it’s still disappointing that the speakers are losing official support, Bose’s approach at least lets people continue using their speakers, rather than bricking otherwise functional devices.</p><p>This move from Bose is particularly surprising because of how rare it is. Usually when products lose support for cloud services, they end up bricked, and occasionally users step in themselves to fix things.

<p dir="auto">The "Jeff Dean facts" are a set of jokes that revolve around the extraordinary programming prowess of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dean" rel="nofollow">titular Google employee</a>. Simply put, they are the coding equivalent of Chuck Norris-style jokes (for example, "Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door").</p>
<p dir="auto">I first encountered the Facts on a random Quora page, though as of recently many of them appear to have been removed. Thus, in order to preserve this invaluable cache of programmer humor for posterity, I decided to create this repository. It is a combined list of various versions of the Facts, beginning with a text file that I copied from the Quora post sometime in 2019, when the original answer still existed. It's been expanded from other sources, which are listed (and linked, if possible) at the end of this document.</p>
<p dir="auto">And now, without further ado...</p>

Since the beginning of December there have been eleven route leak events, impacting multiple prefixes, where AS8048 is the leaker. Although it is impossible to determine definitively what happened on the day of the event, this pattern of route leaks suggests that the CANTV (AS8048) network, a popular Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Venezuela, has insufficient routing export and import policies. In other words, the BGP anomalies observed by the researcher could be tied to poor technical practices by the ISP rather than malfeasance.</p><p>In this post, we’ll briefly discuss Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and BGP route leaks, and then dig into the anomaly observed and what may have happened to cause it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="background-bgp-route-leaks">Background: BGP route leaks</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>First, let’s revisit what a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/route-leak-detection-with-cloudflare-radar/"><u>BGP route leak</u></a> is. BGP route leaks cause behavior similar to taking the wrong exit off of a highway. While you may still make it to your destination, the path may be slower and come with delays you wouldn’t otherwise have traveling on a more direct route.</p><p>Route leaks were given a formal definition in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7908"><u>RFC7908</u></a> as “the propagation of routing announcement(s) beyond their intended scope.” Intended scope is defined using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise"><u>pairwise</u></a> business relationships between networks. The relationships between networks, which in BGP we represent using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)"><u>Autonomous Systems (ASes)</u></a>, can be one of the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>customer-provider: A customer pays a provider network to connect them and their own downstream customers to the rest of the Internet</p></li><li><p>peer-peer: Two networks decide to exchange traffic between one another, to each others’ customers, settlement-free (without payment)</p></li></ul><p>In a customer-provider relationship, the provider will announce <i>all routes to the customer</i>. The customer, on the other hand, will advertise <i>only the routes</i> from their own customers and originating from their network directly.</p><p>In a peer-peer relationship, each peer will advertise to one another <i>only their own routes and the routes of their downstream customers</i>.&nbsp;</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/16jXNbH5R5Q4evGm4oRY5p/08d0474000111923f37a7e53b809b5c2/BLOG-3107_2.png" alt="BLOG-3107 2" width="1653" height="738" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>These advertisements help direct traffic in expected ways: from customers upstream to provider networks, potentially across a single peering link, and then potentially back down to customers on the far end of the path from their providers.&nbsp;</p><p>A valid path would look like the following that abides by the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6363987"><u>valley-free routing</u></a> rule:&nbsp;</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3qKtxTWTrGcpMm8u3nAjYT/dd19181418076c0e12b6035154639e75/BLOG-3107_3.png" alt="BLOG-3107 3" width="1540" height="636" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>A <b>route leak</b> is a violation of valley-free routing where an AS takes routes from a provider or peer and redistributes them to another provider or peer. For example, a BGP path should never go through a “valley” where traffic goes up to a provider, and back down to a customer, and then up to a provider again. There are different types of route leaks defined in RFC7908, but a simple one is the Type 1: Hairpin route leak between two provider networks by a customer.&nbsp;</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4XdHugzuQAVhucuninsUfB/43912258386debc0500e3ceb7c8abab2/BLOG-3107_4.png" alt="BLOG-3107 4" width="1548" height="706" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>In the figure above, AS64505 takes routes from one of its providers and redistributes them to their other provider. This is unexpected, since we know providers should not use their customer as an intermediate IP transit network. AS64505 would become overwhelmed with traffic, as a smaller network with a smaller set of backbone and network links than its providers. This can become very impactful quickly.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="route-leak-by-as8048-cantv">Route leak by AS8048 (CANTV)</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Now that we have reminded ourselves what a route leak is in BGP, let’s examine what was hypothesized&nbsp; in <a href="https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/?cf_history_state=%7B%22guid%22%3A%22C255D9FF78CD46CDA4F76812EA68C350%22%2C%22historyId%22%3A106%2C%22targetId%22%3A%2251107FD345D9B86C319316904C23F966%22%7D"><u>the newsletter post</u></a>. The post called attention to a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as8048#bgp-route-leaks"><u>few route leak anomalies</u></a> on Cloudflare Radar involving AS8048. On the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/anomalies/leak-462460"><u>Radar page</u></a> for this leak, we see this information:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7d1gGdOtSEvPxciyfNswhw/619965acdc1a7a4d3eafbd99b0ccb9f3/BLOG-3107_5.png" alt="BLOG-3107 5" width="1360" height="726" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>We see the leaker AS, which is AS8048 — CANTV, Venezuela’s state-run telephone and Internet Service Provider. We observe that routes were taken from one of their providers AS6762 (Sparkle, an Italian telecom company) and then redistributed to AS52320 (V.tal GlobeNet, a Colombian network service provider). This is definitely a route leak.&nbsp;</p><p>The newsletter suggests “BGP shenanigans” and posits that such a leak could be exploited to collect intelligence useful to government entities.&nbsp;</p><p>While we can’t say with certainty what caused this route leak, our data suggests that its likely cause was more mundane. That’s in part because BGP route leaks happen all of the time, and they have always been part of the Internet — most often for reasons that aren’t malicious.</p><p>To understand more, let’s look closer at the impacted prefixes and networks. The prefixes involved in the leak were all originated by AS21980 (Dayco Telecom, a Venezuelan company):</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/42cmmWdskKqGw7bByd3tGs/c3841ffa205b241798593b91194d25b1/BLOG-3107_6.png" alt="BLOG-3107 6" width="1028" height="312" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>The prefixes are also all members of the same 200.74.224.0/20 <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-subnet/"><u>subnet</u></a>, as noted by the newsletter author. Much more intriguing than this, though, is the relationship between the originating network AS21980 and the leaking network AS8048: AS8048 is a <i>provider</i> of AS21980.&nbsp;</p><p>The customer-provider relationship between AS8048 and AS21980 is visible in both <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as21980#connectivity"><u>Cloudflare Radar</u></a> and <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/21980#upstreams"><u>bgp.tools</u></a> AS relationship interference data. We can also get a confidence score of the AS relationship using the monocle tool from <a href="https://bgpkit.com/"><u>BGPKIT</u></a>, as you see here:&nbsp;</p><p><code>➜&nbsp; ~ monocle as2rel 8048 21980
Explanation:
- connected: % of 1813 peers that see this AS relationship
- peer: % where the relationship is peer-to-peer
- as1_upstream: % where ASN1 is the upstream (provider)
- as2_upstream: % where ASN2 is the upstream (provider)</code></p><p><code>Data source: https://data.bgpkit.com/as2rel/as2rel-latest.json.bz2</code></p><p><code>╭──────┬───────┬───────────┬──────┬──────────────┬──────────────╮
│&nbsp;asn1 │ asn2&nbsp; │ connected&nbsp;│ peer │ as1_upstream&nbsp;│&nbsp;as2_upstream │
├──────┼───────┼───────────┼──────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ 8048 │ 21980 │    9.9% &nbsp; │ 0.6%&nbsp;│     9.4%&nbsp;  &nbsp; │ 0.0% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; │
╰──────┴───────┴───────────┴──────┴──────────────┴──────────────╯</code></p><p>While only 9.9% of route collectors see these two ASes as adjacent, almost all of the paths containing them reflect AS8048 as an upstream provider for AS21980, meaning confidence is high in the provider-customer relationship between the two.</p><p>Many of the leaked routes were also heavily prepended with AS8048, meaning it would have been <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/prepends-considered-harmful/"><u>potentially</u></a> <i>less</i> attractive for routing when received by other networks. <b>Prepending</b> is the padding of an AS more than one time in an outbound advertisement by a customer or peer, to attempt to switch traffic away from a particular circuit to another. For example, many of the paths during the leak by AS8048 looked like this: “52320,8048,8048,8048,8048,8048,8048,8048,8048,8048,23520,1299,269832,21980”.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see that AS8048 has sent their AS multiple times in an advertisement to AS52320, because by means of BGP loop prevention the path would never actually travel in and out of AS8048 multiple times in a row. A non-prepended path would look like this: “52320,8048,23520,1299,269832,21980”.&nbsp;</p><p>If AS8048 was intentionally trying to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"><u>man-in-the-middle (MITM)</u></a> for traffic, why would they make the BGP advertisement less attractive instead of <i>more </i>attractive? Also, why leak prefixes to try and MITM traffic when you’re <i>already</i> a provider for the downstream AS anyway? That wouldn’t make much sense.&nbsp;</p><p>The leaks from AS8048 also surfaced in multiple separate announcements, each around an hour apart on January 2, 2026 between 15:30 and 17:45 UTC, suggesting they may have been having network issues that surfaced in a routing policy issue or a convergence-based mishap.&nbsp;</p>

          </figure><p>It is also noteworthy that these leak events begin over twelve hours prior to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-capture-trump.html"><u>U.S. military strikes in Venezuela</u></a>. Leaks that impact South American networks <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/br#routing-anomalies"><u>are common</u></a>, and we have no reason to believe, based on timing or the other factors I have discussed, that the leak is related to the capture of Maduro several hours later.</p><p>In fact, looking back the past two months, we can see plenty of leaks by AS8048 that are just like this one, meaning this is not a new BGP anomaly:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Md8BdHtP1GIDkyNT8PTbD/3915068dc6f47046665410b665e29853/BLOG-3107_8.png" alt="BLOG-3107 8" width="1802" height="924" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>You can see above in the history of Cloudflare Radar’s route leak alerting pipeline that AS8048 is no stranger to Type 1 hairpin route leaks. Since the beginning of December alone there have been <b>eleven route leak events</b> where AS8048 is the leaker.</p><p>From this we can draw a more innocent possible explanation about the route leak: AS8048 may have configured too loose of export policies facing at least one of their providers, AS52320. And because of that, redistributed routes belong to their customer even when the direct customer BGP routes were missing. If their export policy toward AS52320 only matched on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/monitoring-as-sets-and-why-they-matter/"><u>IRR-generated</u></a> prefix list and not a <i>customer</i> BGP <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1997"><u>community</u></a> tag, for example, it would make sense why an indirect path toward AS6762 was leaked back upstream by AS8048.&nbsp;</p><p>These types of policy errors are something <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9234/"><u>RFC9234</u></a> and the Only-to-Customer (OTC) attribute would help with considerably, by coupling BGP more tightly to customer-provider and peer-peer roles, when supported <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2025/09/05/preventing-route-leaks-made-simple-bgp-roleplay-with-junos-rfc-9234/"><u>by all routing vendors</u></a>. I will save the more technical details on RFC9234 for a follow-up blog post.</p>

      <h3 id="the-difference-between-origin-and-path-validation">The difference between origin and path validation</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The newsletter also calls out as “notable” that Sparkle (AS6762) does not implement <a href="https://rpki.cloudflare.com/"><u>RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)</u></a> Route Origin Validation (ROV). While it is true that AS6762 appears to have an <a href="https://stats.labs.apnic.net/rpki/AS6762?a=6762&amp;c=IT&amp;ll=1&amp;ss=0&amp;mm=1&amp;vv=1&amp;w=7&amp;v=0"><u>incomplete deployment</u></a> of ROV and is flagged as “unsafe” on <a href="http://isbgpsafeyet.com/"><u>isbgpsafeyet.com</u></a> <a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/#faq"><u>because of it</u></a>, origin validation would not have prevented this BGP anomaly in Venezuela.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to separate BGP anomalies into two categories: route misoriginations, and path-based anomalies. Knowing the difference between the two helps to understand the solution for each. Route misoriginations, often called BGP hijacks, are meant to be fixed by RPKI Route Origin Validation (ROV) by making sure the originator of a prefix is who rightfully owns it. In the case of the BGP anomaly described in this post, the origin AS was correct as AS21980 and <b>only</b> the path was anomalous. This means ROV wouldn’t help here.</p><p>Knowing that, we need path-based validation. This is what <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification/"><u>Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA)</u></a>, an upcoming draft standard in the IETF, is going to provide. The idea is similar to RPKI Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) and ROV: create an ASPA object that defines a list of authorized providers (upstreams) for our AS, and everyone will use this to invalidate route leaks on the Internet at various vantage points. Using a concrete example, AS6762 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network"><u>Tier-1</u></a> transit-free network, and they would use the special reserved “AS0” member in their ASPA signed object to communicate to the world that they have no upstream providers, only lateral peers and customers. Then, AS52320, the other provider of AS8048, would see routes from their customer with “6762” in the path and reject them by performing an ASPA verification process.</p><p>ASPA is based on RPKI and is exactly what would help prevent route leaks similar to the one we observed in Venezuela.</p>

    <p>We felt it was important to offer an alternative explanation for the BGP route leak by AS8048 in Venezuela that was observed on Cloudflare Radar. It is helpful to understand that route leaks are an expected side effect of BGP historically being based entirely on trust and carefully-executed business relationship-driven intent.&nbsp;</p><p>While route leaks could be done with malicious intent, the data suggests this event may have been an accident caused by a lack of routing export and import policies that would prevent it. This is why to have a safer BGP and Internet we need to work together and drive adoption of RPKI-based ASPA, for which <a href="https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/rpki/aspa/"><u>RIPE recently released object creation</u></a>, on the wide Internet. It will be a collaborative effort, just like RPKI has been for origin validation, but it will be worth it and prevent BGP incidents such as the one in Venezuela.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to ASPA, we can all implement simpler mechanisms such as <a href="https://github.com/job/peerlock"><u>Peerlock</u></a> and <a href="https://archive.nanog.org/sites/default/files/Snijders_Everyday_Practical_Bgp.pdf"><u>Peerlock-lite</u></a> as operators, which sanity-checks received paths for obvious leaks. One especially promising initiative is the adoption of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9234/"><u>RFC9234</u></a>, which should be used in addition to ASPA for preventing route leaks with the establishing of BGP roles and a new Only-To-Customer (OTC) attribute. If you haven’t already asked your routing vendors for an implementation of RFC9234 to be on their roadmap: <i>please</i> <i>do</i>. You can help make a big difference.</p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks">

	<p>A NEW medical study is raising questions about the reliability of artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection, revealing that nearly one in three cancers may be overlooked by current AI tools. But researchers say a specialised MRI technique could help close that gap.</p>
<p>In a review of 414 women, with a mean age of 55.3 years, recently diagnosed with breast cancer, investigators evaluated how well an AI-based computer-aided diagnosis system (AI-CAD) performed when reading <a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/radiology/news/majority-support-ai-assisted-mammograms-but-few-trust-it-alone/">mammograms</a> and breast MRI scans. To count as “detected,” the system had to both score a lesion as suspicious and correctly locate it. When it failed to meet those criteria, the cancer was labelled as AI-missed.</p>
<h2><strong>AI Misses More Cancers in Dense Breast Tissue</strong></h2>
<p>The results were striking: 127 cancers, 30.7% of all cases, were missed by the AI system. The study found two major factors strongly linked to missed cancers: dense breast tissue, which can obscure tumours on imaging, and small tumour size, particularly cancers 2 cm or smaller, which were nearly five times more likely to be missed.</p>
<p>However, the researchers also tested a potential solution. Two radiologists reviewed only the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) portion of the MRI scans, a rapid, contrast-free technique that measures how water moves through tissue. Using a simple confidence scale, they determined whether the DWI images suggested cancer.</p>
<p>Their findings offered reassurance: DWI alone identified the majority of cancers the AI had overlooked, detecting 83.5% of missed lesions for one radiologist and 79.5% for the other. The readers showed substantial agreement in their interpretations, suggesting the method is both reliable and reproducible. DWI performed best for cancers larger than one centimetre and for tumours that were invisible on mammograms, though its accuracy dropped for very small lesions under one centimetre.</p>
<h2><strong>Next Steps for Improving AI in Breast Imaging</strong></h2>
<p>Experts say the results show that while AI is becoming a powerful tool in breast imaging, it is not infallible. The study indicates that supplementing AI-based screening with DWI could serve as an effective safety net, especially for women with dense breasts, where both human and machine readers tend to struggle.</p>
<p>Still, the authors caution that the research has limits. Because the study included only women already diagnosed with cancer and was conducted at a single institution, the findings may not represent broader screening populations. They call for prospective, multicentre trials to confirm whether DWI can reliably enhance AI-assisted breast cancer detection.</p>

        <section>
            <!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->
<p>I need everyone to stop looking at <code>go.sum</code>, <em>especially</em> to analyze dependency graphs. It is not a “lockfile,”<sup id="fnref:lockfile"><a href="#fn:lockfile">1</a></sup> and it has zero semantic effects on version resolution. There is truly no use case for ever parsing it outside of cmd/go.</p>
<p><code>go.sum</code> is only a local cache for the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database">Go Checksum Database</a>. It’s a map of module versions to their cryptographic hashes. Those versions may or may not be in use; it doesn’t matter to package resolution.</p>
<p><code>go.sum</code> was not even enabled by default in the original modules design, precisely because it has no observable effect on builds!<sup id="fnref:default"><a href="#fn:default">2</a></sup> Its (important) purpose is exclusively tightening the security story: the Checksum Database ensures the whole ecosystem shares the same contents for a given module version, regardless of how it is downloaded, and <code>go.sum</code> makes that guarantee local and self-contained.</p>
<p>Instead, just look at <code>go.mod</code>. It lists the precise version at which all dependencies are built. <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-go">Since Go 1.17</a> (released August 2021), it includes all transitive dependencies needed to build the main module and its tests.<sup id="fnref:other"><a href="#fn:other">3</a></sup></p>
<p>You can either parse <code>go.mod</code> with <a href="https://golang.org/x/mod/modfile">golang.org/x/mod/modfile</a>, run <code>go mod edit -json</code> to get its JSON representation,<sup id="fnref:all"><a href="#fn:all">4</a></sup> or parse it according to <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file">its specification</a>.</p>
<p>This is the end of the Public Service Announcement. Read on for some <code>go.mod</code> nerdery.</p>
<h2 id="manifests-and-lockfiles">Manifests and lockfiles</h2>
<p>The enduring confusion around <code>go.mod</code> and <code>go.sum</code> is due to the fact that most other languages also have two package-related files, but theirs <em>both</em> matter to version resolution. These two files are usually called manifest and lockfile.</p>
<p>The manifest (e.g. <code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>package.json</code>, <code>Cargo.toml</code>) usually lists <em>some</em> dependencies along with potentially complex rules for which versions are supported. These rules usually apply transitively to dependents, making version resolution extremely hard and/or slow in the general case, and sometimes unsolvable. The manifest is not always<sup id="fnref:direct"><a href="#fn:direct">5</a></sup> guaranteed to list all direct dependencies, and no automated mechanism ensures your code actually works with e.g. the minimum allowed manifest version of its dependencies.<sup id="fnref:cargomin"><a href="#fn:cargomin">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The lockfile (e.g. <code>uv.lock</code>, <code>package-lock.json</code>, <code>Cargo.lock</code>) is a relatively recent innovation in some ecosystems, and it lists the actual versions used in the most recent build. It is not really human-readable, and is <a href="https://research.swtch.com/cargo-newest.html">ignored by dependents</a>, allowing <a href="https://research.swtch.com/npm-colors">the rapid spread of supply-chain attacks</a>.</p>
<p>I honestly find the manifest version ranges essentially useless (because the lower bounds are not normally tested and hence largely incorrect, while I never had a use case for complex upper bounds). I also get endlessly confused trying to remember which commands modify the lockfile (and when/why) and which ones respect it.</p>
<p>In Go, <code>go.mod</code> serves as both manifest and lockfile, and more: it lists all dependencies, direct and transitive, and their exact version to be used when the module is the main module. Semantic versioning is assumed, and those versions are also the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#minimal-version-selection">minimum versions</a> applied to dependents’ module graphs. Different major versions of the same module are considered essentially separate modules.</p>
<p>Notice how there is no way to accidentally use a feature introduced in a version that your dependents won’t have. Also, when adding a dependency, you don’t automatically get the latest—potentially untested/compromised—version of all <em>its</em> dependencies. Finally, there can’t be diamond dependency conflicts.</p>
<p>All that with a single, human-readable file: <code>go.mod</code>.</p>
<p>All <code>go</code> commands take a <code>-mod</code> flag. If set to <code>mod</code>, missing dependencies can be added to <code>go.mod</code> automatically if necessary, and partial manual changes are reconciled. If set to <code>readonly</code>, those are errors. <code>go mod tidy</code> and (effectively) <code>go get</code> default to <code>mod</code>; all other commands default to <code>readonly</code>.</p>
<p>Go modules truly don’t get enough credit for how much simpler they are compared to the alternatives. In other ecosystems, package resolution time going down below 1s is celebrated (and is indeed an impressive technical achievement given the design’s requirements!). In Go, no one ever noticed package resolution happening, so there is nothing to celebrate.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p>There are bugs in your kernel right now that won't be found for years. I know because I analyzed 125,183 of them, every bug with a traceable <code>Fixes:</code> tag in the Linux kernel's 20-year git history.</p>
<p>The average kernel bug lives <strong>2.1 years</strong> before discovery. But some subsystems are far worse: CAN bus drivers average <strong>4.2 years</strong>, SCTP networking <strong>4.0 years</strong>. The longest-lived bug in my dataset, a buffer overflow in ethtool, sat in the kernel for <strong>20.7 years</strong>. The one which I'll dissect in detail is refcount leak in netfilter, and it lasted <strong>19 years</strong>.</p>
<p>I built a tool that catches 92% of historical bugs in a held-out test set at commit time. Here's what I learned.</p>

<h2>The initial discovery</h2>
<p>I started by mining the most recent 10,000 commits with <code>Fixes:</code> tags from the Linux kernel. After filtering out invalid references (commits that pointed to hashes outside the repo, malformed tags, or merge commits), I had <strong>9,876 valid vulnerability records</strong>. For the lifetime analysis, I excluded 27 same-day fixes (bugs introduced and fixed within hours), leaving <strong>9,849 bugs</strong> with meaningful lifetimes.</p>
<p>The results were striking:</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>Almost 20% of bugs had been hiding for <strong>5+ years</strong>. The networking subsystem looked particularly bad at <strong>5.1 years</strong> average. I found a refcount leak in netfilter that had been in the kernel for <strong>19 years</strong>.</p>

<em>Initial findings: Half of bugs found within a year, but 20% hide for 5+ years.</em></p>
<p>But something nagged at me: my dataset only contained fixes from 2025. Was I seeing the full picture, or just the tip of the iceberg?</p>
<h2>Going deeper: Mining the full history</h2>
<p>I rewrote my miner to capture <strong>every</strong> <code>Fixes:</code> tag since Linux moved to git in 2005. Six hours later, I had 125,183 vulnerability records which was 12x larger than my initial dataset.</p>
<p>The numbers changed significantly:</p>

<em>Full history: 57% of bugs found within a year. The long tail is smaller than it first appeared.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why the difference?</strong> My initial 2025-only dataset was biased. Fixes in 2025 include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New bugs</strong> introduced recently and caught quickly</li>
<li><strong>Ancient bugs</strong> that finally got discovered after years of hiding</li>
</ul>
<p>The ancient bugs skewed the average upward. When you include the full history with all the bugs that were introduced AND fixed within the same year, the average drops from 2.8 to 2.1 years.</p>
<h2>The real story: We're getting faster (but it's complicated)</h2>

<p>Bugs introduced in 2010 took nearly 10 years to find and bugs introduced in 2024 are found in 5 months. At first glance it looks like a 20x improvement!</p>
<p>But here's the catch: <strong>this data is right-censored</strong>. Bugs introduced in 2022 <em>can't</em> have a 10-year lifetime yet since we're only in 2026. We might find more 2022 bugs in 2030 that bring the average up.</p>
<p>The fairer comparison is "% found within 1 year" and that IS improving: from 0% (2010) to 69% (2022). That's real progress, likely driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syzkaller (released 2015)</li>
<li>KASAN, KMSAN, KCSAN sanitizers</li>
<li>Better static analysis</li>
<li>More contributors reviewing code</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But there's a backlog.</strong> When I look at just the bugs fixed in 2024-2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>60% were introduced in the last 2 years (new bugs, caught quickly)</li>
<li>18% were introduced 5-10 years ago</li>
<li><strong>6.5% were introduced 10+ years ago</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We're simultaneously catching new bugs faster AND slowly working through ~5,400 ancient bugs that have been hiding for over 5 years.</p>
<h2>The methodology</h2>
<p>The kernel has a convention: when a commit fixes a bug, it includes a <code>Fixes:</code> tag pointing to the commit that introduced the bug.</p>
<pre><code>commit de788b2e6227
Author: Florian Westphal &lt;fw@strlen.de&gt;

    netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump

    Fixes: d205dc40798d ("netfilter: ctnetlink: ...")
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote a miner that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Runs <code>git log --grep="Fixes:"</code> to find all fixing commits</li>
<li>Extracts the referenced commit hash from the <code>Fixes:</code> tag</li>
<li>Pulls dates from both commits</li>
<li>Classifies subsystem from file paths (70+ patterns)</li>
<li>Detects bug type from commit message keywords</li>
<li>Calculates the lifetime</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>fixes_pattern = r'Fixes:\s*([0-9a-f]{12,40})'
match = re.search(fixes_pattern, commit_message)
if match:
    introducing_hash = match.group(1)
    lifetime_days = (fixing_date - introducing_date).days

<p><strong>Coverage note:</strong> The kernel has ~448,000 commits mentioning "fix" in some form, but only ~124,000 (28%) use proper <code>Fixes:</code> tags. My dataset captures the well-documented bugs aka the ones where maintainers traced the root cause.</p>

<em>CAN bus and SCTP bugs persist longest. BPF and GPU bugs get caught fastest.</em></p>
<p>CAN bus drivers and SCTP networking have bugs that persist longest probably because both are niche protocols with less testing coverage. GPU (especially Intel i915) and BPF bugs get caught fastest, probably thanks to dedicated fuzzing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Networking looked terrible in the 2025-only data (5.2 years!) but is actually closer to average in the full history (2.9 years). The 2025 fixes were catching a backlog of ancient networking bugs. GPU looks the same either way, and those bugs get caught consistently fast.</p>

<p>Why do race conditions hide so long? They're non-deterministic and only trigger under specific timing conditions that might occur once per million executions. Even sanitizers like KCSAN can only flag races they observe.</p>
<p><strong>30% of bugs are self-fixes</strong> where the same person who introduced the bug eventually fixed it. I guess code ownership matters.</p>
<h2>Why some bugs hide longer</h2>
<p><strong>Less fuzzing coverage.</strong> Syzkaller excels at syscall fuzzing but struggles with stateful protocols. Fuzzing netfilter effectively requires generating valid packet sequences that traverse specific connection tracking states.</p>
<p><strong>Harder to trigger.</strong> Many networking bugs require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific packet sequences</li>
<li>Race conditions between concurrent flows</li>
<li>Memory pressure during table operations</li>
<li>Particular NUMA topologies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Older code with fewer eyes.</strong> Core networking infrastructure like <code>nf_conntrack</code> was written in the mid-2000s. It works, so nobody rewrites it. But "stable" means fewer developers actively reviewing.</p>
<h2>Case study: 19 years in the kernel</h2>
<p>One of the oldest networking bug in my dataset was introduced in <strong>August 2006</strong> and fixed in <strong>August 2025</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>// ctnetlink_dump_table() - the buggy code path
if (res &lt; 0) {
    nf_conntrack_get(&amp;ct-&gt;ct_general);  // increments refcount
    cb-&gt;args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;
    break;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The irony:</strong> Commit <code>d205dc40798d</code> was itself a fix: "[NETFILTER]: ctnetlink: fix deadlock in table dumping". Patrick McHardy was fixing a deadlock by removing a <code>_put()</code> call. In doing so, he introduced a refcount leak that would persist for 19 years.</p>
<p>The bug: the code doesn't check if <code>ct == last</code>. If the current entry is the same as the one we already saved, we've now incremented its refcount twice but will only decrement it once. The object never gets freed.</p>
<pre><code>// What should have been checked:
if (res &lt; 0) {
    if (ct != last)  // &lt;-- this check was missing for 19 years
        nf_conntrack_get(&amp;ct-&gt;ct_general);
    cb-&gt;args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;
    break;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The consequence:</strong> Memory leaks accumulate. Eventually <code>nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list()</code> waits forever for the refcount to hit zero. The netns teardown hangs. If you're using containers, this blocks container cleanup indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Why it took 19 years:</strong> You had to run <code>conntrack_resize.sh</code> in a loop for ~20 minutes under memory pressure. The fix commit says: "This can be reproduced by running conntrack_resize.sh selftest in a loop. It takes ~20 minutes for me on a preemptible kernel." Nobody ran that specific test sequence for two decades.</p>
<h2>Incomplete fixes are common</h2>
<p>Here's a pattern I keep seeing: someone notices undefined behavior, ships a fix, but the fix doesn't fully close the hole.</p>
<p><strong>Case study: netfilter set field validation</strong></p>

<td><code>1b9335a8000f</code></td>
<td>Security researcher finds a bypass. The 2024 fix was incomplete—there were still code paths that could mismatch. Real fix shipped.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The 2024 fix was an acknowledgment that something was wrong, but Pablo couldn't find a crash, so the fix was conservative. A year later, someone found the crash.</p>
<p><strong>This pattern suggests a detection opportunity:</strong> commits that say things like "this is undefined behavior" or "I couldn't trigger this but..." are flags. The author knows something is wrong but hasn't fully characterized the bug. These deserve extra scrutiny.</p>
<h2>The anatomy of a long-lived bug</h2>
<p>Looking at the bugs that survive 10+ years, I see common patterns:</p>
<p><strong>1. Reference counting errors</strong></p>
<pre><code>kref_get(&amp;obj-&gt;ref);
// ... error path returns without kref_put()
</code></pre>
<p>These don't crash immediately. They leak memory slowly. In a long-running system, you might not notice until months later when OOM killer starts firing.</p>
<p><strong>2. Missing NULL checks after dereference</strong></p>
<pre><code>struct foo *f = get_foo();
f-&gt;bar = 1;              // dereference happens first
if (!f) return -EINVAL;  // check comes too late
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler might optimize away the NULL check since you already dereferenced. These survive because the pointer is rarely NULL in practice.</p>
<p><strong>3. Integer overflow in size calculations</strong></p>
<pre><code>size_t total = n_elements * element_size;  // can overflow
buf = kmalloc(total, GFP_KERNEL);
memcpy(buf, src, n_elements * element_size);  // copies more than allocated
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>n_elements</code> comes from userspace, an attacker can cause allocation of a small buffer followed by a large copy.</p>
<p><strong>4. Race conditions in state machines</strong></p>
<pre><code>spin_lock(&amp;lock);
if (state == READY) {
    spin_unlock(&amp;lock);
    // window here where another thread can change state
    do_operation();  // assumes state is still READY
}
</code></pre>
<p>These require precise timing to hit. They might manifest as rare crashes that nobody can reproduce.</p>
<h2>Can we catch these bugs automatically?</h2>
<p>Every day a bug lives in the kernel is another day millions of devices are vulnerable. Android phones, servers, embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, all running kernel code with bugs that won't be found for years.</p>
<p>I built VulnBERT, a model that predicts whether a commit introduces a vulnerability.</p>

<p><strong>The problem with vanilla CodeBERT:</strong> I first tried fine-tuning CodeBERT directly. Results: 89% recall but <strong>48% false positive rate</strong> (measured on the same test set). Unusable, flagging half of all commits.</p>
<p>Why so bad? CodeBERT learns shortcuts: "big diff = dangerous", "lots of pointers = risky". These correlations exist in training data but don't generalize. The model pattern-matches on surface features, not actual bug patterns.</p>
<p><strong>The VulnBERT approach:</strong> Combine neural pattern recognition with human domain expertise.</p>

<p><strong>Three innovations that drove performance:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Chunked encoding for long diffs.</strong> CodeBERT's 512-token limit truncates most kernel diffs (often 2000+ tokens). I split into chunks, encode each, then use learned attention to aggregate:</p>
<pre><code># Learnable attention over chunks
chunk_attention = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size // 4),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.Linear(hidden_size // 4, 1)
)
attention_weights = F.softmax(chunk_attention(chunk_embeddings), dim=1)
pooled = (attention_weights * chunk_embeddings).sum(dim=1)
</code></pre>
<p>The model learns which chunks matter aka the one with <code>spin_lock</code> without <code>spin_unlock</code>, not the boilerplate.</p>
<p><strong>2. Feature fusion via cross-attention.</strong> Neural networks miss domain-specific patterns. I extract 51 handcrafted features using regex and AST-like analysis of the diff:</p>

<p>The key bug-pattern features:</p>
<pre><code>'unbalanced_refcount': 1,    # kref_get without kref_put → leak
'unbalanced_lock': 1,        # spin_lock without spin_unlock → deadlock
'has_deref_no_null_check': 0,# *ptr without if(!ptr) → null deref
'has_alloc_no_free': 0,      # kmalloc without kfree → memory leak
</code></pre>
<p>Cross-attention learns <em>conditional</em> relationships. When CodeBERT sees locking patterns AND <code>unbalanced_lock=1</code>, that's HIGH risk. Neither signal alone is sufficient, it's the combination.</p>
<pre><code># Feature fusion via cross-attention
feature_embedding = feature_projection(handcrafted_features)  # 51 → 768
attended, _ = cross_attention(
    query=code_embedding,      # What patterns does the code have?
    key=feature_embedding,     # What do the hand-crafted features say?
    value=feature_embedding
)
fused = fusion_layer(torch.cat([code_embedding, attended], dim=-1))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3. Focal loss for hard examples.</strong> The training data is imbalanced where most commits are safe. Standard cross-entropy wastes gradient updates on easy examples. Focal loss:</p>
<pre><code>Standard loss when p=0.95 (easy):  0.05
Focal loss when p=0.95:            0.000125  (400x smaller)
</code></pre>
<p>The model focuses on ambiguous commits: the hard 5% that matter.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p><strong>Dataset limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only captures bugs with <code>Fixes:</code> tags (~28% of fix commits). Selection bias: well-documented bugs tend to be more serious.</li>
<li>Mainline only, doesn't include stable-branch-only fixes or vendor patches</li>
<li>Subsystem classification is heuristic-based (regex on file paths)</li>
<li>Bug type detection based on keyword matching in commit messages and many bugs are "unknown" type</li>
<li>Lifetime calculation uses author dates, not commit dates, rebasing can skew timestamps</li>
<li>Some "bugs" may be theoretical (comments like "fix possible race" without confirmed trigger)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Model limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>92.2% recall is on a <strong>held-out 2024 test set</strong>, not a guarantee for future bugs</li>
<li>Can't catch semantic bugs (logic errors with no syntactic signal)</li>
<li>Cross-function blind spots (bug spans multiple files)</li>
<li>Training data bias (learns patterns from bugs that <em>were found</em>, novel patterns may be missed)</li>
<li>False positives on intentional patterns (init/cleanup in different commits)</li>
<li>Tested only on Linux kernel code, may not generalize to other codebases</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statistical limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Survivorship bias in year-over-year comparisons (recent bugs can't have long lifetimes yet)</li>
<li>Correlation ≠ causation for subsystem/bug-type lifetime differences</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> VulnBERT is a triage tool, not a guarantee. It catches 92% of bugs with recognizable patterns. The remaining 8% and novel bug classes still need human review and fuzzing.</p>
<h2>What's next</h2>
<p>92.2% recall with 1.2% FPR is production-ready. But there's more to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RL-based exploration</strong>: Instead of static pattern matching, train an agent to explore code paths and find bugs autonomously. The current model predicts risk; an RL agent could <em>generate</em> triggering inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Syzkaller integration</strong>: Use fuzzer coverage as a reward signal. If the model flags a commit and Syzkaller finds a crash in that code path, that's strong positive signal.</li>
<li><strong>Subsystem-specific models</strong>: Networking bugs have different patterns than driver bugs. A model fine-tuned on netfilter might outperform the general model on netfilter commits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal isn't to replace human reviewers but to point them at the 10% of commits most likely to be problematic, so they can focus attention where it matters.</p>
<h2>Reproducing this</h2>
<p>The dataset extraction uses the kernel's <code>Fixes:</code> tag convention. Here's the core logic:</p>
<pre><code>def extract_fixes_tag(commit_msg: str) -&gt; Optional[str]:
    """Extract the commit ID from a Fixes: tag"""
    pattern = r'Fixes:\s*([a-f0-9]{12,40})'
    match = re.search(pattern, commit_msg, re.IGNORECASE)
    return match.group(1) if match else None

# Mine all Fixes: tags from git history
git log --since="2005-04-16" --grep="Fixes:" --format="%H"

# For each fixing commit:
#   - Extract introducing commit hash
#   - Get dates from both commits
#   - Calculate lifetime
#   - Classify subsystem from file paths
</code></pre>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>125,183 bugs</strong> analyzed from 20 years of Linux kernel git history (123,696 with valid lifetimes)</li>
<li><strong>Average bug lifetime:</strong> 2.1 years (2.8 years in 2025-only data due to survivorship bias in recent fixes)</li>
<li><strong>0% → 69%</strong> of bugs found within 1 year (2010 vs 2022) (real improvement from better tooling)</li>
<li><strong>13.5% of bugs hide for 5+ years</strong> (these are the dangerous ones)</li>
<li>Race conditions hide longest (<strong>5.1 years</strong> average)</li>

<p><strong>WITHDRAWING FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS: </strong>Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the withdrawal of the United States from 66 international organizations that no longer serve American interests.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Memorandum orders all Executive Departments and Agencies to cease participating in and funding 35 non-United Nations (UN) organizations and 31 UN entities that operate contrary to U.S. national interests, security, economic prosperity, or sovereignty.</li>



<li>This follows a review ordered earlier this year of all international intergovernmental organizations, conventions, and treaties that the United States is a member of or party to, or that the United States funds or supports.</li>



<li>These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over U.S. priorities, or that address important issues inefficiently or ineffectively such that U.S. taxpayer dollars are best allocated in other ways to support the relevant missions. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>RESTORING AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY: </strong>President Trump is ending U.S. participation in international organizations that undermine America’s independence and waste taxpayer dollars on ineffective or hostile agendas.</p>



<ul>
<li>Many of these bodies promote radical climate policies, global governance, and ideological programs that conflict with U.S. sovereignty and economic strength.</li>



<li>American taxpayers have spent billions on these organizations with little return, while they often criticize U.S. policies, advance agendas contrary to our values, or waste taxpayer dollars by purporting to address important issues but not achieving any real results.</li>



<li>By exiting these entities, President Trump is saving taxpayer money and refocusing resources on America First priorities.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>PUTTING AMERICA FIRST ON THE GLOBAL STAGE: </strong>President Trump has consistently fought to protect U.S. sovereignty and ensure international engagements serve American interests.</p>



<ul>
<li>Immediately upon returning to office, President Trump initiated the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.</li>



<li>On Day One of his Administration, President Trump also signed a Presidential Memorandum to notify the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that its Global Tax Deal has no force or effect in the United States, and direct an investigation into whether foreign countries have tax rules in place that are extraterritorial or disproportionately affect American companies.</li>



<li>Just weeks later, President Trump signed an Executive Order withdrawing the United States from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and prohibiting any future funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency for the Near East (UNRWA).</li>



<li>He has prioritized American interests by redirecting focus and resources toward domestic priorities such as infrastructure, military readiness, and border security, and acting swiftly to protect American companies from foreign interference.</li>

INTRODUCTION:
------------

Musashi is a Motorola 68000, 68010, 68EC020, 68020, 68EC030, 68030, 68EC040 and
68040 emulator written in C.  This emulator was written with two goals in mind:
portability and speed.

The emulator is written to ANSI C89 specifications.  It also uses inline
functions, which are C9X compliant.

It has been successfully running in the MAME project (<a href="http://www.mame.net/" rel="nofollow">www.mame.net</a>) for years
and so has had time to mature.

BASIC CONFIGURATION:
-------------------
The basic configuration will give you a standard 68000 that has sufficient
functionality to work in a primitive environment.

This setup assumes that you only have 1 device interrupting it, that the
device will always request an autovectored interrupt, and it will always clear
the interrupt before the interrupt service routine finishes (but could
possibly re-assert the interrupt).
You will have only one address space, no tracing, and no instruction prefetch.

To implement the basic configuration:

- Open m68kconf.h and verify that the settings for INLINE will work with your
  compiler. (Currently set to "static __inline__", which works in gcc 2.9.
  For C9X compliance, it should be "inline")

- In your host program, implement the following functions:
    unsigned int  m68k_read_memory_8(unsigned int address);
    unsigned int  m68k_read_memory_16(unsigned int address);
    unsigned int  m68k_read_memory_32(unsigned int address);
    void m68k_write_memory_8(unsigned int address, unsigned int value);
    void m68k_write_memory_16(unsigned int address, unsigned int value);
    void m68k_write_memory_32(unsigned int address, unsigned int value);

- In your host program, be sure to call m68k_pulse_reset() once before calling
  any of the other functions as this initializes the core.

- Use m68k_execute() to execute instructions and m68k_set_irq() to cause an
  interrupt.



ADDING PROPER INTERRUPT HANDLING:
--------------------------------
The interrupt handling in the basic configuration doesn't emulate the
interrupt acknowledge phase of the CPU and automatically clears an interrupt
request during interrupt processing.
While this works for most systems, you may need more accurate interrupt
handling.

To add proper interrupt handling:

- In m68kconf.h, set M68K_EMULATE_INT_ACK to OPT_SPECIFY_HANDLER

- In m68kconf.h, set M68K_INT_ACK_CALLBACK(A) to your interrupt acknowledge
  routine

- Your interrupt acknowledge routine must return an interrupt vector,
  M68K_INT_ACK_AUTOVECTOR, or M68K_INT_ACK_SPURIOUS.  most m68k
  implementations just use autovectored interrupts.

- When the interrupting device is satisfied, you must call m68k_set_irq(0) to
  remove the interrupt request.



MULTIPLE INTERRUPTS:
-------------------
The above system will work if you have only one device interrupting the CPU,
but if you have more than one device, you must do a bit more.

To add multiple interrupts:

- You must make an interrupt arbitration device that will take the highest
  priority interrupt and encode it onto the IRQ pins on the CPU.

- The interrupt arbitration device should use m68k_set_irq() to set the
  highest pending interrupt, or 0 for no interrupts pending.



SEPARATE IMMEDIATE READS:
------------------------
You can write faster memory access functions if you know whether you are
fetching from ROM or RAM.  Immediate reads are always from the program space
(Always in ROM unless it is running self-modifying code).

To enable separate immediate reads:

- In m68kconf.h, turn on M68K_SEPARATE_READ_IMM.

- In your host program, implement the following functions:
    unsigned int  m68k_read_immediate_16(unsigned int address);
    unsigned int  m68k_read_immediate_32(unsigned int address);

    Now you also have the pcrelative stuff:
    unsigned int  m68k_read_pcrelative_8(unsigned int address);
    unsigned int  m68k_read_pcrelative_16(unsigned int address);
    unsigned int  m68k_read_pcrelative_32(unsigned int address);

- If you need to know the current PC (for banking and such), set
  M68K_MONITOR_PC to OPT_SPECIFY_HANDLER, and set M68K_SET_PC_CALLBACK(A) to
  your routine.

- In the unlikely case where you need to emulate some PMMU in the immediate
  reads and/or pcrealtive stuff, you'll need to explicitely call the
  translation address mechanism from your user functions this way :

    if (PMMU_ENABLED)
        address = pmmu_translate_addr(address);

  (this is handled automatically by normal memory accesses).

ADDRESS SPACES:
--------------
Most systems will only implement one address space, placing ROM at the lower
addresses and RAM at the higher.  However, there is the possibility that a
system will implement ROM and RAM in the same address range, but in different
address spaces.

In this case, you might get away with assuming that immediate reads are in the
program space and all other reads are in the data space, if it weren't for the
fact that the exception vectors are fetched from the data space.  As a result,
anyone implementing this kind of system will have to copy the vector table
from ROM to RAM using pc-relative instructions.

This makes things bad for emulation, because this means that a non-immediate
read is not necessarily in the data space.
The m68k deals with this by encoding the requested address space on the
function code pins:

                       FC
    Address Space      210
    ------------------ ---
    USER DATA          001
    USER PROGRAM       010
    SUPERVISOR DATA    101
    SUPERVISOR PROGRAM 110
    CPU SPACE          111 &lt;-- not emulated in this core since we emulate
                               interrupt acknowledge in another way.

To emulate the function code pins:

- In m68kconf.h, set M68K_EMULATE_FC to OPT_SPECIFY_HANDLER and set
  M68K_SET_FC_CALLBACK(A) to your function code handler function.

- Your function code handler should select the proper address space for
  subsequent calls to m68k_read_xx (and m68k_write_xx for 68010+).

Note: immediate reads are always done from program space, so technically you
      don't need to implement the separate immediate reads, although you could
      gain more speed improvements leaving them in and doing some clever
      programming.



USING DIFFERENT CPU TYPES:
-------------------------
The default is to enable only the 68000 cpu type.  To change this, change the
settings for M68K_EMULATE_010 etc in m68kconf.h.

To set the CPU type you want to use:

- Make sure it is enabled in m68kconf.h.  Current switches are:
    M68K_EMULATE_010
    M68K_EMULATE_EC020
    M68K_EMULATE_020

- In your host program, call m68k_set_cpu_type() and then call
  m68k_pulse_reset().  Valid CPU types are:
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_68000,
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_68010,
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_68EC020,
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_68020,
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_68EC030,
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_68030,
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_68EC040,
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_68040,
    M68K_CPU_TYPE_SCC68070 (which is a 68010 with a 32 bit data bus).

CLOCK FREQUENCY:
---------------
In order to emulate the correct clock frequency, you will have to calculate
how long it takes the emulation to execute a certain number of "cycles" and
vary your calls to m68k_execute() accordingly.
As well, it is a good idea to take away the CPU's timeslice when it writes to
a memory-mapped port in order to give the device it wrote to a chance to
react.

You can use the functions m68k_cycles_run(), m68k_cycles_remaining(),
m68k_modify_timeslice(), and m68k_end_timeslice() to do this.
Try to use large cycle values in your calls to m68k_execute() since it will
increase throughput.  You can always take away the timeslice later.



MORE CORRECT EMULATION:
----------------------
You may need to enable these in order to properly emulate some of the more
obscure functions of the m68k:

- M68K_EMULATE_BKPT_ACK causes the CPU to call a breakpoint handler on a BKPT
  instruction

- M68K_EMULATE_TRACE causes the CPU to generate trace exceptions when the
  trace bits are set

- M68K_EMULATE_RESET causes the CPU to call a reset handler on a RESET
  instruction.

- M68K_EMULATE_PREFETCH emulates the 4-word instruction prefetch that is part
  of the 68000/68010 (needed for Amiga emulation).
  NOTE: if the CPU fetches a word or longword at an odd address when this
  option is on, it will yield unpredictable results, which is why a real
  68000 will generate an address error exception.

- M68K_EMULATE_ADDRESS_ERROR will cause the CPU to generate address error
  exceptions if it attempts to read a word or longword at an odd address.

- call m68k_pulse_halt() to emulate the HALT pin.



CONVENIENCE FUNCTIONS:
---------------------
These are in here for programmer convenience:

- M68K_INSTRUCTION_HOOK lets you call a handler before each instruction.

- M68K_LOG_ENABLE and M68K_LOG_1010_1111 lets you log illegal and A/F-line
  instructions.



MULTIPLE CPU EMULATION:
----------------------
The default is to use only one CPU.  To use more than one CPU in this core,
there are some things to keep in mind:

- To have different cpus call different functions, use OPT_ON instead of
  OPT_SPECIFY_HANDLER, and use the m68k_set_xxx_callback() functions to set
  your callback handlers on a per-cpu basis.

- Be sure to call set_cpu_type() for each CPU you use.

- Use m68k_set_context() and m68k_get_context() to switch to another CPU.



LOAD AND SAVE CPU CONTEXTS FROM DISK:
------------------------------------
You can use them68k_load_context() and m68k_save_context() functions to load
and save the CPU state to disk.



GET/SET INFORMATION FROM THE CPU:
--------------------------------
You can use m68k_get_reg() and m68k_set_reg() to gain access to the internals
of the CPU.



EXAMPLE:
-------

The subdir example contains a full example (currently linux &amp; Dos only).

Compilation
-----------

You can use the default Makefile in Musashi's directory, it works like this :
1st build m68kmake, which will build m68kops.c and m68kops.h based on the
contents of m68k_in.c.
Then compile m68kcpu.o and m68kops.o. Add m68kdasm.o if you want the
disassemble functions. When linking this to your project you will need libm
for the fpu emulation of the 68040.

Using some custom m68kconf.h outside Musashi's directory
--------------------------------------------------------

It can be useful to keep an untouched musashi directory in a project (from
git for example) and maintain a separate m68kconf.h specific to the
project. For this, pass -DMUSASHI_CNF="mycustomconfig.h" to gcc (or whatever
compiler you use). Notice that if you use an unix shell (or make which uses
the shell to launch its commands), then you need to escape the quotes like
this : -DMUSASHI_CNF=\"mycustomconfig.h\"

<p><b>Sample screenshot of the Aardwolf Client</b></p>

<p>You can play the game solo or group with other players, focus on gaining experience and levels, take part in hundreds of quests, solve puzzles, explore, map, play casino games for in-game currency, join a clan, take part in our forums, enchant and craft equipment, compete with other players in
player-vs-player combat and global quests, answer trivia, create your own
private manor, experiment with hundreds of spells and skills and even, eventually, build your own additions to the world.</p>
<p>If you have never played a text based RPG before, we offer an extensive in-game help system to help you get started and a team of volunteer
"helpers" who answer questions in real time. We also have a very detailed
starting area called "The Aylorian Academy" - your first major quest in the
game where you are guided through playing Aardwolf in an interactive format.</p>
<p>To learn more about MUDs in general, see the <a href="http://www.aardwolf.com/about-muds.html">introduction to MUDs</a> article. To jump in and get started, visit the <a href="http://www.aardwolf.com/play/index.htm">"Play now"</a> page to choose from a selection of online and downloadable clients.</p>

<p>For builders, Aardwolf features an embedded LUA interpreter allowing area developers to add atmosphere to their areas and create area puzzles and quests. See our building section for more information on the LUA integration.</p>

            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has a new budget under the current administration, and they are going on a surveillance tech shopping spree. Standing at </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex"><span>$28.7 billion dollars for the year 2025 (nearly triple their 2024 budget)</span></a><span> and at least another $56.25 billion over the next three years, ICE's budget would be the envy of many national militaries around the world. Indeed, this budget would put ICE as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_highest_military_expenditures"><span>14th most well-funded military in the world, right between Ukraine and Israel</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are many different agencies under U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that deal with immigration, as well as non-immigration related agencies such as Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ICE is specifically the enforcement arm of the U.S. immigration apparatus. Their stated mission is to “[p]rotect America through criminal investigations and enforcing immigration laws to preserve national security and public safety.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, ICE doesn’t just end up targeting, </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/ice-wants-go-after-dissenters-well-immigrants"><span>surveilling</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will"><span>harassing</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/06/vancouver-ice-alleged-crushing-legs/"><span>assaulting</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/woman-says-she-was-detained-by-ice-in-minneapolis-for-being-a-citizen-observer/"><span>detaining</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/12/estados-unidos-nuevas-investigaciones-revelan-violaciones-de-derechos-humanos-en-los-centros-de-detencion-de-alligator-alcatraz-y-krome-en-florida/"><span>torturing</span></a><span> people who are undocumented immigrants. They have </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will"><span>targeted people</span></a><span> on </span><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/30/tacoma-hillsboro-victor-cruz-ice-immigration-oregon-law-enforcement/"><span>work permits</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/ice-kidnapped-my-neighbor-in-broad-daylight-the-aftermath-left-me-reeling/"><span>asylum seekers</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/ice-lawsuit-violent-assault"><span>permanent residents</span></a><span> (people holding “green cards”), </span><a href="https://sahanjournal.com/immigration/ice-arrest-cedar-riverside-minneapolis-somali-man/"><span>naturalized citizens</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/i-m-citizen-ice-wrongfully-detained-me-21244415.php"><span>even citizens by birth.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the NSA and FBI might be the first agencies that come to mind when thinking about surveillance in the U.S., ICE should not be discounted. ICE has always engaged in </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/ice-releases-documents-detailing-electronic-surveillance-problems-and-then-demands"><span>surveillance</span></a><span> and intelligence-gathering as part of their mission. A </span><a href="https://americandragnet.org/"><span>2022 report</span></a><span> by Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology found the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>ICE had scanned the driver’s license photos of 1 in 3 adults.</span></li>
<li><span>ICE had access to the driver’s license data of 3 in 4 adults.</span></li>
<li><span>ICE was tracking the movements of drivers in cities home to 3 in 4 adults.</span></li>
<li><span>ICE could locate 3 in 4 adults through their utility records.</span></li>
<li><span>​​ICE built its surveillance dragnet by tapping data from private companies and state and local bureaucracies.</span></li>
<li><span>ICE spent approximately $2.8 billion between 2008 and 2021 on new surveillance, data collection and data-sharing programs.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>With a budget for 2025 that is 10 times the size of the agency’s total surveillance spending over the last 13 years, ICE is going on a shopping spree, creating one of the largest, most comprehensive domestic surveillance machines in history.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>How We Got Here</span></h2>
<p><span>The entire surveillance industry has been allowed to grow and flourish under both Democratic and Republican regimes. For example, President Obama dramatically expanded ICE from its more limited origins, while at the same time narrowing its focus to undocumented people accused of crimes. Under the first and second Trump administrations, ICE ramped up its operations significantly, increasing raids in major cities far from the southern border and casting a much wider net on potential targets. ICE has most recently expanded its partnerships with sheriffs across the U.S., and deported more than 1.5 million people cumulatively under the Trump administrations (600,000 of those were just during the first year of Trump’s second term </span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/10/thanks-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-more-25-million-illegal-aliens-left-us"><span>according to DHS statistics</span></a><span>), not including the 1.6 million people DHS claims have “self-deported.” More horrifying is that in just the last year of the current administration, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251217221208/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_in_the_second_Trump_administration"><span>4,250 people</span></a><span> detained by ICE </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2025/03/17/ice-has-disappeared-48-new-mexico-residents-attorneys-say/"><span>have</span></a> <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article312042943.html"><span>gone</span></a> <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/could-ice-have-lost-3000-immigrant-arrestees-in-chicago/3844220/"><span>missing</span></a><span>, and 31 have died </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline"><span>in custody</span></a><span> or while </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-farmworker-dies-immigration-raid-rcna218467"><span>being detained</span></a><span>. In contrast, </span><a href="https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting"><span>24 people died in ICE custody during the entirety of the Biden administration</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>ICE also has openly stated that they plan to spy on the American public, looking for </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/countering-domestic-terrorism-and-organized-political-violence/"><span>any signs of left-wing dissent</span></a><span> against their domestic military-like presence. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in a</span><a href="https://pod.wave.co/podcast/the-glenn-beck-program/glenns-tough-message-to-the-ice-shooters-mom-guests-todd-lyons-dr-jay-bhattacharya-92525"> <span>recent interview</span></a><span> that his agency “was dedicated to the mission of going after” Antifa and left-wing gun clubs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On a long enough timeline, any surveillance tool you build will eventually be used by people you don’t like for reasons that you disagree with.</span></p>
<p><span>On a long enough timeline, any surveillance tool you build will eventually be used by people you don’t like for reasons that you disagree with. A surveillance-industrial complex and a democratic society are fundamentally incompatible, regardless of your political party.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>EFF recently </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/homeland-security-spending-trail-how-follow-money-through-us-government-databases"><span>published a guide</span></a><span> to using government databases to dig up homeland security spending and compiled our own </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/us-border-homeland-security-tech-vendors-dataset"><span>dataset</span></a><span> of companies selling tech to DHS components. In 2025, ICE entered new contracts with several private companies for location surveillance, social media surveillance, face surveillance, spyware, and phone surveillance. Let’s dig into each.</span></p>
<h2><span>Phone Surveillance Tools&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>One common surveillance tactic of immigration officials is to get physical access to a person’s phone, either while the person is detained at a border crossing, or while they are under arrest. </span><a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/29/ice-doesnt-want-you-to-know-why-they-bought-a-phone-cracking-system/"><span>ICE renewed an $11 million contract</span></a><span> with a company called Cellebrite, which helps ICE unlock phones and then can take a </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/forensic-extraction-tools"><span>complete image of all the data on the phone</span></a><span>, including apps, location history, photos, notes, call records, text messages, and even Signal and WhatsApp messages. ICE also signed a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/ice-unit-signs-new-3-million-contract-for-phone-hacking-tech/"><span>$3 million contract</span></a><span> with Cellebrite’s main competitor Magnet Forensics, makers of the Graykey device for unlocking phones. DHS has had contracts with Cellebrite since 2008, but the number of phones they search has risen dramatically each year, reaching a </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/phone-searches-at-the-us-border-hit-a-record-high/"><span>new high of 14,899 devices searched</span></a><span> by ICE’s sister agency U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) between April and June of 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If ICE can’t get physical access to your phone, that won’t stop them from trying to gain access to your data. They have also </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/ice-reactivates-contract-with-spyware-maker-paragon/"><span>resumed a $2 million contract with the spyware manufacturer, Paragon</span></a><span>. Paragon makes the Graphite spyware, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/paragon-spyware-used-to-target-citizens-across-europe-says-italian-government/"><span>which made headlines in 2025</span></a><span> for being found on the phones of several dozen members of Italian civil society. Graphite is able to harvest messages from multiple different encrypted chat apps such as Signal and WhatsApp without the user ever knowing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our concern with ICE buying this software is the likelihood that it will be used against undocumented people and immigrants who are here legally, as well as U.S. citizens who have spoken up against ICE or who work with immigrant communities. Malware such as Graphite can be used to read encrypted messages as they are sent, other forms of spyware can also download files, photos, location history, record phone calls, and even discretely turn on your microphone to record you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How to Protect Yourself&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>The most effective way to protect yourself from smartphone surveillance would be to not have a phone. But that’s not realistic advice in modern society. Fortunately, for most people there are other ways you can make it harder for ICE to spy on your digital life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first and easiest step is to keep your phone up to date. Installing security updates makes it harder to use </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/mobile-phones-malware#malware"><span>malware against you</span></a><span> and makes it less likely for Cellebrite to break into your phone. Likewise, both iPhone (</span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-enable-lockdown-mode-on-iphone"><span>Lockdown Mode</span></a><span>) and Android (</span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-android-privacy-and-security-settings#enable-advanced-protection"><span>Advanced Protection</span></a><span>) offer special modes that lock your phone down and can help protect against some malware.</span></p>
<p><span>The first and easiest step is to keep your phone up to date. </span></p>
<p><span>Having your phone’s software up to date and locked with a strong alphanumeric password will offer some protection against Cellebrite, depending on your model of phone. However, the strongest protection is simply to keep your phone turned off, which puts it in “before first unlock” mode and has been typically harder for law enforcement to bypass. This is good to do if you are at a protest and expect to be arrested, if you are crossing a border, or if you are expecting to encounter ICE. Keeping your phone on airplane mode should be enough to protect against cell-site simulators, but turning your phone off will offer extra protection against cell-site simulators and Cellebrite devices. If you aren’t able to turn your phone off, it’s a good idea to at least turn off </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/attending-protest#remove-fingerprint-or-face-unlock"><span>face/fingerprint unlock</span></a><span> to make it harder for police to force you to unlock your phone. While EFF continues to fight to strengthen our legal protections against compelling people to decrypt their devices, there is currently less protection against compelled face and fingerprint unlocking than there is against compelled password disclosure.</span></p>
<h2><span>Internet Surveillance&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>ICE has also spent $5 million to acquire at least two location and social media surveillance tools: Webloc and Tangles, </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-to-buy-tool-that-tracks-locations-of-hundreds-of-millions-of-phones-every-day/"><span>from a company called Pen Link</span></a><span>, an established player in the open source intelligence space. </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-lapd-is-using-controversial-mass-surveillance-tracking-software/"><span>Webloc gathers the locations of millions of phones</span></a><span> by gathering data from mobile data brokers and linking it together with other information about users. Tangles is a social media surveillance tool which combines web scraping with access to social media application programming interfaces. These tools are able to build a dossier on anyone who has a public social media account. Tangles is able to link together a <span>person’s</span> posting history, posts, and comments containing keywords, location history, tags, social graph, and photos with those of their friends and family. Penlink then sells this information to law enforcement, allowing law enforcement to avoid the need for a warrant. This means ICE can look up historic and current locations of many people all across the U.S. without ever having to get a warrant.</span></p>
<p><span>These tools are able to build a dossier on anyone who has a public social media account.</span></p>
<p><span>ICE also has established contracts with other social media scanning and AI analysis companies, such as </span><a href="https://perma.cc/K7CJ-S5YK"><span>a $4.2 million contract with a company called Fivecast</span></a><span> for the social media surveillance and AI analysis tool ONYX. </span><a href="https://perma.cc/K7CJ-S5YK"><span>According to Fivecast</span></a><span>, ONYX can conduct “automated, continuous and targeted collection of multimedia data” from all major “news streams, search engines, social media, marketplaces, the dark web, etc.” ONYX can build what it calls “digital footprints” from biographical data and curated datasets spanning numerous platforms, and “track shifts in sentiment and emotion” and identify the level of risk associated with an individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another contract is with ShadowDragon for their product Social Net, </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/the-200-sites-an-ice-surveillance-contractor-is-monitoring/"><span>which is able to monitor publicly available data from over 200 websites</span></a><span>. In an </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/ICE%20ShadowDragon%20Justification%20for%20Exception%20to%20Fair%20Opp..pdf"><span>acquisition document from 2022</span></a><span>, ICE confirmed that ShadowDragon allowed the agency to search “100+ social networking sites,” noting that “[p]ersistent access to Facebook and Twitter provided by ShadowDragon SocialNet is of the utmost importance as they are the most prominent social media platforms.”</span></p>
<p><span>ICE has also indicated that they intend to </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26331575-forecast-record-acquisition-planning-forecast-system/"><span>spend between 20 and 50 million dollars</span></a><span> on building and staffing a </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-social-media-surveillance-24-7-contract/"><span>24/7 social media monitoring office with at least 30 full time agents</span></a><span> to comb every major social media website for leads that could generate enforcement raids.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How to protect yourself&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>For U.S. citizens, making your account private on social media is a good place to start. You might also consider having accounts under a pseudonym, or deleting your social media accounts altogether. For more information, </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/protecting-yourself-social-networks"><span>check out our guide to protecting yourself on social media</span></a><span>. Unfortunately, people immigrating to the U.S. might be subject to greater scrutiny, including </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/19/g-s1-73572/us-resumes-visas-foreign-students-access-social-media"><span>mandatory social media checks</span></a><span>, and should consult with an immigration attorney before taking any action. For people traveling to the U.S., new rules will soon likely require them to reveal </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/us-to-inspect-tourists-social-media-history-from-past-5-years-.html"><span>five years of social media history and 10 years of past email addresses</span></a><span> to immigration officials.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Street-Level Surveillance&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>But it’s not just your digital habits ICE wants to surveil; they also want to spy on you in the physical world. ICE has contracts with multiple automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies and is able to follow the driving habits of a large percentage of Americans. ICE uses this data to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-adds-random-person-to-group-chat-exposes-details-of-manhunt-in-real-time/"><span>track down specific people</span></a><span> anywhere in the country. ICE has a </span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/records-reveal-ice-using-mass-surveillance-database-track-people-aid-local-law"><span>$6 million contract through a Thomson Reuters subsidiary to access ALPR data from Motorola Solutions</span></a><span>. ICE has also persuaded local law enforcement officers to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/"><span>run searches on their behalf through Flock Safety's massive network</span></a><span> of ALPR data. CBP, including Border Patrol, also operates a </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-patrol-surveillance-drivers-ice-trump-9f5d05469ce8c629d6fecf32d32098cd"><span>network</span></a><span> of </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/how-identify-automated-license-plate-readers-us-mexico-border"><span>covert ALPR systems</span></a><span> in many areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ICE has also invested in biometric surveillance tools, such as </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-supercharged-facial-recognition-app-of-200-million-images/"><span>face recognition software called Mobile Fortify</span></a><span> to scan the faces of people they stop to determine if they are here legally. Mobile Fortify checks the pictures it takes against a database of 200 million photos for a match (the source of the photos is unknown). Additionally, ICE has a </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/08/ice-to-pay-10-million-for-clearview-facial-recognition-to-investigate-agent-assaults/"><span>$10 million contract with Clearview AI</span></a><span> for face recognition. ICE has also contracted with </span><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202508/ices-biometric-surveillance-reach-expands-with-bi2-iris-scanning-tech"><span>iris scanning company BI2 technologies</span></a><span> for even more invasive biometric surveillance. ICE agents have also been&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.404media.co/border-patrol-agent-recorded-raid-with-metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses/"><span>spotted wearing Meta’s Ray-Ban video recording</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>sunglasses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/ice-bought-vehicles-equipped-with-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-phones/"><span>ICE has acquired trucks equipped</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/cell-site-simulators-imsi-catchers"><span>cell-site simulators (AKA Stingrays)</span></a><span> from a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (likely the cell-site simulators were manufactured by another company). This is not the first time ICE has bought this technology. According to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union, </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/aclu-ice-stingray-documents/"><span>ICE deployed cell-site simulators at least 466 times between 2017 and 2019</span></a><span>, and ICE more than 1,885 times between 2013 and 2017,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/this-is-how-many-times-the-department-of-homeland-security"><span>according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News</span></a><span>. Cell-site simulators can be used to track down a specific person in real time, with more granularity than a phone company or tools like Webloc can provide, though Webloc has the distinct advantage of being used without a warrant and not requiring agents to be in the vicinity of the person being tracked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How to protect yourself&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>Taking public transit or bicycling is a great way to keep yourself off ALPR databases, but an even better way is to go to your local city council meetings and demand the city cancels contracts with ALPR companies, like people have done in Flagstaff, Arizona; Eugene, Oregon; and Denver, Colorado, among others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are at a protest, putting your phone on airplane mode could help protect you from cell-site simulators and from apps on your phone disclosing your location, but might leave you vulnerable to advanced targeted attacks. For more advanced protection, turning your phone completely off protects against all radio based attacks, and also makes it harder for tools like Cellebrite to break into your phone as discussed above. But each individual will need to weigh their need for security from advanced radio based attacks against their need to document potential abuses through photo or video. For more information about protecting yourself at a protest, </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/attending-protest"><span>head over to SSD</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>There is nothing you can do to change your face, which is why we need more stringent privacy laws such as </span><a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/campaigns/biometric-information-privacy-act-bipa"><span>Illinois<span>’</span> Biometric Information Privacy Act</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><span>Tying All the Data Together&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Last but not least, ICE uses tools to combine and search all this data along with the data on Americans they have acquired from private companies, the IRS, TSA, and other government databases.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To search all this data, ICE uses ImmigrationOS, a system that came from a </span><a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/ice-immigrationos-palantir-ai-track-immigrants/"><span>$30-million contract with Palantir</span></a><span>. What Palantir does is hard to explain, even for people who work there, but essentially they are plumbers. Palantir makes it so that ICE has all the data they have acquired in one place so it’s easy to search through. Palantir links data from different databases, like IRS data, immigration records, and private databases, and enables ICE to view all of this data about a specific person in one place.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Palantir makes it so that ICE has all the data they have acquired in one place so it’s easy to search through. </span></p>
<p><span>The true civil liberties nightmare of Palantir is that they enable governments to link data that should have never been linked. There are </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/eff-us-court-appeals-protect-taxpayer-privacy"><span>good civil liberties reasons</span></a><span> why IRS data was never linked with immigration data and was never linked with social media data, but Palantir breaks those firewalls. Palantir has labeled themselves as a progressive, human rights centric company historically, but their recent actions have given them away as just another tech company enabling surveillance nightmares.</span></p>
<h2><span>Threat Modeling When ICE Is Your Adversary&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>&nbsp;Understanding the capabilities and limits of ICE and how to threat model helps you and your community fight back, remain powerful, and protect yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the most important things you can do is to not spread rumors and misinformation. Rumors like “ICE has malware so now everyone's phones are compromised” or “Palantir knows what you are doing all the time” or “Signal is broken” don’t help your community. It’s more useful to spread facts, ways to protect yourself, and ways to fight back. For information about how to create a </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/your-security-plan"><span>security plan</span></a><span> for yourself or your community, and other tips to protect yourself, read our </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/"><span>Surveillance Self-Defense guides</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><span>How EFF Is Fighting Back</span></h2>
<p><span>One way to fight back against ICE is in the courts. EFF currently has a lawsuit against ICE over their pressure on Apple and Google to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-demands-answers-about-ice-spotting-app-takedowns"><span>take down ICE spotting apps, like ICEBlock</span></a><span>. We also represent multiple labor unions </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/labor-unions-eff-sue-trump-administration-stop-surveillance-free-speech-online"><span>suing ICE over their social media surveillance practices</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have also demanded the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/eff-aclu-sfpd-stop-illegally-sharing-data-ice-and-anti-abortion-states?language=es"><span>San Francisco Police Department stop sharing data illegally with ICE</span></a><span>, and issued a statement condemning the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/eff-statement-ice-use-paragon-solutions-malware"><span>collaboration between ICE and the malware provider Paragon</span></a><span>. We also continue to maintain our </span><a href="https://rayhunter.eff.org/"><span>Rayhunter</span></a><span> project for detecting cell-site simulators.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Other civil liberties organizations are also suing ICE. </span><a href="https://www.aclunc.org/news/dhs-withdraws-subpoena-seeking-unmask-instagram-users-who-posted-about-ice-raids"><span>ACLU has sued ICE over a subpoena to Meta</span></a><span> attempting to identify the owner of an account providing advice to protestors, and another coalition of groups has thus far </span><a href="https://democracyforward.org/updates/court-orders-irs-to-stop-sharing-confidential-taxpayer-information-with-immigration-and-customs-enforcement/"><span>successfully sued the IRS to stop sharing taxpayer data with ICE</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to have a hard look at the surveillance industry. It is a key enabler of vast and untold violations of human rights and civil liberties, and it continues to be used by aspiring autocrats to threaten our very democracy. As long as it exists, the surveillance industry, and the data it generates, will be an irresistible tool for anti-democratic forces.</span></p>

<p>Connector Custom Resource Definition (CRD) can be used to configure the Kubernetes Operator to deploy a Tailscale <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1281/app-connectors">app connector</a> on Kubernetes.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="new">
<p>Tailscale running on Kubernetes and using a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret">Kubernetes Secret</a> as a state store writes Kubernetes Events to its Pod when changes occur to the state stored in the Kubernetes Secret. The same is true when there are errors related to reading or writing the state. This should help debugging issues related to transient errors when talking to the Kubernetes API server to retrieve or update the state Secret.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="new">
<p>Kubernetes Operator can optionally create a <a href="https://prometheus-operator.dev/">Prometheus ServiceMonitor</a> for proxy resources that have Tailscale <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1482/client-metrics">client metrics</a> enabled.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="new">
<p>Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver volume for the operator's OAuth client credentials can be configured by using Helm values.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="new">
<p><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1439/kubernetes-operator-cluster-ingress">Kubernetes Ingress</a> has clearer warnings if it has been deployed to a tailnet that has no HTTPS enabled. Specifically, a new warning in proxy logs and empty hostname on the Ingress status.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="changed">
<p><code>tailscale.com/tailnet-ip</code> annotation is validated that it holds a valid IP address.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="changed">
<p>Timeout for Kubernetes API server calls for reading/updating <code>tailscaled</code> state stored in a Kubernetes Secret has been changed from 5 seconds to the total of 30 seconds for the read/update operation and an operation to emit an Event about the state update. This should reduce errors related to  slow API server connections.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="changed">
<p>The <code>ProxyClass</code> field <code>.spec.metrics.enable</code> enables metrics at both <code>/metrics</code> and <code>/debug/metrics</code>, but <code>/debug/metrics</code> is deprecated. Users relying on <code>/debug/metrics</code> need to set <code>.spec.statefulSet.pod.tailscaleContainer.debug.enable</code> (which is a new field in Tailscale 1.78.1) until Tailscale 1.82.0 releases. When 1.82.0 releases, <code>/metrics</code> and <code>/debug/metrics</code> will both independently default to false.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="changed">
<p>Kubernetes operator proxy containers created for ingress and egress Service resources, Connectors and ProxyGroups are privileged. This is needed because of recent changes in <code>containerd</code>. For more context, see <a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/pull/14262">tailscale/tailscale/pull/14262</a>.</p>
</li>
<li data-change="fixed">
<p>Tailscale running on Kubernetes reads its state from a Secret only once, and that is upon initial start. This should reduce bugs caused by transient issues when connecting to the Kubernetes API server as well as reduce the load on the API server and improve latency for state operations.</p>

<ul>
<li>The meaning of <code>*</code> when used in the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1337/acl-syntax#src"><code>src</code></a> field in ACLs has been changed. Previously, <code>*</code> expanded to include any IPv4 and IPv6 address. With this change, <code>*</code> expands to all <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1015/100.x-addresses">Tailscale IP addresses</a> and all IP addresses from approved <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets">subnet routes</a>.</li>
<li>The new <code>autogroup:danger-all</code> ACL type has been added, which matches the previous definition of <code>*</code> when used in the <code>src</code> field. If you are using default ACLs or have specified <code>*</code> in <code>src</code>, you don't need to make any ACL changes to get the new secure behavior.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This change can break existing setups that depend on forwarding connections from external hosts (internet, LAN, Docker containers, etc.) into the tailnet through a Tailscale node.

The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.</p><p id="anchor-e237eb">The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.</p><p id="anchor-a403f6">The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.</p><p id="anchor-7d81ae">Grace Perzana said she did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on the street where Wednesday’s shooting happened, but said she does have many “Latinx” neighbors.</p><p id="anchor-a0bf4e">Trump disparaged Somalis last month, saying they had destroyed Minneapolis and the country.
