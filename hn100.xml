<cite>Testaankoop</cite></blockquote><p>A MITM attack is a security breach in which an attacker intercepts communication between two parties without either party’s knowledge, allowing the attacker to read or alter the exchanged messages.</p><p>The consumer organization conducted these tests using the latest firmware available at the time. Despite warning Linksys in November, no effective measures have been taken. A firmware update appeared months later, but the problem persists. “We regret the lack of response from Linksys and expected more from such a renowned brand,” Testaankoop expressed.</p><p>Testaankoop suspects the security issue might stem from third-party software used in the Linksys firmware. However, they emphasize that this does not excuse the vulnerability. For those who already own the affected routers, they have recommended changing the Wi-Fi network name and password via the web interface instead of the app. This precaution prevents the SSID name and password from being transmitted in readable text.</p><p>Mesh routers like <a href="https://store.linksys.com/shop/shop-home/whole-home-mesh-wifi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Velop series</a> are designed to improve Wi-Fi distribution in large or multi-story homes by creating a wireless network through multiple connected nodes. These nodes communicate either wirelessly or through cables to ensure better Wi-Fi coverage. However, the Velop Pro WiFi 6E and Pro 7’s data transmission practices undermine the security benefits they should provide.</p><p>Testaankoop contacted Linksys again just days before today’s publication in response to the ongoing issue, giving them a brief window to respond. However, they have not received any acknowledgment or solution from the manufacturer.</p><p>The vulnerability persists even in the latest Linksys 7 Pro, highlighting a critical security lapse. “After our long and intensive tests, we strongly advise against buying the Linksys Velop Pro WiFi 6E and Pro 7 because there is a serious risk of network intrusion and data loss,” the researchers concluded.</p><p><em>Stack Diary has also contacted Linksys to see if they plan on responding.</em></p></div><div data-author-bio="true"><h2>

		<h2>Why the current hype around AI is a slap in the face for creatives</h2>
<div>
<p>Almost every day we receive emails from AI companies who want to work with us. In these emails, someone cheerfully suggests a ‘collaboration’ in which they propose that we promote their product.</p>
<p>It is an understatement to say that these emails are in poor-taste. While we are usually interested in technology and try to remain optimistic about this field, we feel it’s necessary to speak out about the unbearable hype-cycle that generative AI has brought with it. A hype-cycle that has originated by stealing creative work, and now wishes to further damage creative energy by funnelling it into an automated content-creation nightmare.</p>
<p><em>Today we’d like to show you one of these emails and our response.</em></p>

The email is from Elizabeth Pich and Jonathan Kunz, a webcomic duo who have been creating original comics since 2011. They express their appreciation for being contacted but politely decline the offer to collaborate with Muse. They provide several reasons for their decision:

The rise of AI has been built on the work of creative individuals like themselves, without proper compensation or acknowledgment.
Social media platforms thrive on engaging, original content created by people, but creators have not been fairly rewarded.
Most artists love their work and prefer to be properly compensated rather than outsource their creativity to AI. They emphasize the personal nature of storytelling.
Artists would benefit more from AI tools that assist with administrative tasks rather than creative ones.
The email concludes by stating that the Muse platform does not align with their values, as it devalues creative work and promotes derivative content. They hope for a shift towards more inclusive, artist-focused approaches in the industry.

<blockquote><p>Dear XXX,</p>
<p>thank you for contacting us. We are a webcomic duo that has been creating original comics since 2011 and sharing them on various platforms on the web.</p>
<p>Usually we are very keen on connecting with potential partners that value our art and wish to help us in making a living. However, in this case we must politely decline. Here are some reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>The surge in AI has been built on the backs of creative people like us. Artists’ work has been harvested in order to train large language models and they have not been informed or compensated.</li>
<li>Social Media platforms cannot grow without engaging and original content, made by people. This is the basis for any user to join. Creators have – in large part – not been privy to the rewards that these platforms have generated over the years even though they are the reason for platform growth. Any business model that does not acknowledge this and does not seek proper compensation for artists is not of interest to us.</li>
<li>While being creative is surely not always fun, most artists love their work and do not want to outsource their passion to a machine that does this for them. They would much rather be properly compensated for their work in order to continue to be able to do said work. Frankly, storytelling “without the need for personal content creation” sounds horrible. Storytelling is personal. It is a connection between the writer and the reader. Without this personal connection, storytelling loses its purpose.</li>
<li>Artists would much rather have an AI that actually helps with grunt chores, such as writing invoices, or helping with taxes in order to focus more on fulfilling creative tasks. Such an AI-tool would be of much more value to the artist community.For these reasons, we hope it has become self-evident that your platform does not do anything for us. On the contrary, it works against a world in which creative work is valued and elevated. It turns creative work into an assembly-line meant to churn out derivative and soulless ‘content’ to supply the attention-factory that has become social media.We hope that these efforts will soon be seen as what they are and be quickly abandoned in favor of a more inclusive artist-focused approach.
<p>Best regards,<br>
Elizabeth Pich &amp; Jonathan Kunz</p></li>

Subject: Re: CVE-2024-6387: RCE in OpenSSH's server, on glibc-based Linux systems

Hi,

Today is the coordinated release date to publicly disclose a related
issue I found during review of Qualys' findings, with further analysis
by Qualys.  My summary is:

CVE-2024-6409: OpenSSH: Possible remote code execution in privsep child
due to a race condition in signal handling

OpenSSH versions 8.7 and 8.8 and the corresponding portable releases
call cleanup_exit() from grace_alarm_handler() when running in the
privsep child process.  cleanup_exit() was not meant to be called from a
signal handler and may call other async-signal-unsafe functions.  The
current understanding is that in those upstream versions cleanup_exit()
would not actually call async-signal-unsafe functions under those
conditions, but with downstream distribution patches it sometimes does.
Specifically, openssh-7.6p1-audit.patch found in Red Hat's package of
OpenSSH adds code to cleanup_exit() that exposes the issue.  Relevantly,
this patch is found in RHEL 9 (and its rebuild/downstream
distributions), where the package is based on OpenSSH 8.7p1.

The audit patch is also found in Fedora, so the package versions that
were based on 8.7p1 and 8.8p1 are affected.  Per change log, it appears
that out of Fedora releases only 36 and 37 were affected, as well as
some updates maybe starting with those for 35 and until those for 37.
These versions are now end-of-life, and Fedora 38+ has moved to newer
upstream OpenSSH that doesn't make the problematic cleanup_exit() call.

The main difference from CVE-2024-6387 is that the race condition and
RCE potential are triggered in the privsep child process, which runs
with reduced privileges compared to the parent server process.  So
immediate impact is lower.  However, there may be differences in
exploitability of these vulnerabilities in a particular scenario, which
could make either one of these a more attractive choice for an attacker,
and if only one of these is fixed or mitigated then the other becomes
more relevant.  In particular, the "LoginGraceTime 0" mitigation works
against both issues, whereas the "-e" mitigation only works against
CVE-2024-6387 and not (fully) against CVE-2024-6409.  It may also be
possible to construct an exploit that would work against either
vulnerability probabilistically, which could decrease attack duration or
increase success rate.  That said, actual exploitation of CVE-2024-6409
has not yet been attempted and thus has not been proven.

I brought this extra issue to distros on June 26 and Qualys confirmed
and completed most of the analysis later same day.  Qualys later found
another issue with the audit patch, which is currently believed to be
mostly non-security.  I include it closer to the end of this message.

I'm sorry for not disclosing CVE-2024-6409 on the same day as
CVE-2024-6387, which would have saved many of us time (me included).
I agreed for the separate coordinated release date because apparently
Red Hat already had CVE-2024-6387 in the pipeline and wasn't ready to
add a fix for CVE-2024-6409 at the same time.

I quote relevant excerpts from the distros list discussion below:

&gt; &gt; A few days after we started our work on amd64, we noticed the following
&gt; &gt; bug report (in OpenSSH's public Bugzilla), about a deadlock in sshd's
&gt; &gt; SIGALRM handler:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3690" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3690</a>

&gt; 
&gt; In 2021, djm@ was wondering "why this is triggering when it wasn't
&gt; before" and "I still don't understand why this condition did not exist
&gt; previously."  I guess the reason was this same regression in the signal
&gt; handler.
&gt; 
&gt; The patch for the above issue conditionally replaced the call to
&gt; sigdie() with cleanup_exit(255), but I think that other call was also
&gt; async-signal-unsafe!
&gt; 
&gt; commit e3c032333be5fdbbaf2751f6f478e044922b4ec4

&gt; 
&gt;     upstream: don't sigdie() in signal handler in privsep child process;
&gt;     
&gt;     this can end up causing sandbox violations per bz3286; ok dtucker@
&gt;     
&gt;     OpenBSD-Commit-ID: a7f40b2141dca4287920da68ede812bff7ccfdda

&gt; -/* $OpenBSD: sshd.c,v 1.572 2021/04/03 06:18:41 djm Exp $ */
&gt; +/* $OpenBSD: sshd.c,v 1.573 2021/05/07 03:09:38 djm Exp $ */
&gt; 
&gt; So in OpenSSH 8.7p1 as used e.g. in RHEL 9, we have this:
&gt; 
&gt;         /* Log error and exit. */
&gt;         if (use_privsep &amp;&amp; pmonitor != NULL &amp;&amp; pmonitor-&gt;m_pid &lt;= 0)
&gt;                 cleanup_exit(255); /* don't log in privsep child */
&gt;         else {
&gt;                 sigdie("Timeout before authentication for %s port %d",
&gt;                     ssh_remote_ipaddr(the_active_state),
&gt;                     ssh_remote_port(the_active_state));
&gt;         }
&gt; 
&gt; So if patching that version, I think not only the body of sshsigdie()
&gt; should be #if 0'ed out, but also the above call to cleanup_exit(255);
&gt; replaced with _exit(1).
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, that's also the difference between sshlogdie(), which uses
&gt; cleanup_exit(255), and sshsigdie(), which uses _exit(1).
&gt; 
&gt; This extra problematic logic only existed in upstream OpenSSH(-portable)
&gt; for ~9 months, having been removed with:
&gt; 
&gt; commit 4e62c13ab419b4b224c8bc6a761e91fcf048012d
&gt; Author: dtucker@...nbsd.org &lt;dtucker@...nbsd.org&gt;
&gt; Date:   Tue Feb 1 07:57:32 2022 +0000
&gt; 
&gt;     upstream: Remove explicit kill of privsep preauth child's PID in
&gt;     
&gt;     SIGALRM handler. It's no longer needed since the child will get terminated by
&gt;     the SIGTERM to the process group that cleans up any auth helpers, it
&gt;     simplifies the signal handler and removes the risk of a race when updating
&gt;     the PID. Based on analysis by HerrSpace in github PR#289, ok djm@
&gt;     
&gt;     OpenBSD-Commit-ID: 2be1ffa28b4051ad9e33bb4371e2ec8a31d6d663

&gt; -/* $OpenBSD: sshd.c,v 1.582 2021/11/18 03:07:59 djm Exp $ */
&gt; +/* $OpenBSD: sshd.c,v 1.583 2022/02/01 07:57:32 dtucker Exp $ */
&gt; 
&gt; which obviously left the (even worse) sshdie() intact.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, depending on what exact cleanups are done, it may (or
&gt; may not, I haven't checked) have briefly been possible to exploit a race
&gt; condition of this sort not only in the parent (worse), but also in the
&gt; privsep child (relatively mild).  An extra vulnerability nevertheless,
&gt; maybe with different exploitability conditions - maybe exploitable even
&gt; on *BSD where sshdie() is not?

As a side note, I wrote *BSD above because I had found that syslog_r()
is also available on NetBSD, as well as on AIX and even Tru64, so
_maybe_ some builds of OpenSSH for some of those systems were not
affected by CVE-2024-6387.  We did not research this further.

&gt; Now, cleanup_exit() _might_ have actually be safe if called from this
&gt; place.  Upstream 8.7p1's is:
&gt; 
&gt; /* server specific fatal cleanup */
&gt; void
&gt; cleanup_exit(int i)
&gt; {
&gt;         if (the_active_state != NULL &amp;&amp; the_authctxt != NULL) {
&gt;                 do_cleanup(the_active_state, the_authctxt);
&gt;                 if (use_privsep &amp;&amp; privsep_is_preauth &amp;&amp;
&gt;                     pmonitor != NULL &amp;&amp; pmonitor-&gt;m_pid &gt; 1) {
&gt;                         debug("Killing privsep child %d", pmonitor-&gt;m_pid);
&gt;                         if (kill(pmonitor-&gt;m_pid, SIGKILL) != 0 &amp;&amp;
&gt;                             errno != ESRCH) {
&gt;                                 error_f("kill(%d): %s", pmonitor-&gt;m_pid,
&gt;                                     strerror(errno));
&gt;                         }
&gt;                 }
&gt;         }
&gt; #ifdef SSH_AUDIT_EVENTS
&gt;         /* done after do_cleanup so it can cancel the PAM auth 'thread' */
&gt;         if (the_active_state != NULL &amp;&amp; (!use_privsep || mm_is_monitor()))
&gt;                 audit_event(the_active_state, SSH_CONNECTION_ABANDON);
&gt; #endif
&gt;         _exit(i);
&gt; }

&gt; Further, RHEL 9 patched this to:
&gt; 
&gt; /* server specific fatal cleanup */
&gt; void
&gt; cleanup_exit(int i)
&gt; {
&gt;         static int in_cleanup = 0;
&gt;         int is_privsep_child;
&gt; 
&gt;         /* cleanup_exit can be called at the very least from the privsep
&gt;            wrappers used for auditing.  Make sure we don't recurse
&gt;            indefinitely. */
&gt;         if (in_cleanup)
&gt;                 _exit(i);
&gt;         in_cleanup = 1;
&gt;         if (the_active_state != NULL &amp;&amp; the_authctxt != NULL) {
&gt;                 do_cleanup(the_active_state, the_authctxt);
&gt;                 if (use_privsep &amp;&amp; privsep_is_preauth &amp;&amp;
&gt;                     pmonitor != NULL &amp;&amp; pmonitor-&gt;m_pid &gt; 1) {
&gt;                         debug("Killing privsep child %d", pmonitor-&gt;m_pid);
&gt;                         if (kill(pmonitor-&gt;m_pid, SIGKILL) != 0 &amp;&amp;
&gt;                             errno != ESRCH) {
&gt;                                 error_f("kill(%d): %s", pmonitor-&gt;m_pid,
&gt;                                     strerror(errno));
&gt;                         }
&gt;                 }
&gt;         }
&gt;         is_privsep_child = use_privsep &amp;&amp; pmonitor != NULL &amp;&amp; pmonitor-&gt;m_pid == 0;
&gt;         if (sensitive_data.host_keys != NULL &amp;&amp; the_active_state != NULL)
&gt;                 destroy_sensitive_data(the_active_state, is_privsep_child);
&gt;         if (the_active_state != NULL)
&gt;                 packet_destroy_all(the_active_state, 1, is_privsep_child);
&gt; #ifdef SSH_AUDIT_EVENTS
&gt;         /* done after do_cleanup so it can cancel the PAM auth 'thread' */
&gt;         if (the_active_state != NULL &amp;&amp;
&gt;             (the_authctxt == NULL || !the_authctxt-&gt;authenticated) &amp;&amp;
&gt;             (!use_privsep || mm_is_monitor()))
&gt;                 audit_event(the_active_state, SSH_CONNECTION_ABANDON);
&gt; #endif
&gt;         _exit(i);
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; from where it looks like other cleanup calls can be made even when
&gt; called from privsep child prior to authentication

&gt; In summary:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. I think the call to
&gt;                 cleanup_exit(255); /* don't log in privsep child */
&gt; should also be patched to _exit(1) in distro packages that have that
&gt; (perhaps those based on 8.7p1 and 8.8p1).
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The logic of upstream cleanup_exit() (but not necessarily distros')
&gt; is such that the call _may_ have been safe (unless the other race?)
&gt; 
&gt; 3. My analysis is incomplete.  I welcome further analysis by others -
&gt; Qualys, distros, and we could want to contact upstream (via Qualys?)
&gt; for comment even though the issue is already inadvertently fixed.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. If this is in fact an extra vulnerability (even if only exposed in a
&gt; distro?), should it perhaps get its own CVE?  It's different affected
&gt; versions range, which I think qualifies it for a different CVE.  (If
&gt; confirmed that this is in fact a vulnerability.)

&gt; ....
&gt; 2662         if (options.use_pam) {
&gt; 2663                 sshpam_cleanup();
&gt; 2664                 sshpam_thread_cleanup();
&gt; 2665         }
&gt; ....
&gt; 2668         if (!authctxt-&gt;authenticated)
&gt; 2669                 return;
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; - The debug() call at line 2647 is not ideal, because it calls
&gt;   snprintf(), but we do not consider this to be a practical problem,
&gt;   because we do not know of an snprintf() implementation that calls
&gt;   malloc() (unless the format string uses positional arguments or
&gt;   floating points, which is not the case here).
&gt; 
&gt; - The calls to PAM functions at lines 2662-2665 are no-ops in the unpriv
&gt;   child, so not a problem either.
&gt; 
&gt; - And then do_cleanup() returns at lines 2668-2669, so OK.
&gt; 
&gt; Summary: we consider this upstream version to be safe (from a practical
&gt; point of view, i.e. despite the few calls to snprintf()).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Further, RHEL 9 patched this to:
&gt; 
&gt; Ouch, we had not seen this one; it is definitely a problem:
&gt; 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 2657 cleanup_exit(int i)
&gt; 2658 {
&gt; ....
&gt; 2681         if (sensitive_data.host_keys != NULL &amp;&amp; the_active_state != NULL)
&gt; 2682                 destroy_sensitive_data(the_active_state, is_privsep_child);
&gt; 2683         if (the_active_state != NULL)
&gt; 2684                 packet_destroy_all(the_active_state, 1, is_privsep_child);
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; - The call to destroy_sensitive_data() may or may not be a problem,
&gt;   because the "sensitive data" (private keys) were already destroyed in
&gt;   the unpriv child at that point.
&gt; 
&gt; - But the call to packet_destroy_all() is definitely a problem, because
&gt;   it calls packet_destroy_state(), which calls free() everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; Summary: this patched version of cleanup_exit() makes the unpriv child
&gt; vulnerable too.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. I think the call to
&gt; &gt;                 cleanup_exit(255); /* don't log in privsep child */
&gt; &gt; should also be patched to _exit(1) in distro packages that have that
&gt; &gt; (perhaps those based on 8.7p1 and 8.8p1).
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed (by "patched" you mean "replace the call to cleanup_exit(255)
&gt; with a call to _exit(1)", right?).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. The logic of upstream cleanup_exit() (but not necessarily distros')
&gt; &gt; is such that the call _may_ have been safe
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed as well.

The below excepts are about an extra issue (beyond CVE-2024-6409) - the
audit patch's logging of SSH host key fingerprints apparently being
broken at least on RHEL 9.  This issue is only indirectly related to
CVE-2024-6409 because it explains why more async-signal-unsafe calls are
made than would have been otherwise.

&gt; 
&gt; It is a problem: destroy_sensitive_data() calls malloc functions many
&gt; times (especially free()) because even if only the public keys remain in
&gt; sensitive_data.host_keys, they are still passed to sshkey_free().
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, destroy_sensitive_data() even ends up calling syslog() itself:
&gt; PRIVSEP(audit_destroy_sensitive_data()) calls mm_request_send(), which
&gt; can fail if the priv/parent process already _exit()ed, so fatal_f() is
&gt; called, which calls mm_log_handler(), which also fails because the priv/
&gt; parent process _exit()ed, so fatal_f() is called again, but this time it
&gt; calls syslog().
&gt; 
&gt; If you are wondering why destroy_sensitive_data() calls
&gt; PRIVSEP(audit_destroy_sensitive_data()) in the first place, we were
&gt; wondering too, because this should happen only if one of the keys is
&gt; private, and no private key should remain in the unpriv/child process!
&gt; This is actually a bug in sshkey_is_private(): for ed25519 keys, this
&gt; function checks ed25519_pk, which is the public key! It should check
&gt; ed25519_sk instead, which is the secret/private key.

&gt; 
&gt; As to security consequences, at first my concern was this could leave
&gt; secret host keys around in privsep child.  However, upon a closer look
&gt; the only thing audit_destroy_sensitive_data() does is log a message, so
&gt; the only impact is erroneous audit logging.

&gt; Actual processing of keys is untouched by this patch, so probably
&gt; remains correct.

&gt; &gt; &gt; hoping that fixing the check from pk to sk would suppress only the
&gt; &gt; &gt; erroneous logging from the unprivileged child, but in my testing it
&gt; &gt; &gt; suppressed all of it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; [...] I think that I have
&gt; &gt; found the solution to this mystery, but I have not yet investigated the
&gt; &gt; consequences (if any): the private host keys are "shielded" as soon as
&gt; &gt; they are loaded (by sshkey_shield_private()), which means that, to the
&gt; &gt; (non-buggy) tests in sshkey_is_private(), they look like public keys,
&gt; &gt; but the private part is actually there, in another part of the key
&gt; &gt; structure, in encrypted form.

&gt; The shielding was added upstream in:
&gt; 
&gt; commit 4f7a56d5e02e3d04ab69eac1213817a7536d0562
&gt; Author: djm@...nbsd.org &lt;djm@...nbsd.org&gt;
&gt; Date:   Fri Jun 21 04:21:04 2019 +0000
&gt; 
&gt;     upstream: Add protection for private keys at rest in RAM against
&gt;     
&gt;     speculation and memory sidechannel attacks like Spectre, Meltdown, Rowhammer
&gt;     and Rambleed. This change encrypts private keys when they are not in use with
&gt;     a symmetic key that is derived from a relatively large "prekey" consisting of
&gt;     random data (currently 16KB).
&gt; 
&gt; which is newer than 7.6p1 that openssh-7.6p1-audit.patch was presumably
&gt; based on.  So it is possible that this audit logging was more functional
&gt; initially (sans this bug for ed25519 you found), but mostly broke when
&gt; it was rebased on newer versions without consideration for the change
&gt; above.  However, that's just a guess, which I did not confirm.  A way to
&gt; confirm it could be to test a Red Hat package that already has the audit
&gt; patch, but does not yet have upstream's shielding.  Since the above
&gt; upstream commit isn't in 8.0 (it's about 1 week newer than V_8_0 tag),
&gt; maybe RHEL 8 is suitable for this test (its package is based on 8.0p1).
&gt; 
&gt; ... and indeed, on a RHEL 8 rebuild system I see "msg='op=destroy
&gt; kind=server fp=SHA256:" /var/log/audit/audit.log lines with 3 different
&gt; fingerprint values, presumably corresponding to the different key types.
&gt; This is different from the RHEL 9 rebuild system I checked before, where
&gt; only one fingerprint value would be seen despite of the system also
&gt; having 3 different host key types.

&gt; We decided to target Rocky Linux 9 (a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

&gt; 
&gt; - its OpenSSH version (8.7p1) is vulnerable to this signal handler race
&gt;   condition and its glibc is always mapped at a multiple of 2MB (because
&gt;   of the ASLR weakness discussed in the previous "Theory" subsection),
&gt;   which makes partial pointer overwrites much more powerful;
&gt; 
&gt; - the syslog() function (which is async-signal-unsafe but is called by
&gt;   sshd's SIGALRM handler) of this glibc version (2.34) internally calls
&gt;   __open_memstream(), which malloc()ates a FILE structure in the heap,
&gt;   and also calls calloc(), realloc(), and free() (which gives us some
&gt;   much-needed freedom).
&gt; 
&gt; With a heap corruption as a primitive, two FILE structures malloc()ated
&gt; in the heap, and 21 fixed bits in the glibc's addresses, we believe that
&gt; this signal handler race condition is exploitable on amd64 (probably not
&gt; in ~6-8 hours, but hopefully in less than a week). Only time will tell.

FWIW, we patched CVE-2024-6387 in Rocky Linux SIG/Security and CIQ 9.2

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/09/evolve_lockbit_attack/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/09/evolve_lockbit_attack/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40916260">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Evolve Bank &amp; Trust says the data of more than 7.6 million customers was stolen during the LockBit break-in in late May, per a fresh filing with Maine's attorney general.</p>
<p>The filing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/a2e61e38-f78d-403d-9abb-3810771bb5d2.html">lists</a> the total number of persons affected (including residents) at 7,640,112.</p>
<p>It's the first time Evolve has confirmed the scale of the data theft – which affected at least three of its major partners, past and present – and it expects the number to rise as its investigations continue.</p>

    

<p>Both Wise and Affirm, international money transfer and buy-now-pay-later companies respectively, confirmed in SEC filings last week that they were both materially affected by the break-in at Evolve.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>Wise severed ties with Evolve last year but was still impacted by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/02/affirm_evolve_ransomware_breach/">the incident</a>. Mercury also suggested it could be affected.</p>
<p>However, none of the company's partners have yet revealed the extent to which the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/07/alleged_lockbit_kingpin_charged_sanctioned/">ransomware crew</a> that cops allege is headed by Dmitry Khoroshev managed to pillage their customers' data.</p>

        

<p><em>The Register</em> approached all 15 partners listed on Evolve's website and only received a response from one other company, Melia, and the last we heard it was probing any potential impact rather than confirming anything.</p>
<p>As for Evolve, its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/a2e61e38-f78d-403d-9abb-3810771bb5d2.html" rel="nofollow">letter</a> to customers reads: "On May 29, 2024, Evolve identified that some of its systems were not working properly.</p>
<p>"While it initially appeared to be a hardware failure, we subsequently learned it was unauthorized activity.</p>

        

<p>"Evolve promptly initiated its incident response processes and stopped the attack. No new unauthorized activity on Evolve's systems has been identified since May 31, 2024. An investigation with assistance from a cybersecurity firm was initiated to investigate what happened and what data may have been impacted. Evolve also notified law enforcement and worked to add further protections to harden its systems."</p>
<p>The Banking-as-a-Service provider went on to say that although it may have enacted its incident response playbook when it spotted signs of foul play, it took the vendor roughly four months to detect the intrusion.</p>
<p>"There is no evidence that the threat actors accessed any customer funds, but it appears the threat actors did access and download customer information from Evolve's databases and a file share during periods in February and May 2024."</p>
<p>The letters sent to affected individuals are usually attached to filings with state attorneys general, but typically omit details such as the specific data types stolen in each case.</p>
<p>Some customers may have had names and addresses stolen, while others may have had their social security numbers taken as well, for example.</p>
<p>We know from Evolve's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getevolved.com/about/news/cybersecurity-incident/" rel="nofollow">earlier disclosure</a> that SSNs, bank account numbers, and contact information "for most" of its personal banking customers and partners may be affected, as well as some staff.</p>
<p>That disclosure, last updated on July 8, also stated that this week's notification letters are expected to be a first round with additional, smaller rounds of notifications to come in the following weeks.</p>
<p>Evolve has offered impacted individuals 24 months of credit monitoring, as is often the case in major data leaks. Victims have until October 31 to enroll for these services, and the full instructions on how to do so are included in an email to be sent in the next two weeks.</p>

</ul>
<p>Rounding off the letter, Evolve went on to say that it "had a significant number of cybersecurity measures in place," which have now been strengthened even further.</p>
<p>The incident, however, came against the backdrop of a stern <a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20240614a.htm" rel="nofollow">telling off</a> from the US Federal Reserve Board on June 14, less than a fortnight before it announced the data had been stolen.</p>
<p>Following a review of Evolve in 2023, the board wasn't happy at all with the Arkansas-headquartered company for a number of reasons including "deficiencies" in anti-money laundering, risk management, and consumer compliance programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was assessed to have engaged in "unsafe and unsound banking practices," particularly in relation to the absence of an effective risk management framework for its array of partners, among other issues, which resulted in an enforcement action being issued.</p>
<p>This, of course, came just a few weeks after Evolve became aware that LockBit was rummaging through its systems for the best part of four months – a hardly ideal 2024 for the finance firm.</p>
<h3>Misery loves company</h3>
<p>At least Evolve is not alone in the pits of the "data breach" filings this week. Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS) also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/186129d3-f965-48f0-a48d-fbdfc6b74b02.html" rel="nofollow">updated</a> Maine's attorney general on the state of its investigation regarding its own data exposure for the second time in as many weeks.</p>
<p>At the end of June, we reported how the debt collector's situation was going <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/24/security_breaches_of_the_week/">from bad to worse</a>, and now it's worse still with the update indicating the number of affected individuals has now surpassed 4 million.</p>
<p>The February attack on FBCS was originally slated to have affected around 2 million people, according to its first filing in April. By the end of June, that number had risen to just north of 3.4 million, and now it stands at 4,050,711, to be precise.</p>
<p>The data stolen includes names, SSNs, dates of birth, account information, and identity documents, but no recognized cybercrime operation has taken credit for what the FBCS called a "cyber incident." ®</p>

      <p data-substack-content="">Let’s face it: Boeing has the government by the balls.</p><p data-substack-content="">It is, after all, America’s only commercial aircraft manufacturer, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268992/change-in-employment-figures-from-boeing/">over 170,000 employees</a> in Washington State, South Carolina, and Virginia, most of whom make middle-class to upper-middle-class wages. In dollar volume, it is the country’s <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/07/news/economy/top-us-exports/index.html">largest exporter</a>. And to top it off, Boeing is a critical <a href="https://www.boeing.com/company/about-bds#anchor1">defense contractor</a>, with a space division that recently sent two astronauts to the International Space Station (though thanks to problems with Boeing’s spacecraft, it’s a little unclear when, exactly, those astronauts <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-07-nasa-astronauts-unexpected-july-international.html">will return</a> to earth).&nbsp;</p><p data-substack-content="">Late Sunday night, faced with the possibility of a trial, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/business/boeing-justice-department-plea-deal.html">Boeing agreed</a> to a settlement offered by the Department of Justice, pleading guilty to a felony for the two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that caused the death of 346 passengers and crew. The felony charge comes with a probationary period of three years and a fine of nearly $500 million. Boeing has also agreed to invest $455 million to bolster its safety and compliance programs and accept the oversight of an independent compliance monitor who will submit annual reports to the government. And board members will be required to meet with families of the victims.</p><p data-substack-content="">The Justice Department will no doubt characterize the settlement as just punishment for a recidivist company. Don’t believe it. This is a company that murdered those 346 people as surely as if it had lined them up against a wall and shot them. There was no pilot error involved in those crashes, nor was it the result of some unlucky accident. Those planes crashed because Boeing had cut so many corners in rushing this new 737 model to the marketplace that a disaster was inevitable. As one engineer memorably <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-10/-incredibly-damning-boeing-messages-show-employee-unease-on-max">put it in an email</a> to a colleague: “This airplane was designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”</p><p data-substack-content="">What’s more, to a company the size of Boeing, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264374/boeings-worldwide-revenue/">$78 billion</a> in annual revenue, a half billion-dollar fine is pocket change. Back in 2021, Boeing accepted a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion">deferred prosecution agreement</a> with the Justice Department that called for it to pay $2.5 billion, including a criminal fine, money for the victims’ families, and compensation to its airline customers. Even that amount wasn’t enough to cause Boeing to change its ways: in January 2024, a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/14/boeing-737-max-problems-timeline">door blew out of a 737 Max</a> in flight, proving that safety was still not a top priority on the factory floor. Thus began the latest round of investigations, recriminations, and Boeing’s promise, with this settlement, to do better.</p><p data-substack-content="">The families of the victims are furious, with one of their lawyers calling it “a sweetheart deal.” Can you blame them? Some executives have lost their jobs, but no one has ever been held responsible for the wrongdoing that led to the crashes and to a culture that ignored safety concerns if it got in the way of a higher stock price. The top executives will still make millions. Boeing will still be able to conduct its defense business, even though convicted felons are not supposed to be eligible for government contracts. The settlement makes it obvious that the government is afraid of what would happen—not just to Boeing but to the Defense Department and even the larger economy—if it hit the company as hard as the company deserves to be hit.</p><p data-substack-content="">“I’m ashamed to see that this is our justice system at work,” <a href="https://www.foundationforaviationsafety.org/board/ed-pierson">Ed Pierson</a>, a Boeing whistleblower who has since founded the Foundation for Aviation Safety, told me yesterday afternoon. “It provides zero accountability. The executives who pressured employees to take shortcuts—they’re culpable. This settlement is allowing individuals who have acted criminally to walk away.”</p><p data-substack-content="">And that’s the larger point. The Justice Department seems to believe it’s meaningful to charge a company with a felony. But it’s not. Companies don’t commit felonies—people do. And if people aren’t held responsible—and sent to prison when necessary—then they’ll never have the incentive they need to change.&nbsp;</p><p data-substack-content="">You want to fix Boeing? Then prosecute its executives. There is nothing like the prospect of prison to focus the mind.</p><div data-substack-content=""><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png" width="1336" height="24" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:24,&quot;width&quot;:1336,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:820,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thefp.com/i/146416356?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png&quot;}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5dfa68-519d-48c8-8fa5-cc1215b8e110_1336x24.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p data-substack-content=""><em><strong>Joe Nocera is a columnist for The Free Press and the co-author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-big-fail-what-the-pandemic-revealed-about-who-america-protects-and-who-it-leaves-behind-joe-nocera/19667924?ean=9780593331026">The Big Fail</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The plane reached 10,000ft. I took out my laptop, planning to peruse the internet and maybe do a little work if I got really desperate.</p>

<p>I connected to the in-flight wi-fi and opened my browser. The network login page demanded credit card details. I fumbled for my card, which I eventually discovered had hidden itself inside my passport. As I searched I noticed that the login page was encouraging me to sign in to my airmiles account, free of charge, even though I hadn’t paid for anything yet. A hole in the firewall, I thought. It’s a long way from London to San Francisco so I decided to peer through it.</p>

<p>I logged in to my JetStreamers Diamond Altitude account and started clicking. I went to my profile page, where I saw an edit button. It looked like a normal button: drop shadow, rounded corners, nothing special. I was supposed to use it to update my name, address, and so on.</p>

<p>But suddenly I realised that this was no ordinary button. This clickable rascal would allow me to access the entire internet through my airmiles account. This would be slow. It would be unbelievably stupid. But it would work.</p>

<p>Several co-workers were asking me to review their PRs because my feedback was “two weeks late” and “blocking a critical deployment.” But my ideas are important too so I put on my headphones and smashed on some focus tunes. I’d forgotten to charge my headphones so Limp Bizkit started playing out of my laptop speakers. Fortunately no one else on the plane seemed to mind so we all rocked out together.</p>

<p>Before I could access the entire internet through my airmiles account I’d need to write a few prototypes. At first I thought that I’d write them using Go, but then I realised that if I used Python then I could call the final tool <a href="https://github.com/robert/PySkyWiFi"><code>PySkyWiFi</code></a>. Obviously I did that instead.</p>

<h4 id="prototype-1-instant-messaging">Prototype 1: Instant Messaging</h4>

<p>Here’s the basic idea: suppose that I logged into my airmiles account and updated my name. If you were also logged in to my account then you could read my new name, from the ground. You could update it again, and I could read your new value. If we kept doing this then the name field of my airmiles account could serve as a tunnel through the airplane’s wi-fi firewall to the real world.</p>

<p>This tunnel could support a simple instant messaging protocol. I could update my name to “<code>Hello how are you</code>.”  You could read my message and then send me a reply by updating my name again to “<code>Im fine how are you</code>.” I could read that, and we could have a stilted conversation. This might not sound like much, but it would be the first step on the road to full internet access. <a id="nl"></a></p>

<p>I paid for the internet on my old laptop. I hadn’t finished migrating my data off this computer, so it still had to come everywhere with me. I messaged my wife to ask her to help me with my experiments. <code>no, what are you talking about, i'm busy</code> she replied, lovingly.</p>

<p>So instead I took out my new laptop, which still had no internet access. I created a test airmiles account and logged into it on both computers. I found that I could indeed chat with myself by updating the name field in the UI.</p>

<pre><code>sequenceDiagram
    participant Computer1
    participant AirmilesAccount as Airmiles Account&lt;br&gt;Name Field
    participant Computer2
    
    Computer1-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount: TYPE: Hello how are you
    AirmilesAccount-&gt;&gt;Computer2: READ: Hello how are you
    Computer2-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount: TYPE: Im fine how are you
    AirmilesAccount-&gt;&gt;Computer1: READ: Im fine how are you
</code></pre>

<p>This was a lousy user experience though. So I wrote a command line tool to automate it. My tool asked the user for a message, and then behind the scenes it logged into my airmiles account via the website, using my credentials. The tool updated the name field of my test account with the user’s message. It then polled the name field every few seconds to see if my account’s name had changed again, which would indicate that the other person had sent a message back. Once the tool detected a new value it printed that value and asked the user for their next reply, and so on.</p>

<pre><code>sequenceDiagram
    actor Me
    participant AirmilesAccount as Airmiles Account&lt;br&gt;Name Field
    actor You
    
    You-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount: (poll for new data)
    AirmilesAccount--&gt;&gt;You: (no new data)
    Me-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount: WRITE: Hello how are you
    You-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount: (poll for new data)
    AirmilesAccount-&gt;&gt;You: READ: Hello how are you
    Me-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount: (poll for new data)
    AirmilesAccount--&gt;&gt;Me: (no new data)
    You-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount: WRITE: Im fine how are you
    Me-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount: (poll for new data)
    AirmilesAccount-&gt;&gt;Me: READ: Im fine how are you
</code></pre>

<p>Using this tool I could chat with someone on the ground, via my terminal. I wouldn’t have to pay for wifi, and neither of us would have to know or care that the messages were being sent via my SkyVenture Premium Gold Rewards account.</p>

<p>I still needed to find someone who would chat with me. But this was a good start!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NB: at this point I didn’t want to send any more automated data through my airmiles account in case that got me in trouble somehow. Nothing I was doing could possibly cause any damage, but some companies get jumpy about this kind of thing.</p>

  <p>I therefore proved to myself that PySkyWiFi would work on my airmiles accounts too by updating my name ten or so times in quick succession. They all succeeded, which suggested to me that my airmiles account probably wasn’t rate-limiting the speed or number of requests I could send to it.</p>

  <p>I then wrote the rest of my code by sending my data through friendly services like GitHub Gists and local files on my computer, using the same principles as if I were sending it through an airmiles account. If PySkyWiFi worked through GitHub then it would work through my Star Power UltimateBlastOff account too. This had the secondary advantage of being much faster and easier for iteration too.</p>

  <p>I’m going to keep talking about sending data through an airmiles account, because that’s the point I’m trying to make.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="prototype-2-live-headlines-stock-prices-and-football-scores">Prototype 2: Live headlines, stock prices, and football scores</h4>

<p>The tunnel I’d constructed through my airmiles account would be useful for more than IMing. For my next prototype I wrote a program that would run on a computer back at my house or in the cloud, and would automatically send information from the real world up to me on the plane, through my airmiles account. I could deploy it before I left for my next flight and have it send me the latest stock prices or football scores while I was in the sky.</p>

<p>To do this I wrote a daemon that would run on a computer that was on the ground and connected to the internet. The daemon constantly polled the name field in my airmiles account, looking for structured messages that I sent to it from the plane (such as <code>STOCKPRICE: APPL</code> or <code>SCORE: MANUNITED</code>). When the daemon saw a new request it parsed it, retrieved the requested information using the relevant API, and sent it back to me via my airmiles account. It worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Now I could use my first prototype to send IMs through my airmiles account, and I could use my second prototype tio follow the markets and the sports.</p>

<p>It was time to squeeze the entire internet through my airmiles account.</p>

<h4 id="the-real-thing-pyskywifi">The real thing: PySkyWiFi</h4>

<p>During the rest of the flight I wrote PySkyWiFi. PySkyWiFi is a highly simplified version of the TCP/IP protocol that squeezes whole HTTP requests through an airmiles account, out of the plane, and down to a computer connected to the internet on the ground. A daemon running on this ground computer makes the HTTP requests for me, and then finally squeezes the completed HTTP responses back through my airmiles account, up to me on my plane.</p>

<p>This meant that on my next flight I could technically have full access to the internet, via my airmiles account. Depending on network conditions on the plane I might be able to hit speeds of several bytes per second.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DISCLAIMER: you obviously shouldn’t actually do any of this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s how it works (and <a href="https://github.com/robert/PySkyWiFi">here’s the source code</a>).</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="how-pyskywifi-works">How PySkyWiFi works</h3>

<p>PySkyWiFi has two components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The sky proxy</strong> - a proxy that runs on your laptop, on a plane</li>
  <li><strong>The ground daemon</strong> - a daemon that runs on a computer connected to the internet, at your home on the ground or in the cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a simplified diagram:</p>

<pre><code>sequenceDiagram
    actor Me
    participant SkyProxy as Sky Proxy
    participant AirmilesAccount1 as Airmiles Account
    participant GroundDaemon as Ground Daemon
    participant Website as example.com

    Me-&gt;&gt;SkyProxy: HTTP request
    SkyProxy-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount1: HTTP request
    AirmilesAccount1-&gt;&gt;GroundDaemon: HTTP request
    GroundDaemon-&gt;&gt;Website: HTTP request
    Website-&gt;&gt;GroundDaemon: HTTP response
    GroundDaemon-&gt;&gt;AirmilesAccount1: HTTP response
    AirmilesAccount1-&gt;&gt;SkyProxy: HTTP response
    SkyProxy-&gt;&gt;Me: HTTP response
</code></pre>

<p>Setup starts before you leave your house. First you start up the ground daemon. Then you get a taxi to the airport, get on the plane, and connect to the plane’s wi-fi network. You boot up the sky proxy on your laptop. Your PySkyWiFi relay is now ready to go.</p>

<p>You use a tool like <code>curl</code> to make an HTTP request to the sky proxy that you’ve started on your laptop. You address your request to the proxy (eg. <code>localhost:1234/</code>) and you put the actual URL that you want to query inside a custom HTTP header called <code>X-PySkyWiFi</code>. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code>curl localhost:1234 -H "X-PySkyWiFi: example.com"`
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>X-PySkyWiFi</code> header will be stripped by the ground daemon and used to route your request to your target website. Everything else about the request (including the body and other headers) will be forwarded exactly as-is.</p>

<p>Once you make your request it will hang for several minutes. If by some miracle nothing breaks then you’ll eventually get back an HTTP response, exactly as if you’d sent the request over the normal internet like a normal person. The only difference is that it didn’t cost you anything. You will now almost certainly pay for wi-fi, because your curiosity has been satisfied and your time on this earth is very short.</p>

<h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-step</h3>

<p>Here’s what happens behind the scenes:</p>


<pre><code>sequenceDiagram

</code></pre>

<p>In order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The sky proxy receives the HTTP request from your <code>curl</code> call. It splits the request into chunks, because the entire request is too large to fit into you airmiles account in one go</li>
  <li>The sky proxy writes each chunk one-by-one to the name field in your airmiles account.</li>
  <li>The ground daemon polls your airmiles account. When it detects that the name field has changed to a new chunk, it reads that chunk and sends an acknowledgement to the sender so that the sender knows it’s safe to send the next chunk. The receiver sticks the chunks back together and rebuilds the original HTTP request</li>
  <li>Once the ground daemon has received and rebuilt the full HTTP request, it sends the request out over the internet.</li>
  <li>The ground daemon receives an HTTP response.</li>
  <li>The ground daemon sends the HTTP response up to the sky proxy using the same process as before, in reverse. This time the ground daemon splits the HTTP response up into chunks and writes each chunk one-by-one to the name field in your airmiles account (it actually writes these response chunks using a second airmiles account to make the protocol simpler)</li>
  <li>The sky proxy polls the second airmiles account. It reads each chunk and sticks them back together to rebuild the HTTP response</li>
  <li>The sky proxy returns the HTTP response to the original call to <code>curl</code>. As far as <code>curl</code> is concerned this is a perfectly normal HTTP response, just a little slow. <code>curl</code> has no idea about the silliness that just transpired</li>
</ol>

<p>The sky proxy and the ground daemon are relatively simple: they send HTTP requests and parse HTTP responses. The magic is in how they squeeze these requests and responses through an airmiles account. Let’s look closer.</p>

<h3 id="squeezing-http-requests-through-an-airmiles-account">Squeezing HTTP requests through an airmiles account</h3>

<p>PySkyWiFi’s communication logic is split into two layers: a <strong>transport layer</strong>, and a <strong>network layer</strong>. The transport layer’s job is to decide what data clients should send to each other. It dictates how senders should split up long messages into manageable chunks, as well as how senders and receivers should signal information like “I am ready to receive another chunk.” The PySkyWiFi transport layer is somewhat similar to the TCP protocol that powers much of the internet, if you squint very hard and don’t know much about TCP.</p>

<p>By contrast, the network layer’s job is to actually send data between clients, once the transport protocol has decided what that data should be. It’s vaguely similar to the IP protocol, if you squint even harder and know even less what you’re talking about.</p>

<p>This division of responsibility between layers is useful because the transport layer doesn’t have to care about how the network layer sends its data, and the network layer doesn’t care what the data it sends means or where it came from. The transport layer just hands the network layer some data, and the network layer sends it however it likes.</p>

<p>This separation makes it easy to add support for new airmiles platforms, because all we have to do is implement a new network layer that reads and writes to the new type of airmiles account. This separation also allows us to write test versions of the network protocol that write and read from local files instead of airmiles accounts. In each case the network layer changes, but the transport layer stays exactly the same. Here’s how they work.</p>

<h4 id="the-transport-layer">The transport layer</h4>

<p>A PySkyWiFi transport connection between two clients consists of two “pipes” (or “airmiles accounts”). Each client has a “SEND” pipe that it can write data to, and a “RECV” pipe that it can read from. Clients write to their SEND pipe by writing data to it, and they read from their RECV pipe by constantly polling it and seeing if anything has changed.</p>

<pre><code>flowchart LR
    Client1 --&gt; Client2
    Client2 --&gt; Client1
</code></pre>

<p>From the transport layer’s point of view, a pipe is just something that it can write and read data from. Beyond that the transport layer doesn’t care how its pipes work.</p>

<p>At any given moment a PSWF (PySkYWiFi) client can only either send or receive data, but not both. A client in <em>send mode</em> will not see data sent by the other client, and a client in <em>receive mode</em> should never send data because the other client won’t see it. This is unlike TCP, where clients can send or receive data at ay time.</p>

<p>When squeezing HTTP requests and responses through an airmiles account, the sky proxy sends the first message and the ground daemon receives it. Once the sky proxy has finished sending its HTTP request it switches to receive mode and the ground daemon switches to send. The ground daemon makes the HTTP request and sends back the response, at which point the two switch roles again so that the sky proxy can send another HTTP request.</p>

<h4 id="how-are-long-messages-sent-through-such-a-small-pipe">How are long messages sent through such a small pipe?</h4>

<p>PSWF uses small pipes (such as an airmiles name field) that can’t fit much data in them at once. This means that it takes some work and care to squeeze long messages (like HTTP requests) through them.</p>

<p>To send a long message, the sender first splits up their message into chunks that will fit into their SEND pipe. They then send each chunk down the pipe one at a time.</p>

<p>To begin a message, a sender starts by sending its first chunk of message data inside a <code>DATA</code> segment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <code>DATA</code> segment consists of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The letter <code>D</code></li>
    <li>The <em>sequence number</em> of the chunk (a number that uniquely identifies the chunk, padded to 6 digits)</li>
    <li>The actual chunk of data.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, a data segment in the middle of a message might read: <code>D000451adline": "Mudslide in Wigan causes m</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the sender has sent a <code>DATA</code> segment, it pauses. It wants to send its next <code>DATA</code> segment, but it can’t overwrite the airmiles account name field until it knows that the receiver has received and processed the previous one.</p>

<p>The receiver tells the sender that it’s safe for to send a new <code>DATA</code> segment by acknowledging every segment that it reads. The receiver does this by writing an <code>ACK</code> segment to its own SEND pipe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An <code>ACK</code> segment consists of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The letter <code>A</code></li>
    <li>The sequence number of the segment that is being acknowledged (padded to 6 digits)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example: <code>A000451</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sender is constantly polling its own RCV pipe to check for changes, and so it reads this new <code>ACK</code> segment promptly. Once the sender reads the <code>ACK</code>, it knows that the receiver has received the segment corresponding to the <code>ACK</code>’s sequence number. For example, if a sender receives an <code>ACK</code> segment with sequence number <code>000451</code>, the sender knows that it’s safe to send the next <code>DATA</code> segment with sequence number <code>000452</code>. The sender therefore pulls the next chunk from its message and constructs a new <code>DATA</code> segment using this chunk and sequence number. The sender writes the new segment to its SEND pipe, and then pauses waits for another <code>ACK</code>.</p>

<p>This loop continues until the sender has sent all the data in its message. To tell the recipient that it’s finished, the sender sends an <code>END</code> segment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An <code>END</code> segment is just the letter <code>E</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a receiver sees an <code>END</code> segment it knows that the sender’s message is over. The sender and the receiver swap roles. The old sender starts polling its RECV pipe for <code>DATA</code> segments, and the old receiver starts chunking up its response message and sending it through its pipe, exactly as before.</p>

<p>None of this transport logic cares about the details of the network layer through which the segments are sent. The transport layer just needs the network layer to provide two pipes that it can read and write to. The network layer can pipe this data around via local files, a Discord profile, or an airmiles account. This genericness is what allows PySkyWiFi to work with any airline’s airmiles account, so long as the airline allows you to login to it from the plane without paying.</p>

<p>Here’s how PSWF uses transport protocol segments to exchange long messages:</p>

<p>The transport layer decides what data the clients should send each other, but it doesn’t say anything about how they should send it. That’s where the network protocol comes in.</p>

<h3 id="the-network-layer">The network layer</h3>

<p>The network layer’s job is to send data between clients. It doesn’t care about where the data came from or what it means; it just receives some data from the transport layer and sends it to the other client (typically via an airmiles account).</p>

<p>This means that the network layer is quite simple. It also means that adding a new network layer for a new airmiles platform is straightforward. You use the new platform to implement a few operations and a few properties (see below), and then the transport layer can automatically to use your new airmiles platform with no extra work.</p>

<p>A network layer consists of two operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>send(msg: str)</code> - write <code>msg</code> to storage. For an airmiles-based implementation, this writes the value of <code>msg</code> to the name field in the user’s airmiles account</li>
  <li><code>recv() -&gt; str</code> - read the message from storage. For an airmiles-based implementation, this reads the value of the name field from the user’s airmiles account.</li>
</ul>

<p>A network layer implementation must also define two properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sleep_for</code> - the number of seconds that the transport layer should sleep for in between polling for new segments from a RECV pipe. <code>sleep_for</code> can be very low for test implementations like files, but it should be at least several seconds for an implementation like an airmiles account. This is in order to avoid hammering remote server with too many requests.</li>
  <li><code>segment_data_size</code> - the number of characters that the transport layer should send in a single segment. Should be equal to the maximum size of the airmiles account field being used to transfer segments (often around 20 characters).</li>
</ul>

<p>A network layer implementation can also optionally provide two more operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>connect_send()</code> - a hook called by the sender when a SEND pipe is initialised. In an airmiles-based implementation this allows the client to login to the platform using a username and password. This gives the client a cookie that it can use to authenticate future <code>send</code> and <code>recv</code> calls.</li>
  <li><code>connect_recv()</code> - a hook called by the receiver when a RECV pipe is initialised</li>
</ul>

<p>If you fill in all these methods, you’ll be able to use PySkyWiFi on a new airline. But again, don’t.</p>

<h3 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and tricks</h3>

<p>When writing a network layer that uses a new airmiles provider, there are a couple of tricks that can make your implementation faster and more reliable.</p>

<h4 id="1-encode-messages-to-make-sure-the-airmiles-account-accepts-them">1. Encode messages to make sure the airmiles account accepts them</h4>

<p>Airmiles HTML forms usually don’t let users include non-alphabetic characters in their name. <code>Stephen</code> will probably be allowed, but <code>GET /data?id=5</code> will probably be rejected.</p>

<p>To work around this, the network layer should encode segments using base26 before writing them to an airmiles account. base26 is a way of representing a string using only the letters <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code> . In order to convert a byte string to base26, you convert the bytes to a single large number, then you represent that number using a counting system with base 26 (hence the name) where the digits are the letters <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>b26_encode</span><span>(</span><span>input_string</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>
    <span># Convert input string to a base-256 integer
</span>    <span>base256_int</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>char</span> <span>in</span> <span>input_string</span><span>:</span>
        <span>base256_int</span> <span>=</span> <span>base256_int</span> <span>*</span> <span>256</span> <span>+</span> <span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span># Convert base-256 integer to base26 string
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>base256_int</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'A'</span>  <span># Special case for empty input or input that equals zero
</span>    
    <span>base26_str</span> <span>=</span> <span>""</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>base256_int</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span>base26_str</span> <span>=</span> <span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>base256_int</span> <span>%</span> <span>26</span> <span>+</span> <span>65</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>base26_str</span>
        <span>base256_int</span> <span>//=</span> <span>26</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>base26_str</span>

<span>b26_encode</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello world"</span><span>)</span>
<span># =&gt; 'CZEZINADXFFTZEIDPKM'
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The transport layer never needs to know about this encoding. The network layer receives some bytes, encodes them using base26, and writes this encoded string of <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code> to the airmiles account. When the network layer reads the base26 value back out of the airmiles account, it decodes the encoded string back into a number and then back into bytes, and then returns those bytes to the transport layer.</p>

<p>Encoding a string using base 26 makes it significantly longer, just like how it takes many more digits to represent a number using binary than decimal. This reduces the bandwidth of our protocol. We could increase our bandwidth by using base52 (using both upper- and lower-case letters) instead of base26, which would shorten it somewhat. This is left as an enhancement for version 2.</p>

<h4 id="2-increase-bandwidth-by-using-more-account-fields">2. Increase bandwidth by using more account fields</h4>

<p>Another way to increase our PSWF bandwidth is to increase the segment size that a network layer can handle. If we double the size of our segments, we double the bandwidth of our protocol.</p>

<p>Fields in airmiles accounts usually have length limits. For example, you might not be allowed to set a name longer than 20 characters. However, we can maximise our bandwidth by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using the full length of the field</li>
  <li>Spreading out a segment across multiple fields</li>
</ol>

<p>Suppose we have control over 5 fields that can each store 20 characters. Instead of using one field to transmit segments of 20 characters, we can split a 100 character segment into 5 chunks of 20 and update them all at once in a single request. The receiver can then read all 5 fields, again in a single request, and stitch them back together to reconstruct the full segment.</p>

<h3 id="further-enhancements">Further enhancements</h3>

<h3 id="http-connect">HTTP <code>CONNECT</code></h3>

<p>It would be better if PySkyWiFi used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT">HTTP <code>CONNECT</code> requests</a> to set up the tunnel from the sky proxy to the target site, instead of manually tossing around HTTP requests. <code>CONNECT</code> requests are how most HTTP proxies work, and using them would allow PySkyWiFi to act as the system-level proxy and so handle requests from a web browser. It would also mean that PySkyWiFi would negotiate TLS connections with the target website directly, so its traffic would be encrypted as it passed through the airmiles account.</p>

<p>On the other hand, using <code>CONNECT</code> would also be a lot more work and I’ve already taken this joke way too far.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>When I was done with all of this I used PySkyWiFi to load the homepage of my blog using <code>curl</code>, tunneling the data via a GitHub Gist. Several minutes later I got a response back. I scrolled around the HTML and reflected that this had been both the most and least productive flight of my life.</p>

<p dir="auto">This repository contains the training code of MobileLLM introduced in our work: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14905" rel="nofollow">MobileLLM: Optimizing Sub-billion Parameter Language Models for On-Device Use Cases</a>", published in ICML 2024.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this work, we comprehensively consider multiple design factors to obtain high-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters. We integrated (1) SwiGLU activation function, (2) deep and thin architectures, (3) embedding sharing, (4) grouped-query attention to build MobileLLM. MobileLLM-125M/350M attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M SoTA models on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks. In our updated version, we further demonstrate that our design philosophy scales effectively to larger models, with SoTA results for MobileLLM-600M/1B/1.5B.</p>

<p>Per a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.druckerchannel.de/artikel.php?ID=5023&amp;t=hp_laserjet_drucker" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.druckerchannel.de/artikel.php?ID=5023&amp;t=hp_laserjet_drucker" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">DruckerChannel</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/hewlett-packard" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/hewlett-packard">HP</a> has finally been forced to discontinue its cheaper e-series LaserJet printers due to customers experiencing problems with their online-only and always tied to HP+ subscription requirements. Among other things, HP+ requires a permanent Internet connection, and customers only use HP-original ink and toners, not allowing for third-party alternatives to be used at all. There are benefits to HP+, including cloud printing and an extra year's warranty, but the forced online requirement for a cheaper printer left a bad taste in the mouths of many consumers.</p><p>In any case, it's important to clarify that this discontinuation of HP printers will only impact HP LaserJet printers that have an "e" added to the end of their model name to denote the alternative business model. So, the HP Laserjet M110w is unaffected by this, but the HP LaserJet M110we and M209dwe, two cheaper always-online alternatives, will no longer be produced or sold by HP.</p><p>Another critical point of clarification is that the existing HP e-series LaserJet printer models in the wild will still function exactly as they did when they were purchased. No software updates are forthcoming to unlock the true potential of the hardware, so existing customers will have to deal with it and HP+ until they can replace their printers entirely. At least they'll still get HP+ benefits, but after such backlash, it'd be nice if HP acknowledged its mistake enough to remove some of the restrictions on e-series printer users.</p><p>Speaking to DruckerChannel, an HP representative had the following to say (translated from German) on the discontinuation of these printers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Since the introduction of HP+, our smart, connected printing system has been embraced by customers who appreciate the convenience, extended warranty, and solutions," said the HP representative, "We know that some customers in IT-managed office environments are unable to meet the cloud connection requirements for HP+. To provide our customers with an exceptional printing experience in all office environments, we will no longer offer LaserJet series products with HP+. We plan to extend proven solutions such as Print from Anywhere and Smart <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security">Security</a> to select new HP LaserJet devices. HP+ customers who are satisfied [...] do not need to make any adjustments."</p><p>The HP representative also disclosed that "HP will stop marketing the Instant Ink toner subscription service later this year. The service will no longer be available to new customers. This will not affect existing Instant Ink toner subscribers, only those new to the service."</p><p>The reasons for Instant Ink's discontinuation are less clear, as it was an optional subscription. DruckerChannel speculates it may have been getting confused or conflated with HP+ and that some customers may even think it required HP+, so HP opted to discontinue the service to simplify things for end users. That step, at least, feels like a slight overcorrection.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PWXp4w6JeR4nwWqNo3Zjv"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/microsofts-xandr-grants-gdpr-rights-rate-0">https://noyb.eu/en/microsofts-xandr-grants-gdpr-rights-rate-0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40913915">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><ul><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2024-07/Xandr%20Complaint-EN_redacted.pdf">Complaint against Xandr (EN)</a></li><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2024-07/Xandr%20Reclamo-IT_redacted.pdf">Complaint against Xandr (IT)</a></li></ul><p><strong>Background: targeted advertising.</strong> If companies want to use targeted advertising to promote their products or services online, they have to go through so-called Real Time Bidding (RTB) platforms. One such platform is run by Microsoft subsidiary Xandr, which allows advertisers to buy ad space on websites or in mobile apps in a fully automated way. When a user visits a website, an algorithmic auction takes place in order to decide which company can display an advertisement. Because a users’ interests and characteristics ultimately determine an advertiser’s willingness to place an ad, Xandr collects and shares a massive amount of personal data in order to profile the users and to allow for targeting. Much of that data is bought by external parties like <a href="https://www.emetriq.com/">emetriq, a subsidiary of the German Telecom</a>.</p><p><strong>Disability? Pregnant? LGBT?</strong> <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2023/microsofts-datenmarktplatz-xandr-das-sind-650-000-kategorien-in-die-uns-die-online-werbeindustrie-einsortiert/">Previous research has shown</a> that <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/06/08/from-heavy-purchasers-of-pregnancy-tests-to-the-depression-prone-we-found-650000-ways-advertisers-label-you">Xandr collects hundreds of sensitive profiles</a> of Europeans containing information about their health, sex life or sexual orientation, political or philosophical opinions, religious beliefs or financial status. Specific segments include things like ‘french_disability’, ‘pregnant’, ‘lgbt’, ‘gender_equality’ and ‘jewishfrench’.</p><p><strong>0% compliance with GDPR requests. </strong>According to the GDPR, everyone has the right to get access to their information. However, despite collecting vast amounts of detailed information about people, Xandr reports an astonishing 0% response rate to access and erasure requests in 2022. <a href="https://monetize.xandr.com/privacy-center/metric-calculations">Xandr even publishes these internal statistics</a> on a hidden website for everyone to see. The complainant has experienced this approach first hand: When he requested access to his data, Xandr claimed that it couldn’t identify him - and denied his request for access and erasure. In reality, the company has all the necessary information to single out specific data subjects. Identifying and targeting individuals is after all their core business.</p><p>Massimiliano Gelmi, data protection lawyer at <em>noyb</em>: <em>“Xandr’s business is obviously based on keeping data on millions of Europeans and targeting them. Still, the company admits that it has a 0% response rate to access and erasure requests. It is astonishing that Xandr even publicly illustrates how it breaches the GDPR.”</em></p></div><div><p><strong>(Un)targeted advertising.</strong> In addition, the GDPR requires data about individuals to be 'accurate'. However, the available information suggests that Xandr’s system uses tonnes of false information about users. Even from a business perspective, Xandr seems to make a mockery of the idea of targeted advertising. Thanks to an access request with the data broker – and Xandr supplier – emetriq, we know that at least part of Xandr’s database consists of wildly inaccurate and contradictory personal data about people: According to emetriq, the complainant is both male and female, has an estimated age between 16-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and 60+. The complainant also has an income between €500 - €1,500, €1,500 - €2,500 and €2,500 - €4,000. Furthermore, the same person is looking for a job, is employed, a student, a pupil and works in a company. That company, in turn, employs 1-10, 1,000+ and 1,100-5,000 people at the same time. It is hard to imagine how these data categories can be used for accurate ad targeting. Although emetriq isn’t the only data broker supplying data to Xandr, it has to be assumed that this information is used for ad targeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Massimiliano Gelmi, data protection lawyer at <em>noyb</em>: <em>“It seems that parts of the advertising industry don’t really care about providing advertisers with accurate information. Instead, the data set contains a chaotic variety of conflicting information. This can potentially benefit companies like Xandr as they can sell the same user as young and old to different business partners.”</em></p><p><strong>Complaint filed in Italy. </strong><em>noyb</em> has now filed a GDPR complaint with the Italian data protection authority (Garante) regarding transparency issues, the right of access and the use of inaccurate information about users. Overall, Xandr appears to be in breach of Article 5(1)(c) and (d), Article 12(2), Article 15 and Article 17 of the GDPR. We therefore ask the authority to investigate Xandr’s processing operations and to order the company to comply with the complainant’s request for access and erasure. With respect to all affected data subjects, we also suggest that the Garante orders Xandr to bring its processing operations in line with the principles of data minimisation and accuracy. Finally, we suggest that the competent authority impose an effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine of up to 4% of Xandr’s annual turnover.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8106">https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8106</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40912684">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-8106">
				
<p>In Michael Sipser’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X"><em>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</em> textbook</a>, he has one Platonically perfect homework exercise, so perfect that I can reconstruct it from memory despite not having opened the book for over a decade.  It goes like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Let f:{0,1}*→{0,1} be the constant 1 function if God exists, or the constant 0 function if God does not exist. Is f computable? (<em>Hint:</em> The answer does not depend on your religious beliefs.)</li>
</ul>



<p>The correct answer is that yes, f is computable.  Why?  Because the constant 1 function is computable, and so is the constant 0 function, so if f is one or the other, then it’s computable.</p>



<p>If you’re still tempted to quibble, then consider the following parallel question:</p>



<ul>
<li>Let n equal 3 if God exists, or 5 if God does not exist.  Is n prime?</li>
</ul>



<p>The answer is again yes: even though n hasn’t been completely mathematically specified, it’s been specified <em>enough</em> for us to say that it’s prime (just like if we’d said, “n is an element of the set {3,5}; is n prime?”).  Similarly, f has been specified enough for us to say that it’s computable.</p>



<p>The deeper lesson Sipser was trying to impart is that the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function">computability</a> applies to <em>functions</em> or <em>infinite sequences</em>, not to individual yes-or-no questions or individual integers.  Relatedly, and even more to the point: computability is about whether a computer program <em>exists</em> to map inputs to outputs in a specified way; it says nothing about how hard it might be to <em>choose</em> or <em>find</em> or <em>write</em> that program.  Writing the program could even require settling God’s existence, for all the definition of computability cares.</p>



<hr>



<p>Dozens of times in the past 25 years, I’ve gotten some variant on the following question, always with the air that I’m about to bowled over by its brilliance:</p>



<ul>
<li>Could the P versus NP question <em>itself</em> be NP-hard, and therefore impossible to solve?</li>
</ul>



<p>Every time I get this one, I struggle to unpack the layers of misconceptions.  But for starters: the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness">“NP-hard”</a> applies to <em>functions</em> or <em>languages</em>, like 3SAT or Independent Set or Clique or whatnot, all of which <em>take an input</em> (a Boolean formula, a graph, etc) and produce a corresponding output.  NP-hardness means that, if you had a polynomial-time algorithm to map the inputs to the outputs, then you could convert it via reductions into a polynomial-time algorithm for any language or function in the class NP.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/pnp.pdf">P versus NP</a>, by contrast, is an individual yes-or-no question.  Its answer (for all we know) could be independent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms</a> of set theory, but there’s no sense in which the question could be uncomputable or NP-hard.  Indeed, a fast program that correctly answers the P vs. NP question trivially exists:</p>



<ul>
<li>If P=NP, then the program prints “P=NP.”</li>



<li>If P≠NP, then the program prints “P≠NP.”</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>In the comments of <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8088">last week’s post</a> on the breakthrough determination of Busy Beaver 5, I got several variants on the following question:</p>



<ul>
<li>What’s the smallest n for which the value of BB(n) is uncomputable?  Could BB(6) already be uncomputable?</li>
</ul>



<p>Once again, I explained that the Busy Beaver <em>function</em> is uncomputable, but the concept of computability doesn’t apply to individual integers like BB(6).  Indeed, whichever integer k turns out to equal BB(6), the program “print k” clearly exists, and it clearly outputs that integer!</p>



<p>Again, we can ask for the smallest n such that the value of BB(n) is <em>unprovable in ZF set theory</em> (or some other system of axioms)—precisely the question that Adam Yedidia and I <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04343">did ask in 2016</a> (the current record stands at n=745, improving my and Adam’s n=8000).  But <em>every</em> specific integer is “computable”; it’s only the BB function <em>as a whole</em> that’s uncomputable.</p>



<p>Alas, in return for explaining this, I got more pushback, and even ridicule and abuse that I chose to leave in the moderation queue.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, I’ve come to think of this as the Zombie Misconception of Theoretical Computer Science: this constant misapplication of concepts that were designed for infinite sequences and functions, to individual integers and open problems. (Or, relatedly: the constant conflation of the uncomputability of the halting problem with Gödel incompleteness.  While they’re closely related, only Gödel lets you talk about <em>individual</em> statements rather than infinite families of statements, and only Turing-computability is absolute, rather than relative to a system of axioms.)</p>



<p>Anyway, I’m writing this post mostly just so that I have a place to link the <em>next</em> time this pedagogical zombie rises from its grave, muttering “UNCOMPUTABLE INTEGERRRRRRS….”  But also so I can query my readers: what are <em>your</em> ideas for how to keep this zombie down?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span lang="EN-GB">Nearly 2 million metric tons of wild fish are harvested from the ocean to feed Norwegian farmed salmon every year, according to a report from U.K.- and Netherlands-based environmental campaign group Feedback, as well as a coalition of West African and Norwegian organizations.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">According to </span><a href="http://feedbackglobal.org/blue-empire"><span lang="EN-GB">"Blue Empire: How the Norwegian salmon industry extracts nutrition and undermines livelihoods in West Africa,"</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> these wild fish are used to produce fish oil for salmon feed, which is contributing to the loss of livelihoods and malnutrition in the West African countries of The Gambia, Senegal, and Mauritania.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">“Along the West African coast, small-scale fishing is the only means of subsistence for Indigenous communities,” </span><span lang="FR">Regional Network of Marine Protected Areas in West Africa (</span><span lang="EN-GB">RAMPAO</span><span lang="FR">) Executive Secretary </span><span lang="EN-GB">Marie Suzanna Traore</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="FR">said. </span><span lang="EN-GB">”The big boats that supply the fishmeal and fish oil industry with fish caught in African waters <span>–</span> to the detriment of these communities <span>–</span> undermine their human dignity.”</span><o:p></o:p></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">In the report, Feedback calculated that the Norwegian salmon farming industry’s "feed footprint" is equivalent to 2.5 percent of global marine fisheries catch. The report also estimated that Norway’s annual output of farmed salmon is 27 percent lower than the volume of wild fish required to produce the fish oil used in Norwegian farmed salmon feed. The Norwegian industry’s plan to more than triple farmed salmon production to 5 million metric tons by 2050 would create demand for over three times as much wild-caught fish compared to 2020.<span> <o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span><span lang="EN-GB">“While salmon companies claim their ‘blue revolution’ will contribute to global food security by feeding the world, the rapid expansion of industrial aquaculture is fueling a modern-day colonialism <span>–</span> or food imperialism,” Feedback Campaigns Director Natasha Hurley said. “Despite mounting hunger and malnutrition in West African countries, corporate sustainability initiatives are failing to protect West African communities from hunger and malnutrition linked to the voracious appetite of the salmon-farming industry for wild fish.”</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Feedback estimated that <span>fish sourced from West African fishing grounds to </span>supply fish oil to the Norwegian salmon farming industry in 2020 could have provided up to 4 million people in the region with a year’s supply of fish.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Four of the industry’s biggest feed producers <span>–</span> Mowi, Skretting, Cargill, and Biomar <span>–</span> supply most of the feed used in Norwegian salmon farming, and each sources fish oil from northwest Africa. </span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">One-quarter of the total volume of fish oil sourced from West Africa by Norwegian companies was purchased by Mowi in 2020, including 5,100 MT of fish oil from Mauritania in 2020, which Feedback calculates was produced from 28,300 MT of fish. Another 17,000 MT of fish oil were sourced by Skretting, Cargill, and BioMar from&nbsp;</span>the major fishing area located off the west coast of Africa known as FAO 34<span lang="EN-GB">. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">In Mauritania, round sardinella catches dropped by 66 percent between 2020 and 2021, while in Senegal, they dropped by 86 percent and in Gambia by 16 percent over the same period, according to Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission Techincal Advisor Mika Samba Diop.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">“Unfair competition from fishmeal factories, which offer more money for catches, has resulted in many women who process small pelagic fish losing their jobs,” Diop said. “The overexploitation of fish stocks has led to a drastic reduction in small-scale fishers’ incomes and local fish consumption of fish. For example, in The Gambia, annual per capita consumption of fish has gone from 15 kilograms in 2020 to only 8 kilogarms in 2021.”<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">As part of the campaign, Feedback and fellow environmental NGO WildFish is calling for British restaurant chain Wagamama to stop serving farmed salmon.The chain, which has nearly 200 U.K. locations, currently features three dishes featuring farmed salmon.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">"The campaign was launched after Wagamama failed to respond to several letters from NGOs asking for clarification on its farmed salmon sourcing standards," Feedback Campaigner Liam Lysaght said in a press release. "</span><span lang="EN-GB">As a restaurant which markets itself as a sustainability leader, Wagamama’s response may set a precedent for the place of farmed salmon on hospitality menus.</span></p><p><i>Photo courtesy of Evannovostro/Shutterstock<o:p></o:p></i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<div>
<p>I’m getting married pretty soon, and I figured it’d be fun to make my own rings. I’d seen a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Pcp944sRI">Nile Red video where he made purple gold</a>, and the process seemed simple enough: Make a mold, pour some molten metal into it, and voila you have metal in the shape of the mold. It turns out that the devil is in the details.</p>

<p>Since I wanted the ring to fit my finger precisely, and I wanted it to be pure gold, I figured that lost PLA casting was my best bet. The process is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost-wax_casting">lost wax casting</a>, but starts with a 3D printed part instead of a wax form. I’d 3D print the ring I wanted, make a plaster mold of it, heat up the mold until the plastic melted/vaporized away, then pour molten metal into the mold. After it cooled I’d rinse away the plaster, then cut off the excess metal and polish the ring.</p>

<p>I had a 3D printer, but none of the other necessary equipment. I bought:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investment plaster</li>
  <li>Some cast iron pipe to use as a flask</li>
  <li>A vacuum pump and chamber (for getting bubbles out of the liquid plaster)</li>
  <li>A small electric kiln for burning out the mold</li>
  <li>A handheld torch for melting the metal</li>
  <li>A crucible</li>
  <li>Borax</li>
  <li>Tongs</li>
  <li>5 ounces of fine silver (because gold is <em>expensive</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The plan was simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3d print the desired shape.</li>
  <li>Make a plaster mold.</li>
  <li>Heat up the mold in the kiln, curing the plaster and burning/vaporizing the plastic.</li>
  <li>Coat the crucible with borax, then torch the metal in the crucible until it’s melted.</li>
  <li>Take the out the mold and pour the molten metal in.</li>
  <li>Wash away the plaster.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the trial run worked, the plan was to buy some gold and repeat the process. Jewelry made of pure silver or gold is rare because the un-alloyed metals are very soft, causing them to scratch or deform easily. I thought it was worth the tradeoff since I wouldn’t have to worry about oxides when melting the metal. Also pure silver/gold looks unique. Pure silver is the most reflective metal, and pure gold has a deeper color than lower karat gold used in most jewerly.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-test">The First Test</h2>

<p>I didn’t have much trouble following my plan:</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_3670.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_3670.JPG" alt="Printing"></a>

<a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_3643.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_3643.JPG" alt="Removing bubbles"></a>
<a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_0995.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_0995.JPG" alt="Melting"></a>
<a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_0999.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_0999.JPG" alt="Melted"></a>
<a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_1006.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_1006.JPG" alt="Washing out the plaster"></a>
<a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_1011.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_1011.JPG" alt="It fits!"></a></p>

<p>This was the result:</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_3647.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_3647.JPG" alt="First attempt"></a></p>

<p>After polishing, it looked like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_3663.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_3663.JPG" alt="After polishing"></a></p>

<p>It was promising, but it had quite a few defects. No amount of polishing could fix them, as they permeated the casting. I searched around and discovered two important facts: First, although molten silver doesn’t react with oxygen, it does dissolve oxygen from the atmosphere. Right before the silver solidifies, it spits out the oxygen and forms bubbles, ruining the cast. Second, pure metals have a melting/freezing point, while alloys have a melting range. A metal that freezes more quickly has a harder time filling in all the tiny details in the mold.</p>

<p>Armed with this new knowledge, I changed my plan in two ways. First, I’d make an alloy of 90% silver and 10% gold. Second, I’d build a contraption to hook up my vacuum pump to the flask. This would suck oxygen out of the molten metal and help force the metal into every crevice of the mold.</p>

<h2 id="testing-alloyed-silver--vacuum-casting">Testing: Alloyed silver + Vacuum Casting</h2>

<p>I went to the hardware store and grabbed some parts to construct a vacuum base for the flask. I drilled a few holes in a steel plate, then used some JB weld to attach the plate to some fittings. I used a piece of ABS pipe as support. A hose connected it to my vacuum pump. I ordered a 2 inch diameter steel tube to use as a flask, as the cast iron had no bottom opening and had degraded from the heat. I found out later that cast iron is coated in zinc, so it was a terrible idea to use it as a flask. I could have given myself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_fume_fever">metal fume fever</a>.</p>

<p>I also put some rubber on the steel plate to help get a seal.</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_3692.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_3692.JPG" alt="Vacuum device"></a></p>

<p>When I put the flask on the rubber, the rubber melted and smoked, failing to get a seal around the flask.</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_3675.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_3675.JPG" alt="Melted rubber"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_3676.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_3676.JPG" alt="Still defects"></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the result wasn’t much better than my first test.</p>

<h2 id="testing-again">Testing Again</h2>

<p>For my next attempt, I replaced the rubber with some silicone rubber. Silicone rubber is much more resilient to high temperatures. I would have used it earlier, but the black rubber was the only thing I could find at the hardware store. I also JB welded some metal tubing to replace the janky ABS pipe support.</p>

<p>In this test, the mold had cooled significantly before I poured the metal in. Also I think the metal wasn’t hot enough and froze before it could fill all the details in the mold. The quality of the casting was better, but still not good enough. The ring on the right is the new one. The one on the left is from the previous attempt.</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_3713.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_3713.JPG" alt="Better, but still not good enough"></a></p>

<p>Polishing makes these rings look better than they really are. The inside of the ring still had quite a few defects, causing it to look bad when not on a finger. Also the irregularities made wearing it distracting.</p>

<p>It was around this point that I realized that I liked the look of the silver more than gold. Yes, gold is expensive and rare, but it’s not as shiny. And these rings are for our benefit, not everyone else’s.</p>

<h2 id="yet-another-attempt">Yet Another Attempt</h2>

<p>The only changes I made on this attempt were to remove the flask at the last minute and to spend more time heating the metal.</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_4389_1.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_4389_1.JPG" alt="Success!"></a>
<a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_4393_1.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_4393_1.JPG" alt="Another view"></a></p>

<p>It turned out perfect. You can see the layer lines from the 3D print. After cutting off the excess, I sanded, polished, and hammered it. (My fiancee preferred the faceted look of a hammered surface to a smooth polished surface.)</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_4396_1.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_4396_1.JPG" alt="Almost done"></a></p>

<p>There are still some layer lines visible in this image as I wasn’t quite done hammering and polishing it. I like the effect, but it’s not as shiny.</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_4398_1.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_4398_1.JPG" alt="Finished product"></a></p>

<p>The perspective makes it look like the ring is too big to fit on a finger, but it fits perfectly. I think only a professional jeweler could tell that this was made by a hobbyist.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a tough but rewarding project. Until the final attempt, I was worried that I’d never be able to make a decent ring. But I knew that jewelers are not magicians. Whatever they’re doing, I could reproduce. I just needed to understand enough of the chemistry and physics involved.</p>

<p>The final product was exactly what I wanted. Because it’s a casting, the core is soft and malleable, meaning it won’t shatter if dropped. But since the outer surface is work hardened from hammering, it’s less likely to collect scratches. Also I can re-hammer it to remove any scratches. Since the rings are made entirely of noble metals, they’ll never corrode. The trace amounts of sulfur compounds in the atmosphere will tarnish the silver eventually, but a small amount of polishing will fix that.</p>

<p>In total, this project took me six weekends over three months and cost around $3,500. Most of that was the ounce of gold I bought ($2,300). The equipment was a little under $1,000 and the 5 ounces of silver ran me $125. I could have ordered a sterling silver ring for $100, or I could have worked with a jeweler to fabricate two rings of the desired style and alloy, but it wouldn’t have been the same. Our rings have a story.</p>

<p>Knowing what I know now, I probably could have made these rings without casting. I could have heated up the metal, hammered it into shape, reheated to undo the work hardening, and repeated that process until I had the ring I desired. In fact I did so with the extra gold:</p>

<p><a href="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/IMG_4402_1.JPG"><img src="https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/ring/thumbs/IMG_4402_1.JPG" alt="A hammer forged gold ring"></a></p>

<p>It’s ridiculously ostentatious, but it is kinda cool. Also gold is 1.7x the density of silver or lead, so it makes a very rewarding sound when knocked against anything.</p>

<p>That said, I’m glad I made these rings the way I did. They’re totally unique. Nobody makes jewelry like this, because gold is so much more expensive than silver. It’s far more cost effective to alloy the silver with copper. But such alloys tarnish more quickly and are less reflective.</p>

<p>And paying someone else for rings wouldn’t be as cool, or as romantic. Every time we look at our rings, we’re reminded of how much of our own efforts went into them. I’m reminded of the initial idea and thinking, “How hard could it be?” I’m reminded of the trial and error, the mistakes, the frustrations, the determination to keep working through problems, and the eventual beautiful success.</p>

<p>Hmm. That almost sounds like a relationship.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’d like to thank <a href="https://mokume-gane.com/">James Binnion</a> for publishing so much useful information about jewelry casting. In addition to <a href="https://orchid.ganoksin.com/u/james_binnion2/activity">his countless forum posts</a> helping others, he published a very informative paper about <a href="https://patternedart.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/binnionsfs2016.pdf">casting defects in 3D printed resin</a>. Without him, I would have had a much harder time accomplishing this.</p>

<p>The site launched in <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-opens-the-door-to-z-library-and-other-pirate-libraries-221118/">the fall of 2022</a>, just days after Z-Library was targeted in a U.S. criminal crackdown, to ensure continued availability of ‘free’ books and articles to the broader public. </p>
<p>Late last year, Anna’s Archive <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-scraped-worldcat-to-help-preserve-all-books-in-the-world-231003/">expanded its offering</a> by making information from OCLC’s proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldCat">WorldCat database</a> available online. The site’s operators took more than a year to scrape several terabytes of data and published roughly 700 million unique records online, for free.</p>
<center><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/worldcattorrent.jpg" alt="worldcat" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/worldcattorrent.jpg 871w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/worldcattorrent-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></center>
<p>This ‘metadata’ heist was a massive breakthrough in the site’s quest to archive as much published content as possible. However, OCLC wasn’t pleased and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/lawsuit-accuses-annas-archive-of-hacking-worldcat-stealing-2-2-tb-data-240207/">responded with a lawsuit</a> at an Ohio federal court, accusing the site and its operators of hacking and demanding damages. </p>
<p>The non-profit says that it spent more than a million dollars responding to Anna’s Archive’s alleged hacking efforts. Even then, it couldn’t prevent the data from being released through a torrent. </p>
<p>“Defendants, through the Anna’s Archive domains, have made, and continue to make, all 2.2 TB of WorldCat® data available for public download through its torrents,” OCLC wrote in the complaint it filed in an Ohio federal court.</p>
<h2>No Response from Anna’s Archive</h2>
<p>In the months that passed since then, the operators of Anna’s Archive didn’t respond in court. The only named defendant <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/key-defendant-in-annas-archive-lawsuit-denies-any-involvement-with-the-site-240416/">flat-out denied</a> all connections to the site, and OCLC didn’t receive any response from any of the official Anna’s Archive email addresses that were served. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pirate library continues to offer the WorldCat® data, which is a major problem for the organization. Without the prospect of a two-sided legal battle, OCLC has now moved for a default judgment. </p>
<p>“OCLC respectfully prays that a default judgment be entered in its favor against defendant Anna’s Archive and that OCLC be granted declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages,” the non-profit writes. </p>
<p>The plaintiff notes that it continues to fight an unknown defendant who is unwilling to show up in court. Therefore, a default judgment is the only option it has left.</p>
<h2>Millions in Damages</h2>
<p>While the exact scale of the damages has yet to be established, OCLC states that it has suffered considerable harm. In response to the massive scraping operation, which caused substantial downtime, its technical infrastructure had to be upgraded and improved. </p>
<p>For example, the organization spent $1,548,693 on upgrades for its hardware infrastructure, and an additional $608,069 for a two-year Cloudflare contract that helps to protect the service against malicious outside attacks. </p>

<p>Other costs include the salaries of 34 full-time employees, who were tasked with mitigating the harm caused by the attacks, as well as various other investigation, security, and hardware-related costs. </p>
<p>Adding up all the extra charges brings total damages to over $5 million; OCLC says the harm is ongoing, so that number continues to rise.</p>
<p>“OCLC has incurred damages of $5,333,064 as a direct result of Anna’s Archive’s cyberattacks, but that amount does not fully compensate OCLC for the harm from Anna’s Archive’s wrongful actions. OCLC continues to suffer from harms that cannot be remedied by monetary damages.” </p>
<h2>Site Blocking?</h2>
<p>In addition to monetary damages, the non-profit also seeks injunctive relief. The motion doesn’t specify the requested measures, but the original complaint sought an order that prevents Anna’s Archive from scraping WorldCat data going forward. </p>
<p>In addition, all previously scraped data should no longer be distributed. Instead, it should be destroyed in full, including all the torrents that are currently being offered. </p>
<p>OCLC says the requested injunctive relief is warranted, noting that this isn’t the first time that rightsholders have requested courts to take action against the site. Multiple countries and publishers have already recognized the illegality of Anna’s Archive’s pirate activities by issuing site blocking injunctions against its domains. </p>
<p>“Anna’s Archive has been banned in several other countries for its deliberate violations of copyright laws, and publishers are making shutting down Anna’s Archive a top priority,” the motion reads, referencing bans in <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/silenzio-annas-archive-shadow-library-blocked-following-publishers-complaint-240104/">Italy</a> and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/dutch-court-orders-isp-to-block-annas-archiveand-libgen-240322/">The Netherlands</a>. </p>
<p>“Therefore, the public interest will be served by an injunction that curtails the continuing harm from Anna’s Archive’s flagrant disregard for the law,” OCLC adds. </p>
<h2>Domain Suspension?</h2>
<p>The current motion doesn’t include a request for site blocking in the United States. However, it is possible that OCLC may ask more concrete measures in the future. That could also include a potential domain suspension. </p>
<p>In this light, it is interesting to note that Anna’s Archive moved away from its .org domain about a week ago. The .org domain is managed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Registry">Public Interest Registry</a> with Tucows as the registrar, both of which fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. </p>
<center><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/annanews.jpg" alt="anna new doman name" width="500" height="185" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/annanews.jpg 711w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/annanews-300x111.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></center>
<p>Anna’s Archive switched to a .GS domain instead, which falls under the UK-based <a href="https://nic.gs/">Atlantis North</a> registry. That domain was registered by domain privacy provider Njalla, which adds another layer of complexity from an enforcement perspective.</p>
<p>As things stand, it appears that Anna’s Archive is not going anywhere. While OCLC may very well have the law on its side, enforcing it may turn out to be quite the challenge. </p>

Essentially, they make it possible to forward any message received to your personal email. The aliases are private and never include anything in the address that would reveal any information about you.&nbsp;</p><p>But why would you need this?</p><p>Take, for instance, any time you sign up for an online service or subscription. When you do, you typically use your personal email address, which means that address could be sold by the original company and land you on numerous mailing lists or worse. In the name of all things privacy, you don't want that.</p><p>There are <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/generator/#username-types">plenty of services</a> that offer email aliases, such as SimpleLogin, Addy.io, Firefox Relay, Fastmail, DuckDuckGo, and Forward Email. In fact, Bitwarden supports each of those. Of course, you do have to already have an account with one of those services, and some of those services are free. You'll want to check into which service you prefer and sign up.</p></section><div><p data-testid="videoplayer"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQMAu7bDYmU?rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1" title="Bitwarden video" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div><section><p>So, how do you make them work with Bitwarden?

This feature is available on the desktop app, web app, browser extension, and mobile app, but this blog will walk through using it with the desktop app. You'll also need the access API token for your email relay service. Which service you use will determine where the API token is located. It can be a bit tricky to locate this information. For example, with DuckDuckGo, here are the steps:</p><ol><li><p>Go to the Autofill tab on the DuckDuckGo email protection page.</p></li><li><p>Open your web browser's developer tools.</p></li><li><p>Click the Generate Private Duck Address button and then go to the Network tab in the developer tools window.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Select the Addresses call for the API POST request.</p></li><li><p>Locate the API authorization item, which will look like <i>authorization: Bearer &lt;TOKEN&gt; </i>Where TOKEN is your authorization token.</p></li><li><p>Copy the authorization token, as you will need that later.</p></li></ol><p>In Firefox Relay, you'll find the authorization token in Settings, which you access via your profile icon. In the Settings window, you'll see the API Key listed.</p><p>With those things in place, it's time to work with Bitwarden.</p><p id="setting-up-the-forwarded-email-alias"><a href="#setting-up-the-forwarded-email-alias" title="#setting-up-the-forwarded-email-alias"><svg version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M30.939 9.669l-7.372-0.014 1.332-8.422c0.022-0.138 0.016-0.279-0.016-0.415s-0.092-0.264-0.174-0.377c-0.082-0.113-0.186-0.209-0.305-0.282s-0.251-0.122-0.389-0.144-0.279-0.016-0.415 0.016c-0.136 0.033-0.264 0.092-0.377 0.174-0.229 0.166-0.382 0.415-0.426 0.694l-1.388 8.75-8.728-0.018 1.316-8.31c0.028-0.141 0.027-0.286-0.002-0.426s-0.087-0.274-0.169-0.391c-0.082-0.118-0.187-0.218-0.309-0.294s-0.257-0.127-0.399-0.15c-0.142-0.022-0.287-0.016-0.426 0.019s-0.27 0.097-0.384 0.184c-0.114 0.087-0.21 0.195-0.282 0.32s-0.117 0.262-0.134 0.405l-1.366 8.64-7.776-0.016c-0.283 0-0.554 0.112-0.754 0.312s-0.312 0.471-0.312 0.754c0 0.283 0.112 0.554 0.312 0.754s0.471 0.312 0.754 0.312l7.442 0.014-1.4 8.876-7.718-0.016c-0.283 0-0.554 0.112-0.754 0.312s-0.312 0.471-0.312 0.754c0 0.283 0.112 0.554 0.312 0.754s0.471 0.312 0.754 0.312l7.384 0.016-1.266 8c-0.044 0.279 0.024 0.564 0.19 0.793s0.416 0.382 0.694 0.427c0.052 0.009 0.104 0.013 0.156 0.014 0.254 0 0.499-0.091 0.692-0.256s0.32-0.394 0.358-0.644l1.32-8.33 8.73 0.018-1.248 7.89c-0.044 0.279 0.024 0.564 0.19 0.793s0.415 0.382 0.694 0.427c0.056 0.009 0.112 0.013 0.168 0.014 0.253-0.001 0.498-0.092 0.691-0.257s0.32-0.393 0.359-0.643l1.3-8.218 7.762 0.016c0.283 0 0.554-0.112 0.754-0.312s0.312-0.471 0.312-0.754c0-0.283-0.112-0.554-0.312-0.754s-0.471-0.312-0.754-0.312l-7.428-0.016 1.4-8.876 7.704 0.016c0.283 0 0.554-0.112 0.754-0.312s0.312-0.471 0.312-0.754-0.112-0.554-0.312-0.754c-0.2-0.2-0.471-0.312-0.754-0.312h0.014zM19.671 20.657l-8.732-0.018 1.4-8.876 8.73 0.018-1.398 8.876z"></path></svg></a><h2>Setting up the forwarded email alias</h2></p><p>Open Bitwarden and create a new vault entry.
