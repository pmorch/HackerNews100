I'm smart and read the title of this blog post so I know that this is most definitely not a circle."</p><p>Well it is. Specifically it is a raster image of a circle that I created with the Gimp just for this use.</p><p>However almost every "circle" you can see in printed media (and most purely digital ones) are not, in fact, circles. Why is this?</p><p>Since roughly the mid 80s all "high quality" print jobs have been done either in PostScript or, nowadays almost exclusively, in PDF. They use the same basic drawing model, which does not have a primitive for circles (or circle arcs). The only primitives they have are straight line segments, rectangles and Bézier curves. None of these can be used to express a circle accurately. You can only do an approximation of a circle but it is always slightly eccentric. The only way to create a proper circle is to have a raster image like the one above.</p><h2>Does this matter in the real world?</h2><p>For printing probably not. Almost nobody can tell the difference between a real circle and one that has been approximated with a Bézier curve with just four points. Furthermore, the human vision system is a bit weird and perfect circles look vertically elongated. You have to make them non-circular for people to consider them properly circular.</p><p>But suppose you want to use one of these things:</p><p><a href="https://api.hel.fi/respa/resource_image/797?dim=700x420"><img data-original-height="420" data-original-width="700" height="192" src="https://api.hel.fi/respa/resource_image/797?dim=700x420" width="320"></a></p><p>This is a laser cutter that takes its "print jobs" as a PDF file and uses its vector drawing commands to drive the cutting head. This means that it is impossible to use it to print a wheel. You'd need to attach the output to a lathe and sand it down to be round so it actually functions as a wheel rather than as a vibration source.</p><p>Again one might ask whether this has any practical impact. For this case, again, probably not. But did you know that one of the cases PDF is being considered (and, based on Internet rumors, is already being used) is as an interchange format for CAD drawings? Now it suddenly starts mattering. If you have any component where getting a really accurate circle shape is vital (like pistons and their holes), suddenly all your components are slightly misshaped. Which would not be fun.</p><h2>Extra bonus information</h2><p>Even though it is impossible to construct a path that is perfectly circular, PDF does provide a way to draw a filled circle. Here is the relevant snippet from the PDF 2.0 spec, subsection 8.5.3.2:</p><blockquote><p>If a subpath is degenerate (consists of a single-point closed path or of two or more points at the same coordinates), the S operator shall paint it only if round line caps have been specified, producing a filled circle centred at the single point.</p></blockquote><p>Who is willing to put money on the line that every PDF rendering implementation actually uses circles rather than doing the simple thing of approximating it with Béziers?</p>

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Go 1.21 includes a preview of a change to <code>for</code> loop scoping
that we plan to ship in Go 1.22,
removing one the most common Go mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>If you’ve written any amount of Go code, you’ve probably made the mistake
of keeping a reference to a loop variable past the end of its iteration,
at which point it takes on a new value that you didn’t want.
For example, consider this program:</p>
<pre><code>func main() {
    done := make(chan bool)

    values := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
    for _, v := range values {
        go func() {
            fmt.Println(v)
            done &lt;- true
        }()
    }

    // wait for all goroutines to complete before exiting
    for _ = range values {
        &lt;-done
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The three created goroutines are all printing the same variable <code>v</code>,
so they usually print “c”, “c”, “c”, instead of printing “a”, “b”, and “c” in some order.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/doc/faq#closures_and_goroutines" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Go FAQ entry “What happens with closures running as goroutines?”</a>,
gives this example and remarks
“Some confusion may arise when using closures with concurrency.”</p>
<p>Although concurrency is often involved, it need not be.
This example has the same problem but no goroutines:</p>
<pre><code>func main() {
    var prints []func()
    for i := 1; i &lt;= 3; i++ {
        prints = append(prints, func() { fmt.Println(i) })
    }
    for _, print := range prints {
        print()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This kind of mistake has caused production problems at many companies,
including a
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/60078-loopvar.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly documented issue at Lets Encrypt</a>.
In that instance, the accidental capture of the loop variable was spread across
multiple functions and much more difficult to notice:</p>
<pre><code>// authz2ModelMapToPB converts a mapping of domain name to authz2Models into a
// protobuf authorizations map
func authz2ModelMapToPB(m map[string]authz2Model) (*sapb.Authorizations, error) {
    resp := &amp;sapb.Authorizations{}
    for k, v := range m {
        // Make a copy of k because it will be reassigned with each loop.
        kCopy := k
        authzPB, err := modelToAuthzPB(&amp;v)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        resp.Authz = append(resp.Authz, &amp;sapb.Authorizations_MapElement{
            Domain: &amp;kCopy,
            Authz: authzPB,
        })
    }
    return resp, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>The author of this code clearly understood the general problem, because they made a copy of <code>k</code>,
but it turns out <code>modelToAuthzPB</code> used pointers to fields in <code>v</code> when constructing its result,
so the loop also needed to make a copy of <code>v</code>.</p>
<p>Tools have been written to identify these mistakes, but it is hard to analyze
whether references to a variable outlive its iteration or not.
These tools must choose between false negatives and false positives.
The <code>loopclosure</code> analyzer used by <code>go vet</code> and <code>gopls</code> opts for false negatives,
only reporting when it is sure there is a problem but missing others.
Other checkers opt for false positives, accusing correct code of being incorrect.
We ran an analysis of commits adding <code>x := x</code> lines in open-source Go code,
expecting to find bug fixes.
Instead we found many unnecessary lines being added,
suggesting instead that popular checkers have significant false positive rates,
but developers add the lines anyway to keep the checkers happy.</p>
<p>One pair of examples we found was particularly illuminating:</p>
<p>This diff was in one program:</p>
<pre><code>     for _, informer := range c.informerMap {
+        informer := informer
         go informer.Run(stopCh)
     }
</code></pre>
<p>And this diff was in another program:</p>
<pre><code>     for _, a := range alarms {
+        a := a
         go a.Monitor(b)
     }
</code></pre>
<p>One of these two diffs is a bug fix; the other is an unnecessary change.
You can’t tell which is which unless you know more about the types
and functions involved.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>
<p>For Go 1.22, we plan to change <code>for</code> loops to make these variables have
per-iteration scope instead of per-loop scope.
This change will fix the examples above, so that they are no longer buggy Go programs;
it will end the production problems caused by such mistakes;
and it will remove the need for imprecise tools that prompt users
to make unnecessary changes to their code.</p>
<p>To ensure backwards compatibility with existing code, the new semantics
will only apply in packages contained in modules that declare <code>go 1.22</code> or
later in their <code>go.mod</code> files.
This per-module decision provides developer control of a gradual update
to the new semantics throughout a codebase.
It is also possible to use <code>//go:build</code> lines to control the decision on a
per-file basis.</p>
<p>Old code will continue to mean exactly what it means today:
the fix only applies to new or updated code.
This will give developers control over when the semantics change
in a particular package.
As a consequence of our <a href="https://go.dev/blog/toolchain">forward compatibility work</a>,
Go 1.21 will not attempt to compile code that declares <code>go 1.22</code> or later.
We included a special case with the same effect in
the point releases Go 1.20.8 and Go 1.19.13,
so when Go 1.22 is released,
code written depending on the new semantics will never be compiled with
the old semantics, unless people are using very old, unsupported Go versions](/doc/devel/release#policy).</p>
<h2 id="previewing-the-fix">Previewing The Fix</h2>
<p>Go 1.21 includes a preview of the scoping change.
If you compile your code with <code>GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar</code> set in your environment,
then the new semantics are applied to all loops
(ignoring the <code>go.mod</code> <code>go</code> lines).
For example, to check whether your tests still pass with the new loop semantics
applied to your package and all your dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar go test
</code></pre>
<p>We patched our internal Go toolchain at Google to force this mode during all builds
at the start of May 2023, and in the past four months
we have had zero reports of any problems in production code.</p>
<p>You can also try test programs to better understand the semantics
on the Go playground by including a <code>// GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar</code> comment
at the top of the program, like in <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/YchKkkA1ETH" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this program</a>.
(This comment only applies in the Go playground.)</p>
<h2 id="fixing-buggy-tests">Fixing Buggy Tests</h2>
<p>Although we’ve had no production problems,
to prepare for that switch, we did have to correct many buggy tests that were not
testing what they thought they were, like this:</p>
<pre><code>func TestAllEvenBuggy(t *testing.T) {
    testCases := []int{1, 2, 4, 6}
    for _, v := range testCases {
        t.Run("sub", func(t *testing.T) {
            t.Parallel()
            if v&amp;1 != 0 {
                t.Fatal("odd v", v)
            }
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Go 1.21, this test passes because <code>t.Parallel</code> blocks each subtest
until the entire loop has finished and then runs all the subtests
in parallel. When the loop has finished, <code>v</code> is always 6,
so the subtests all check that 6 is even,
so the test passes.
Of course, this test really should fail, because 1 is not even.
Fixing for loops exposes this kind of buggy test.</p>
<p>To help prepare for this kind of discovery, we improved the precision
of the <code>loopclosure</code> analyzer in Go 1.21 so that it can identify and
report this problem.
You can see the report <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/WkJkgXRXg0m" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">in this program</a> on the Go playground.
If <code>go vet</code> is reporting this kind of problem in your own tests,
fixing them will prepare you better for Go 1.22.</p>
<p>If you run into other problems,
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/LoopvarExperiment#my-test-fails-with-the-change-how-can-i-debug-it" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the FAQ</a>
has links to examples and details about using a tool we’ve written to identify
which specific loop is causing a test failure when the new semantics are applied.</p>
<h2 id="more-information">More Information</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	


<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>As a software architect dealing with a lot of Microservices based systems, I often encounter the ever-repeating question – “should I use RabbitMQ or Kafka?”. For some reason, many developers view these technologies as interchangeable. While this is true for some cases, there are various underlying differences between these platforms. As a result, different scenarios require a different solution and choosing the wrong one might severely impact your ability to design, develop, and maintain your software solution.</p>



<p>The goal of this blog post is first to introduce the basic asynchronous messaging patterns. Then, it continues to present both RabbitMQ and Kafka and their internal structure. <a href="https://eranstiller.com/rabbitmq-vs-kafka-an-architects-dilemma-part-2">Part 2</a> highlights the critical differences between these platforms, their various advantages and disadvantages, and how to choose between the two.</p>



<h2>Asynchronous Messaging Patterns</h2>



<p>Asynchronous messaging is a messaging scheme where message production by a producer is decoupled from its processing by a consumer.  When dealing with messaging systems, we typically identify two main messaging patterns – Message Queuing and Publish/Subscribe.</p>



<h3>Message Queueing</h3>



<p>In the Message Queuing communication pattern, queues temporally decouple producers from consumers. Multiple producers can send messages to the same queue; however, when a consumer processes a message, it is locked or removed from the queue and is no longer available. Only a single consumer consumes a specific message.</p>


<div>

<p>As a side note, if the consumer fails to process a certain message, the messaging platform typically returns the message to the queue where it is made available for other consumers. Besides temporal decoupling, queues allow us to scale producers and consumers independently as well as providing a degree of fault-tolerance against processing errors.</p>



<h3>Publish/Subscribe</h3>



<p>In the Publish/Subscribe (or Pub/Sub) communication pattern, a single message can be received and processed by multiple subscribers concurrently.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="675" height="369" src="https://eranstiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RabbitMQ-vs-Kafka-PubSub.svg" alt="An illustration of a pub/sub message exchange"><figcaption>Publish/Subscribe</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This pattern allows a publisher, for example, to notify all subscribers that something has happened in the system. Many queueing platforms often associate pub/sub with the term&nbsp;<strong>topics</strong>. In RabbitMQ, topics are a specific type of pub/sub implementation (a type of exchange to be exact), but during this post, I refer to topics as a representation of pub/sub as a whole.</p>



<p>Generically speaking, there are two types of subscriptions:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>An ephemeral subscription</strong>, where the subscription is only active as long the consumer is up and running. Once the consumer shuts down, its subscription and yet-to-be processed messages are lost.</li>



<li><strong>A durable subscription</strong>, where the subscription is maintained as long as it is not explicitly deleted. When the consumer shuts down, the messaging platform maintains the subscription and message processing can be resumed later.</li>
</ol>



<h3>RabbitMQ</h3>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">RabbitMQ</a>&nbsp;is an implementation of a&nbsp;<strong>Message Broker</strong>, and as is also often referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>Service Bus</strong>. It natively supports both messaging patterns described above. Other popular implementations of message brokers include&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://activemq.apache.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActiveMQ</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://zeromq.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeroMQ</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Service Bus</a>, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a>. All of these implementations have a lot in common; many concepts described in this post apply to most of them.</p>



<h3>Queues</h3>



<p>RabbitMQ supports classic message queuing out of the box. A developer defines named queues, and then publishers can send messages to that named queue. Consumers, in turn, use the same queue to retrieve messages to process them.</p>



<h3>Message Exchanges</h3>



<p>RabbitMQ implements Pub/Sub via the use of message exchanges. A publisher publishes its messages to a message exchange without knowing who are the subscribers of these messages. Each consumer wishing to subscribe to an exchange creates its queue; the message exchange then queues produced messages for consumers to consume. It can also filter messages for some subscribers based on various routing rules.</p>

<p>It is important to note that RabbitMQ supports both ephemeral and durable subscriptions. A consumer can decide the type of subscription they’d like to employ via RabbitMQ’s API.</p>



<p>Due to RabbitMQ’s architecture, we can also create a hybrid approach where some subscribers form&nbsp;<strong>consumer groups</strong>&nbsp;who work together processing messages in the form of competing consumers over a specific queue. In this manner, we implement the pub/sub pattern while also allowing some subscribers to scale-up to handle received messages.</p>

<h2>Apache Kafka</h2>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kafka.apache.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Kafka</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>an implementation of a message broker. Instead, it is a&nbsp;<strong>distributed streaming platform</strong>. Unlike RabbitMQ, which is based on queues and exchanges, Kafka’s storage layer is implemented using a partitioned transaction log. Kafka also provides a Streams API to process streams in real-time and a Connectors API for easy integration with various data sources, however, these are out of scope for this post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Cloud Vendors provide alternative solutions for Kafka’s storage layer. These solutions include&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Event Hubs</a>, and to some extent,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Kinesis Data Streams</a>. There are also cloud-specific and open source alternatives to Kafka’s stream processing capabilities, but again, these are out of scope for this post.</p>



<h3>Topics</h3>



<p>Kafka does not implement the notion of a queue. Instead, Kafka stores collections of records in categories called topics. For each topic, Kafka maintains a partitioned log of messages. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records where messages are continually appended. Kafka appends messages to these partitions as they arrive. By default, it uses a round-robin partitioner to spread messages uniformly across partitions. Producers can modify this behavior to create logical streams of messages. For example, in a multitenant application, we might want to create logical message streams according to every message’s tenant Id. In an IoT scenario, we might want to have each producer’s identity map to a specific partition constantly. Making sure that all messages from the same logical stream map to the same partition guarantees their delivery in-order to consumers.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="571" height="396" src="https://eranstiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RabbitMQ-vs-Kafka-Kafka-Producers.svg" alt="An illustration of producers for a Kafka topic and its inner structure"><figcaption>Kafka Producers</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Consumers consume messages by maintaining an offset (or index) to these partitions and reading them sequentially. A single consumer can consume multiple topics, and consumers can scale-up to the number of partitions available. As a result, when creating a topic, one should carefully consider the expected throughput of messaging on that topic. A group of consumers working together to consume a topic is called a&nbsp;<strong>consumer group</strong>. Kafka’s API typically handles the balancing of partition processing between consumers in a consumer group and storing consumers’ current partition offsets.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="562" height="330" src="https://eranstiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RabbitMQ-vs-Kafka-Kafka-Consumers.svg" alt="An illustration of consumer groups for a Kafka topic and its inner structure"><figcaption>Kafka Consumers</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3>Implementing Messaging Patterns with Kafka</h3>



<p>Kafka’s implementation maps quite well to the pub/sub pattern. A producer can send messages to a specific topic, and multiple consumer groups can consume the same message. Each consumer group can scale individually to handle the load. Since consumers maintain their partition offset, they can choose to have a durable subscription that maintains its offset across restarts or an ephemeral subscription, which throws the offset away and restarts from the latest record in each partition every time it starts up.&nbsp;However, it is a less than perfect fit for the message queuing pattern. Of course, we could have a topic with just a single consumer group to emulate classic message queuing. Nevertheless, this has multiple drawbacks that <a href="https://eranstiller.com/rabbitmq-vs-kafka-an-architects-dilemma-part-2">part 2</a> of this post discusses at length.</p>



<p>It is important to note that Kafka retains messages in partitions up to a preconfigured period, regardless of whether consumers consumed these messages. This retention means that consumers are free to reread past messages. Furthermore, developers can also use Kafka’s storage layer for implementing mechanisms such as Event Sourcing and Audit Logs.</p>



<h2>Closing Words</h2>



<p>While RabbitMQ and Kafka are sometimes interchangeable, their implementations are very different from each other. As a result, we cannot view them as members of the same category of tools; one is a message broker, and the other is a distributed streaming platform. As solution architects, we should acknowledge these differences and actively consider which of these types of solutions we should use for a given scenario. <a href="https://eranstiller.com/rabbitmq-vs-kafka-an-architects-dilemma-part-2">Part 2</a> addresses these differences and provides guidance on when to use each.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://about.xethub.com/blog/nfs-fuse-why-we-built-nfs-server-rust">https://about.xethub.com/blog/nfs-fuse-why-we-built-nfs-server-rust</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37573679">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>The Optimistic Case for FUSE</h3><p>I love files. Everything understands files. Every program knows how to read files and write files. Its a truly universal API. As such, I love the idea of FUSE. FUSE, or “Filesystem in Userspace” is a set of Linux interfaces that allow user-mode programs to define a filesystem.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6474aea6101c81b742144dd2/6503bb5f57ddf9f32163597d_first.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This allows filesystem drivers to be built very easily <strong>without needing a kernel module.</strong> Fuse is the basis for a large number of filesystem clients, including NTFS and even remote “filesystems” like SFTP or Amazon S3. It can also be used to make strange filesystems which are not actually filesystems like <a href="https://about.xethub.com/a5ab0a3b55724d45b3e91d1d890b9a8b?pvs=25"><strong>WikipediaFS</strong></a> which allows one to edit wikipedia articles using their own text editor.</p><p>Here at XetHub, we wanted to build an easy way to access any version of any dataset from your laptop using the tools you have. It is <em>really</em> nice being able to directly browse an image dataset without having to go through S3 commands.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6474aea6101c81b742144dd2/6503bb6a47462c93017f9ec1_second.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>What if you could interact with S3 this way?</em></figcaption></figure><p>The obvious solution to enabling this superpower was FUSE.</p><p>FUSE however, is an frustrating API to build against:</p><ul role="list"><li>there are 2 API classes to choose from — a low-level API and a high-level API</li><li>there are 2 incompatible API versions (libfuse2 and libfuse3)</li><li>and lots of other smaller API changes over time (See FUSE_USE_VERSION).</li></ul><p>In addition, FUSE is <strong>unavailable natively on Mac and Windows</strong> and requires the user to install a 3rd party driver (<a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/">MacFuse</a>, <a href="https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfuse">WinFuse</a>). Each of these drivers may have subtle API incompatibilities.</p><h3>The Key Question</h3><p>Because of these issues, I asked myself the following questions.</p><blockquote>Is it possible to build a userspace filesystem interface that is truly cross-platform?</blockquote><p>To answer this question, I had to look back 20 years into computer science history to stumble into <strong>NFSv3.</strong></p><h3>NFS</h3><p>NFSv3 is 20 years old and is a network filesystem protocol that was so simple and so ubiquitous that nearly every operating system has a built-in implementation of it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6474aea6101c81b742144dd2/6503bb7357ddf9f321636887_third.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>From Wikipedia</em></figcaption></figure><p>The NFSv3 protocol is has a beautiful and simple set of design principles:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>The server is completely stateless</strong>: This simplifies the implementation immensely.</li><li><strong>NFS Servers are dumb and NFS clients are smart</strong>: &nbsp;(explicitly stated in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1813#section-1.6">RFC 1813 &nbsp;Section 1.6 Par 4</a>). This is great because we only need to implement the server, and the very smart clients have already been implemented and hardened for &gt; 20 years.</li><li><strong>Simple Cache Consistency Rules</strong>: Server does not define cache policy. The client can be as smart as it wants. Instead, the protocol defines a mechanism for the server to notify the client when something changes. This implementation is simpler and more efficient than FUSE. In practice the FUSE daemon has to explicitly implement a lot caching itself. With NFS we can avoid all of that extra complexity.</li><li><strong>The NFS client knows its talking over a network</strong>: This means that the NFS Client and protocol has builtin timeout, retry and failure semantics we can immediately take advantage of. The stateless protocol makes this very easy. With FUSE, the timeout/failure behavior has to be implemented robustly everywhere in the daemon. It is remarkably easy to hang the daemon and all programs reading from the filesystem if you get stuck in an API call.</li><li><strong>Actually extremely good performance.</strong> On the nixes at least, localhost networking is as fast as pipes. I do not know about Windows but I will be surprised if its not very fast too.</li></ol><p>The summary is that implementing a user-mode filesystem using localhost NFS instead of FUSE makes it easier get performance and resiliency. We can take advantage of the existing caching support and 20+ years of robustness and hardening. We just need to implement the server protocol <em>once</em>.</p><p>So last year, while isolating myself from a COVID-19 infection, I implemented an NFSv3 server in Rust as an experiment. It turned out fantastically.</p><p>‍</p><h3>How we use NFS at XetHub</h3><p>XetHub has the world’s first <strong>natively cross-platform, user-mode filesystem implementation,</strong> allowing you to mount arbitrarily large datasets on your machine without needing any kernel driver.</p><p>This enables you to, in just a few seconds, locally <a href="https://about.xethub.com/blog/comparing-code-llama-models-locally-macbook">mount ~660 GB of Llama 2 models</a> or write DuckDB queries to <a href="https://about.xethub.com/blog/version-control-machine-learning-workflow-pyxet-part-1">analyze large parquet files</a> and scan just the data you need.</p><p>All of this is currently supported on Linux, Mac and Windows Pro (unfortunately doesn’t work with Windows Home). Windows has some minor quirks in the experience but it generally works.</p><h3>Open Sourcing nfsserve</h3><p>We are open sourcing<strong> nfsserve</strong>, our Rust implementation for the NFS server, on <a href="https://github.com/xetdata/nfsserve">GitHub</a>. &nbsp;If you’re a 🦀 Rust-acean, you can install it using <a href="https://docs.rs/nfsserve/latest/nfsserve/">cargo</a> with the dependency <strong>nfsserve = "0.10".</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6474aea6101c81b742144dd2/6503bb9347462c93017fccc0_four.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The documentation could definitely use more love and we’d happily accept PR’s for any improvements!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>We need to have a serious chat about iPhone repairability. We judged the phones of yesteryear by how easy they were to take apart—screws, glues, how hard it was to change a battery. But repairs have gotten trickier, by design. Software now limits many basic iPhone repairs. That’s why we’ve revised the repairability score for the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_14">iPhone 14</a> from a <em>recommend </em>7 out of 10 to a <em>do-not-recommend</em> 4.</p>



<p>Although we <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">enthusiastically</a> awarded it a solid score at launch last year, thanks to its innovative repair-friendly architecture—of which we remain big fans—the reality for folks trying to fix these things has been very different. Most major repairs on modern iPhones require Apple approval. You have to buy parts through their system, then have the repair validated via a chat system. Otherwise, you’ll run into limited or missing functionality, with a side of annoying warnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lots of independent repair shops have business models that are threatened by Apple’s <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">parts pairing</a> practice. Shops harvest parts from broken devices. They use third-party parts. They shouldn’t have to send Apple their customers’ personal information, or agree to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows">five years of audits</a> just to do the repairs they know how to do.</p>



<p>So when we gave the iPhone 14 a high score, the community <a href="https://youtu.be/K2WhU77ihw8?si=TEeGyQscV2wHr3xQ&amp;t=887">pushed back</a>. To be honest, they were right—and we’d like to thank our critics for helping us hold manufacturers accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The situation has gotten so bad that several repair professionals have told us they’re leaving the business entirely rather than navigate the labyrinthine maze of obstacles that Apple has erected.</p>



<p>So we’ve gone back to the drawing board with our scoring system to make sure that it reflects this significant new software limitation on repairs. And now that we’ve run the iPhone 14 through our new scorecard, the picture isn’t as rosy. The iPhone 14’s new 4 / 10 score reflects the fact that individuals and independent repair shops encounter some atrocious limitations when trying to fix it.</p>



<h2><strong>It’s Literally Not Re-Pairable</strong></h2>



<p>For many years, iFixit scores were primarily about <em>design for repair</em>—that is, how easy (or difficult) it is to disassemble your gadget, replace whatever’s broken, and reassemble it successfully. The highest scores were <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/55818/fairphone-4-teardown-if-only-apple-made-phones-like-this">reserved</a> for devices whose manufacturers even provided instructions for how to do that.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="592" height="444" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18221601/lightning.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Ever the innovators, Apple introduced a new dimension to repair that our scorecard simply didn’t account for: namely, that you could take a highly repairable design like the iPhone 14, install a <em>genuine</em> Apple replacement screen or battery, and then… it fails to work. Following the correct procedure was no longer enough.</p>



<p>Today, you need one more thing: a software handshake, using Apple’s System Configuration tool. It contacts Apple’s servers to “authenticate” the repair, then “pairs” the new part to your system so it works as expected. Of course, it can only authenticate if Apple knows about your repair in advance, because you gave them the exact serial number of your iPhone, and they’ve pre-matched it to a display or battery. This is only possible if you buy the screen or battery directly from Apple. Forget harvesting parts—which is a huge part of most independent repair and recycling businesses. It’s also impossible to pair any aftermarket parts—which means only Apple-authorized repairs can truly restore the device to full functionality.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="932" height="648" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18221611/messages.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Apple’s numerous ‘genuine’ parts warnings appear for all parts, even brand new OEM parts, that have not been blessed by Apple’s authentication process.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While it’s an improvement over the status quo of just a few years ago, when Apple wouldn’t sell parts or supply instructions or software tools to <em>anyone</em> outside the Genius Bar and a few select “authorized” repair outlets, it’s still a major problem. Apple has made some real progress here—and we’ve been reluctant to criticize manufacturers taking meaningful steps. There are good people inside Apple working hard to make this situation better.</p>



<p>But parts pairing is a serious threat to our ability to fix the things we own. The problem is the invasive amount of control that Apple exerts over this entire process, and the fee they require you to pay for the privilege of fixing your own stuff. Apple likes to control the user experience so they can make it flawless—and we get that—but that experience should never come at the expense of our ownership rights or the planet. Already got a genuine screen or battery handy? Too bad—you’ll have to buy a new one from Apple if you want full functionality. And what happens in a few years when Apple stops officially supporting repairs for your device and shuts off the authentication servers? Apple’s message is loud and clear: user repair isn’t a priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our reporting, and this revised scoring system, is the result of painstaking analysis. Our team has purchased several units of each phone generation and model and performed hundreds of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/66879/iphone-14-parts-pairing-results-apple-is-still-trying-to-monopolise-repair">tests swapping individual parts</a>. The parts pairing problems we’ve reported on have been backed up by field reports from independent repair shops and YouTube repairers like Hugh Jeffreys and Louis Rossmann.</p>



<h2><strong>How Did We Get Here?</strong></h2>



<p>In a move that will not surprise close observers of Apple, they have developed the system without notifying the people who do the actual repair work that it impacts.</p>



<p>The shifting, secretive target has made it difficult to incorporate into our repairability scoring system. The first paired part we encountered was the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+5s+Teardown/17383#s52330">iPhone 5s</a> biometric fingerprint sensor. Seemingly, this was a necessity for security—so while our forums <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/482732/Getting+around+TouchID+pairing">filled up</a> with users whose repairs were stymied, we didn’t modify our score.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then a curious thing happened: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+XS+Screen+Replacement/113862">True Tone started disappearing</a> after screen repairs, even with genuine screens. Then some aftermarket screens <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59jwvz/iphone-8-aftermarket-touchscreens-ios-update">stopped working</a>. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/9917/11-3-update-breaking-iphone-screens">Some of these bugs</a> were fixed, some were not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/11208/batterygate-timeline">fury of Batterygate</a>, when the world learned that Apple was slowing down phones with older batteries, the company doubled down and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/32343/apple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now">started locking batteries</a> to the logic board via an iOS update. The update hid battery health from the owner of the device with third party batteries, removing a critical lifespan management feature.</p>



<p>Around the same time, the iPhone X introduced Face ID, a revolutionary technology with an unfortunately paired dot projector. As with the biometric sensor, we assumed this was a security issue and, while we didn’t like it, we justified Apple’s behavior because moving to new technology often comes with compromises. So we reluctantly made a carveout in our scoring system for security—but this just as quickly became a slippery slope.</p>



<p>Sometimes parts just didn’t work. But just as often, parts swaps prompted pop-ups. Warnings, warnings, and more warnings. Apple started pushing warnings when repairs were performed—and they were <em>pesky.&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1783" height="850" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4.png" alt="iPhone battery warnings" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4.png 1783w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4-1536x732.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1783px) 100vw, 1783px"></figure>



<p>iPhone 12 came with a camera fail, warnings, and the resultant disappointment to the repair community. iPhone 13 came with a sensibly redesigned display to make Face ID less of an issue with repairs—except that it <em>disabled Face ID completely </em>when replaced<em>. </em>The emotional yo-yo (<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56386/ios-15-2-fixes-iphone-13s-face-id-repair-trap-and-improves-its-repair-score">and repairability score yo-yo</a>) left us reeling. Steps forward, steps back. All the while, though, the steady drumbeat of parts pairing got louder. What initially started as isolated security quirks and bugs ended up being the first canaries in a dark coal mine of pairing strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One by one, the glitches and bugs add up to a broad strategy, a systematic plan to require Apple’s permission to perform any repair on the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="3238" height="745" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg 3238w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image-1536x353.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image-2048x471.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 3238px) 100vw, 3238px"></a></figure>



<h2><strong>The iPhone 14 is Still a Mechanical Design Triumph</strong></h2>



<p>We maintain our high praise for the iPhone 14’s hardware architecture, which really does move the needle on repairability. Rear glass repairs that cost as much as $549 on the previous architecture now costs just $169 with the new mid-frame design.</p>



<p>Discussing repairability <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZiP1l7jlIIA?si=HPONgHjuCmE0-q65&amp;t=3526">for the first time</a> in the iPhone 15 announcement, Apple said they were expanding this new architecture to all 15 models. (On the iPhone 14, only the base, non-Pro models featured the improved design.)</p>



<p>Bravo! This design is truly an improvement worthy of the marketing effort. This is a very good hardware design, and we hope other OEMs will take notice and learn from it.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this laudable mechanical improvement is undermined by a raft of software obstacles.</p>



<h2><strong>Apple Has Not Responded to Feedback</strong></h2>



<p>This parts pairing problem is by <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf">no means isolated</a> to iPhones. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/71442/tearing-down-the-14-macbook-pro-with-apples-help">MacBooks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/apple-pencils-cant-draw-straight-on-third-party-replacement-ipad-screens/">iPads</a> are suffering a similar fate, with screens, buttons, and other important components slowly sliding further into the realm of “only repairable by Apple—or with tough compromises.”</p>



<p>Even though we and <a href="https://repair.eu/news/we-need-the-right-to-repair-to-be-universal/">other repair advocates</a> have been sounding the alarm on parts pairing for years, Apple’s response has been lacking—especially for an industry leader and trend-setter with resources to act responsibly—and the problem continues to worsen. There may be multiple reasons for that, not all of them nefarious:</p>



<ul><li>Benign neglect</li><li>Precision parts calibration</li><li>Combating warranty fraud</li><li>Lack of testing software updates with aftermarket parts</li><li>Control over the customer experience</li></ul>



<p>Our intel says that it’s likely a combination of all of the above. Regardless: Apple has the resources to solve these problems. Based on how Apple designs their products and the relentless, unparallelled focus on user experience, they could easily be a leader in creating the best self-repair experience in tech. Yet, we don’t see that. Year after year, our scrappy repair community shouldn’t have to keep innovating around the shortcomings of the world’s most valuable company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple needs to do better. And frankly, so do we—so as of today, our repairability scores do a better job of reflecting reality.</p>



<h2><strong>A New Score</strong></h2>



<p>The new <strong>4 / 10</strong> score lands just on the negative side of our scorecard, and garners a reluctant but clear <em>not recommended</em>. Our new scorecard covers a wide gamut of approaches that Apple has taught us about, and includes penalties for almost-repairs, non-repairs, and “genuineness” warnings. Taken together, these deductions erode the overall score of the device significantly. (Updating the scorecard took us many months of careful work—if you’re curious about how we score, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/75533/how-ifixit-scores-repairability">check out this explainer</a>.) This scorecard will be the standard for all products moving forward—as Apple isn’t the only company utilizing parts pairing and other digital locks to handcuff DIY repairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This repairability score doesn’t just represent our recommendations. It encapsulates countless wasted money, time, and tears of frustration on the part of Apple customers, repair techs, and would-be repairers. It represents a rising tide of e-waste that threatens the well-being of our society and our planet.</p>



<p>You can help, by preferring repairable products wherever possible. Product designers are paying attention. If enough consumers demand repairable products, then companies will create longer lasting products.</p>



<p>One note: for now, we are only rescoring the iPhone 14. We are not retroactively rescoring <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/smartphone-scores">earlier iPhones</a> at this time. If we did, their scores would also likely decline.</p>



<p>Apple could fix this problem with a software update, and that 7 / 10 score could return overnight. Even though they recently signaled their <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california">support for Right to Repair in California</a>, these problems show that they are not taking the situation seriously enough.</p>



<p>We’re going to keep working to hold Apple and other manufacturers accountable the best way we know: By speaking the truth about <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf">repair restrictions</a> as loudly as we can, by revising our scorecard to reflect any new obstacles to repair, and by pushing for Right to Repair laws that ban parts pairing.</p>



<p>Long-lasting, repairable products are essential for the future of the planet. Sustainable electronics stand the test of time, and parts pairing undermines the ecosystem needed to keep these devices alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right to repair is gaining momentum. We’re not giving up the fight for independent repair—and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair">neither should you</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Google</em> antitrust trial</a> gets underway, the Department of Justice is focusing on the real moneymaker behind Google Search: ads.

Dischler says Google tweaks its auction process in ways that may have raised prices in the past by 5 percent for the typical advertiser and could potentially have raised them by 10 percent for some queries. The parties buying the ads would have been unaware of these “tunings” of prices; “we tend not to tell advertisers about pricing changes,” Dischler said.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="The Verge’s logo over a photograph of the Supreme Court" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/376x95/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/384x97/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/415x105/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/480x121/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/540x136/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/640x161/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/750x189/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/828x209/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/1080x273/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/1200x303/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/1440x363/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/1920x484/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/2048x517/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/2400x606/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/2400x606/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p>Raising ad prices was apparently one way for Google to increase search revenue during dry spells — one of which apparently occurred in the spring of 2019, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-09/416421.pdf">an email chain</a> involving Dischler and fellow Google executive Anil Sabharwal. “We are shaking the cushions” on ads launches, Dischler writes in the email. The email also describes other options for boosting revenue that include making Search more prominent for Chrome users.</p><p>Another <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-09/416417.pdf">trial exhibit</a> indicates that Google made $98 billion from search ads for its owned-and-operated services in 2019 (apparently not including revenue from YouTube, <a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/doj-takes-a-deep-dive-into-googles">according to <em>Big Tech on Trial </em>newsletter reporter Yosef Weitzman</a>), and Dischler said that the number topped $100 billion in 2020. The “vast majority” of growth has come from mobile search.</p><p>Dischler said in court that 10 percent was around the upper limit of price increases and that raising prices by 15 percent would be “a dangerous thing to do” —&nbsp;although, as Nylen notes, Dischler acknowledged that overall revenue might still rise even if the high rates drove some advertisers to competitors like Meta or TikTok.</p><p>As Weitzman writes, demonstrating that Google can raise ad prices with little competitive pressure could help bolster the Justice Department’s argument that Google maintains an unlawful monopoly. It’s an objection that the department can’t raise for the search engine itself, which is a free product for consumers — although it can allege that other forms of harm, like lax privacy standards, might have been mitigated in a more competitive search industry.</p><p>Dischler is resuming testimony today in the trial, which is expected to stretch into November, with a verdict not anticipated until next year.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>MGM Resorts International could be losing between $4.2 million and $8.4 million in daily revenue and around $1 million in cash flow every day it’s under a cyberattack, a gaming industry analyst said in a Sunday report to investors.</p>
<p>David Katz, an equity analyst with New York-based Jefferies Group, in a weekly report on gaming, lodging and leisure companies, updated his Thursday assessments of MGM and Caesars Entertainment Inc. that included an estimate that MGM could take a 10 percent to 20 percent hit on revenue and cash flow “for the days that the current conditions exist.”</p>
<p>MGM on Sunday entered its second week of operations after a cybersecurity breach. Jefferies analysts say MGM generates about $42 million in revenue and $8 million in cash flow daily companywide.</p>
<p>Revenue is the amount of money generated through sales and investments, while cash flow measures net cash and cash equivalents being transferred in and out of a company.</p>
<p>MGM officials on Sunday said there were no updates on the status of the company’s computer systems and no new information was posted on the company’s “frequently asked questions” internet page that launched early Friday.</p>
<p>But there was no shortage of complaints from people about the situation.</p>
<p>There were scattered emailed reports from people around the country to the Review-Journal saying they were MGM employees who hadn’t been paid as of Friday. The company said Friday that payroll had been met as planned.</p>
<p>Others complained that there were no useful functions on the restored websites. Customers can still make reservations by calling a property directly or by using third-party booking apps.</p>
<p>A Review-Journal reporter dining at Babette’s Steakhouse at Park MGM said a waiter indicated the restaurant’s computer system was continually slowing because checks can’t be closed out. In addition, all food has to be ordered at one time because expense tabs can’t be reopened. There’s also no splitting checks within a party and no splitting of payment methods.</p>
<p>Slot machine winnings on machines in operation had to be paid manually by employees because some ticket in-ticket out systems weren’t functioning.</p>
<p>Uber and Lyft drivers contacted by the Review-Journal said MGM’s problems were a constant topic of frustration with their riders. Some said they waited a long time for employees to pay their slot-machine winnings.</p>
<p>Groceryshop 2023, a three-day, technology-meets-supermarket-brands convention with a projected attendance of 5,000, is scheduled to begin Tuesday. Representatives of Groceryshop 2023 did not respond to emails inquiring about the status of the show and whether they expected attendance to be affected by the cybersecurity problems experienced by MGM.</p>
<p>Brands like Kroger, Walmart, Albertson’s, Costco, Amazon, Kellogg, General Mills, Doordash, KraftHeinz, Coca-Cola and Pepsico are expected to be represented at the show.</p>
<p>Katz told investors in his Thursday and Sunday reports that damages from the cyberattack at MGM would be claimed against insurance, but it’s unclear just how much would be covered.</p>
<p>“The announcement by CZR (Caesars Entertainment, which reported a similar cyberattack in an SEC filing Thursday) and indications from MGM confirming the cyberattacks should be taken as one-time, largely insurable events that should not have long-lasting impacts on the businesses, assuming that the event is short-lived,” Katz wrote. “Our sense is that MGM’s impact could potentially be material but moderate near term, while CZR should see no meaningful impact and the question of whether any business is displaced among operators near term is fair.”</p>
<p>Katz said there were unconfirmed reports that Caesars paid around $15 million in ransom money to extortionists to regain control of its computerized systems in late August. But it’s unclear if MGM has considered paying any ransom money.</p>
<p>“Our impression is the Street’s presumption that CZR elected to pay a ransom while MGM did not may not be correct, according to our discussions with both management teams,” Katz wrote. “Nonetheless, given what we expect should be predominantly insurable events for all concerned should mitigate the impact to MGM if it turns out to be significant.</p>
<p>For the time being, it is not clear what the magnitude of the impact is to MGM and the degree of insurance coverage it will have or the duration of the event.”</p>
<p>Katz said he believes MGM will continue operations.</p>
<p>“Our impression of the impact to MGM is that business remains operable and credit card use is possible, albeit manual, while more transactions are cash-based than usual,” he said.</p>

</figure><p>How many clinical-trial studies in medical journals are fake or fatally flawed? In October 2020, John Carlisle reported a startling estimate<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Carlisle, an anaesthetist who works for England’s National Health Service, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" data-track-category="body text link">renowned for his ability to spot dodgy data in medical trials</a>. He is also an editor at the journal <i>Anaesthesia</i>, and in 2017, he decided to scour all the manuscripts he handled that reported a randomized controlled trial (RCT) — the gold standard of medical research. Over three years, he scrutinized more than 500 studies<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>For more than 150 trials, Carlisle got access to anonymized individual participant data (IPD). By studying the IPD spreadsheets, he judged that 44% of these trials contained at least some flawed data: impossible statistics, incorrect calculations or duplicated numbers or figures, for instance. And in 26% of the papers had problems that were so widespread that the trial was impossible to trust, he judged — either because the authors were incompetent, or because they had faked the data.</p><p>Carlisle called these ‘zombie’ trials because they had the semblance of real research, but closer scrutiny showed they were actually hollow shells, masquerading as reliable information. Even he was surprised by their prevalence. “I anticipated maybe one in ten,” he says.</p><p>When Carlisle couldn’t access a trial’s raw data, however, he could study only the aggregated information in the summary tables. Just 1% of these cases were zombies, and 2% had flawed data, he judged (see ‘The prevalence of ‘zombie’ trials’). This finding alarmed him, too: it suggested that, without access to the IPD — which journal editors usually don’t request and reviewers don’t see — even an experienced sleuth cannot spot hidden flaws.</p><figure>

</figure><p>“I think journals should assume that all submitted papers are potentially flawed and editors should review individual patient data before publishing randomised controlled trials,” Carlisle wrote in his report.</p><p>Carlisle rejected every zombie trial, but by now, almost three years later, most have been published in other journals — sometimes with different data to those submitted with the manuscript he had seen. He is writing to journal editors to alert them, but expects that little will be done.</p><p>Do Carlisle’s findings in anaesthesiology extend to other fields? For years, a number of scientists, physicians and data sleuths have argued that fake or unreliable trials are frighteningly widespread. They’ve scoured RCTs in various medical fields, such as women’s health, pain research, anaesthesiology, bone health and COVID-19, and have found dozens or hundreds of trials with seemingly statistically impossible data. Some, on the basis of their personal experiences, say that one-quarter of trials being untrustworthy might be an underestimate. “If you search for all randomized trials on a topic, about a third of the trials will be fabricated,” asserts Ian Roberts, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p><p>The issue is, in part, a subset of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5" data-track-category="body text link">notorious paper-mill problem</a>: over the past decade, journals in many fields have published tens of thousands of suspected fake papers, some of which are thought to have been produced by third-party firms, termed paper mills.</p><p>But faked or unreliable RCTs are a particularly dangerous threat. They not only are about medical interventions, but also can be laundered into respectability by being included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which thoroughly comb the literature to assess evidence for clinical treatments. Medical guidelines often cite such assessments, and physicians look to them when deciding how to treat patients.</p><p>Ben Mol, who specializes in obstetrics and gynaecology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, argues that as many as 20–30% of the RCTs included in systematic reviews in women’s health are suspect.</p><p>Many research-integrity specialists say that the problem exists, but its extent and impact are unclear. Some doubt whether the issue is as bad as the most alarming examples suggest. “We have to recognize that, in the field of high-quality evidence, we increasingly have a lot of noise. There are some good people championing that and producing really scary statistics. But there are also a lot in the academic community who think this is scaremongering,” says Žarko Alfirević, a specialist in fetal and maternal medicine at the University of Liverpool, UK.</p><p>This year, he and others are conducting more studies to assess how bad the problem is. Initial results from a study led by Alfirević are not encouraging.</p><h2><b>Laundering fake trials</b></h2><p>Medical research has always had fraudsters. Roberts, for instance, first came across the issue when he co-authored a 2005 systematic review for the Cochrane Collaboration, a prestigious group whose reviews of medical research evidence are often used to shape clinical practice. The review suggested that high doses of a sugary solution could reduce death after head injury. But Roberts retracted it<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> after doubts arose about three of the key trials cited in the paper, all authored by the same Brazilian neurosurgeon, Julio Cruz. (Roberts never discovered whether the trials were fake, because Cruz died by suicide before investigations began. Cruz’s articles have not been retracted.)</p><p>A more recent example is that of Yoshihiro Sato, a Japanese bone-health researcher. Sato, who died in 2016, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track-category="body text link">fabricated data in dozens of trials of drugs or supplements that might prevent bone fracture</a>. He has 113 retracted papers, according to a list compiled by the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://retractionwatch.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://retractionwatch.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Retraction Watch</a>. His work has had a wide impact: researchers found that 27 of Sato’s retracted RCTs had been cited by 88 systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, some of which had informed Japan’s recommended treatments for osteoporosis<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>Some of the findings in about half of these reviews would have changed had Sato’s trials been excluded, says Alison Avenell, a medical researcher at the University of Aberdeen, UK. She, along with medical researchers Andrew Grey, Mark Bolland and Greg Gamble, all at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, have pushed universities to investigate Sato’s work and monitored its influence. “It probably diverted people from being given more effective treatment for fracture prevention,” Avenell says.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The concerns over zombie trials, however, are beyond individual fakers flying under the radar. In some fields, swathes of RCTs from different research groups might be unreliable, researchers worry.</p><p>During the pandemic, for instance, a flurry of RCTs was conducted into whether ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug, could treat COVID-19. But researchers who were not involved have since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y" data-track-category="body text link">pointed out data flaws</a> in many of the studies, some of which have been retracted. A 2022 update of a Cochrane review argued that more than 40% of these RCTs were untrustworthy<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>“Untrustworthy work must be removed from systematic reviews,” says Stephanie Weibel, a biologist at the University of Wuerzberg in Germany, who co-authored the review.</p><p>In maternal health — another field seemingly rife with problems — Roberts and Mol have flagged studies into whether a drug called tranexamic acid can stem dangerously heavy bleeding after childbirth. Every year, around 14 million people experience this condition, and some 70,000 die: it is the world’s leading cause of maternal death.</p><p>In 2016, Roberts reviewed evidence for using tranexamic acid to treat serious blood loss after childbirth. He reported that many of the 26 RCTs investigating the drug had serious flaws. Some had identical text, others had data inconsistencies or no records of ethical approval. Some seemed not to have adequately randomized the assignment of their participants to control and treatment groups<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>When he followed up with individual authors to ask for more details and raw data, he generally got no response or was told that records were missing or had been lost because of computer theft. Fortunately, in 2017, a large, high-quality multi-centre trial, which Roberts helped to run, established that the drug was effective<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>. It’s likely, says Roberts, that in these and other such cases, some of the dubious trials were copycat fraud — researchers saw that a large trial was going on and produced small, substandard copies that no one would question. This kind of fraud isn’t a victimless crime, however. “It results in narrowed confidence intervals such that the results look much more certain than they are. It also has the potential to amplify a wrong result, suggesting that treatments work when they don’t,” he says.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>That might have happened for another question: what if doctors were to inject the drug into everyone undergoing a caesarean, just after they give birth, as a preventative measure? A 2021 review<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup> of 36 RCTs investigating this idea, involving a total of more than 10,000 participants, concluded that this would reduce the risk of heavy blood loss by 60%.</p><p>Yet this April, an enormous US-led RCT with 11,000 people reported only a slight and not statistically significant benefit<sup><a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">8</a></sup>.</p><p>Mol thinks problems with some of the 36 previous RCTs explains the discrepancy. The 2021 meta-analysis had included one multi-centre study in France of more than 4,000 participants, which found a modest 16% reduction in severe blood loss, and another 35 smaller, single-centre studies, mostly conducted in India, Iran, Egypt and China, which collectively estimated a 93% drop. Many of the smaller RCTs were untrustworthy, says Mol, who has dug into some of them in detail.</p><p>It’s unclear whether the untrustworthy studies affected clinical practice. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using tranexamic acid to treat blood loss after childbirth, but it doesn’t have a guideline on preventive administration.</p><h2><b>From four trials to one</b></h2><p>Mol points to a different example in which untrustworthy trials might have influenced clinical practice. In 2018, researchers published a Cochrane review<sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup> on whether giving steroids to people due to undergo caesarean-section births helped to reduce breathing problems in their babies. Steroids are good for a baby’s lungs but can harm the developing brain, says Mol; benefits generally outweigh harms when babies are born prematurely, but the balance is less clear when steroids are used later in pregnancy.</p><p>The authors of the 2018 review, led by Alexandros Sotiriadis, a specialist in maternal–fetal medicine at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, analysed the evidence for administering steroids to people delivering by caesarean later in pregnancy. They ended up with four RCTs: a British study from 2005 with more than 940 participants, and three Egyptian trials conducted between 2015 and 2018 that added another 3,000 people into the evidence base. The review concluded that the steroids “may” reduce rates of breathing problems; it was cited in more than 200 documents and some clinical guidelines.</p><p>In January 2021, however, Mol and others, who had looked in more depth into the papers, raised concerns about the Egyptian trials. The largest study, with nearly 1,300 participants, was based on the second author’s thesis, he noted — but the trial end dates in the thesis differed from the paper. And the reported ratio of male to female babies was an impossible 40% to 60%. Mol queried the other papers, too, and wrote to the authors, but says he did not get satisfactory replies. (One author told him he’d lost the data when moving house.) Mol’s team also reported statistical issues with some other works by the same authors.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>In December 2021, Sotiriadis’s team updated its review<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. But this time, it adopted a new screening protocol. Until that year, Cochrane reviews had aimed to include all relevant RCTs; if researchers spotted potential issues with a trial, using a ‘risk of bias’ checklist, they would downgrade their confidence in its findings, but not remove it from their analysis. But in 2021, Cochrane’s research-integrity team introduced new guidance: authors should try to identify ‘problematic’ or ‘untrustworthy’ trials and exclude them from reviews. Sotiriadis’s group now excluded all but the British research. With only one trial left, there was “insufficient data” to draw firm conclusions about the steroids, the researchers said.</p><p>By last May, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data" data-track="click" data-label="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data" data-track-category="body text link">as Retraction Watch reported</a>, the large Egyptian trial was retracted (to the disagreement of its authors). The journal’s editors wrote in the retraction notice that they had not received its data or a satisfactory response from the authors, adding that “if the data is unreliable, women and babies are being harmed”. The other two trials are still under investigation by publisher Taylor &amp; Francis as part of a larger case of papers, says Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics at the firm. Before the 2018 review, some clinical guidelines had suggested that administering steroids later in pregnancy could be beneficial, and the practice had been growing in some countries, such as Australia, Mol has reported. The latest updated WHO and regional guidelines, however, recommend against this practice.</p><p>Overall, Mol and his colleagues have alleged problems in more than 800 published medical research papers, at least 500 of which are on RCTs. So far, the work has led to more than 80 retractions and 50 expressions of concern. Mol has focused much of his work on papers from countries in the Middle East, and particularly in Egypt. One researcher responded to some of his e-mails by accusing him of racism. Mol, however, says that it’s simply a fact that he has encountered many suspect statistics and refusals to share data from RCT authors in countries such as Iran, Egypt, Turkey and China — and that he should be able to point that out.</p><h2><b>Screening for trustworthiness</b></h2><p>“Ben Mol has undoubtedly been a pioneer in the field of detecting and fighting data falsification,” says Sotiriadis — but he adds that it is difficult to prove that a paper is falsified. Sotiriadis says he didn’t depend on Mol’s work when his team excluded those trials in its update, and he can’t say whether the trials were corrupt.</p><p>Instead, his group followed a screening protocol designed to check for ‘trustworthiness’. It had been developed by one of Cochrane’s independent specialist groups, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (CPC) group, coordinated by Alfirević. (This April, Cochrane formally dissolved this group and some others, as part of a reorganization strategy.) It provides a detailed list of criteria that authors should follow to check the trustworthiness of an RCT — such as whether a trial is prospectively registered and whether the study is free of unusual statistics, such as implausibly narrow or wide distributions of mean values in participant height, weight or other characteristics, and other red flags. If RCTs fail the checks, then reviewers are instructed to contact the original study authors — and, if the replies are not adequate, to exclude the study.</p><p>“We’re championing the idea that, if a study doesn’t pass these bars, then no hard feelings, but we don’t call it trustworthy enough,” Alfirević explains.</p><p>For Sotiriadis, the merit of this protocol was that it avoided his having to declare the trials faulty or fraudulent; they had merely failed a test of trustworthiness. His team ultimately reported that it excluded the Egyptian trials because they hadn’t been prospectively registered and the authors didn’t explain why.</p><p>Other Cochrane authors are starting to adopt the same protocol. For instance, a review<sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup> of drugs aiming to prevent pre-term labour, published last August, used it to exclude 44 studies — one-quarter of the 122 trials in the literature.</p><h2><b>What counts as trustworthy?</b></h2><p>Whether trustworthiness checks are sometimes unfair to the authors of RCTs, and exactly what should be checked to classify untrustworthy research, is still up for debate. In a 2021 editorial<sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup> introducing the idea of trustworthiness screening, Lisa Bero, a senior research integrity editor at Cochrane, and a bioethicist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, pointed out that there was no validated, universally agreed method.</p><p>“Misclassification of a genuine study as problematic could result in erroneous review conclusions. Misclassification could also lead to reputational damage to authors, legal consequences, and ethical issues associated with participants having taken part in research, only for it to be discounted,” she and two other researchers wrote.</p><p>For now, there are multiple trustworthiness protocols in play. In 2020, for instance, Avenell and others <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03959-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03959-6" data-track-category="body text link">published REAPPRAISED</a>, a checklist aimed more at journal editors. And when Weibel and others reviewed trials investigating ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment last year, they created their own checklist, which they call a ‘research integrity assessment’.</p><p>Bero says some of these checks are more labour-intensive than editors and systematic reviewers are generally accustomed to. “We need to convince systematic reviewers that this is worth their time,” she says. She and others have consulted biomedical researchers, publishers and research-integrity experts to come up with a set of red flags that might serve as the basis for creating a widely agreed method of assessment.</p><p>Despite the concerns of researchers such as Mol, many scientists remain unsure how many reviews have been compromised by unreliable RCTs. This year, a team led by Jack Wilkinson, a health researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, is using the results of Bero’s consultation to apply a list of 76 trustworthiness checks to all trials cited in 50 published Cochrane reviews. (The 76 items include detailed examination of the data and statistics in trials, as well as inspecting details on funding, grants, trial registration, the plausibility of study methods and authors’ publication records — but, in this exercise, data from individual participants are not being requested.)</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The aim is to see how many RCTs fail the checks, and what impact removing those trials would have on the reviews’ conclusions. Wilkinson says a team of 50 is working on the project. He aims to produce a general trustworthiness-screening tool, as well as a separate tool to aid in inspecting participant data, if authors provide them. He will discuss the work in September at Cochrane’s annual colloquium.</p><p>Alfirević’s team, meanwhile, has found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://events.cochrane.org/colloquium-2023/session/1473810/assessment-of-trustworthiness-has-a-significant-impact-on-conclusions-of-cochrane-reviews" data-track="click" data-label="https://events.cochrane.org/colloquium-2023/session/1473810/assessment-of-trustworthiness-has-a-significant-impact-on-conclusions-of-cochrane-reviews" data-track-category="body text link">a study yet to be published</a> that 25% of around 350 RCTs in 18 Cochrane reviews on nutrition and pregnancy would have failed trustworthiness checks, using the CPC’s method. With these RCTs excluded, the team found that one-third of the reviews would require updating because their findings would have changed. The researchers will report more details in September.</p><p>In Alfirević’s view, it doesn’t particularly matter which trustworthiness checks reviewers use, as long as they do something to scrutinize RCTs more closely. He warns that the numbers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that journals publish have themselves been soaring in the past decade — and many of these reviews can’t be trusted because of shoddy screening methods. “An untrustworthy systematic review is far more dangerous than an untrustworthy primary study,” he says. “It is an industry that is completely out of hand, with little quality assurance.”</p><p>Roberts, who first published in 2015 his concerns over problematic medical research in systematic reviews<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>, says that the Cochrane organization took six years to respond and still isn’t taking the issue seriously enough. “If up to 25% of trials included in systematic reviews are fraudulent, then the whole Cochrane endeavour is suspect. Much of what we think we know based on systematic reviews is wrong,” he says.</p><p>Bero says that Cochrane consulted widely to develop its 2021 guide on addressing problematic trials, including incorporating suggestions from Roberts, other Cochrane reviewers and research-integrity experts.</p><h2><b>Asking for data</b></h2><p>Many researchers worried by medical fakery agree with Carlisle that it would help if journals routinely asked authors to share their IPD. “Asking for raw data would be a good policy. The default position has just been to trust the study, but we’ve been operating from quite a naive position,” says Wilkinson. That advice, however, runs counter to current practice at most medical journals.</p><p>In 2016, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), an influential body that sets policy for many major medical titles, had proposed requiring mandatory data-sharing from RCTs. But it got pushback — including over perceived risks to the privacy of trial participants who might not have consented to their data being shared, and the availability of resources for archiving the data. As a result, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/data_sharing_june_2017.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/data_sharing_june_2017.pdf" data-track-category="body text link">in the latest update to its guidance</a>, in 2017, it settled for merely encouraging data sharing and requiring statements about whether and where data would be shared.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The ICMJE secretary, Christina Wee, says that “there are major feasibility challenges” to be resolved to mandate IPD sharing, although the committee might revisit its practices in future. Many publishers of medical journals told <i>Nature</i>’s news team that, following ICMJE advice, they didn’t require IPD from authors of trials. (These publishers included Springer Nature; <i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent.)</p><p>Some journals, however — including Carlisle’s <i>Anaesthesia</i> — have gone further and do already require IPD. “Most authors provide the data when told it is a requirement,” Carlisle says.</p><p>Even when IPD are shared, says Wilkinson, scouring it in the way that Carlisle does is a time-consuming exercise — creating a further burden for reviewers — although computational checks of statistics might help.</p><p>Besides asking for data, journal editors could also speed up their decision-making, research-integrity specialists say. When sleuths raise concerns, editors should be prepared to put expressions of concern on medical studies more quickly if they don’t hear back from authors, Avenell says. This April, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39343/documents/194466/default" data-track="click" data-label="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39343/documents/194466/default" data-track-category="body text link">UK parliamentary report into reproducibility and research integrity</a> said that it should not take longer than two months for publishers to publish corrections or retractions of research when academics raise issues.</p><p>And if journals do retract studies, authors of systematic reviews should be required to correct their work, Avenell and others say. This rarely happens. Last year, for instance, Avenell’s team reported that it had carefully and repeatedly e-mailed authors and journal editors of the 88 reviews that cited Sato’s retracted trials to inform them that their reviews included retracted work. They got few responses — only 11 of the 88 reviews have been updated so far — suggesting that authors and editors didn’t generally care about correcting the reviews<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>That was dispiriting but not surprising to the team, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track-category="body text link">has previously recounted how institutional investigations into Sato’s work were opaque and inadequate</a>. The Cochrane collaboration, for its part, stated in updated guidance in 2021 that systematic reviews must be updated when retractions occur.</p><p>Ultimately, a lingering question is — as with paper mills — why so many suspect RCTs are being produced in the first place. Mol, from his experiences investigating the Egyptian studies, blames lack of oversight and superficial assessments that promote academics on the basis of their number of publications, as well as the lack of stringent checks from institutions and journals on bad practices. Egyptian authorities have taken some steps to improve governance of trials, however; Egypt’s parliament, for instance, published its first clinical research law in December 2020.</p><p>“The solution’s got to be fixes at the source,” says Carlisle. “When this stuff is churned out, it’s like fighting a wildfire and failing.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37571919">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/pqxdh_header.png" alt="An abstract illustration of a Bloch Sphere"></p><p>The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the Signal Protocol was adopted not only by Signal but well beyond. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/" title="Signal Technical Information">docs</a> site.</p><p>Today we are happy to announce the first step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade to the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> specification which we are calling <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a>. With this upgrade, we are adding a layer of protection against the threat of a quantum computer being built in the future that is powerful enough to break current encryption standards.</p><p>This post is written to introduce this work to non-experts, and will review what quantum computing is and the challenges it presents for current cryptographic algorithms, before providing a high level overview of how we are adapting our specifications to answer these challenges. If you would like to skip this summary and explore our PQXDH specification in depth, you can read our technical whitepaper <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">here</a>.</p><h2 id="public-key-cryptography-primer">Public Key Cryptography Primer</h2><p>In order to explain why quantum computers pose a risk to existing cryptographic algorithms, it is first necessary to understand some of the broad strokes of how these algorithms work. The most logical place to start is with the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" title="The RSA Cryptosystem">RSA Cryptosystem</a>, because it provides an accessible example.</p><p>The RSA Cryptosystem is one element in a category of algorithms known as public key cryptosystems. Public key cryptosystems make it possible for someone to publish a public key that anyone can use to encrypt messages to that person. The person keeps a related private key which allows them to decrypt any message that has been encrypted with their published public key.</p><p>In order to make this work, RSA relies on a mathematical one-way function. A one-way function is easy to compute in one direction, but requires substantially more work to compute in reverse. The one-way function RSA relies upon is the multiplication and factorization of large prime numbers. It is computationally easy to multiply two large primes together to compute the product, but much more computationally intensive to find the original primes from their product.</p><p>The RSA cryptosystem works by first picking two large prime numbers at random and publishing the product of the two as one part of a public key. The selected prime numbers are kept private. This relies upon the difficulty of factoring this product to keep the two primes secret.</p><p>Although we have used RSA as an example to aid this primer, Signal does not use the RSA Cryptosystem in its protocols. Instead, Signal uses <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" title="Elliptic Curve Cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a> as the public key cryptosystem supporting many of its specifications. Instead of prime <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization" title="Integer Factorization">integer factorization</a>, as in the RSA example above, elliptic curve cryptography relies upon the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm" title="Discrete Logarithm Problem">discrete logarithm problem</a> as its one-way function. While these two problems are distinct, they are both instances of a mathematical problem known as the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem" title="Hidden Subgroup Problem">hidden subgroup problem</a>.</p><h2 id="quantum-computing">Quantum Computing</h2><p>Quantum computing represents a new type of computational system which leverages quantum mechanical properties to solve certain complex problems many orders of magnitude more quickly than modern classical computers. Instead of bits as in a classical computer, quantum computers operate on qubits. Rather than 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, in some sense allowing them to be both values at once. One place where quantum computers appear to have a significant advantage over classical computers is solving instances of the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem" title="Hidden Subgroup Problem">hidden subgroup problem</a>.</p><p>Quantum computing is unlikely to replace or supplant classical computers for our day-to-day use for the foreseeable future because classical computers are often better at the typical use cases for our laptops, tablets, and phones. Quantum computing systems will likely be built to take alternate approaches to some of the problems we rely on supercomputers to tackle today, whether this is modeling protein folding, forecasting weather, or factoring large numbers. It’s important to understand that quantum computers are not “better” computers but rather different types of computers.</p><p>Although quantum computers already exist, the systems known to exist today do not yet have <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/factor-15-shors-algorithm" title="It's been 20 years since \&quot;15\&quot; was factored on quantum hardware">enough qubits</a> to pose a threat to the public-key cryptography that Signal currently uses. However, if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer were built in the future, it could be used to compute a private key from a public key thereby breaking encrypted messages. This kind of threat is known as <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later" title="Harvest Now, Decrypt Later">Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)</a>.</p><p>The timeline for when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer may be created is a matter of great debate. On the low end, some argue it is only a couple of years away. On the high end some say 30+ years, and there are even those who assert that we may never solve the challenges necessary to make a quantum computer with enough coherent qubits to break the current public key cryptosystems. The middle ground seems to be around the 5 to 10 year time horizon. We are not in a position to judge which timeline is most likely, but we do see a real and growing risk which means we need to take steps today to address the future possibility of a large enough quantum computer being created.</p><h2 id="securing-signal-against-a-future-quantum-computer">Securing Signal Against a Future Quantum Computer</h2><p>To address this problem, new post-quantum cryptosystems have been created to implement new one-way functions that cannot be advantageously reversed by a quantum computer. Thanks to innovation from cryptographic researchers and the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography" title="NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography">NIST Standardization Process for Post-Quantum Cryptography</a> we now have stable options that have been created and vetted by a large community of experts.</p><p>Even with the contributions of a community of experts, building and evaluating these new cryptosystems remains a challenging endeavor. During NIST’s standardization process, one of the post-quantum algorithm candidates was found to be <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/269080-nist-post-quantum-cryptography-candidate-cracked/fulltext" title="NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Candidate Cracked">attackable</a> by a classical computer. While this shows that the scrutiny of the standardization process is working, it also suggests that one should integrate these new post-quantum options cautiously.</p><p>We believe that the key encapsulation mechanism we have selected, <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/" title="CRYSTALS-Kyber">CRYSTALS-Kyber</a>, is built on solid foundations, but to be safe we do not want to simply replace our existing <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" title="Elliptic Curve Cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a> foundations with a post-quantum public key cryptosystem. Instead, we are augmenting our existing cryptosystems such that an attacker must break <em>both</em> systems in order to compute the keys protecting people’s communications.</p><p>The essence of our protocol upgrade from <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> to <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> is to compute a shared secret, data known only to the parties involved in a private communication session, using both the elliptic curve key agreement protocol <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519" title="X25519">X25519</a> and the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/" title="CRYSTALS-Kyber">CRYSTALS-Kyber</a>. We then combine these two shared secrets together so that any attacker must break both X25519 and CRYSTALS-Kyber to compute the same shared secret.</p><p>Our new protocol is already supported in the latest versions of Signal’s client applications and is in use for chats initiated after both sides of the chat are using the latest Signal software. In the coming months (after sufficient time has passed for everyone using Signal to update), we will disable <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> for new chats and require <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> for all new chats. In parallel, we will roll out software updates to upgrade existing chats to this new protocol.</p><h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2><p><a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> protects messages exchanged on Signal against the threat of a future quantum computer. We will need to make further upgrades to address the threat of an attacker with a contemporaneous quantum computer. Further research in the area of post-quantum cryptography will be needed to fill in the remaining gaps. We recommend reading the security considerations section of our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH whitepaper</a> for more information on the areas of open research.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>We want to extend our sincerest thanks and appreciation to all the people who contributed to the development of this protocol upgrade.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Predictions over graphs play a crucial role in various domains, including social networks, molecular biology, medicine, and more. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the dominant approach for learning on graph data. Instances of graph labeling problems consist of the graph-structure (i.e., the adjacency matrix), along with node-specific feature vectors. In some cases, this graph-structure is non-informative for the predictive task. For instance, molecular properties such as molar mass depend solely on the constituent atoms (node features), and not on the molecular structure. While GNNs have the ability to ignore the graph-structure in such cases, it is not clear that they will. In this work, we show that GNNs actually tend to overfit the graph-structure in the sense that they use it even when a better solution can be obtained by ignoring it. We examine this phenomenon with respect to different graph distributions and find that regular graphs are more robust to this overfitting. We then provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, via analyzing the implicit bias of gradient-descent-based learning of GNNs in this setting. Finally, based on our empirical and theoretical findings, we propose a graph-editing method to mitigate the tendency of GNNs to overfit graph-structures that should be ignored. We show that this method indeed improves the accuracy of GNNs across multiple benchmarks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>TLDR; Graphite enables a git workflow called “stacking” - the fastest way to develop and ship code, which many large tech companies have been using for years. Graphite makes stacking available to anyone with a GitHub account.</p><p>Hi HN!</p><p>I’m Tomas, co-founder of graphite.dev, and today we’re launching Graphite after almost two years of development in closed beta. [1] Graphite started as an internal solution to our own problem. When we (engineers from Meta, Google and Airbnb) left our previous roles, we lost access to the internal code review tools we loved. So we built our own.</p><p>https://graphite.dev</p><p>---</p><p>Graphite is how the fastest developers ship code - it’s a developer tool that allows you to create smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster with “stacking” (creating a set of dependent pull requests). Stacking [2] allows developers to break up large pull requests (PRs) into smaller ones that can be reviewed &amp; merged independently, while keeping ongoing development unblocked. Engineering best practices at Google advise that a “reasonable” PR be around 100 lines, and recommend splitting PRs in order to achieve this through stacking or other methods. [3]</p><p>Unlike other tools like Phabricator, Gerrit, or Sapling, Graphite syncs seamlessly with your GitHub repositories, so that you don’t have to manage any extra infrastructure. This also means that even if your teammates don’t use Graphite yet, you still can.</p><p>Here’s what you can expect when you sign in to Graphite with your GitHub account:</p><p>(1) First class support for stacking: At its core, Graphite enables “stacking”—a workflow used by engineers at top companies like Meta and Google to create small, dependent sets of pull requests. The Graphite CLI, web app, and VS Code extension all come together to empower engineers to start stacking.</p><p>(2) Pull request inbox: You can think of this as your home page on Graphite, where you have full visibility into the status of all your PRs and know what still needs to be done across every repo, author, and stage of review. You can also create custom inboxes that filter PRs on reviewers, authors, labels, CI status, and more.</p><p>(3) Streamlined code review interface: Graphite’s pull request page removes tabs and minimizes distractions, with the aim of putting your code front and center. You can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between files and comments or to move between PRs in your stack. You can also import custom memes and gifs to add some  to your reviews too!</p><p>(4) AI-powered pull requests: Auto-generate a detailed description for every PR with our OpenAI integration. You can even turn your comments into suggested code changes (coming soon!).</p><p>(5) Real-time notifications: Connect Graphite to your Slack workspace to stay up-to-date on review requests, comments threads, merge status, and other activity on your PRs. For smaller PRs, you can leave a review (and even merge) directly from Slack.</p><p>(6) Stack-aware merges: Since Graphite is built to support a stacking workflow, it automates the manual work of rebasing PRs when it’s time to merge. You can merge your stacks with one click from the web app, or in a single command from the CLI.</p><p>Feel free to take a look at our getting started guide [4] or product tour video [5] for a tutorial on how to get started, and drop your comments to us below!</p><p>[1] http://graphite.dev/blog/launch</p><p>[2] http://stacking.dev</p><p>[3] https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html</p><p>[4] https://graphite.dev/docs/getting-started-with-graphite</p><p>[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBcd9uopLOY</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

You can see how Oracle Native Image consistently provides more throughput per compute resource for all heap sizes. So applications of all sizes will see more throughput per memory with Oracle GraalVM Native Image, but specifically, the applications with small and medium heaps, up and around 1GB, can get almost twice as much throughput per compute resources as when running on JIT:</p><figure></figure><p id="1d1d">So now with Native Image you can maximize all performance aspects: <strong>peak throughput, latency, memory usage, startup, and packaging size</strong>. Give it a try yourself and feel free to share your benchmark results with us.</p><p id="5b62">As always, there are more Native Image performance updates in this release.</p><p id="d6a1"><strong>G1 GC now works on Linux AArch64</strong> (in addition to Linux x64). You can enable it by passing <code>--gc=G1</code> to Native Image via the command line or in your build file. While there are many possible GC strategies, for those looking for the best peak performance we recommend evaluating the combination of G1 and PGO.</p><p id="1411"><strong>New optimization levels policy</strong>. There are several optimization levels in Native Image you can choose from. You might be familiar with <code>-Ob</code>, the quick build mode, which can be used in development for faster builds. When you build your application for production, you should compile with more optimizations for better performance— when no custom option is provided, Native Image defaults to <code>-O2</code>. This level of optimization provides high performance, 10–15% faster compile times, and has been tuned for common Java microservice workloads.</p><p id="8294">Now we are introducing <strong>a new optimization level in Oracle GraalVM, </strong><code><strong>-O3</strong></code>, which applies maximum optimizations for the best peak performance. You can enable this optimization level yourself, and if you’re using PGO, it will be triggered automatically.</p><h2 id="b373">Developer Experience</h2><ul><li id="18d4">You can now use the option <code>--parallelism</code> to control how many threads are used by the build process — for example, <code>--parallelism=4.</code></li><li id="31b7">There are several other updates to the build output — it now shows the memory and thread limits of the build process, and you can control the color of output with <code>--color.</code></li><li id="1118">We’ve made changes to the <strong>memory limits</strong> of the Native Image build process. By default, the build process only uses free memory: this approach is intended to avoid slowing down your machine and other processes. If free memory is less than 8GB, the build process will use 85% of total memory. So if you observe your machine being slow during native builds, consider closing those processes you don’t need.</li><li id="89dd"><code>native-image-inspect</code> in Oracle GraalVM can now dump the heap of executables and shared libraries: <code>native-image-inspect --heap path/to/image</code>.</li><li id="2ff6"><strong>Special exception handling for missing metadata</strong>. Previously, missing metadata could lead to program misbehavior that was hard to debug. Now in cases when the metadata entry is missing, the call that was requiring it will fail with the special exception — for example, <code>MissingReflectionMetadataException</code>. There are also similar exceptions for missing resources and serialization metadata.</li><li id="104d"><strong>New Class Initialization Strategy.</strong> In this release, we are introducing a <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/4684" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">new class initialization approach</a> that will become the default in the future: all classes are now allowed to be used and initialized at build time, regardless of the class initialization configuration. For classes that are configured as <code>--initialize-at-run-time</code> this means that they will appear as uninitialized again at run time. To enable the new approach, pass the <code>--strict-image-heap</code> flag to Native Image. In case you run into errors or issues with it, we will share more details in a blog post that will go out together with the October 24 patch release.</li><li id="beb1"><code>gu</code> is no longer needed for Native Image and GraalVM languages — learn how to <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/6855" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">use additional components</a> now.</li><li id="aa8e">Support for the JFR event <code>ThreadCPULoad</code> was <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/6588" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">contributed</a> by BellSoft.</li></ul><h2 id="a7fb">Experimental Build Options in Native Image</h2><p id="b0f3">There are many <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/overview/BuildOptions/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">build options</a> in Native Image, most of which are stable, and some are experimental. To provide better awareness and control over options that are being used and avoid misuse, in this release we have added a new <code>-H:±UnlockExperimentalVMOptions</code> option to explicitly handle experimental options. Here’s how you can unlock and lock experimental options:</p><pre><span id="20f0">native-image -H:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -H:SomeExperimentalOption \<br>             -H:-UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -cp ./ HelloWorld</span></pre><p id="5d81">Explicit enabling of experimental options will become required in the next release, but you can test this already in GraalVM for JDK 21 using the environment variable <code>NATIVE_IMAGE_EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS_ARE_FATAL=true</code>.</p><p id="f447">As we are stabilizing the public API, we encourage your feedback on which experimental features you are actively using in <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/7370" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the corresponding roadmap ticket</a>.</p><h2 id="e8c1">Control Flow Integrity in Native Image</h2><p id="cf0a">Oracle GraalVM now provides a form of control flow integrity (CFI) using ARM Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) on supported hardware. PAC mitigates return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks by ensuring the integrity of the return address of a function call: the return address is signed on function entry and the signature is checked before function return. Any tampering is detected by the CPU. You can enable it with the <code>-H:EnableCFI</code> option.</p><h2 id="1480">JDK and Compiler updates</h2><p id="300f">We implemented an initial optimization of <strong>Java Vector API (</strong><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/338" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>JEP 338</strong></a><strong>) operations </strong>in Oracle GraalVM. Multiple operations on the JVM are now transformed to efficient machine instructions where possible. This optimization is enabled by default (you can disable it with <code>-Dgraal.OptimizeVectorAPI=false</code>) and we welcome your feedback.</p><p id="877d">We also implemented several intrinsics for JDK 21 for both x64 and AArch64 architectures.</p><h2 id="8c38">Refactoring GraalVM SDK</h2><p id="6848"><a href="https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The GraalVM SDK</a> is split into four fine-grained modules:</p><ul><li id="649f"><code>org.graalvm.nativeimage</code>: The public API of Native Image for advanced use cases.</li><li id="74d0"><code>org.graalvm.polyglot</code>: A library that allows users to embed polyglot language implementations in Java.</li><li id="c64f"><code>org.graalvm.word</code>: A low-level library for machine-word-sized values in Java.</li><li id="64d2"><code>org.graalvm.collections</code>: A collections library for GraalVM components.</li></ul><p id="8dc2">Note that all GraalVM APIs remain compatible in this release.</p><h2 id="f33a">Ecosystem and Community</h2><ul><li id="3d99">GraalVM’s Maven and Gradle plugin, <a href="https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/index.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Native Build Tools</a>, released a new version, <a href="https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/index.html#_release_0_9_27" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">0.9.27</a>.</li><li id="5512"><a href="https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata/releases" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM Reachability Metadata</a> received several new contributions, such as metadata for <code>org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients</code>, <code>commons-logging:commons-logging</code>, <code>org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient</code>, <code>liquibase-core</code>,<code>org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3,</code> and other projects.</li><li id="e643">Micronaut® framework 4.0 was released with support for a new GraalVM version and <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository</a>.</li><li id="134f">10MinuteMail shared how they used <a href="https://www.digitalsanctuary.com/10minutemail/migrating-10minutemail-from-java-to-graalvm-native.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM and Spring Boot 3</a> to reduce their startup time from ~30 s down to about 3 ms, and memory usage from 6.6 GB down to 1 GB, with the same throughput and CPU utilization.</li><li id="798c">The Ballerina team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDRi3rNiFqo" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">reached similar results</a> with GraalVM: their application went from 980 ms to 52 ms startup time and from 242 MB to 93 MB RSS with GraalVM.</li><li id="d6e4"><a href="https://twitter.com/mraible" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Matt Raible</a> compared the performance of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoU1ruBSXSA" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Native Java REST API Frameworks</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="577d">Conclusion</h2><p id="d3d8">We want to take this opportunity to thank our community for all the feedback, suggestions, and contributions that went into this release.

									<p>Walter Isaacson’s biography of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has uncovered several intriguing revelations. The latest revelation raises serious questions as to whether or not Tesla values its drivers’ privacy.</p>
<p>In his book, Isaacson shows how Musk wanted to spy on drivers to defend Tesla from lawsuits.</p>
<p>Musk insisted on using the internal monitoring camera in Tesla vehicles to record drivers’ behaviors behind the wheel. This driver behavior was to be used as evidence to safeguard the company during investigations following accidents. By recording driver behavior, Musk could argue that driver error led to the accidents rather than Tesla technology.</p>
<p>While most car manufacturers employ internal cameras to monitor driver attentiveness and issue warnings, Musk envisioned Tesla taking it a step further. The book highlights Musk’s push to collect data from the car’s cameras, including the one focused on the driver, to establish instances of driver error. Drivers were not to be informed about the monitoring.</p>
<p>However, during a meeting, a Tesla manager raised concerns regarding privacy. The manager pointed out that Musk’s driver monitoring technology would not be able to link the recorded footage to specific vehicles, even in the event of a crash.</p>
<p>Musk ignored the manager’s concerns. However, he did back down somewhat on his idea to spy on drivers without their consent.</p>
<p>Musk proposed a pop-up message, informing customers that data would be collected if they used the Full Self-Driving Beta feature. This placated the manager.</p>
<p>The pop-up exists in current Tesla vehicles and explains how the company plans to use data from the internal camera. Drivers are given the choice to agree or disagree with Tesla collecting cabin camera data.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Tesla has not yet used internal vehicle images in legal disputes or investigations relating to the Autopilot system.</p>
<p>Even with Tesla’s use of pop-up messages, there continues to be numerous privacy complaints against the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/687228/musk-wanted-use-tesla-in-car-video-win-lawsuits-biography/">According to InsideEVs</a>, Tesla is currently facing multiple class action lawsuits regarding video privacy. In one lawsuit, plaintiffs are alleging that groups of Tesla employees privately shared highly invasive videos captured by customers’ car cameras between 2019 and 2022.</p>
<p>Another lawsuit in Illinois specifically focuses on privacy violations involving the cabin camera.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/441">JEP 441</a> Pattern
Matching for switch<a href="#441" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for
<code>switch</code> expressions and statements. Extending pattern
matching to <code>switch</code> allows an expression to be tested
against a number of patterns, each with a specific action, so that
complex data-oriented queries can be expressed concisely and

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/442">JEP 442</a> Foreign
Function &amp; Memory API (Third Preview)<a href="#442" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API by which Java programs can interoperate with
code and data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking
foreign functions (i.e., code outside the JVM), and by safely
accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), the
API enables Java programs to call native libraries and process
native data without the brittleness and danger of JNI. This is a
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview API</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/443">JEP 443</a> Unnamed
Patterns and Variables (Preview)<a href="#443" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Enhance the Java language with <em>unnamed patterns</em>, which
match a record component without stating the component's name or
type, and <em>unnamed variables</em>, which can be initialized but
not used. Both are denoted by an underscore character,

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/444">JEP 444</a> Virtual
Threads<a href="#444" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce <em>virtual threads</em> to the Java Platform. Virtual
threads are lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort
of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent
applications.</p>
</section>
<section id="445">
<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/445">JEP 445</a> Unnamed
Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)<a href="#445" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Evolve the Java language so that students can write their first
programs without needing to understand language features designed
for large programs. Far from using a separate dialect of Java,
students can write streamlined declarations for single-class
programs and then seamlessly expand their programs to use more
advanced features as their skills grow. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview language feature</a>.</p>

Instance Main Methods (Preview)</a></section>
<section id="446">
<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/446">JEP 446</a> Scoped
Values (Preview)<a href="#446" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce <em>scoped values</em>, values that may be safely and
efficiently shared to methods without using method parameters. They
are preferred to thread-local variables, especially when using
large numbers of virtual threads. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview API</a>.</p>
<p>In effect, a scoped value is an <em>implicit method
parameter</em>. It is "as if" every method in a sequence of calls
has an additional, invisible, parameter. None of the methods
declare this parameter and only the methods that have access to the
scoped value object can access its value (the data). Scoped values
make it possible to pass data securely from a caller to a faraway
callee through a sequence of intermediate methods that do not
declare a parameter for the data and have no access to the
data.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/448">JEP 448</a> Vector API
(Sixth Incubator)<a href="#448" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API to express vector computations that reliably
compile at runtime to optimal vector instructions on supported CPU
architectures, thus achieving performance superior to equivalent
scalar computations.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451">JEP 451</a> Prepare to
Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents<a href="#451" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Issue warnings when agents are loaded dynamically into a running
JVM. These warnings aim to prepare users for a future release which
disallows the dynamic loading of agents by default in order to
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8305968">improve integrity by
default</a>. Serviceability tools that load agents at startup will
not cause warnings to be issued in any release.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/452">JEP 452</a> Key
Encapsulation Mechanism API<a href="#452" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), an
encryption technique for securing symmetric keys using public key
cryptography.</p>
</section>
<section id="453">
<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/453">JEP 453</a> Structured
Concurrency (Preview)<a href="#453" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Simplify concurrent programming by introducing an API for
<em>structured concurrency</em>. Structured concurrency treats
groups of related tasks running in different threads as a single
unit of work, thereby streamlining error handling and cancellation,
improving reliability, and enhancing observability. This is a

<p>The Sequenced Collection API introduces several new interfaces
into the collections framework, providing enhancements to many
existing collections classes. The new API facilitates access to
elements at each end of a sequenced collection, and provides the
ability to view and iterate such collections in reverse order. See
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/431">JEP 431</a> for additional
information.</p>
<p>The introduction of new collections interfaces, along with
default methods, introduces some compatibility risk, including the
possibility of both source and binary incompatibilities. The
introduction of default methods in an interface hierarchy may cause
conflicts with methods declared on existing classes or interfaces
that extend collections interfaces - this could result in either
source or binary incompatibilities. The introduction of new
interfaces also introduces new types into the system, which can
change the results of type inference, leading in turn to source
incompatibilities.</p>
<p>For a discussion of potential incompatibilities and possible
ways to mitigate them, please see the document <a href="https://inside.java/2023/05/12/quality-heads-up/">JDK 21:

<h3>Warning Printed when an Agent Is Loaded into a Running VM
<span>( <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451">JEP 451</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8307478" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>core-svc/tools</section>
<section>
<p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) now prints a warning to standard
error when a JVM Tool Interface (JVM TI) agent or Java Agent is
dynamically loaded into a running JVM. The warning is intended to
prepare for a future release that disallows, by default, dynamic
loading of agent code into a running JVM.</p>
<p>Agents are programs that run in the JVM process and make use of
powerful JVM TI or <code>java.lang.instrument</code> APIs. These
APIs are designed to support tooling such as profilers and
debuggers. Agents are started via a command line option, for
example <code>-agentlib</code> or <code>-javaagent</code>, or they
can be started into a running VM using the JDK specific
<code>com.sun.tools.attach</code> API or the <code>jcmd</code>
command. Agents loaded into a running VM will now print a warning.
There is no warning for agents that are loaded at startup via
command line options.</p>
<p>The HotSpot VM option <code>EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code>
controls dynamic loading of agents. This option has existed since
JDK 9. The default, since JDK 9, is to allow dynamic loading of
agents. Running with <code>-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code> on
the command line serves as an explicit "opt-in" that allows agent
code to be loaded into a running VM and thus suppresses the
warning. Running with <code>-XX:-EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code>
disallows agent code from being loaded into a running VM and can be
used to test possible future behavior.</p>
<p>In addition, the system property
<code>jdk.instrument.traceUsage</code> can be used to trace uses of
the <code>java.lang.instrument</code> API. Running with
<code>-Djdk.instrument.traceUsage</code> or
<code>-Djdk.instrument.traceUsage=true</code> causes usages of the
API to print a trace message and stack trace. This can be used to
identify agents that are dynamically loaded instead of being
started on the command line with <code>-javaagent</code>.</p>

<p>This feature delivers an enhanced syntax for properties related
to certificate, CRL, and OCSP connect and read timeouts. The new
syntax allows the timeout values to be specified either in seconds
or milliseconds. This feature also delivers three new System
properties related to connect and read timeouts.</p>
<p><em>New properties</em>: The existing
<code>com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout</code> property will now be
paired with the new <code>com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout</code>
property. The former property will be used to set timeouts for the
transport-layer connection while the latter will be used to manage
timeouts for reading the data. The new
<code>com.sun.security.cert.timeout</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.cert.readtimeout</code> properties will be
used to control connect and read timeouts, respectively, when
following an X.509 certificate's AuthorityInfoAccess extension. For
the certificate fetching properties, the
<code>com.sun.security.enableAIAcaIssuers</code> property must be
set to <code>true</code> in order for fetching to occur and these
property timeouts to be enabled.</p>
<p><em>Enhanced timeout syntax</em>: The new syntax applies to the
aforementioned properties, and also to the
<code>com.sun.security.crl.timeout</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.crl.readtimeout</code> properties as well.
The allowed syntax is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A decimal integer will be interpreted in seconds and ensures
backward compatibility.</li>
<li>A decimal integer ending in "s" (case-insensitive, no space)
appended to it. This will also be interpreted in seconds.</li>
<li>A decimal integer value with "ms" (case-insensitive, no space)
appended to it. This will be interpreted as milliseconds. For
example, a value of "2500ms" will be a 2.5 second timeout.</li>
<li>Negative, non-numeric, or non-decimal (for example, hexadecimal
values prepended by "0x") values will be interpreted as illegal and
will default to the 15 second timeout.</li>
<li>Whether the value is interpreted in seconds or milliseconds, a
value of zero will disable the timeout.</li>

<p>The following changes have been made with regard to the JAXP
configuration files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added the <code>jaxp.properties</code> file to the JDK at
<code>$JAVA_HOME/conf/jaxp.properties</code> as the default JAXP
configuration file. Property settings in the file reflect the
current, built-in defaults for the JDK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a new System Property, <code>java.xml.config.file</code>,
for specifying the location of a custom configuration file. If it
is set and the named file exists, the property settings contained
in the file override those in the default JAXP configuration file.
For more details, see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.xml/module-summary.html#Conf">
Configuration</a> section of the module specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deprecated the <code>stax.properties</code> file that was
defined in the StAX API and used by the StAX factories. It had been
made redundant after StAX's integration into JAXP since the
function has been fully covered by the JAXP configuration file. It
is recommended that applications migrate to the JAXP configuration
file as the <code>stax.properties</code> file is deprecated and may
no longer be supported in the future.</p>

<section>core-libs/java.lang</section>
<section>
<p>Since JDK 13, executing commands in a sub-process uses the
so-called <code>POSIX_SPAWN</code> launching mechanism (that is,
<code>-Djdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism=POSIX_SPAWN</code>) by
default on Linux. In cases where the parent JVM process terminates
abnormally before the handshake between the JVM and the newly
created <code>jspawnhelper</code> process has completed,
<code>jspawnhelper</code> can hang indefinitely in JDK 13 to JDK
20. This issue is fixed in JDK 21. The issue was especially harmful
if the parent process had open sockets, because in that case, the
forked <code>jspawnhelper</code> process will inherit them and keep
all the corresponding ports open, effectively preventing other
processes from binding to them.</p>
<p>This misbehavior has been observed with applications which
frequently fork child processes in environments with tight memory
constraints. In such cases, the OS can kill the JVM in the middle
of the forking process leading to the described issue. Restarting
the JVM process after such a crash will be impossible if the new
process tries to bind to the same ports as the initial application
because they will be blocked by the hanging
<code>jspawnhelper</code> child process.</p>
<p>The root cause of this issue is <code>jspawnhelper</code>'s
omission to close its writing end of the pipe, which is used for
the handshake with the parent JVM. It was fixed by closing the
writing end of the communication pipe before attempting to read
data from the parent process. This way, <code>jspawnhelper</code>
will reliably read an EOF event from the communication pipe and
terminate once the parent process dies prematurely.</p>
<p>A second variant of this issue could happen because the
handshaking code in the JDK didn't handle interrupts to
<code>write(2)</code> correctly. This could lead to incomplete
messages being sent to the <code>jspawnhelper</code> child process.
The result is a deadlock between the parent thread and the child
process which manifests itself in a <code>jspawnhelper</code>
process being blocked while reading from a pipe and the following
stack trace in the corresponding parent Java process:</p>
<pre><code>java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE
  at java.lang.ProcessImpl.forkAndExec(java.base@17.0.7/Native Method)

<section>
<p>Maintainers of applications that do network multicasting or use
the <code>java.net.NetworkInterface</code> API should note that the
names that the JDK assigns to network interfaces on Windows have
changed in this release. The JDK historically synthesized names for
network interfaces on Windows. This has changed to use the names
assigned by the Windows operating system. For example, the JDK may
have historically assigned a name such as “eth0” for an ethernet
interface and “lo” for the loopback. The equivalent names that
Windows assigns may be names such as “ethernet_32768” and
“loopback_0".</p>
<p>This change may impact code that does a lookup of network
interfaces with the <code>NetworkInterace.getByName(String
name)</code> method. It also may also be surprising to code that
enumerates all network interfaces with the
<code>NetworkInterfaces.networkInterfaces()</code> or
<code>NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces()</code> methods as the
names of the network interfaces will look different to previous
releases. Depending on configuration, it is possible that
enumerating all network interfaces will enumerate network
interfaces that weren’t previously enumerated because they didn’t
have an Internet Protocol address assigned. The display name
returned by <code>NetworkInterface::getDisplayName</code> has not
changed so this should facilitate the identification of network
interfaces when using Windows native tools.</p>

<p>Starting with the July 2023 CPU, on operating systems where ASLR

will be placed at a random address picked by the operating

time may increase because the JVM needs to patch pointers inside

used by the CDS archive is no longer shareable across processes. We
expect the impact to be small because such increases should be only
a small fraction of the overall application usage.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that you must disable ASLR for CDS, you
can use the JVM flags <code>-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions

is being used. The text of the note is:</p>
<pre><code>     Annotation processing is enabled because one or more processors were

    annotation processing unless at least one processor is specified by

<section>
<p>A new compiler lint flag, <code>output-file-clash</code>,
enables detection of output file clashes. An output file clash is
when the compiler intends to write two different output files, but
due to the behavior of the operating system, these files end up
being written to the same underlying file.</p>
<p>This usually happens due to case-insensitive file systems. For
example, a class like this would cause two class files to be
written to the same file, <code>Test$Inner.class</code>:</p>
<pre><code>public class Test {
    class Inner {
    }
    class INNER {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this problem can also happen when the file system
"normalizes" file names. For example, on macOS, compiling this
class will generate such a clash:</p>
<pre><code>public class Test {
    interface Cafeu0301 {
    }
    interface Cafu00e9 {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that <code>u0301</code> is the Unicode character
"Combining Acute Accent" which means "add an accent over the
previous character". MacOS normalizes the letter <code>e</code>
followed by a <code>u0301</code> into a Unicode <code>u00e9</code>,
that is, <code>é</code>. However, the Java language treats these
the two names, <code>Cafeu0301</code> and <code>Cafu00e9</code>, as
distinct.</p>
<p>Compiling the example above on macOS with
<code>-Xlint:output-file-clash</code> will now generate a warning
like this:</p>
<pre><code>    warning: [output-file-clash] output file written more than once: /home/test/Test$Café.class
</code></pre></section>

<h3>Generate "potentially ambiguous overload" Warning for Inherited
Methods <span>(<a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8026369">JDK-8026369</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8026369" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>tools/javac</section>
<section>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the <code>javac</code> compiler was omitting
some "potentially ambiguous overload" warnings enabled by the
<code>-Xlint:overloads</code> option.</p>
<p>If the <code>-Xlint:overloads</code> option is enabled, the
compiler warns when the methods in a class create a potential
ambiguity for method invocations containing an implicit lambda
expression parameter like <code>x -&gt; { ... }</code>. An
ambiguity can occur if two or more methods could match such a
method call, like when one method takes a
<code>Consumer&lt;Integer&gt;</code> parameter where the other
takes an <code>IntConsumer</code>. For example, the
<code>javac</code> compiler should issue a warning for code such
as:</p>
<pre><code>    interface I {
        void foo(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; c);
        void foo(IntConsumer c);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the warning was only issued for a class if one
of the methods was declared in the class. The <code>javac</code>
compiler now also warns when neither method is declared in the
class. That is, both methods are inherited from supertypes. For
example, for code like:</p>
<pre><code>    interface I {
        void foo(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; c);
    }

    interface J {
        void foo(IntConsumer c);
    }

    interface K extends I, J {}
</code></pre></section>

						<p>Canadian Sikh Facebook users posting about the assassination of a Sikh community leader are seeing posts disappear and accounts suspended in response to legal demands by the Indian government.</p>
<p>Many Facebook posts and pages that have been flagged as being in violation of Indian law involve content relating to the legacy of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66158842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Sikh leader who was assassinated outside of a Surrey gurdwara in June of this year.</p>
<p>On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons that Canadian intelligence was pursuing “credible allegations” that “agents of the Government of India” had <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-killing-of-sikh-leader-outside-surrey-bc-temple-sparks-rage-in-the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assassinated Nijjar in Surrey, BC this summer</a>.</p>
<p>“Over the past number of weeks, Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar,” Trudeau said. “Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Since Nijjar’s assassination in June, a number of Canadian Sikh Facebook users say their posts about the community leader have been censored or unpublished by Meta following interventions by the Indian government.</p>
<p>BC Sikhs, a Facebook page that represents British Columbia’s Sikh community, currently remains “unpublished” after admins received a notice that the page was removed for failing to follow Meta’s standards on “dangerous individuals and organizations.”</p>
<p>“Your page has been unpublished,” reads a notice sent to BC Sikhs that was reviewed by <em>PressProgress</em>. “This is because BC Sikhs goes against our Community Standards on dangerous individuals and organizations.”</p>
<div id="attachment_64591"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64591" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-06-facebook-canada9ndia.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="1103" srcset="https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-06-facebook-canada9ndia.jpg 940w, https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-06-facebook-canada9ndia-256x300.jpg 256w, https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-06-facebook-canada9ndia-873x1024.jpg 873w, https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-06-facebook-canada9ndia-768x901.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64591">BC Sikhs (Facebook)</p></div>
<p>Certain posts were also flagged or taken down, requiring the BC Sikhs account to appeal Facebook’s decision.</p>
<p>One Facebook post which was restricted includes a photo of an event promoting a discussion on “the legacy of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar.”</p>
<p>BC Sikhs was notified that “access to (their) photo has been restricted due to a legal request.”</p>
<p>“Access to your photo has been restricted within India because Facebook has been notified by the authorities under an emergency order pursuant to Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000,” the notice states.</p>
<p>“If you have any questions, please contact the appropriate authorities for further information.”</p>

<p>The Information Technology Act in India allows the government to <a href="https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2022/10/22/the-phantom-constitutionality-of-section-69a-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block content </a>“in the interests of the defence, sovereignty, integrity, or security of India or its relations with foreign states, public order, or the incitement of a cognisable offence relating to these categories.”</p>
<p>Other Sikh Facebook users based in Canada have reported similar experiences.</p>
<p>Sarbraj Singh Kahlon, a Vancouver journalist with Radio Punjab, told <em>PressProgress</em> his Facebook account was restricted after he posted about protests about Nijjar’s assassination at the Indian Consulate in Vancouver and posts commemorating the anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>Meta did not respond to multiple requests for comment from<em> PressProgress</em>, but did request additional time to look into the matter<em>.</em></p>
<p>After <em>PressProgress </em>brought the issue to Meta’s attention, BC Sikhs said their appeals were suddenly reversed and their page and posts were restored.</p>
<p>“We found that our review team made a mistake taking your post down,” read an updated notice sent September 17. “Our priority is keeping the community safe and respectful, so sometimes we have to take precautions.”</p>
<div id="attachment_64592"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64592" decoding="async" src="https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-07-facebook-canada9ndia.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="1086" srcset="https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-07-facebook-canada9ndia.jpg 940w, https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-07-facebook-canada9ndia-260x300.jpg 260w, https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-07-facebook-canada9ndia-886x1024.jpg 886w, https://pressprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2023-09-07-facebook-canada9ndia-768x887.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64592">BC Sikhs (Facebook)</p></div>
<p>“The BC Sikhs social media pages have been an active community news and events outlet for almost 20 years,” an admin for the BC Sikh’s Facebook page told <em>PressProgress.</em></p>
<p>“The recent restriction of our content, and unpublishing of our Facebook page, is a result of direct interference by Indian intelligence agencies.”</p>
<p>The group said “decades of India’s interference in Canadian politics has to end here.”</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>PressProgress</em>, the World Sikh Organization also accused India of foreign interference by targeting members of Canada’s Sikh diaspora who are critical of the Indian government.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister of Canada has publicly said what Sikhs in Canada have known for decades- India actively targets Sikhs in Canada,” World Sikh Organization President Tejinder Singh Sidhu said in a statement.</p>
<p>“India cannot be allowed to disregard the rule of law and the sovereignty of foreign states. The Sikh community will not be intimidated or frightened by the actions of the Government of India.”</p>
<p>The Canadian government announced an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2023/09/government-of-canada-launches-public-inquiry-into-foreign-interference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inquiry into foreign interference </a>earlier this year, with a preliminary report to be tabled in February.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference do not mention India by name, but states that “the commissioner will examine and assess interference by China, Russia and other foreign states or non-state actors.”</p>

It is said to prove a point about the globalization of tea: words for tea that sound like </span><em>chai </em><span>reflect a historical spread via overland routes, the argument goes, while words like </span><em>tea </em><span>are a legacy of maritime trade. A 2018 </span><a href="https://qz.com/1176962/map-how-the-word-tea-spread-over-land-and-sea-to-conquer-the-world" rel="">viral article</a><span> by the data journalist Nikhil Sonad in </span><em>Quartz</em><span> first put this idea on the world’s radar. Sonad observed that the Chinese character for tea (茶) is pronounced </span><em>chá</em><span> in some varieties of Chinese, like Mandarin —&nbsp;but in the Min Nan dialect spoken in the coastal province of Fujian, it’s pronounced </span><em>te</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>Maps like this are a big part of why I became a historian. I probably spent more time looking through the volumes of Colin McEvedy’s </span><em>Penguin Atlas of History </em><span>series than any other book when I was a kid (scans of the medieval volume are </span><a href="http://projects.mcah.columbia.edu/courses/medmil/pages/non-mma-pages/maps/penguin.html" rel="">here</a><span>). There’s something beguiling about the thought that a simple arrangement of lines might explain the world —&nbsp;like seeing human history as an enormous game of </span><em>Civilization 6. </em><span>But of course, that’s also the </span><em>problem</em><span> with using maps as a way of understanding history. If you’re not careful, they go from being helpful tools to misleading simplifications. </span></p><p><span>Because, </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-not-to-be-fooled-by-viral-charts" rel="">like economic charts</a><span> that go viral, many popular maps about history happen to be wrong.  </span></p><p><span>As much as I like the map above, for instance, it’s worth pointing out that the coverage of Africa is a mess. It puts the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the “tea” category, for instance. And it’s true that French (</span><em>thé</em><span>) is one</span><em> </em><span>of the DRC’s official languages. But another national language is Lingala, in which the word for tea is “chai.” As for Mozambique and Angola, Portuguese is the official language in both countries, and tea in Portuguese is </span><em>chá.</em></p><p><span>Keeping that in mind, return to the map above and take note of Portugal and Brazil. The map can now be deployed to prove an entirely different argument. Maybe this is not a map about Min Nan and Mandarin. It’s a map about the </span><em>Portuguese empire</em><span>. An empire that, not coincidentally, played a central role in globalizing tea (something I wrote about </span><a href="https://github.com/benjaminbreen/PDFs/blob/master/%22Empires%20on%20Drugs%22%20proofs.pdf" rel="">here</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>Last month, Anton Howes </span><a href="https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-does-history-have" rel="">wrote</a><span> about historians and our weakness for storytelling. I think many maps have a similar dangerous allure. They smooth over chronology and ignore the reality of overwhelming complexity that confronts anyone who has tried to answer a question by visiting a historical archive.</span></p><p><span>And then there are the </span><em>really </em><span>bad</span><em> </em><span>historical maps. Though my title is debatable, I believe that there really are maps — </span><em>several </em><span>maps, in fact— which can be pointed to as causal agents in World War I. </span></p><p><span>The rest of this post is about one specific example: the map of troop movements at the ancient Battle of Cannae (216 BCE) that inspired German military planners in the years just before 1914.

At the head of these planers was General von Schlieffen, the Chief of the German General Staff. The map of Cannae haunted Schlieffen’s dreams. </p><p>As Tuchman writes:</p><blockquote><p>To achieve decisive victory, Schlieffen fixed upon a strategy derived from Hannibal and the Battle of Cannae. The dead general who mesmerized Schlieffen had been dead a very long time. Two thousand years had passed since Hannibal’s classic double envelopment of the Romans at Cannae. Field gun and machine gun had replaced bow and arrow and slingshot, Schlieffen wrote, “but the principles of strategy remain unchanged. The enemy's front is not the objective. The essential thing is to crush the enemy's flanks... and complete the extermination by attack upon his rear.” Under Schlieffen, envelopment became the fetish and frontal attack the anathema of the German General Staff.</p></blockquote><p><span>I highly recommend Tuchman’s book, which, while imperfect as scholarship, is brilliant as historical writing.

It did not seem to trouble them, for instance, that they were drawing world-changing lessons from a map of a battle of two thousand years earlier about which surprisingly little is known. </span></p><p><span>As the historian Martin Samuels </span><a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1524/mgzs.1990.47.1.7/html?lang=en" rel="">pointed out</a><span> in his article “the Reality of Cannae,” there is no archaeological evidence for the battle. Nor are there first-hand sources of any kind. Everything we know derives from accounts written </span><em>sixty years or more </em><span>after Cannae itself. Suffice to say, when Samuels dug into these sources, he found as many questions as answers. The detailed maps of movements at Cannae that decorated military strategy manuals for hundreds of years, in other words, were largely fanciful.  Samuels calls Cannae “the most quoted and least understood battle” in history.</span></p><p>The simplicity of a historical map —&nbsp;the clear labels, the sharp edges, and above all the reduction of thousands or millions of people into abstract symbols —&nbsp;is a big part of why they’re so beguiling.

<pre>JDK 21, the reference implementation of Java 21, is now Generally
Available.  We shipped build 35 as the first and only Release Candidate
of JDK 21 on 11 August, and no P1 bugs have been reported since then.
Build 35 is therefore now the GA build, ready for production use.

GPL-licensed OpenJDK builds from Oracle are available here:

  <a href="https://jdk.java.net/21">https://jdk.java.net/21</a>

Builds from other vendors will no doubt be available soon.

This release includes fifteen JEPs [1], including the final versions of
Record Patterns (440), Pattern Matching for switch (441), and Virtual
Threads (444):

  430: String Templates (Preview)
  431: Sequenced Collections
  439: Generational ZGC
  440: Record Patterns
  441: Pattern Matching for switch
  442: Foreign Function &amp; Memory API (Third Preview)
  443: Unnamed Patterns and Variables (Preview)
  444: Virtual Threads
  445: Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)
  446: Scoped Values (Preview)
  448: Vector API (Sixth Incubator)
  449: Deprecate the Windows 32-bit x86 Port for Removal
  451: Prepare to Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents
  452: Key Encapsulation Mechanism API
  453: Structured Concurrency (Preview)

This release also includes, as usual, hundreds of smaller enhancements
and thousands of bug fixes.

JDK 21 will be a long-term-support (LTS) release from most vendors,
including Oracle.  If you’re upgrading from the previous LTS release,
JDK 17, then you have many more JEPs to look forward to, summarized
here:

  <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/jeps-since-jdk-17">https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/jeps-since-jdk-17</a>

Thank you to everyone who contributed this release, whether by designing
and implementing features or enhancements, by fixing bugs, or by
downloading and testing the early-access builds!

            <link>https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/2615</link>
            <guid>37569258</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 12:54:09 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/2615">https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/2615</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37569258">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Ten years ago, after it became clear to almost everyone that all our online activity was being tracked and stored, <a href="https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/285" data-type="post" data-id="285">I wrote a blog post about simple steps a person could take to improve their privacy online</a>. </p>
<p>Essentially, it contains a few recommendations that everyone could follow to reduce their fingerprint without much effort. It wasn’t meant to be exhaustive, and it wasn’t meant to make you invisible online. If your personal situation needs more, you have a lot more ground to cover, which was totally out of the scope of that post. </p>
<p>The target audience was the average Joe, that doesn’t like to be spied on. Specially by commercial companies that just want to show you ads, sell you stuff or use your habits against you.</p>
<p>Many things have changed in the last 10 years, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/">while others remained the same</a>. <strong>With this in mind, I think it is time for an update to my suggestions, keeping in mind that no specialized knowledge should be required and the maximum amount of effort should not surpass 30 minutes.</strong></p>
<h2>1. Pick an ethical browser</h2>
<p>For regular users on any computer or operating system, the main window to the outside world is the browser. Nowadays, this app is of the utmost importance. </p>
<p>My initial suggestion remains valid these days, you should install and use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. </p>
<p>There are other browsers that could also do the trick, such as Brave or Safari, but my preference still goes to Mozilla’s browser. </p>
<p>No matter your choice, <strong>you should avoid Chrome and Edge</strong>. If you want a more detailed comparison, you can check <a href="https://privacytests.org/">this website</a>.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 5 minutes</em></p>
<h2>2. Install important extensions</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the default configuration of a good browser is not enough, even considering it already includes many protections enabled from the start.</p>
<p>For a minimal setup, I consider 2 extensions indispensable: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/">Privacy badger</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These will ensure that most spyware, included in a huge number of websites, isn’t loaded and does not leak your private information to third-parties. They will also block ads and other junk that make the web slow and waste your bandwidth.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 2 minutes</em></p>
<h2>3. Opt out of any data collection</h2>
<p>This topic is specially problematic for Microsoft Windows users. However, it is becoming an increase prevalent practice in all software vendors.</p>
<p>They will tell you they are collecting anonymous data to improve their products and services, while often the data is not that anonymous and/or the purposes are far wider than the ones they make you believe initially.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Windows is an enormous data collection machine, so to minimize the damage, you should disable as much of this as possible. If this is your operating system, you can find a step-by-step tutorial of the main things to disable <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/893162/11-windows-11-privacy-settings-to-change/">here</a> (note: you should evaluate if the last 3 steps make sense for your case).</p>
<p>If you use a different operating system, you should do a small research about what data the vendor collects.</p>
<p>The next action is to do the same on your browser. In this case, in Firefox you should paste <code>about:preferences#privacy</code> in the URL bar, look for <strong>Firefox Data Collection and Use</strong> and then disable all options.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: </em>2–8 minutes</p>
<h2>4. Use a better DNS resolver</h2>
<p>This suggestion is a bit more technical, but important enough that I decided to include it in this guide that only covers the basics.</p>
<p>With the new configuration that we set up on points 2 and 3, in theory, we are well protected against these forms of tracking. However, there are 2 big holes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you sure the operating system settings are being respected?</li>
<li>Trackers on the browser are being blocked, but what about the other installed applications? Are they spying on you?</li>
</ul>
<p>To address the 2 points above, you can change your default DNS server to one that blocks any queries to sites tracking your activity. Two examples are <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls/">Mullvad DNS</a> and <a href="https://nextdns.io/">Next DNS</a>, but there are others.</p>
<p>Changing your DNS server can also help you block tracking on other devices you have less control, such as your phone or TV.</p>
<p>The links contain detailed guides on how to proceed.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 4–10 minutes</em></p>
<h2>5. Segregate your activity</h2>
<p>This step is more related to your behavior and browsing habits than to any tools that you need to install and configure.</p>
<p>The goal here is to clean any data websites leave behind to track you across visits and websites through time.</p>
<p>You should configure your browser to delete all cookies and website related data at the end of each session, and by this, I mean when you close your browser. </p>
<p>In Firefox, you should again to <code>about:preferences#privacy</code> search for “<strong>Cookies and Site Data</strong>” and check the option: “<strong>Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed</strong>“.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is impractical because it will force you to login into websites and apps all the time. A good compromise is to use “<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Multi-Account Containers</a>“, they allow you to segregate your activity into multiple isolated containers, so you can limit any tracking capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 3 minutes</em></p>
<h2>6. Prefer privacy preserving tools and services</h2>
<p>Most online services that common folk use, go to huge lengths to track your activities. For most of them, this is their business model.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are drop-in replacements for common tools that will provide you with similar or better service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search Engine:</strong> use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> / <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, avoid Google or Bing.</li>
<li><strong>Maps:</strong> use <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#">Open Street Maps</a>, avoid Google Maps.</li>
<li><strong>Online Office Suite:</strong> use <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptoPad</a>, avoid Office 365 and Google Docs.</li>
<li><strong>Video Chat:</strong> use <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi</a>, avoid Zoom. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above are just a few examples, these choices will depend on your own needs. At first, you might find them strange, but experience tells me that soon enough you will get used to them and discover they are superior in many ways.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 3–5 minutes</em></p>
<h2>7. Adopt better habits</h2>
<p>I’m already a few minutes over budget, but hey, privacy is hard to achieve nowadays. </p>
<p>For this last point, the lesson is that you must be careful with the information you share and make use of GDPR to control when someone is overstepping.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips, just for you to get an idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t provide your personal data just because they ask (input random data if you think it will not be necessary).</li>
<li>Always reject cookies and disable data collection when websites show those annoying pop-ups. Look for the “reject all” button, they usually hide it.</li>
<li>Even if websites don’t prompt you about privacy settings, go to your account preferences and disable all data collection.</li>
<li>Use fake profiles / identities.</li>
<li>When too much information is needed, and you don’t see the point, search for other alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main message is: Be cautious and strict with all the information you share online.</p>
<h2>Concluding</h2>
<p><strong>If you followed up to this point, you already made some good progress. However, this is the bare minimum and I only covered what to do on your personal computer, even though some of these suggestions will also work on your other devices (phone, tablet, etc.).</strong></p>
<p>I avoided suggesting tools, services and practices that would imply monetary costs for the reader, but depending on your needs they might be necessary.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is very hard not to be followed around by a “thousand companies and other entities”, specially when we carry a tracking device in our pockets, attached to our wrists, or <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">move around inside one of them</a>.</p>
<p>In case you want to dig deeper, there are a many sources online with more detailed guides on how to go a few steps further. As an example, you can check “<a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/">Privacy Guides</a>“.</p>
<p>Now, to end my post with a question (so I could also learn something new), what would you recommend differently? Would you add, remove or replace any of these suggestions? Don’t forget about the 30-minute rule. </p>

            <p>
              Recently at TigerBeetle,
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1157">we’ve decided</a>
              to use 128-bit integers to store all financial amounts and
              balances, retiring our previous use of 64-bit integers. While some
              may argue that a 64-bit integer, which can store integers ranging
              from zero to 2<sup>64</sup>, is enough to count the
              <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2012/09/17/161096233/which-is-greater-the-number-of-sand-grains-on-earth-or-stars-in-the-sky">grains of sand on Earth</a>, we realized we need to go beyond this limit if we want to be
              able to store all kinds of transactions adequately. Let’s
              find out why.
            </p>
            <h2 id="how-do-we-represent-money">How do we represent money?</h2>
            <p>
              To represent numbers (and to be able to do math with them),
              computers need to encode this number in a binary system which,
              depending on the range and the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number#Classification">kind</a>
              of number, requires a certain amount of bits (each bit can be
              either 0 or 1). For example, integers (whole numbers) ranging from
              -128 to 127 can be represented with only 8 bits, but if we
              don’t need negative numbers, we can use the same bits to
              represent any integer from 0 to 255, and that’s a byte!
              Larger numbers require more bits, for example, 16-bit, 32-bit, and
              64-bit numbers are the most common.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may have noticed that we are talking about money as whole
              numbers and not as decimal numbers or cents. Things get more
              complicated with fractional numbers, which can be encoded using
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">floating point</a>
              numbers. While binary floating point may be fine for other
              calculations, they
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_error_mitigation">cannot accurately express decimal numbers</a>. This is the same kind of problem that we humans have when we
              try to represent ⅓ in decimal as 0.33333…, computers have to
              represent ¹⁄₁₀ in binary!
            </p>

              As “fractions of a penny” add up over time to a lot, floating
              point is a

              <br>
            </small></p><p>
              Therefore, in TigerBeetle, we don’t use fractional or
              decimal numbers, every
              <a href="https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/accounts#ledger">ledger</a>
              is expressed as multiples of a minimal
              <a href="https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/recipes/fractional-amounts">integer factor</a>
              defined by the user. For example, you can represent Dollars as a
              multiple of cents, and then a $1.00 transaction can be described
              as 100 cents. Even
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency">non-decimal currency systems</a>
              can be
              <a href="https://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/learning/learning-zone/going-decimal/old-money/">better represented</a>
              as a multiple of a common factor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Surprisingly, we also don’t use negative numbers (you may
              have encountered software ledgers that store only a single
              positive/negative balance). Instead, we keep two separate strictly
              positive integer amounts:
              <a href="https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/design/data-modeling#debits-vs-credits">one for debits and another for credits</a>. This not only avoids the burden of dealing with negative
              numbers (such as the myriad of language-specific wraparound
              consequences of overflow… or underflow), but most of all
              preserves information by showing the volume of transactions with
              respect to ever-increasing balances for both the debit and credit
              sides. When you need to take the net balance, the two balances can
              be subtracted accordingly and the net displayed as a single
              positive or negative number.

              So, why do we need 128-bit integers?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Back to the example of representing $1.00 as 100 cents. In this
              case, 64-bit integers can count to something close to 184.5
              quadrillion dollars. While it may not be an issue for many people,
              the upper limit of a 64-bit integer becomes restrictive when there
              is a need to represent values smaller than a cent. Adding more
              decimal places
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/986">dramatically reduces</a>
              this range.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the same reason,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency">digital currencies</a>
              are another use case for 128-bit balances, where again, the
              smallest quantity of money can be represented on the order of
              micro-cents (10<sup>-6</sup>)… or
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ether">even smaller</a>. Although it’s a compelling use case for TigerBeetle to support,
              we found a variety of other applications that also benefit from
              128-bit balances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s think some more about scenarios where $0.01 is too big
              to represent the value of something.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in many countries, the price of a gallon/liter of
              gasoline requires three digits after the decimal point, and stock
              markets
              <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/subpenny612faq.htm">already require</a>
              pricing increments of hundredths of cents like 0.0001.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or, in an economy of high-frequency
              <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.micropaymentsimpactonnpaymentsecosystem202308~bb92cda8ce.en.pdf">micropayments</a>, greater precision and scale are also required. Sticking with
              64-bit values would impose artificial limits on real-world
              demands, or force applications to handle different scales of the
              same currency in separate ledgers, by painstakingly splitting
              amounts across multiple “Dollar” and
              “Micro-Dollar” accounts, only because a single 64-bit
              balance isn’t enough to cover the entire range of precision
              and scale required for many micropayments to represent a
              multi-billion Dollar deal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The value of a database that can count well (and at scale) is also
              not limited to money. TigerBeetle is designed to count not only
              money, but anything that can be modeled using double-entry
              accounting. For instance, to count inventory items, the frequency
              of API calls, or even kilowatts of electricity. And none of those
              things need to behave like money or be constrained to the same
              limits.
            </p>
            <h2 id="future-proof-accounting">Future-proof accounting.</h2>
            <p>
              Another thing about the upper limits of amounts and balances, is
              that, while it may seem unlikely for a single transaction amount
              to exceed the order of magnitude of trillions or quadrillions,
              account balances accumulate over time. For long-running systems,
              it’s likely that an account could transact such volume over
              the years, and so then a single transfer must also be able to move
              this entire balance from one account to another. This was a gotcha
              we ran into, as we considered whether to move to 128-bit
              transaction amounts and/or only 128-bit account balances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, even the most unexpected events such as
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a>
              can push a currency toward the upper limits of a 64-bit integer,
              requiring it to abandon the cents and cut the zeros that have no
              practical use.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              We may not be able to intuit how big a 128-bit integer is. Not
              merely twice the 64-bit; it’s actually 2<sup>64</sup> times
              bigger! To put this in perspective, a 64-bit integer is not enough
              to handle that One Hundred Trillion Dollar bill if we encode our
              ledger at a micro-cent scale. However, using 128-bit integers we
              should be able to perform 1 million transfers per second of the
              same value for a thousand years and still not hit the account
              balance limit.

              Modern processor architectures such as x86-64 and ARM64 can handle
              arithmetic operations involving 64-bit values, but, if we
              understand correctly, they don’t always have a specific
              instruction set for native 128-bit calculations. When dealing with
              128-bit operands, the task may have to be segmented into 64-bit
              portions that the CPU can execute. Consequently, we considered
              whether 128-bit arithmetic may be more demanding compared to the
              single-instruction execution possible with 64-bit integers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The table below compares the x86_64
              <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/oosed6j81">machine code generated</a>
              for 64-bit and 128-bit operands. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be
              an assembly expert to get the point! Just note that the compiler
              can optimize most operations into a sequence of trivial CPU
              instructions, such as
              <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/adc">carry sum</a> and
              <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sbb">borrowing subtraction</a>. This means that the cost overhead of using 128-bit amounts is
              not material for TigerBeetle.

              1. For simplicity, this assembly code omits the checked arithmetic
              bounds checks and panics that we
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3WYdYyjek4">always enable for TigerBeetle</a>.<br>
              2. 128-bit division cannot be expressed as a sequence of 64-bit
              instructions and needs to be implemented
              <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/master/lib/builtins/udivmodti4.c">by software</a>.<br>
            </small></p><p>
              Something else we had to consider as part of this change were all
              our clients, since TigerBeetle needs to expose its API to many
              different programming languages that don’t always support
              128-bit integers. The mainstream languages
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle#clients">we provide clients for</a>, currently need to use arbitrary-precision integers (aka
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">BigInteger</a>) to do math with 128-bit integers. The sole exception is .Net
              which recently
              <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67151">added support for Int128 and UInt128 data types</a>
              in .Net 7.0 (kudos to the DotNet team!).
            </p>
            <p>
              Utilizing BigIntegers comes with additional overhead because they
              are not handled as fixed-size 128-bit values but are instead
              heap-allocated as variable-length byte arrays. Also, arithmetic
              operations are emulated by software during runtime, which means
              they can’t take much advantage of the optimizations that
              would be possible if the compiler knew the kind of number it’s
              dealing with. Hey,
              <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/">Java</a>,
              <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9455">Go</a>, and
              even
              <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-7-generic-math/#types-without-language-support">C#</a>, I’m looking at you.
            </p>
            <p>
              To mitigate this cost on the client side (and, of course, to stay
              true to our
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/DESIGN.md#performance">TigerStyle</a>), we store and expose all 128-bit values (e.g. IDs, amounts,
              etc.) as just a pair of stack-allocated 64-bit integers (except
              for JavaScript, since it does not support 64-bit numbers either).
              Although the programming language has no knowledge of this raw
              type and can’t perform arithmetic operations on them, we
              offer a set of helper functions for converting between idiomatic
              alternatives existing in each ecosystem (e.g., BigInteger, byte
              array, UUID).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our API is designed to be non-intrusive, giving each application
              the freedom to choose between using BigIntegers or handling
              128-bit values through any third-party numerical library that
              makes the most sense. We want to provide excellent
              high-performance low-level primitives, as far as possible, with a
              minimum of “sugar”, without taking away from the
              freedom of the user at a higher layer.
            </p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              TigerBeetle is designed for a new era where financial transactions
              are more precise and more frequent. A new era that has already
              begun and is full of everyday-life examples that 64-bit balances
              ‘ought to be enough!’ for not much longer. To
              128-bit… and beyond!

<p>What the group’s members didn’t realize at the time, is that the plans they made would create a ripple effect that still has an impact decades later.</p>
<p>Like many other people mesmerized by the unbridled ability to share files over the Internet, the new BitTorrent protocol caught Piratbyrån’s eye. From one thing came another, and Piratbyrån decided to start their own tracker. </p>
<h2>A Swedish Torrent Tracker</h2>
<p>When this idea was first brought up isn’t clear, not even to the site’s founders, but at the end of 2003 The Pirate Bay was presented to the public. </p>
<p>“We have opened a BitTorrent tracker – The Pirate Bay. From there, you can download and share games, movies, discs, TV shows and more,” the short <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127001634/http://www.piratbyran.org/index.php?view=viewcomments&amp;type=news&amp;cid=62">announcement reads</a>, translated from Swedish.</p>
<center><strong>A New Torrent Tracker</strong></center><br><center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg" alt="tpb announcement" width="600" height="321" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg 1079w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20321'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg 1079w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb-300x160.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg"></center>
<p>One of the group’s unwritten goals was to offer a counterweight to the propaganda being spread by local anti-piracy outfit Antipiratbyrån. The pro-culture group saw sharing as something positive instead, and a file-sharing website would surely bring this point across.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay first came online in Mexico where Gottfrid Svartholm, aka Anakata, hosted the site on a server owned by the company he was working for at the time.</p>
<p>After a few months, the site moved to Sweden where it was hosted on a Pentium III 1GHz laptop with 256MB RAM. This one machine, which belonged to Fredrik Neij, aka TiAMO, kept the site online and included a fully operational tracker. </p>
<p>This early setup was quite primitive, as <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/early-tpb.jpg">shown here</a>, and some of the hardware was later <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/first-pirate-bay-server-on-permanent-display-in-computer-museum-130110/">put on display</a> at the Computer Museum in Linköping.</p>
<center><strong>The Pirate Bay server</strong><br></center><center><img width="525" height="418" decoding="async" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb-laptop1.jpg" alt="tpb classic" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20525%20418'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb-laptop1.jpg"></center>
<p>Piratbyrån initially planned to create the first public file-sharing network in Sweden but, in the years that followed, the site grew out to become a global file-sharing icon.</p>
<p>While The Pirate Bay team was proud of this success, it was not without consequences. Initially, various takedown messages from copyright holders were met with mocking responses, but the legal pressure became a heavy burden. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the US Government applied <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-us-pushed-sweden-to-take-down-the-pirate-bay-171212/">pressure on Sweden</a>, urging the country do something about the taunting pirate site. At the same time, the site’s founders noticed that they were being shadowed by private investigators, who smelled blood. </p>
<h2>The Raid</h2>
<p>The pressure eventually reached its first peak when The Pirate Bay’s infrastructure was raided. </p>
<p>May 31, 2006, less than three years after The Pirate Bay was founded, 65 Swedish police officers <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-piratebay-is-down-raided-by-the-swedish-police/">entered a datacenter</a> in Stockholm. The policemen had instructions to shut down the Pirate Bay’s servers, and that’s exactly what they did.</p>
<center><strong>Footage from The Pirate Bay raid</strong><br></center><center></center>
<p>For most pirate sites the road would end there, but The Pirate Bay was no ordinary site, and it wasn’t planning to cave in just yet. </p>
<p>Shortly before the raid began, Gottfrid noticed some unusual activity. He warned Fredrik who, as a precaution, decided to make a backup. This turned out to be a pivotal moment in the site’s history. Because of this backup, Fredrik and the rest of the Pirate Bay team managed to resurrect the site within three days.</p>
<p>Instead of hiding in the shadows, Pirate Bay’s spokesperson Peter Sunde, aka Brokep, told the world that The Pirate Bay wasn’t going anywhere. </p>
<p>This swift and defiant comeback turned the site’s founders into heroes for many. The site made headline news around the world and in Stockholm, people were waving pirate flags in the streets, a sentiment that benefited the newly founded Pirate Party as well. </p>
<h2>The Turning Point</h2>
<p>There was also a major downside, however. The raid was the start of a criminal investigation, which led to a spectacular trial, and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founders-prison-sentences-final-supreme-court-appeal-rejected-120201/">prison sentences</a> for several of the site’s founders.</p>
<p><strong>Pirate Bay supporters at the first day in Court</strong><img width="475" height="344" decoding="async" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-flags1.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20475%20344'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-flags1.jpg"></p>
<p>This became another turning point. Many of the early Piratbyrån members cut their ties with the site. Gottfrid, Fredrik and Peter also left the ship, which was handed over to a more anonymous group ostensibly located in the Seychelles. </p>
<p>The outspokenness of the early years eventually gave way to the silent treatment. While the site’s moderators are easy to reach nowadays, the people (Winston) who pull the strings at the top remain behind the scenes at all times. </p>
<p>This was made quite obvious when the site disappeared for weeks following another raid at a Stockholm datacenter <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/swedish-police-raid-the-pirate-bay-site-offline-141209/">in 2014</a>. At the time, even the site’s staffers had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay eventually recovered from this second raid too, but by then something had clearly changed. The torrent site now seems content with just being there. </p>
<p>Over the years the site simplified its setup by removing the tracker, introducing <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-dumps-torrents-120228/">magnet links</a>, and further decentralizing its setup. The ability to comment was also sacrificed at some point, and user registrations were closed for years, although there’s some <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-reopens-its-doors-to-new-members-after-four-years-230628/#:~:text=Manually%20Approved%20Registrations&amp;text=New%20Pirate%20Bay%20registrations%20are,accounts%20using%20a%20new%20tool.">progress on that front</a> now.</p>
<h2>The Mods and Admins</h2>
<p>Today’s manual user registrations are processed by a dedicated moderator team, which also ensures that the site remains free of spam and malware. This team of volunteers is separate from the site’s ‘operator’ and many have been in that role for over a decade.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Pirate Bay admin Spud17 posted a <a href="https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-The-Pirate-Bay-is-20-years-old-today">message</a> in the Pirate Bay forum to celebrate the 20th anniversary. </p>
<p>“Most of the current TPB Crew have been here for well over 10 years, many for much, much longer, and we’re proud to be associated with the world’s most iconic torrent site,” she notes. </p>
<p>“We volunteer our time freely to help keep the site clean, nuking the fakes and malware to kingdom come, and help edit/move/delete torrents as and when uploaders request help in the forum’s Account Issues subforum.”</p>
<h2>Crypto Miner and Token</h2>
<p>After two decades, TPB still manages to make headlines on occasion. For example, when yet another country orders Internet providers to block the site, or when it suddenly decides to ‘deploy’ its users to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-website-runs-a-cryptocurrency-miner-170916/">mine cryptocurrency</a>. </p>
<p>The last major project was announced in 2021 when The Pirate Bay released its very own <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-promotes-mysterious-piratetoken-tpb-210513/">‘crypto’ token</a> out of the blue. There was no official whitepaper for these PirateTokens, but the torrent site envisioned the ‘coin’ being used to access VIP content or donate to uploaders.</p>
<p>These plans never came to fruition and the token price soon entered a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bays-crypto-token-is-barely-alive-after-just-one-year-220515/">freefall</a>. After a few months, the official token announcement disappeared from the site as well, leaving token holders with worthless digital memorabilia.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay itself isn’t going anywhere it seems. The events listed above are really just a fraction of events spanning 20 extraordinary years. The question now is whether the site will survive until its 25th anniversary.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Lichess is safe, because it is free of ads and trackers.</strong></p>

<p>But browsing the rest of the  Internet exposes us to the following threats:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Advertisement</strong> sells our screen estate and influences us</li>

<li><strong>Tracking</strong> sells our personal information to increase advertisement effectiveness</li>

</ul>

<p>These don't benefit us, the website users, in any way. In fact, they use a lot of our computing power and bandwidth against us.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are simple and legal ways to protect ourselves from these invasions.</p>

<h2>Protect your computer</h2>

<h3><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a></h3>

<p>Hands-down the best ad-blocking <strong>browser extension</strong>. It's free software (GPLv3), blazing fast, and will effectively block most malware. We heartily recommend that everyone installs it. uBlock is available for most browsers on Windows, MacOS and Linux. <strong><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">Install it now!</a></strong></p>

<p>Note that other browser extensions, such as the popular "AdBlock", are unsafe: they have accepted money to expose you to some ads. Don't fall for it, just use uBlock Origin instead.</p>

<h3><a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a></h3>

<p>This is a DNS server that can block ads and trackers throughout the <strong>whole system</strong>. This includes video ads and ads in your favorite apps, browsers and games. It can be used as a replacement or, better, a complement of uBlock Origin.</p>

<p>It's very easy to set up, <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html#instruction">check out the instructions on the AdGuard website</a> on how to do this.</p>

<h3>Custom hosts file (advanced)</h3>

<p>An alternative to AdGuard for system-wide blocking is to directly manage your <em>hosts </em>file. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/readme.md">list of dangerous hosts to block</a>, with links to raw hosts files available. To modify your current&nbsp;hosts&nbsp;file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text editor.</p>

<h4>Where to find your hosts file:</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-the-Hosts-File-on-a-Mac">mac OS</a> (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave), iOS, Android, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/">Linux</a></strong>:&nbsp;/etc/hosts</li>

<li><strong>macOS Catalina (10.15+):</strong>&nbsp;/private/etc/hosts</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-the-Hosts-File-on-Windows">Windows</a></strong>:&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</li>

</ul>

<h2>Protect your Android device</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/">personalDNSfilter</a></h3>

For instance, you could ask Bard to start a trip planning Doc for you and your friends, draft up your online marketplace listing, or help explain a science topic to your kids. And now, Bard is getting even better at customizing its responses so you can easily bring your ideas to life.</p><p data-block-key="5hbk4">Today we’re rolling out Bard’s most capable model yet. Bard now integrates with Google apps and services for more helpful responses. We’ve also improved the “Google it” feature to double-check Bard’s answers and expanded features to more places.</p><h2 data-block-key="bj6re">Connect to Google apps and services</h2><p data-block-key="6mbo3">Today we’re launching <a href="https://youtu.be/lr87yrvK86w">Bard Extensions</a> in English, a completely new way to interact and collaborate with Bard. With Extensions, Bard can find and show you relevant information from the Google tools you use every day — like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Google Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and hotels — even when the information you need is across multiple apps and services.</p><p data-block-key="2bch5">For example, if you’re planning a trip to the Grand Canyon (a project that takes up many tabs), you can now ask Bard to grab the dates that work for everyone from Gmail, look up real-time flight and hotel information, see Google Maps directions to the airport, and even watch YouTube videos of things to do there — all within one conversation.</p></div>

If you choose to use the Workspace extensions, your content from Gmail, Docs and Drive is not seen by human reviewers, used by Bard to show you ads or used to train the Bard model. And of course, you’re always in control of your privacy settings when deciding how you want to use these extensions, and you can turn them off at any time.</p><h2 data-block-key="cdea1">Easily double-check responses and build on shared conversations</h2><p data-block-key="7udaq">Starting today with responses in English, you can use Bard’s “Google it” button to more easily double-check its answers. When you click on the “G” icon, Bard will read the response and evaluate whether there is content across the web to substantiate it. When a statement can be evaluated, you can click the highlighted phrases and learn more about supporting or contradicting information found by Search.</p></div>

I share that sentiment, yet sometimes people take this idea too religiously.</p><p>First, what is a native app? It’s an app built using the native frameworks of a platform. For MacOS it could be SwiftUI. Such apps leverage the native platform’s interface, including windows, buttons, text areas, and everything else. They look right and familiar, and they behave this way. And most of the time, they’re smooth and fast. Historically, this has been the way to build applications for any platform.</p><p>But the Web has advanced so much from the early pages with hyperlinks that it’s now a platform for applications. Modern JavaScript runtimes, reactive frameworks (e.g. React), and platform APIs allow developers to use web technologies to build apps running on desktop operating systems. And this has largely become the preferred way to create new apps by now. If you use Slack, Notion, Spotify, or Todoist, then you’ve seen it. Their desktop applications are effectively just wrappers, usually built with a technology called Electron (Spotify isn’t though). And people <a href="https://www.hendrik-erz.de/post/electron-bloated-web-and-trade-offs">hate</a> Electron.</p><p>Here are the main problems people point out in web apps.</p><p>***</p><h3 id="memory-consumption">Memory consumption</h3><p>Each Electron app basically carries a large part of Google Chrome in it and has to keep it running. Naturally, this isn’t great for memory consumption. Of course, Notion is a complex app by itself, but in comparison, the native app for Apple Notes usually takes around just 120Mb for me.</p><p><img src="https://molodtsov.me/images/cleanshot-2023-08-28-at-22.29.16-2x.png" alt="Activity Monitor"></p><p>This particular problem is impossibly difficult to solve. In fact, you might save a bit of resources by simply running all the same apps in your browser, since it will at least be able to share some resources and offload tabs when they’re needed.</p><h3 id="they-might-be-slow">They might be slow</h3><p>Electron apps are known to be slow. There are just too many levels, and JavaScrip is an interpreted language, not a compiled one, so by default, it will be orders of magnitude slower than an app written in Swift, Rust, or C++.</p><p>Still, in my experience, this isn’t necessarily the defining characteristic of a web app. Superhuman is insanely quick. Todoist is also seamless enough. While VS Code is sluggish, it still performs better than Atom did. Unfortunately, such apps are rare exceptions. Yes, the foundations are indeed slower, but at least some people are capable of writing quick web apps.</p><p>Feel free to share positive examples you’re aware of.</p><h3 id="they-have-unique-ui">They have unique UI</h3><p>Since web apps can’t just use the components provided by the operating system, they have to <a href="https://linear.app/blog/invisible-details">recreate everything from scratch</a>. And this creates a lot of burden for developers and, I think, lowers the quality floor. Creating beautiful, compelling apps is possible, but it requires so much work. People building native apps get it all “<em>for free</em>”. In fact, this could be one of the reasons Apple still has such a vibrant ecosystem of great artisanal apps since developers can build most things out of nice ready-made components.</p><p>This also means users often must learn your app’s UI instead of relying on their muscle memory.</p><p>***</p><p>I’ve been focusing on desktop, but the same is happening on mobile, albeit at a smaller scale. Tools like React Native allow developers to build apps for iOS and Android. I’d say the “<em>experience gap</em>” is a bit larger on mobile. Notion famously <a href="https://www.notion.so/releases/2022-07-20">started</a> introducing more native components in their app, which instantly made it quicker and nicer to use. Still, their apps are largely web-based, which limits their functionality. For instance, it’s quite difficult to implement complete offline mode (Notion caches recently seen pages but nothing else).</p><p>Basecamp has a particularly <a href="https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/basecamp-3-for-ios-hybrid-architecture-afc071589c25">good visual example</a> of how this works, even though they use quite a “<em>basic</em>” approach.</p><p>***</p><p>Web apps are here to stay. There are fewer and fewer artisanal Mac apps these days, even though sometimes a jewel appears out of thin air, as it happened with <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a>. Quite unusually, they have native apps for all of Apple’s platforms <em>and</em> a web app with the same functionality, which is useful for people on Windows, ChromeOS, or Linux.</p><p>Native apps do feel great. But they have their own challenges. The first and the most important one is making them cross-platform. If you’re a small developer, you might not have enough resources for this. And if you’re a big company, you don’t want to struggle to keep all your apps’ development in sync. Building a web app and wrapping it with Electron ends up being the most reasonable approach for most people.</p><p>So most of the time, our choice isn’t between native and web apps. You either have that useful app or you don’t because it didn’t make much sense for the developer. And while I like native apps and enjoy them when I have such an option, I’d rather have a web app than nothing.</p><p>If I use the app all the time, I’d want it to be at least quick (and ideally, native). But if I need it occasionally, I’d be OK with pretty much anything, as long as it’s useful and there’s nothing better. Also, we have seen evidence it’s humanly possible to build quick web apps. The fact most people don’t bother is a different question.</p></section></article><div id="subscribe"><p>If you liked this post, subscribe to get new content right in your inbox!</p></div><div><h2>Read More</h2><ul id="post-list"><li><a href="https://molodtsov.me/2023/09/basecamp-is-a-contrarian-marketing-operation/">Basecamp is a Contrarian Marketing Operation</a><p>Basecamp is well-known not because of its product but because its founders heavily leverage marketing and communications, eventually turning into contrarian marketing machines producing edgy posts and starting crusades just to get everyone’s attention.</p></li><li><a href="https://molodtsov.me/2023/08/sorry-but-google-meet-is-better-than-zoom/">Sorry, But Google Meet Is Better Than Zoom</a><p>It seems that we're finally getting out of this weird period of collective gaslighting where people tried to convince everyone Zoom was the best conference app out there.</p></li><li><a href="https://molodtsov.me/2023/08/finalist-a-simpler-to-do-app/">Finalist: A Simpler To-do App</a><p>Finalist is built for people who liked keeping all their tasks in Apple Notes but wanted it just a bit more structured.</p></li><li><a href="https://molodtsov.me/2023/08/omnivore-review-an-underrated-read-later-app/">Omnivore Review: An Underrated Read-Later App</a><p>I sometimes see people using Pocket, Instapaper, or Safari’s Reading List even though all of them have been practically abandoned and the first two definitely don’t deserve a subscription.

        <p>When you move in Berlin, you must <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin">register your address</a>. This involves filling a paper form and delivering it in person&nbsp;–&nbsp;by appointment only&nbsp;–&nbsp;to the Bürgeramt. This is called the <em>Anmeldung</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Anmeldung</em> form sucks. It sucked 8 years ago and it sucks now. It’s ambiguous and confusing and I hate it, so I made a better one.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/anmeldung">You can try it here.</a></strong></p>

<p>It’s an actual web form, not a PDF. It works on your phone. It supports autofill, numeric keyboards, field validation, autocomplete, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility tools, etc.</p>
<p>I designed it to <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/think-of-the-form-as-a-conversation">feel more like a conversation</a>, and less like being interrogated by a blunt bureaucrat. The form adapts to your answers and gives helpful instructions. The web is a great medium. We can do more than put a paper sheet on the internet.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung web form" height="1260" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.png" width="1620"></picture>
<p>I added a dedicated step for <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox">“c/o” addresses</a>. German apartments don’t have apartment numbers. If your name is not on your mailbox, postal workers can’t deliver your mail. If you can’t put your name on your mailbox, you must add “c/o” to your address. This is officially allowed, but it’s covered neither by the official form, nor by the official instructions.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung form filler with instructions" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png" title="Using words to explain stuff.

<p>The Bürgeramt also wants to know that you live on the second floor on the right. That’s not clearly stated on the form (it’s the “Zusätze” in “Straße, Hausnummer, Zusätze”). People leave that out, so they get asked (in German) during their appointment.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-building-details.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-building-details.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-building-details.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="The &quot;building details&quot; form field" height="184" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-building-details.png" width="1608"></picture>
<p>At the end, you can download the form. You also get a few options like booking an appointment or hiring help.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-last-step.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-last-step.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-last-step.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Last step of the Anmeldung form filler" height="1724" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-last-step.png" width="1612"></picture>
<p>The form can only fit two people. If you register your whole family, you must fill the same form multiple times. This tool handles it for you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-multiple-form.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Option to download multiple forms" height="794" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-multiple-form.png" width="1610"></picture>
<p>These are small details that make a big difference for immigrants registering their address for the first time.</p>
<p>I also made a few small quality of life improvement: using the browser’s language to suggest the user’s country, focusing on the right fields when moving between form stages, and a few other niceties. It’s subtle, but it adds up to a nice user experience.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>Everything happens in your browser. Your personal information never leaves your computer. </p>
<h2 id="how-its-made">How it’s made</h2>
<p>It’s a simple VueJS component, like <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/tools">all the other tools</a> on All About Berlin.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">PDFLib</a> to fill the form in the browser. While the user is filling the form, I download the empty PDF form and the JS library in the background. When they click “save form”, it happens instantly. It feels unnaturally snappy.</p>
<h3 id="culture-sniffing">Culture sniffing</h3>
<p>I use <code>navigator.languages</code> to get a list of supported languages. For example, <code>en-CA</code>, <code>fr-CA</code>, <code>de-DE</code>. This gives me a list of countries the user <em>might</em> have lived in. I suggest those countries at the top of the country list.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-country-picker.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-country-picker.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-country-picker.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-country-picker.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-country-picker.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-country-picker.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="List of countries with suggested countries" height="460" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-country-picker.png" width="1616"></picture>
<p>This is a technique I first used with the <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/currency-tooltips">currency tooltips</a>. It lets you guess a user’s culture when the cost of getting it wrong is low.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>I’d like to digitalize more forms. The <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/010250-antrag-auf-vergabe-einer-steuerlichen-id">tax ID request form</a> is a solid contender, as the original design is offensively bad. The <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/abmeldung">Abmeldung</a> form would also be useful.</p>
<h3 id="faxes-and-snail-mail">Faxes and snail mail</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a printer, I could mail the form to you. It costs <span>0.85</span>€ to mail a letter through the LetterXPress API. You could get the filled form in a few days, then bring it to your appointment.</p>
<p>I could digitalize other forms, and fax them through the Simple Fax API. It costs <span>0.07</span>€ to fax a page. This would let you complete some bureaucratic tasks “fully digitally” a decade before the government gets there.</p>
<p>Anachronistic problems demand anachronistic solutions!</p>
<h3 id="go-fully-digital">Go fully digital</h3>
<p>Or why not skip paper entirely? During COVID, we filled information online, and showed a QR code at the test centre. Why can’t the Bürgeramt have that? Even with in-person appointments, a QR code or a short URL would make paper forms entirely unnecessary.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>Computer hackers and users from across the world will celebrate GNU's
anniversary with special events. These include a specially convened
<a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">GNU Hackers Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</a> and a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for
hackers of any skill level at the FSF's headquarters in Boston, MA.</p>
<p>On September 27, 1983, a computer scientist named Richard Stallman
announced the plan to develop a free software Unix-like operating
system called <a href="https://gnu.org/">GNU</a>, for "GNU's not Unix." GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom, and has remained true to its founding ideals for forty
years. Since 1983, the GNU Project has provided a full, ethical
replacement for proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>When describing GNU's history and the background behind its initial
announcement, Stallman (often known simply as "RMS") <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>,
"with a free operating system, we could again have a community of
cooperating hackers -- and invite anyone to join. And anyone would be
able to use a computer without starting out by conspiring to deprive
his or her friends."</p>
<p>"When we look back at the history of the free software movement -- or
the idea that users should be in control of their own computing -- it
starts with GNU," said Zoë Kooyman, executive director of the FSF,
which sponsors GNU's development. "The GNU System isn't just the most
widely used operating system that is based on free software. GNU is
also at the core of a philosophy that has guided the free software
movement for forty years."</p>
<p>Usually combined with the kernel Linux, GNU forms the backbone of the
Internet and powers millions of servers, desktops, and embedded
computing devices. Aside from its technical advancements, GNU
pioneered the concept of "copyleft," the approach to software
licensing that requires the same rights to be preserved in derivative
works, and is best exemplified by the GNU General Public License
(GPL). As Stallman <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>, "The goal of GNU was to give users
freedom, not just to be popular. So we needed to use distribution
terms that would prevent GNU software from being turned into
proprietary software. The method we use is called 'copyleft.'"</p>
<p>The free software community has held strong for forty years and
continues to grow, as exemplified by the FSF's annual <a href="https://libreplanet.org/conference">LibrePlanet</a>
conference on software freedom and digital ethics.</p>
<p>Kooyman continues, "we hope that the fortieth anniversary will inspire
hackers, both old and new, to join GNU in its goal to create, improve,
and share free software around the world. Software is controlling our
world these days, and GNU is a critique and solution to the status quo
that we desperately need in order to not have our technology control
us."</p>
<h3>GNU Hacker's Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</h3>
<p>On September 27, GNUnet e.V. is celebrating GNU's fortieth anniversary
with a <a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">hacker meeting</a> in Switzerland, which will feature
presentations about various GNU packages, hacking, and making new
releases. Among the speakers are Richard Stallman, the founder of GNU;
Free Software Award winner Sébastien Blin of GNU Jami; the president
of the Free Software Foundation Europe, Matthias Kirschner; and
several GNU webmasters.</p>
<h3>Hackday at the FSF Headquarters</h3>
<p>In honor of GNU's fortieth anniversary, its organizational sponsor the
FSF is organizing a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for families, students, and anyone
interested in celebrating GNU's anniversary. It will be held at the
FSF's offices in Boston, MA on October 1.</p>
<h3>About the Free Software Foundation</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to
promoting computer users' right to run, edit, share, contribute to,
and redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development
and use of free (as in freedom) software -- particularly the GNU
operating system and its GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation
for free software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the
ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software, and
its Web sites, located at <a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org</a> and <a href="https://gnu.org/">https://gnu.org</a>, are
an important source of information about GNU/Linux. Donations to
support the FSF's work can be made at <a href="https://donate.fsf.org/">https://donate.fsf.org</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the FSF, as well as important information for
journalists and publishers, is at <a href="https://www.fsf.org/press">https://www.fsf.org/press</a>.</p>
<h3>About the GNU Operating System and Linux</h3>
<p>Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a
free software Unix-like operating system called GNU. GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for
one, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under
the GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux
formed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for
the first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination
is the GNU/Linux system. For more explanation, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                        <p><strong>When should you use someone's family name first? And is Kim a first name or a last name? The Asia Media Centre looks at naming conventions in Asia.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Japan’s foreign minister has called on overseas media to refer to the country’s prime minister as<a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/05/624f6d022f34-foreign-minister-to-ask-media-to-switch-order-of-japanese-names.html" target="_blank"> “Abe Shinzo”, instead of “Shinzo Abe”.</a></p><p>Foreign Minister Kono Taro (whom we would usually refer to in English as Taro Kono) wants reporters to write Japanese names in the East Asian style, which is to put the family name before the given name. This convention is already widely used when referring to other Asian leaders, such as China’s President Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>For those who are used to the western convention, the format has been known to cause confusion. Last year, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was left red-faced after he referred to the North Korean leader as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/oops-mike-pompeo-refers-to-north-korean-leader-kim-as-chairman-un.html" target="_blank">“Chairman Un”</a> — which would be a bit like calling President Donald Trump, “President Don”. Meanwhile, President Xi is often mistakenly referred to as “Mr. Jinping.”</p><p>It’s good to be aware that naming conventions differ throughout Asia. In some countries, the family name is king, while in others, calling someone by their given name is the polite thing to do. The Asia Media Centre has put together a rough style guide that can act as a rule of thumb when it comes to using Asian names in your reporting.</p><p>Please note this list is not exhaustive — and keep in mind that in all cases, the person’s preference is the most important thing to consider. If in doubt, just ask!</p><h3>JAPAN</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Family name, given name. Eg. Kondo Marie.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Kondo.</p><h3>CHINA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Family name, given name. Eg: Xi Jinping.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Xi.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Most Chinese family names consist of one syllable.<span>&nbsp;If you see a three-syllable Chinese name, you can be confident that the two-syllable name is the given name, and the one-syllable name is the family name. But in cases where the person has two one-syllable names, it can be impossible to tell which should be the first and last name. Eg. Wang Yang.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>SOUTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Family name, given name. Eg: Moon Jae-in; Kim Jong-un.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Moon; Kim.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Like Chinese names, most Korean family names are single-syllable. Most given names have two syllables, often joined with a hyphen. Also note that Kim is the most common surname in the Korean Peninsula, so if referring to more than one "Kim" in a story it can be helpful to write the names out in full.</p><h3>INDIA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Depends on region. In northern India, it is typical to follow the western convention of given name, family name. Eg. Narendra Modi.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Modi.</p><p>In southern India, some communities follow a more complex naming system. A typical pattern is: Village name, father’s name, given name, caste name. Initials are often used to shorten the name. Eg. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. It is common for the given name to be spelled out in full. It is also common for Indians in the south to use their caste names as surnames.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Either given name or caste name. Eg. Kalam.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Sikhs tend to use Singh (males) and Kaur (females) as surnames.</p><h3>SRI LANKA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Depends on ethnic group. Sinhalese names are often comprised of three or more components, including: father’s name, given name, family name. Eg. Pallewatte Gamaralalage Yapa Maithripala Yapa Sirisena (usually shortened to Maithripala Sirisena).</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Sirisena.</p><p>The Tamil community usually uses two names: Father’s name, given name. The father’s name is often represented by an initial, with the given name written in full. Eg. V. Rudrakumaran.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Rudrakumaran.</p><h3>PAKISTAN</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name, family name (or father’s name). Eg. Imran Khan.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Khan.</p><h3>MALAYSIA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name, father’s name. Eg. Mahathir Mohamad.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Mahathir. &nbsp;</p><h3>THAILAND</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name, family name. Eg. Thaksin Shinawatra.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Thaksin.</p><h3>INDONESIA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name/names, sometimes (but not always) followed by a family name. Eg. Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Prabowo.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Many Indonesians have only one name. Eg. Suharto. Nicknames are also commonly used. Eg.
