            <pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 06:06:08 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.lohr.dev/embedded-rust">https://blog.lohr.dev/embedded-rust</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41834662">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>When I mention that we use Rust on the embedded ESP32 platform the most common reaction is a jaw-dropping "This is possible?!". Yes, it is indeed possible! - And we at STABL Energy have used it successfully for over a year now. And because so many people seem interested in why we use Rust and how it is going for us, I decided to write this blog post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thanks to its direct access to both hardware and memory, Rust is well suited for embedded systems and bare-metal development." - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.blog/2023-08-30-why-rust-is-the-most-admired-language-among-developers/">GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It all started in 2022, with me getting annoyed by our C implementation of a small piece of software running on an ESP32 (a microcontroller with built-in internet connectivity). The purpose of the software was to read messages via UART (serial interface/protocol, often used to communicate between embedded devices) and send them to some cloud services via MQTT (messaging protocol, often used to communicate between IoT devices). Seems simple enough, right? Well, we had some additional requirements in terms of reliability, regarding the layout of the resulting JSON MQTT messages and concerning the content of the UART messages which is rather difficult to parse.</p>
<p>To give you some more context: I work for a startup named <a target="_blank" href="https://stabl.com/?ref=ml-blog">STABL Energy</a> where we build revolutionary energy storage systems, that are based on second-life batteries (batteries that were used in electric cars before). Instead of recycling them just now, we can use those perfectly fine batteries to (for example) back large PV farms and prolong their lives just a little bit more. The device I was talking about before is used to connect our battery storage systems to the cloud for monitoring and remote control. We also use it during development, to test new features in our system - so it really needs to be reliable, because we don't want to lose any data.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1706812711815/53a4d26a-2e21-486c-b052-245e017cd584.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Our C implementation was a small (very prototype) software running on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32">ESP32</a> platform. It had some serious runtime issues, preventing it from working reliably, that were hard to debug. And debugging on embedded is a lot more complicated than debugging software targeting desktop architectures. I have much respect for C (and even more for people programming in C), but I think its era is coming to an end. As I wrote in <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.lohr.dev/after-a-day-of-programming-in-zig">a previous blog post</a>, Zig could be a quite good modern replacement in the future. But Zig is rather new and at the time we worked with the C implementation, I didn't even know that Zig existed. However, I did a lot with Rust in personal projects at that time. The developer experience in Rust is just on the next level and the software you write is reliable without giving reliability, memory allocation etc. too much thought in the first place.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1706813402492/571c6001-33b8-4c77-a2d8-ec6cc95bd21c.webp?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>At STABL Energy, we didn't use any Rust before. We mainly used C for embedded and Python for anything else. But since I got to lead this project and had a great time with Rust, we ended up writing a prototype using <a target="_blank" href="https://esp-rs.github.io/book/overview/using-the-standard-library.html">ESP IDF</a>, which even allowed us to use the Rust standard library. Long story short: Our Rust prototype ended up much more reliable than the C implementation. We spent a little bit more time writing the software (Rust takes longer to write than C) to achieve the same functionality but spent basically zero time debugging (since there weren't that many bugs) - so we stuck with it. At that time the Rust support from Espressif (the company behind the ESP32) was rather new and experimental (and it still is), but it kept improving and we noticed quite the investment from Espressif in terms of work spent working on Rust support for their platform.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2024: We now used the ESP32 with our custom software written in Rust for over a year in production, with great success. The devices transmit data 24/7 and we have no known bugs (I don't even remember the last bug we had). There is just one problem: Who maintains and further develops this project? While there are some pretty passionate Rust developers (&amp; consultancies) out there (even in Germany) and even more that would be willing to learn Rust, it is not viable to hire one sole Rust developer for this (small) project. Since Rust, and especially embedded Rust (lots of FFI &amp; unsafe), is quite hard to learn, it is not viable (for us) to retrain a C developer to Rust. Luckily we <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Shemnei/">found a Rust developer</a> who was willing to learn C as well.</p>
<p>So what's the state of embedded Rust outside of our small project? Dion, from Tweedegolf, recently published <a target="_blank" href="https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/101/are-we-embedded-yet">a great article</a> about the current state: He says that what works and does not work heavily depends on the specific use case and willingness to build the missing pieces yourself or rely on open-source software. There are still some rough edges, as visualised in his infographic, but overall Rust is a viable programming language choice for embedded projects.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1706813382842/c04013ce-7a07-4e46-9bec-71c8d45b3ad7.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="The state of embedded Rust by https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/101/are-we-embedded-yet"></p>
<p>If, in the future, I were faced with a choice between C and Rust for embedded development again, I would most likely choose Rust because of how successfully we used it in the past. Let me know if you heard about some similar projects - I am always excited to hear about embedded Rust!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-6b87e69f=""><h2 id="why-pay-for-search" tabindex="-1">Why pay for search <a href="#why-pay-for-search" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why pay for search&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Search advertising is becoming increasingly aggressive and harder to distinguish from organic results. In 2022 alone, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/267056/paid-search-advertising-expenditure-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">search advertising spending</a> reached a staggering <strong>185.35 billion U.S. dollars</strong> worldwide, and this is forecast to grow by six percent annually until 2028, hitting nearly <strong>261 billion U.S. dollars</strong>.</p><p>This explosion in spending has directly contributed to the cluttering of search results with intrusive ads, slowing down the experience and making it harder for users to find what they’re looking for.</p><p>Beyond just the clutter, these ads are powered by invasive tracking technologies that follow users across the web, exploiting their data to maximize ad revenue.</p><p>This is where Kagi comes in. By charging a nominal fee for searches, Kagi ensures that its search results are faster, more accurate, and completely respectful of the user's privacy:</p><p><img src="https://help.kagi.com/assets/why_pay_for_search_kagi.c8abd60b.png" alt="Why_pay_for_search"></p><p>And when you pay for search, you’re supporting a product that doesn't need ad revenue or access to user data because it gets its support directly from its users.</p><p>By aligning our incentives with those of our users, Kagi is committed to building a <strong>better, more ethical web</strong>.</p><p>You can learn more in <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Age of PageRank is Over</a> post on our blog.</p><h2 id="ad-supported-search-engines-the-future-of-the-web" tabindex="-1">Ad-supported search engines &amp; the future of the web <a href="#ad-supported-search-engines-the-future-of-the-web" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ad-supported search engines &amp; the future of the web&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the early days of Google, in 1998, its founders emphasized the importance of maintaining an ad-free search engine:</p><blockquote><p>"<strong>The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users.</strong> ... <strong>we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.</strong>"</p><p>— <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine</a>, Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, 1998</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this is exactly how it played out, and over the last 20 years we proceeded to witness the <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">great detoriation of web and search</a> as a result. In many ways, Google made a pivot from "organizing the world's information" to "organizing the world's ads" and we believe that this leads to a sub-optimal experience for the end user.</p><h2 id="the-numbers-tell-a-tale" tabindex="-1">The numbers tell a tale <a href="#the-numbers-tell-a-tale" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The numbers tell a tale&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Ad based search engines make almost $300 a year off their users.</p><p>Google generated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/469821/google-annual-ad-revenue-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">$76 billion</a> in US ad revenue in 2023. Google had <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1001/google/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">274 million</a> unique visitors in the US as of February 2023.</p><p>To estimate the revenue per user, we can divide the 2023 US ad revenue by the 2023 number of users: $76 billion / 274 million = $277 revenue per user in the US or $23 USD per month, on average! That means there is someone, somewhere, a third party and a complete stranger, an advertiser, paying $23 per month for your searches.</p><p>Choosing to subscribe to Kagi means that while you are now paying for your search you are getting a fair value for your money, you are getting more relevant results, are able to personalize your experience and take advantage of all the tools and features we built, all while protecting your and your family's privacy and data.</p><h2 id="kagi-offers-a-choice" tabindex="-1">Kagi offers a choice <a href="#kagi-offers-a-choice" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Kagi offers a choice&quot;">​</a></h2><p>All search engines have search costs, development costs, and administrative costs. Most search engines cover this by advertising, tracking, and selling your data. And for 25 years we did not have any choice.</p><p>Kagi brings a new model to the market - pay for your search with your wallet instead. For only $5/mo (Starter plan) or $10/mo (unlimited search plan) you can now search with a peace of mind, knowing the results are always shown with your best interest in mind.</p><h2 id="pick-a-kagi-plan-that-is-right-for-you" tabindex="-1">Pick a Kagi plan that is right for you <a href="#pick-a-kagi-plan-that-is-right-for-you" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pick a Kagi plan that is right for you&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We make it easy to pick the plan that is right for you, take a look at our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/plan-types.html">Plan Types</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open source python client to read your data from the Colmi R02 family of Smart Rings. 100% open source, 100% offline.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-colmi-r02">What is the Colmi R02?</h2>

<p><img src="https://cdn.tahnok.ca/u/banner_colmi_r02.png" alt="picture of the colmi r02 smart ring in shiny black. The electronics can be seen through the epoxy inside the ring" width="100%"></p>

<p>It's a cheap (as in $20) "smart ring" / fitness wearable that includes the following sensors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accelerometer
<ul>
<li>step tracking</li>
<li>sleep tracking</li>
<li>gestures (maybe...?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heart Rate (HR)</li>
<li>Blood Oxygen (SPO2)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found out about the ring from atc1441 and his work on <a href="https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_RF03_Ring/">ATC_RF03</a> and the 
<a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/06/16/new-part-day-a-hackable-smart-ring/">Hackaday coverage</a></p>

<p>Are you hiring? <a href="mailto:tahnok+colmir02@gmail.com">Send me an email</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-buy">How to buy</h2>

<p>You can get it on <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006631448993.html">here on AliExpress</a>. If that link is dead try searching for "COLMI R02", I got mine from "Colmi official store". It cost me $CAD 22 shipped.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-engineering-status">Reverse engineering status</h2>

<ul>
<li> Real time heart rate and SPO2</li>
<li> Step logs (still don't quite understand how the day is split up)</li>
<li> Heart rate logs (aka periodic measurement)</li>
<li> Set ring time</li>
<li> Set HR log frequency</li>
<li> SPO2 logs</li>
<li> Sleep tracking</li>
<li> "Stress" measurement</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="planned-feature">Planned Feature</h2>

<ul>
<li>add more CLI functionlity</li>
<li>pretty print HR and steps</li>
<li>sync all data to a file or sqlite db</li>
<li>simple web interface</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<h3 id="using-the-command-line">Using the command line</h3>

<p>If you don't know python that well, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend you install <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/">pipx</a>. It's puprpose built for managing python packages intended to be used as standalone programs and it will keep your computer safe from the pitfalls of python packaging. Once installed you can do</p>

<div>
<pre><span></span><code>pipx<span> </span>install<span> </span>git+https://github.com/tahnok/colmi_r02_client
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once that is done you can look for nearby rings using</p>



<pre><code>Found device(s)
                Name  | Address
--------------------------------------------
            R02_341C  |  70:CB:0D:D0:34:1C
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have your address you can use it to do things like get real time heart rate</p>

<div>
<pre><span></span><code>colmi_r02_client<span> </span>--address<span>=</span><span>70</span>:CB:0D:D0:34:1C<span> </span>get-real-time-heart-rate

</div>

<pre><code>Starting reading, please wait.

</code></pre>

<h3 id="with-the-library-sdk">With the library / sdk</h3>

<p>You can use the <code><a href="https://tahnok.github.io/colmi_r02_client/colmi_r02_client/client.html">colmi_r02_client.client</a></code> class as a library to do your own stuff in python. I've tried to write a lot of docstrings, which are visible on <a href="https://tahnok.github.io/colmi_r02_client/">the docs site</a></p>

<h2 id="communication-protocol-details">Communication Protocol Details</h2>

<p>I've kept a lab notebook style stream of consciousness notes on <a href="https://notes.tahnok.ca/">https://notes.tahnok.ca/</a>, starting with <a href="https://notes.tahnok.ca/blog/2024-07-07+Smart+Ring+Hacking">2024-07-07 Smart Ring Hacking</a> and eventually getting put under one folder. That's the best source for all the raw stuff.</p>

<p>At a high level though, you can talk to and read from the ring using BLE. There's no binding or security keys required to get started. (that's kind of bad, but the range on the ring is really tiny and I'm not too worried about someone getting my steps or heart rate information. Up to you).</p>

<p>The ring has a ble GATT service with the UUID <code>6E40FFF0-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E</code>. It has two important characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li>RX: <code>6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E</code>, which you write to</li>
<li>TX: <code>6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E</code>, which you can "subscribe" to and is where the ring responds to packets you have sent.</li>
</ol>

<p>This closely ressembles the <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/libraries/bluetooth_services/services/nus.html">Nordic UART Service</a> and UART/Serial communications in general.</p>

<h3 id="packet-structure">Packet structure</h3>

<p>The ring communicates in 16 byte packets for both sending and receiving. The first byte of the packet is always a command/tag/type. For example, the packet you send to ask for the battery level starts with <code>0x03</code> and the response packet also starts with <code>0x03</code>.</p>

<p>The last byte of the packet is always a checksum/crc. This value is calculated by summing up the other 15 bytes in the packet and taking the result modulo 255. See <code><a href="https://tahnok.github.io/colmi_r02_client/colmi_r02_client/packet.html#checksum">colmi_r02_client.packet.checksum</a></code></p>

<p>The middle 14 bytes are the "subdata" or payload data. Some requests (like <code><a href="https://tahnok.github.io/colmi_r02_client/colmi_r02_client/set_time.html#set_time_packet">colmi_r02_client.set_time.set_time_packet</a></code>) include additional data. Almost all responses use the subdata to return the data you asked for.</p>

<p>Some requests result in multiple responses that you have to consider together to get the data. <code><a href="https://tahnok.github.io/colmi_r02_client/colmi_r02_client/steps.html#SportDetailParser">colmi_r02_client.steps.SportDetailParser</a></code> is an example of this behaviour.</p>

<p>If you want to know the actual packet structure for a given feature's request or response, take a look at the source code for that feature. I've tried to make it pretty easy to follow even if you don't know python very well. There are also some tests that you can refer to for validated request/response pairs and human readable interpretations of that data.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Generative models based on denoising, such as diffusion models and flow-based models, have been a scalable
            approach in generating high-dimensional visual data. Recent works have started exploring diffusion models as
            representation learners; the idea is that the hidden states of these models can capture meaningful, discriminative features.
        </p>    

        <p>
            We identify that the main challenge in training diffusion models stems from the need to learn a high-quality internal representation.
            In particular, we show: 
        </p>
        <blockquote>    
                <p>
                The performance of generative <b>diffusion models can be improved dramatically</b> when they are supported by an
                <b>external high-quality representation</b> from another model, such as a self-supervised visual encoder.
                </p>
            </blockquote>    
        
        <p>
            Specifically, we introduce <b>REPresentation Alignment (REPA)</b>, a simple regularization technique
            built on recent diffusion transformer architectures.
            In essence, REPA distills the pretrained self-supervised visual representation of a clean image into 
            the diffusion transformer representation of a noisy input. This regularization better aligns 
            the diffusion model representations with the target self-supervised representations.
        </p>

        </p>    
        <p>
            Notably, model training becomes significantly
            more efficient and effective, and achieves &gt;17.5x faster convergence than the vanilla model.
            In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves <b>state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42</b>
            using classifier-free guidance with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724">guidance interval</a>.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Alignment behavior for a pretrained SiT model</h3>
        <p>
            We empirically investigate the feature alignment between <a href="https://dinov2.metademolab.com/">DINOv2-g</a>
            and the original <a href="https://scalable-interpolant.github.io/">SiT-XL/2</a> checkpoint
            trained for 7M iterations.
            Similar to prior studies, we first observe that pretrained diffusion models do indeed learn meaningful
            discriminative representations. However, these representations
            are significantly inferior to those produced by DINOv2. Next, we find that the alignment between the 
            representations learned by the diffusion model and those of DINOv2 is still considered weak, 
            which we study by measuring their <a href="https://phillipi.github.io/prh/"><i>representation alignment</i></a>.
            Finally, we observe this alignment between diffusion models and DINOv2 improves consistently with longer
            training and larger models.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Bridging the representation gap</h3>

        <p>
        REPA reduces the semantic gap in the representation and better aligns it with the target self-supervised
        representations. Interestingly, with REPA, we observe that sufficient representation alignment
        can be achieved by aligning only the first few transformer blocks. This, in turn, allows the later layers
        of the diffusion transformers to focus on capturing high-frequency details based on the aligned representations,
        further improving generation performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>REPA improves visual scaling</h3>
        <p>
            We first compare the images generated by two SiT-XL/2 models during the first 400K iterations, with REPA
            applied to one of the models. Both models share the same noise, sampler, and number of sampling steps, 
            and neither uses classifier-free guidance. The model trained with REPA shows much better progression.
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://sihyun.me/REPA/assets/qual_progression.jpg" alt="PDF Image">
        </p>    

        <h3>REPA shows great scalability in various perspectives</h3>
        <p>
            We also examine the scalability of REPA by varying pretrained encoders and diffusion transformer model sizes,
            showing that aligning with better visual representations leads to improved generation and linear probing results.
            REPA also provides more significant speedups in larger models, achieving faster FID-50K improvements compared to 
            vanilla models. Additionally, increasing model size yields faster gains in both generation and linear evaluation.
        </p>

        </p>



        <h3>REPA significantly improves training efficiency and generation quality</h3>
        <p>
             Finally, we compare the FID values between vanilla DiT or SiT models and those trained with REPA. 
             Without classifier-free guidance, REPA achieves FID=7.9 at 400K iterations,
             outperforming the vanilla model's performance at 7M iterations. Moreover, using classifier-free guidance, 
             SiT-XL/2 with REPA outperforms recent diffusion models with 7× fewer epochs, and achieves state-of-the-art FID=1.42
             with additional guidance scheduling.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sqlite-in-durable-objects/">Zero-latency SQLite storage in every Durable Object</a></strong> (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/kjx2vk/zero_latency_sqlite_storage_every" title="lobste.rs">via</a>) Kenton Varda introduces the next iteration of Cloudflare's <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/">Durable Object</a> platform, which recently upgraded from a key/value store to a full relational system based on SQLite.</p>
<p>For useful background on the first version of Durable Objects take a look at <a href="https://digest.browsertech.com/archive/browsertech-digest-cloudflares-durable/">Cloudflare's durable multiplayer moat</a> by Paul Butler, who digs into its popularity for building WebSocket-based realtime collaborative applications.</p>
<p>The new SQLite-backed Durable Objects is a fascinating piece of distributed system design, which advocates for a really interesting way to architect a large scale application.</p>
<p>The key idea behind Durable Objects is to colocate application logic with the data it operates on. A Durable Object comprises code that executes on the same physical host as the SQLite database that it uses, resulting in blazingly fast read and write performance.</p>
<p>How could this work at scale?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A single object is inherently limited in throughput since it runs on a single thread of a single machine. To handle more traffic, you create more objects. This is easiest when different objects can handle different logical units of state (like different documents, different users, or different "shards" of a database), where each unit of state has low enough traffic to be handled by a single object</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kenton presents the example of a flight booking system, where each flight can map to a dedicated Durable Object with its own SQLite database - thousands of fresh databases per airline per day.</p>
<p>Each DO has a unique name, and Cloudflare's network then handles routing requests to that object wherever it might live on their global network.</p>
<p>The technical details are fascinating. Inspired by <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a>, each DO constantly streams a sequence of WAL entries to object storage - batched every 16MB or every ten seconds. This also enables point-in-time recovery for up to 30 days through replaying those logged transactions.</p>
<p>To ensure durability within that ten second window, writes are also forwarded to five replicas in separate nearby data centers as soon as they commit, and the write is only acknowledged once three of them have confirmed it.</p>
<p>The JavaScript API design is interesting too: it's blocking rather than async, because the whole point of the design is to provide fast single threaded persistence operations:</p>

		<p>The original form of radio broadcast was amplitude modulation (AM). With AM radio, the changes in the amplitude of the carrier wave carries the signal you want to broadcast.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/am_signal.png" alt="AM signal" width="600" height="151"></p>
<p>Frequency modulation (FM) came later. With FM radio, changes to the frequency of the carrier wave carry the signal.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/fm_wave.png" alt="" width="548" height="95"></p>
<p>I go into the mathematical details of AM radio <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2016/03/15/beats-amplitude-modulation/">here</a> and of FM radio <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2016/02/17/analyzing-an-fm-signal/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Pinter [1] gives a clear explanation of why the inventor of FM radio, Edwin Howard Armstrong, correctly predicted that FM radio transmissions would be less effected by noise.</p>
<blockquote><p>Armstrong reasoned that the effect of random noise is primarily to amplitude-modulate the carrier without consistently producing frequency derivations.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, noise tends to be a an unwanted amplitude modulation, not a frequency modulation.</p>
<p>FM radio was able to achieve levels of noise reduction that people steeped in AM radio thought would be impossible. As J. R. Carson eloquently but incorrectly concluded</p>
<blockquote><p>… as the essential nature of the problem is more clearly perceived, we are unavoidably forced to the conclusion that static, like the poor, will always be with us.</p></blockquote>
<p>But as Pinter observes</p>
<blockquote><p>The substantial reduction of noise in a FM receiver by use of a limiter was indeed a startling discovery, contrary to the behavior of AM systems, because experience with such systems had shown that the noise contribution to the modulation of the carrier could not be eliminated without partial elimination of the message.</p></blockquote>

		<p>“Is this a Minecraft clone? Is it like Minecraft Alpha?” If you’ve been a member of our community for some time, you are
probably aware of how often these questions remind us of what people think of when they hear the name “Minetest”: a
rip-off of a similar genre-defining game. Truth be told, that was celeron55’s initial plan. But things change, and
Minetest evolved. Now, the time has come for Minetest to assume a new identity and prove it has moved beyond its
original purpose.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="a-bit-of-history">A Bit of History</h2>

<p>After seeing Minecraft’s alpha debut, celeron55 “took it as a challenge” to explore “the mystery of how a game world
like this works under the hood”<sup id="fnref:wikinews" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikinews" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The name wasn’t very important; it was a test after all— an experiment to
see what it could do differently. An experiment that began attracting more users and contributors throughout the years
until Minetest eventually evolved from a game to what it is today: a game platform.</p>

<p>Through the efforts of the community over the past decade, Minetest has developed a unique identity with an approachable
API and easy scripting language, support for community-created games and mods, a central library to easily find
community content, and more recently a shift to promoting community creations instead of the original Minetest Game.
Despite these advancements, one anachronistic holdover has remained to remind us of the past: an idea that no longer
describes the purpose of this project and community— its name.</p>

<p>After more than a year of public and internal discussions, that era is over. “Minetest” is no more; the “Minecraft
clone” is no more. With great thanks to the community for their input, we wave goodbye to Minetest and introduce a new
era. Welcome 🥁 … <strong>Luanti!</strong></p>

<h2 id="luanwhat">Luanwhat?</h2>

<p>“Luanti” is a wordplay on the Finnish word <em>luonti</em> (“creation”) and the programming language <del>Minetest</del> Luanti employs
for games and mods, <em>Lua</em>. The goal was to avoid yet another plain English word (good luck finding something unique…)
and highlight the core principles of the project. The fusion of celeron55’s Finnish nationality and the platform’s focus
on content creation resulted in the birth of “Luanti”.</p>

<p>We decided to avoid using “free” or “libre” in the name because we don’t think it does the project justice. Luanti will
always be free software, but that core principle is not everything it has to offer. Projects like Blender, Krita, or
Godot are awesome, and they don’t need to convince you about their libre nature by putting it in their names. They are
libre, but they’re also much, much more!</p>

<p>Luanti is a lot of things. Many of us are familiar with the voxel nature of the engine and the library of content it
supports, and name suggestions related to that idea were certainly plentiful. But describing that in the new name would
limit the platform in the same way as the original: users and developers would come to expect it to be an engine
exclusive to cube games when it can be more than that. Luanti is a platform that is built to help you create. It’s a
platform where anyone can make something. It’s a platform that will keep evolving to support your creations.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>With the new name, a few changes will be made in the engine and community. Obviously, all the repositories and community
hubs will adopt the Luanti name in some form. You’ll be able to find the website at luanti.org and repositories at
<a href="https://github.com/luanti-org">github.com/luanti-org</a> (many old links will redirect). Our social platforms will change
similarly. The logo will be staying, and you’ll probably still hear “Minetest” occasionally in reference to <a href="https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/">Minetest
Game</a> which will remain a testament to the project’s
roots. Otherwise, Luanti now represents the future of the platform.</p>

<p>For developers, the engine won’t actually change much. For those who aren’t aware, <code>core</code> is actually the real Lua
namespace used internally, <code>minetest</code> is just an alias (which we will keep for compatibility). Rather than rename all
the namespaces to <code>luanti</code>, <code>core</code> will be the official namespace to use. It’s shorter to type, easier to remember, and
backwards-compatible. It’s also friendlier to forks and future name changes (which we don’t plan to do, promise!)</p>

<p>We hope that, free from the ghost of its past, Luanti can bloom into something more and bring life to adventures and
experiences for years to come. It can now live and breathe on its own, explore its nature and potential, and overcome
its limits. At the very least, we can finally say to those who once asked “Is this a Minecraft clone?”: No, not anymore.
It came from humble beginnings and has grown into a powerful game platform where you, and anyone else, can start
creating. And with your help, it will continue to grow into something even better.</p>

<p>What do you think about the new name? Let us know in the forum thread or on any of our community platforms!</p>

    <h2>Counterintuitive Properties of High Dimensional Space</h2>

    <p><span size="5"><b>Marc Khoury</b></span></p>

    <p>Our geometric intuition developed in our three-dimensional world often fails us in higher dimensions. Many properties of even simple objects, such as higher dimensional analogs of cubes and spheres, are very counterintuitive. Below we discuss just a few of these properties in an attempt to convey some of the weirdness of high dimensional space.</p>

    <p>You may be used to using the word "circle" in two dimensions and "sphere" in three dimensions. However, in higher dimensions we generally just use the word sphere, or \(d\)-sphere when the dimension of the sphere is not clear from context. With this terminology, a circle is also called a 1-sphere, for a 1-dimensional sphere. A standard sphere in three dimensions is called a 2-sphere, and so on. This sometimes causes confusion, because a \(d\)-sphere is usually thought of as existing in \((d+1)\)-dimensional space. When we say \(d\)-sphere, the value of \(d\) refers to the dimension of the sphere locally on the object, not the dimension in which it lives. Similarly we'll often use the word cube for a square, a standard cube, and its higher dimensional analogues.</p>

    <h2>Escaping Spheres</h2>

    <p>Consider a square with side length 1. At each corner of the square place a circle of radius \(1/2\), so that the circles cover the edges of the square. Then consider the circle centered at the center of the square that is just large enough to touch the circles at the corners of the square. In two dimensions it's clear that the inner circle is entirely contained in the square.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure1.png" width="300">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 1:</b> At each corner of the square we place a circle of radius \(1/2\). The inner circle is just large enough to touch the circles at the corners.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We can do the same thing in three dimensions. At each corner of the unit cube place a sphere of radius \(1/2\), again covering the edges of the cube. The sphere centered at the center of the cube and tangent to spheres at the corners of the cube is shown in red in Figure 2. Again we see that, in three dimensions, the inner sphere is entirely contained in the cube.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure2.png">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 2:</b> In three dimensions we place a sphere at the each of the eight corners of a cube.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>To understand what happens in higher dimensions we need to compute the radius of the inner sphere in terms of the dimension. The radius of the inner sphere is equal to the length of the diagonal of the cube minus the radius of the spheres at the corners. See Figure 3. The latter value is always \(1/2\), regardless of the dimension. We can compute the length of the diagonal as</p>

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    d\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \ldots, \frac{1}{2}\right), \left(1,1, \ldots, 1\right)\right) &amp;= \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{d} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2}\\
    &amp;= \sqrt{d}/2
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    <p>Thus the radius of the inner sphere is \(\sqrt{d}/2 - 1/2\). Notice that the radius of the inner sphere is increasing with the dimension!</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure3.png">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 3:</b> The size of the radius of the inner sphere is growing as the dimension increases because the distance to the corner increases while the radius of the corner sphere remains constant.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In dimensions two and three, the sphere is strictly inside the cube, as we've seen in the figures above. However in four dimensions something very interesting happens. The radius of the inner sphere is exactly \(1/2\), which is just large enough for the inner sphere to touch the sides of the cube! In five dimensions, the radius of the inner sphere is \(0.618034\), and the sphere starts poking outside of the cube! By ten dimensions, the radius is \(1.08114\) and the sphere is poking very far outside of the cube!</p>

    <h2>Volume in High Dimensions</h2>

    <p>The area of a circle \(A(r) = \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius. Given the equation for the area of a circle, we can compute the volume of a sphere by considering cross sections of the sphere. That is, we intersect the sphere with a plane at some height \(h\) above the center of the sphere.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure4.png" width="300">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 4:</b> Intersecting the sphere with a plane gives a circle.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The intersection between a sphere and a plane is a circle. If we look at the sphere from a side view, as shown in Figure 5, we see that the radius can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem (\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)). The radius of the circle is \(\sqrt{r^2 - h^2}\).</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure5.png" width="300">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 5:</b> A side view of Figure 4. The radius of the circle defined by the intersection can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Summing up the area of each cross section from the bottom of the sphere to the top of the sphere gives the volume</p>

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    V(r) &amp;= \int_{-r}^{r} A(\sqrt{r^2 - h^2})\; dh\\
         &amp;= \int_{-r}^{r} \pi \sqrt{r^2 - h^2}^2 \; dh\\
         &amp;= \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3.
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    <p>Now that we know the volume of the \(2\)-sphere, we can compute the volume of the \(3\)-sphere in a similar way. The only difference is where before we used the equation for the area of a circle, we instead use the equation for the volume of the \(2\)-sphere. The general formula for the volume of a \(d\)-sphere is approximately</p>

    \[
    \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{(d/2+1)!}r^d.
    \]

    <p>(Approximately because the denominator should be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>, but that's not important for understanding the intuition.)</p>

    <p>Set \(r = 1\) and consider the volume of the unit \(d\)-sphere as \(d\) increases. The plot of the volume is shown in Figure 6.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure6.png">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 6:</b> The volume of the unit \(d\)-sphere goes to 0 as \(d\) increases!</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The volume of the unit \(d\)-sphere goes to 0 as \(d\) grows! A high dimensional unit sphere encloses almost no volume! The volume increases from dimensions one to five, but begins decreasing rapidly toward 0 after dimension six.</p>

    <h2>More Accurate Pictures</h2>

    <p>Given the rather unexpected properties of high dimensional cubes and spheres, I hope that you'll agree that the following are somewhat more accurate pictorial representations.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure7.png" height="200">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 7:</b> More accurate pictorial representations of high dimensional cubes (left) and spheres (right).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Notice that the corners of the cube are much further away from the center than are the sides. The \(d\)-sphere is drawn so that it contains almost no volume but still has radius 1. This image also suggests the next counterintuitive property of high dimensional spheres.</p>

    <h2>Concentration of Measure</h2>

    <p>Suppose that you wanted to place a band around the equator of the unit sphere so that, say, 99% of the surface area of the sphere falls within that band. See Figure 8. How large do you think that band would have to be?</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure8.png" height="250">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 8:</b> In two dimensions a the width of a band around the equator must be very large to contain 99% of the perimeter.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In two dimensions the width of the band needs to be pretty large, indeed nearly 2, to capture 99% of the perimeter of the unit circle. However as the dimension increases the width of the band needed to capture 99% of the surface area gets smaller. In very high dimensional space nearly all of the surface area of the sphere lies a very small distance away from the equator!</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure9.png">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 9:</b> As the dimension increases the width of the band necessary to capture 99% of the surface area decreases rapidly. Nearly all of the surface area of a high dimensional sphere lies near the equator.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>To provide some intuition consider the situation in two dimensions, as shown in Figure 10. For a point on the circle to be close to the equator, its \(y\)-coordinate must be small.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure10.png">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 10:</b> Points near the equator have small y coordinate.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>What happens to the values of the coordinates as the dimensions increases? Figure 11 is a plot of 20000 random points sampled uniformly from a \(d\)-sphere. As \(d\) increases the values become more and more concentrated around 0.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure11.gif" width="750">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 11:</b> As the dimension increases the coordinates become increasingly concentrated around 0.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Recall that every point on a \(d\)-sphere must satisfy the equation \(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_{d+1}^2 = 1\). Intuitively as \(d\) increases the number of terms in the sum increases, and each coordinate gets a smaller share of the single unit, on the average.</p>

    <p>The really weird thing is that any choice of "equator" works! It must, since the sphere is, well, spherically symmetrical. We could have just as easily have chosen any of the options shown in Figure 12.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure12.png">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 12:</b> Any choice of equator works equally well!</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Kissing Numbers</h2>

    <p>Consider a unit circle in the plane, shown in Figure 13 in red. The blue circle is said to <i>kiss</i> the red circle if it just barely touches the red circle. (Leave it to mathematicians to think that barely touching is a desirable property of a kiss.) The <i>kissing number</i> is the maximum number of non-overlapping blue circles that can simultaneously kiss the red circle.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure13.png" width="300">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 13:</b> The kissing number is six in two dimensions.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In two dimensions it's easy to see that the kissing number is 6. The entire proof is shown in Figure 14. The proof is by contradiction. Assume that more than six non-overlapping blue circles can simultaneously kiss the red circle. We draw the edges from the center of the red circle to the centers of the blue circles, as shown in Figure 14. The angles between these edges must sum to exactly \(360^\circ\). Since there are more than six angles, at least one must be less than \(60^\circ\). The resulting triangle, shown in Figure 14, is an isosceles triangle. The side opposite the angle that is less than \(60^\circ\) must be strictly shorter than the other two sides, which are \(2r\) in length. Thus the centers of the two circles must be closer than \(2r\) and the circles must overlap, which is a contradiction.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/counterintuitive-properties-of-high-dimensional-space/Figure14.png">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 14:</b> A proof that the kissing number is six in two dimensions. If more than six blue circles can kiss the red, then one of the angles must be less than 60 degrees. It follows that the two blue circles that form that angle must overlap, which is a contradiction.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>It is more difficult to see that in three dimensions the kissing number is 12. Indeed this was famously disputed between Isaac Newton, who correctly thought the kissing number was 12, and David Gregory, who thought it was 13. (Never bet against Newton.) Looking at the optimal configuration, it's easy to see why Gregory thought it might be possible to fit a 13th sphere in the space between the other 12. As the dimension increases there is suddenly even more space between neighboring spheres and the problem becomes even more difficult.</p>

    <p>In fact, there are very few dimensions where we know the kissing number exactly. In most dimensions we only have an upper and lower bound on the kissing number, and these bounds can vary by as much as several thousand spheres!</p>

    <p>As shown in the table, we only know the kissing number exactly in dimensions one through four, eight, and twenty-four. The eight and twenty-four dimensional cases follow from special lattice structures that are known to give optimal packings. In eight dimensions the kissing number is 240, given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_lattice">\(E_8\) lattice</a>. In twenty-four dimensions the kissing number is 196560, given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice">Leech lattice</a>. And not a single sphere more.</p>

The robots mingled with the crowd, served drinks to and played games with guests, and danced inside a gazebo. Seemingly most surprisingly, they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267570/the-optimus-robots-can-talk-apparently">could even talk</a>. But it was mostly just a show.</p><p>It’s obvious when you watch the videos from the event, of course. If Optimus really was a fully autonomous machine that could immediately react to verbal and visual cues while talking, one-on-one, to human beings in a dimly lit crowd, that would be mind-blowing. </p><p>Attendee Robert Scoble posted that he’d learned humans were “remote assisting” the robots, later clarifying that an engineer had told him the robots used AI to walk, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fclient%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26q%3DPlural%2Bof%2BTesla%2BOptimus%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8">spotted <em>Electrek</em></a>. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote that the robots “relied on tele-ops (human intervention)” in a note, the outlet reports. </p><p>There are obvious tells to back those claims up, like the fact that the robots all have different voices or that their responses were immediate, with gesticulation to match. </p><p>It doesn’t feel like Tesla was going out of its way to make anyone think the Optimus machines were acting on their own. In another video that <a href="https://jalopnik.com/teslas-beer-serving-optimus-robot-was-controlled-by-a-h-1851670923"><em>Jalopnik</em> pointed to</a>, an Optimus’ voice jokingly told Scoble that “it might be some” when he asked it how much it was controlled by AI.</p><p>Another robot — or the human voicing it — told an attendee in a stilted impression of a synthetic voice, “Today, I am assisted by a human,” adding that it’s not fully autonomous. (The voice stumbled on the word “autonomous.”)</p><p>Musk first announced Tesla’s humanoid robot by bringing what was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633958/tesla-bot-elon-musk-ai-day">very clearly a person in a robot suit</a> on stage, so it’s no surprise that the Optimuses (Optimi? Optimodes?) at last week’s event were hyperbolic in their presentation. And people who went didn’t seem to feel upset or betrayed by that. But if you were hoping to have any sense of how far along Tesla truly is in its humanoid robotics work, the “We, Robot” event wasn’t the place to look.</p></div></div>]]></description>

			<p><span>An important part of BDRC's mission is technological innovation to make the Tibetan language a first-class citizen in the digital world. A major milestone in that enterprise was passed recently, as the open source software suite LibreOffice now supports an important feature of Tibetan: very long paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span>Tibetans have invested tremendous energy and resources into writing, innovation, and technology since the introduction&nbsp; of Buddhism in the eighth century. Many of you will know the story of how the Tibetan script and classical language were invented for the purpose of translating Buddhist texts from Sanskrit (and Chinese) into a language Tibetans would understand. In the 14th Century Tibetans widely adopted the technology of woodblock printing as a means of mass producing the Tibetan translation of the scriptures and also the thousands of volumes of Buddhist texts written directly in Tibetan by Himalayan authors. Fast forwarding to more recent times, the creation of Tibetan computer fonts was a quantum leap in the evolution of Tibetan and its integration in the digital world. Of particular note was the inclusion of Tibetan in the Unicode Standard, the global standard for the codes that underlie computer fonts for all of the world's writing systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, written Tibetan has important features that are still not supported by all tools or applications. One that may be surprising is very long paragraphs: in fact, the typographical notion of the paragraph does not really exist in a Tibetan text the way it does in European languages. As a result, Tibetan texts often need to be processed as a long stream of uninterrupted text with no forced line breaks, sometimes over hundreds or thousands of pages.&nbsp;</span></p>

		</div><div><div><p><img decoding="async" itemprop="image" src="https://www.bdrc.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/c5MCRRhVCKIYkaOtm9FfAA-copy.jpg" alt=""></p></div><div><p><img decoding="async" itemprop="image" src="https://www.bdrc.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mantra-roll.webp" alt=""></p><p><span></span><i><span>Examples of long Tibetan scrolls of unbroken text that are placed inside prayer wheels.&nbsp;</span></i></p></div></div><div>	


	<div>
			<p><span>In general, word processing software programs were originally designed with English text in mind, meaning that they support relatively short paragraphs (possibly up to a few pages), with words separated by spaces that can have a flexible width. These assumptions don't work for written Tibetan, however, where paragraphs are virtually limitless and contain very few spaces. The result is that such a word processor performs very poorly, if it works at all, when opening a long Tibetan text, and it will therefore be impossible to use for any serious publication project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>LibreOffice is one of the only mature and stable open source word processors (i.e. inspired by MS Word) that is available for free on all possible platforms, including Linux. It is relevant to Tibetan Studies and the Tibetan community because it is free and open source, while popular commercial software programs such as Word or InDesign which can handle long Tibetan texts, are expensive and in many parts of Asia often used in pirated versions. So long as LibreOffice could not handle long paragraphs there was essentially no free tool to publish Tibetan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2015, BDRC's CTO, Elie Roux, reported the issue to LibreOffice</span><span>. Unfortunately an intervention in the code of LibreOffice is a big project that would have required weeks of research and development, and therefore there was no evolution on that front. That is until a few weeks ago, when a developer named Jonathan Clark tackled the issue and fixed it! A long text like Longchenpa's Yishindzö (view on the BDRC archive at: <a href="http://purl.bdrc.io/resource/WA00KG02677">yid bzhin mdzod</a>), which consists of one "paragraph" of 153 letter size pages, now opens quickly and can be edited in LibreOffice.</span><span> The conversion of the RDF file of this particular text into a PDF used to stall after 45 minutes and it is now completed in 13 seconds! This is a remarkable improvement of several orders of magnitude, something quite rare in software optimization.</span></p>

</div></div><div>
			<p><span>BDRC's modest contribution to this breakthrough is just to have planted the seed many years ago, but we want to acknowledge and rejoice in Jonathan's good work, and the consequent strengthening of Tibetan in open source publication tools!</span></p>
<p><span>The support for very long paragraphs was integrated in <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/">LibreOffice 24.8.2</a>, released on September 27 2024. We encourage you to try it out and send us comments on your favorite software to edit Tibetan, or the most important shortcomings you experience in this type of tool for Tibetan. Working together as a community, we can continue to innovate and keep Tibetan up to speed with the digital technology of other languages.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Restic is a modern backup program that can back up your files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>from <strong>Linux, BSD, Mac and Windows</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to <strong>many different storage types</strong>, including self-hosted and online services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>easily</strong>, being a single executable that you can run without a server or complex setup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>effectively</strong>, only transferring the parts that actually changed in the files you back up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>securely</strong>, by careful use of cryptography in every part of the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>verifiably</strong>, enabling you to make sure that your files can be restored when needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>freely</strong> - restic is entirely free to use and completely open source</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>
<p>A short recorded demo of restic:</p>

<p>To learn more about restic, checkout the user manual:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Manual for restic (released version)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Manual for restic (latest development version)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To install, please follow the <a href="https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/020_installation.html">Installation Instructions Page</a> in the manual or download the latest native binary on the <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/latest">GitHub Download Page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>Backward compatibility for backups is important so that our users are always able to restore saved data. Therefore restic follows <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> to clearly define which versions are compatible. The repository and data structures contained therein are considered the “Public API” in the sense of Semantic Versioning.</p>
<p>Once version 1.0.0 is released, we guarantee backward compatibility of all repositories within one major version; as long as we do not increment the major version, data can be read and restored. We strive to be fully backward compatible to all prior versions.</p>
<p>During initial development (versions prior to 1.0.0), maintainers and developers will do their utmost to keep backwards compatibility and stability, although there might be breaking changes without increasing the major version.</p>
<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>Contributions are welcome! More information can be found in <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">the restic contribution guidelines</a>. A document describing the design of restic and the data structures stored on disc is contained in <a href="http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#design">the design document</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrap">

			<p>We were saddened and appalled by Matt Mullenweg’s actions this morning appropriating the Advanced Custom Fields plugin that our ACF team has been actively developing for the WordPress community since 2011.</p>

<p>Advanced Custom Fields is a sophisticated plugin with over 200,000 lines of code, which we continually develop, enhance, support and invest in to meet the needs of our users across WordPress.&nbsp; We’ve made 15+ releases over the past two years, since joining WP Engine, and added significant new functionality to the free plugin as well as continually improving performance and our security and testing practices to meet the ‘enterprise grade’ that our users deserve.</p>

<p>The change to our published distribution, and under our ‘slug’ which uniquely identifies the ACF plugin and code that our users trust in the WordPress.org plugin repository, is inconsistent with open source values and principles.&nbsp; The change made by Mullenweg is maliciously being used to update millions of existing installations of ACF with code that is unapproved and untrusted by the Advanced Custom Fields team.</p>

<p>We are directly able to protect WP Engine, Flywheel hosting and ACF PRO customers –&nbsp; you are not impacted and do not need to take any action. You will continue to get the latest innovations and updates from the experts in the ACF team. The ACF code on wordpress.org is no longer controlled by the ACF team.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have been made aware that the Advanced Custom Fields plugin on the WordPress directory has been taken over by WordPress dot org.</p><p>A plugin under active development has never been unilaterally and forcibly taken away from its creator without consent in the 21 year history of… <a href="https://t.co/eV0qakURLc">pic.twitter.com/eV0qakURLc</a></p></div>— Advanced Custom Fields (@wp_acf) <a href="https://twitter.com/wp_acf/status/1845169499064107049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>If you have a site managed elsewhere using the free version of ACF, in order to get genuine ACF updates you <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/installing-and-upgrading-to-the-latest-version-of-acf/">must perform a one-time download</a> of the 6.3.8 version via advancedcustomfields.com to remain safe in the future. After this one-time download you will be able to update as usual via the WP Admin panel.</p>

<p>You can also follow the same process if your site has already been upgraded to the modified “Secure Custom Fields” plugin, to get back to a genuine version of ACF.</p>

<p>Mullenweg’s actions are extraordinarily concerning and pose the grave risk of upending and irreparably harming the entire WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp; His attempt to unilaterally take control of this open platform that we and so many other plugin developers and contributors have relied on, in the spirit of sharing plugins for all, provides further evidence of his serious abuse of trust, manifold conflicts of interest, and breach of the promises of openness and integrity in the community.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>On October 10,</span> 2018, Tyndall Air Force Base on the Gulf of Mexico—a pillar of American air superiority—found itself under aerial attack. Hurricane Michael, first spotted as a Category 2 storm off the Florida coast, unexpectedly hulked up to a Category 5. Sustained winds of 155 miles per hour whipped into the base, flinging power poles, flipping F-22s, and totaling more than 200 buildings. The sole saving grace: Despite sitting on a peninsula, Tyndall avoided flood damage. Michael’s 9-to-14-foot storm surge swamped other parts of Florida. Tyndall’s main defense was luck.</p><p>That $5 billion disaster at Tyndall was just one of a mounting number of extreme-weather events that convinced the US Department of Defense that it needed new ideas to protect the 1,700 coastal bases it’s responsible for globally. As hurricanes Helene and Milton have just shown, beachfront residents face compounding threats from climate change, and the Pentagon is no exception. Rising oceans are chewing away the shore. Stronger storms are more capable of flooding land.</p><p>In response, Tyndall will later this month test a new way to protect shorelines from intensified waves and storm surges: a prototype artificial reef, designed by a team led by Rutgers University scientists. The 50-meter-wide array, made up of three chevron-shaped structures each weighing about 46,000 pounds, can take 70 percent of the <em>oomph</em> out of waves, according to tests. But this isn’t your grandaddy’s seawall. It’s specifically designed to be colonized by oysters, some of nature’s most effective wave-killers.</p><p>If researchers can optimize these creatures to work in tandem with new artificial structures placed at sea, they believe the resulting barriers can take 90 percent of the energy out of waves. David Bushek, who directs the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory at Rutgers, swears he’s not hoping for a megastorm to come and show what his team’s unit is made of. But he’s not <em>not</em> hoping for one. “Models are always imperfect. They’re always a replica of something,” he says. “They’re not the real thing.”</p><p>The project is one of three being developed under a $67.6 million program launched by the US government’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. Cheekily called Reefense, the initiative is the Pentagon’s effort to test if “hybrid” reefs, combining manmade structures with oysters or corals, can perform as well as a good ol’ seawall. Darpa chose three research teams, all led by US universities, in 2022. After two years of intensive research and development, their prototypes are starting to go into the water, with Rutgers’ first up.</p><p>Today, the Pentagon protects its coastal assets much as civilians do: by hardening them. Common approaches involve armoring the shore with retaining walls or arranging heavy objects, like rocks or concrete blocks, in long rows. But hardscape structures come with tradeoffs. They deflect rather than absorb wave energy, so protecting one’s own shoreline means exposing someone else’s. They’re also static: As sea levels rise and storms get stronger, it’s getting easier for water to surmount these structures. This wears them down faster and demands constant, expensive repairs.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In recent decades, a new idea has emerged: using nature as infrastructure. Restoring coastal habitats like marshes and mangroves, it turns out, helps hold off waves and storms. “Instead of armoring, you’re using nature’s natural capacity to absorb wave energy,” says Donna Marie Bilkovic, a professor at the Virginia Institute for Marine Science. Darpa is particularly interested in two creatures whose numbers have been decimated by humans but which are terrific wave-breakers when allowed to thrive: oysters and corals.</p><p>Oysters are effective wave-killers because of how they grow. The bivalves pile onto each other in large, sturdy mounds. The resulting structure, unlike a smooth seawall, is replete with nooks, crannies, and convolutions. When a wave strikes, its energy gets diffused into these gaps, and further spent on the jagged, complex surfaces of the oysters. Also unlike a seawall, an oyster wall can grow. Oysters have been shown to be capable of building vertically at a rate that matches sea-level rise—which suggests they’ll retain some protective value against higher tides and stronger storms.</p><p>Today hundreds of human-tended oyster reefs, particularly on America’s Atlantic coast, use these principles to protect the shore. They take diverse approaches; some look much like natural reefs, while others have an <a data-offer-url="https://www.wfae.org/2024-06-20/sugarloaf-island-morehead-city-oysters-wave-attenuation-devices" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.wfae.org/2024-06-20/sugarloaf-island-morehead-city-oysters-wave-attenuation-devices&quot;}" href="https://www.wfae.org/2024-06-20/sugarloaf-island-morehead-city-oysters-wave-attenuation-devices" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">artificial component</a>. Some cultivate oysters for food, with coastal protection a nice co-benefit; others are built specifically to preserve shorelines. What’s missing amid all this experimentation, says Bilkovic, is systematic performance data—the kind that could validate which approaches are most effective and cost-effective. “Right now the innovation is outpacing the science,” she says. “We need to have some type of systematic monitoring of projects, so we can better understand where the techniques work the best. There just isn’t funding, frankly.”</p><p>Rather than wait for the data needed to engineer the perfect reef, Darpa wants to rapidly innovate them through a burst of R&amp;D. Reefense has given awardees five years to deploy hybrid reefs that take up to 90 percent of the energy out of waves, without costing significantly more than traditional solutions. The manmade component should block waves immediately. But it should be quickly enhanced by organisms that build, in months or years, a living structure that would take nature decades.</p><p>The Rutgers team has built its prototype out of 788 interlocked concrete modules, each 2 feet wide and ranging in height from 1 to 2 feet tall. They have a scalloped appearance, with shelves jutting in all directions. Internally, all these shelves are connected by holes.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>A Darpa-funded team will install sea barriers, made of hundreds of concrete modules, near a Florida military base. The scalloped shape should not only dissipate wave energy but invite oysters to build their own structures.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: David Bushek</span></p></figure><p>What this means is that when a wave strikes this structure, it smashes into the internal geometry, swirls around, and exits with less energy. This effect alone weakens the wave by 70 percent, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers, which tested a scale model in a wave simulator in Mississippi. But the effect should only improve as oysters colonize the structure. Bushek and his team have tried to design the shelves with the right hardness, texture, and shading to entice them.</p><p>But the reef’s value would be diminished if, say, disease were to wipe the mollusks out. This is why Darpa has tasked Rutgers with also engineering oysters resistant to dermo, a protozoan that’s dogged Atlantic oysters for decades. Darpa prohibited them using genetic-modification techniques. But thanks to recent advances in genomics, the Rutgers team can rapidly identify individual oysters with disease-resistant traits. It exposes these oysters to dermo in a lab, and crossbreeds the survivors, producing hardier mollusks. Traditionally it takes about three years to breed a generation of oysters for better disease resistance; Bushek says his team has done it in one.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Oysters cluster onto the manmade concrete structures designed by the research team led by Rutgers University.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: David Bushek</span></p></figure><p>Oysters may suit the DoD’s needs in temperate waters, but for bases in tropical climates, it’s coral that builds the best seawalls. Hawaii, for instance, enjoys the protection of “fringing” coral reefs that extend offshore for hundreds of yards in a gentle slope along the seabed. The colossal, complex, and porous character of this surface exhausts wave energy over long distances, says Ben Jones, an oceanographer for the Applied Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii—and head of the university’s Reefense project. He said it’s not unusual to see ocean swells of 6 to 8 feet way offshore, while the water at the seashore laps gently.</p><figure><p><span><p>A Marine base in Hawaii will test out a new approach to coastal protection inspired by local coral reefs: A forward barrier will take the first blows of the waves, and a scattering of pyramids will further weaken waves before they get to shore.</p>
</span><span>Photograph:  Kevin Chun, Makai Ocean Engineering</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Inspired by this effect, Jones and a team of researchers are designing an array that they’ll deploy near a US Marine Corps base in Oahu whose shoreline is rapidly receding. While the final design isn’t set yet, the broad strokes are: It will feature two 50-meter-wide barriers laid in rows, backed by 20 pyramid-like obstacles. All of these are hollow, thin-walled structures with sloping profiles and lots of big holes. Waves that crash into them will lose energy by crawling up the sides, but two design aspects of the structure—the width of the holes and the thinness of the walls—will generate turbulence in the water, causing it to spin off more energy as heat.</p><figure><p><span><p>The manmade structures in Hawaii will be studded with concrete domes meant to encourage coral colonization. Though at grave risk from global warming, coral reefs are thought to provide coastal-protection benefits worth billions of dollars.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: R3D Consortium</span></p></figure><p>In the team’s full vision, the units are bolstered by about a thousand small coral colonies. Jones’ group plans to cover the structures with concrete modules that are about 20 inches in diameter. These have grooves and crevices that offer perfect shelters for coral larvae. The team will initially implant them with lab-bred coral. But they’re also experimenting with enticements, like light and sound, that help attract coral larvae from the wild—the better to build a wall that nature, not the Pentagon, will tend.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>A third Reefense team, led by scientists at the University of Miami, takes its inspiration from a different sort of coral. Its design has a three-tiered structure. The foundation is made of long, hexagonal logs punctured with large holes; atop it is a dense layer with smaller holes—“imagine a sponge made of concrete,” says Andrew Baker, director of the university’s Coral Reef Futures Lab and the Reefense team lead.</p><p>The team thinks these artificial components will soak up plenty of wave energy—but it’s a crest of elkhorn coral at the top that will finish the job. Native to Florida, the Bahamas, and the Caribbean, elkhorn like to build dense reefs in shallow-water areas with high-intensity waves. They don’t mind getting whacked by water because it helps them harvest food; this whacking keeps wave energy from getting to shore.</p><p>Disease has ravaged Florida’s elkhorn populations in recent decades, and now ocean heat waves are dealing further damage. But their critical condition has also motivated policymakers to pursue options to save this iconic state species—including Baker’s, which is to develop an elkhorn more rugged against disease, higher temperatures, and nastier waves. Under Reefense, Baker says, his lab has developed elkhorn with 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius more heat tolerance than their ancestors. They also claim to have boosted the heat thresholds of symbiotic algae—an existentially important occupant of any healthy reef—and cross-bred local elkhorn with those from Honduras, where reefs have mysteriously withstood scorching waters.</p><p>An unexpected permitting issue, though, will force the Miami team to exit Reefense in 2025, without building the test unit it hoped to deploy near a Florida naval base. The federal permitting authority wanted a pot of money set aside to uninstall the structure if needed; Darpa felt it couldn’t do that in a timely way, according to Baker. (Darpa told WIRED every Reefense project has unique permitting challenges, so the Miami team’s fate doesn’t necessarily speak to anything broader. Representatives for the other two Reefense projects said Baker’s issue hasn’t come up for them.)</p><p>Though his team’s work with Reefense is coming to a premature end, Baker says, he’s confident their innovations will get deployed elsewhere. He’s been working with Key Biscayne, an island village near Miami whose shorelines have been chewed up by storms. Roland Samimy, the village’s chief resilience and sustainability officer, says they spend millions of dollars every few years importing sand for their rapidly receding beaches. He’s eager to see if a hybrid structure, like the University of Miami design, could offer protection at far lower cost. “People are realizing their manmade structures aren’t as resilient as nature is,” he says.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>By no means is Darpa the only one experimenting in these areas. Around the world, there are efforts tackling various pieces of the puzzle, like breeding coral for greater heat resistance, or combining coral and oysters with artificial reefs, or designing low-carbon concrete that makes building these structures less environmentally damaging. Bilkovic, of the Virginia Institute for Marine Science, says Reefense will be a success if it demonstrates better ways of doing things than the prevailing methods—and has the data to back this up. “I’m looking forward to seeing what their findings are,” she says. “They’re systematically assessing the effectiveness of the project. Those lessons learned can be translated to other areas, and if the techniques are effective and work well, they can easily be translated to other regions.”</p><p>As for Darpa, though the Reefense prototypes are just starting to go in the water, the work is just beginning. All of these first-generation units will be scrutinized—both by the research teams and independent government auditors—to see whether their real-world performance matches what was in the models. Reefense is scheduled to conclude with a final report to the DoD in 2027. It won’t have a “winner” <em>per se</em>; as the Pentagon has bases around the world, it’s likely these three projects will all produce learnings that are relevant elsewhere.</p><p>Although their client has the largest military budget in the world, the three Reefense teams have been asked to keep an eye on the economics. Darpa has asked that project costs “not greatly exceed” those of conventional solutions, and tasked government monitors with checking the teams’ math. Catherine Campbell, Reefense’s program manager at Darpa, says affordability doesn’t just make it more likely the Pentagon will employ the technology—but that civilians can, too.</p><p>“This isn’t something bespoke for the military … we need to be in line with those kinds of cost metrics [in the civilian sector],” Campbell said in an email. “And that gives it potential for commercialization.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
