<h2>Sarah Wynn-Williams's 'Careless People' (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>I never would have read <em>Careless People</em>, Sarah Wynn-Williams's tell-all memoir about her years running global policy for Facebook, but then Meta's lawyer tried to get the book suppressed and secured an injunction to prevent her from promoting it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/nx-s1-5318854/former-meta-executive-barred-from-discussing-criticism-of-the-company">https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/nx-s1-5318854/former-meta-executive-barred-from-discussing-criticism-of-the-company</a></p>
<p>So I've got something to thank Meta's lawyers for, because it's a great book! Not only is Wynn-Williams a skilled and lively writer who spills some of Facebook's most shameful secrets, but she's also a kick-ass narrator (I listened to the audiobook, which she voices):</p>
<p><a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781250403155-careless-people">https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781250403155-careless-people</a></p>
<p>I went into <em>Careless People</em> with strong expectations about the kind of disgusting behavior it would chronicle. I have several friends who took senior jobs at Facebook, thinking they could make a difference (three of them actually appear in Wynn-Williams's memoir), and I've got a good sense of what a nightmare it is for a company.</p>
<p>But Wynn-Williams was a lot closer to three of the key personalities in Facebook's upper echelon than anyone in my orbit: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Joel Kaplan, who was elevated to VP of Global Policy after the Trump II election. I already harbor an atavistic loathing of these three based on their public statements and conduct, but the events Wynn-Williams reveals from their private lives make these three out to be beyond despicable. There's Zuck, whose underlings let him win at board-games like Settlers of Catan because he's a manbaby who can't lose (and who accuses Wynn-Williams of cheating when she fails to throw a game of Ticket to Ride while they're flying in his private jet). There's Sandberg, who demands the right to buy a kidney for her child from someone in Mexico, should that child ever need a kidney.</p>
<p>Then there's Kaplan, who is such an extraordinarily stupid and awful oaf that it's hard to pick out just one example, but I'll try. At one point, Wynn-Williams gets Zuck a chance to address the UN General Assembly. As is his wont, Zuck refuses to be briefed before he takes the dais (he's repeatedly described as unwilling to consider any briefing note longer than a single text message). When he gets to the mic, he spontaneously promises that Facebook will provide internet access to refugees all over the world. Various teams at Facebook then race around, trying to figure out whether this is something the company is actually doing, and once they realize Zuck was just bullshitting, set about trying to figure out how to do it. They get some way down this path when Kaplan intervenes to insist that giving away free internet to refugees is a bad idea, and that instead, they should <em>sell</em> internet access to refugees. Facebookers dutifully throw themselves into this absurd project, which dies when Kaplan fires off an email stating that he's just realized that refugees don't have any money. The project dies.</p>
<p>The path that brought Wynn-Williams's into the company of these careless people is a weird – and rather charming – one. As a young woman, Wynn-Williams was a minor functionary in the New Zealand diplomatic corps, and during her foreign service, she grew obsessed with the global political and social potential of Facebook. She threw herself into the project of getting hired to work on Facebook's global team, working on strategy for liaising with governments around the world. The biggest impediment to landing this job is that it doesn't exist: sure, FB was lobbying the US government, but it was monumentally disinterested in the rest of the world in general, and the governments of the world in particular.</p>
<p>But Wynn-Williams persists, pestering potentially relevant execs with requests, working friends-of-friends (Facebook itself is extraordinarily useful for this), and refusing to give up. Then comes the Christchurch earthquake. Wynn-Williams is in the US, about to board a flight, when her sister, a news presenter, calls her while trapped inside a collapsed building (the sister hadn't been able to get a call through to anyone in NZ). Wynn-Williams spends the flight wondering if her sister is dead or alive, and only learns that her sister is OK through a post on Facebook.</p>
<p>The role Facebook played in the Christchurch quake transforms Wynn-Williams's passion for Facebook into something like religious zealotry. She throws herself into the project of landing the job, and she <em>does</em>, and after some funny culture-clashes arising from her Kiwi heritage and her public service background, she settles in at Facebook.</p>
<p>Her early years there are sometimes comical, sometimes scary, and are characteristic of a company that is growing quickly and unevenly. She's dispatched to Myanmar amidst a nationwide block of Facebook ordered by the ruling military junta and at one point, it seems like she's about to get kidnapped and imprisoned by goons from the communications ministry. She arranges for a state visit by NZ Prime Minister John Key, who wants a photo-op with Zuckerberg, who – oblivious to the prime minister standing right there in front of him – berates Wynn-Williams for demanding that he meet with some jackass politician (they do the photo-op anyway).</p>
<p>One thing is clear: Facebook doesn't really care about countries other than America. Though Wynn-Williams chalks this up to plain old provincial chauvinism (which FB's top eschelon possess in copious quantities), there's something else at work. The USA is the only country in the world that a) is rich, b) is populous, and c) has no meaningful privacy protections. If you make money selling access to dossiers on rich people to advertisers, America is the most important market in the world.</p>
<p>But then Facebook conquers America. Not only does FB saturate the US market, it uses its free cash-flow and high share price to acquire potential rivals, like Whatsapp and Instagram, ensuring that American users who leave Facebook (the service) remain trapped by Facebook (the company).</p>
<p>At this point, Facebook – Zuckerberg – turns towards the rest of the world. Suddenly, acquiring non-US users becomes a matter of urgency, and overnight Wynn-Williams is transformed from the sole weirdo talking about global markets to the key asset in pursuit of the company's top priority.</p>
<p>Wynn-Williams's explanation for this shift lies in Zuckerberg's personality, his need to constantly dominate (which is also why his subordinates have learned to let him win at board games). This is doubtless true: not only has this aspect of Zuckerberg's personality been on display in public for decades, Wynn-Williams was able to observe it first-hand, behind closed doors.</p>
<p>But I think that in addition to this personality defect, there's a <em>material</em> pressure for Facebook to grow that Wynn-Williams doesn't mention. Companies that grow get extremely high price-to-earnings (P:E) ratios, meaning that investors are willing to spend many dollars on shares for every dollar the company takes in. Two similar companies with similar earnings can have vastly different valuations (the value of all the stock the company has ever issued), depending on whether one of them is still growing.</p>
<p>High P:E ratios reflect a bet on the part of investors that the company will continue to grow, and those bets only become more extravagant the more the company grows. This is a <em>huge</em> advantage to companies with "growth stocks." If your shares constantly increase in value, they are highly liquid – that is, you can always find someone who's willing to buy your shares from you for cash, which means that you can treat shares <em>like</em> cash. But growth stocks are <em>better</em> than cash, because money grows slowly, if at all (especially in periods of extremely low interest rates, like the past 15+ years). Growth stocks, on the other hand, <em>grow</em>.</p>
<p>Best of all, companies with growth stocks have no trouble finding more stock when they need it. They just type zeroes into a spreadsheet and more shares appear. Contrast this with money. Facebook may take in a lot of money, but the money only arrives when <em>someone else</em> spends it. Facebook's access to money is limited by exogenous factors – your willingness to send your money to Facebook. Facebook's access to shares is only limited by endogenous factors – the company's own willingness to issue new stock.</p>
<p>That means that when Facebook needs to buy something, there's a very good chance that the seller will accept Facebook's stock in lieu of US dollars. Whether Facebook is hiring a new employee or buying a company, it can outbid rivals who only have dollars to spend, because that bidder has to ask someone else for more dollars, whereas Facebook can make its own stock on demand. This is a <em>massive</em> competitive advantage.</p>
<p>But it is also a <em>massive</em> business risk. As Stein's Law has it, "anything that can't go on forever eventually stops." Facebook can't grow forever by signing up new users. Eventually, everyone who might conceivably have a Facebook account will get one. When that happens, Facebook will need to find some other way to make money. They could enshittify – that is, shift value from the company's users and customers to itself. They could invent something new (like metaverse, or AI). But if they can't make those things work, then the company's growth will have ended, and it will <em>instantaneously</em> become grossly overvalued. Its P:E ratio will have to shift from the high value enjoyed by growth stocks to the low value endured by "mature" companies.</p>
<p>When that happens, anyone who is slow to sell will lose a <em>ton</em> of money. So investors in growth stocks tend to keep one fist poised over the "sell" button and sleep with one eye open, watching for any hint that growth is slowing. It's not just that growth gives FB the power to outcompete rivals – it's <em>also</em> the case that growth makes the company vulnerable to massive, sudden devaluations. What's more, if these devaluations are persistent and/or frequent enough, the key FB employees who accepted stock in lieu of cash for some or all of their compensation will either demand <em>lots</em> more cash, or jump ship for a growing rival. These are the very same people that Facebook needs to pull itself out of its nosedives. For a growth stock, even small reductions in growth metrics (or worse, declines) can trigger cascades of compounding, mutually reinforcing collapse.</p>
<p>This is what happened in early 2022, when Meta posted slightly lower-than-anticipated US growth numbers, and the market all pounded on the "sell" button at once, lopping $250,000,000,000 of the company's valuation in 24 hours. At the time, it was the worst-ever single day losses for any company in human history:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/02/03/facebook-faces-an-existential-moment-after-230-billion-stock-crash/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/02/03/facebook-faces-an-existential-moment-after-230-billion-stock-crash/</a></p>
<p>Facebook's conquest of the US market triggered an emphasis on foreign customers, but not just because Zuck is obsessed with conquest. For Facebook, a decline in US growth posed an existential risk, the possibility of mass stock selloffs and with them, the end of the years in which Facebook could acquire key corporate rivals and executives with "money" it could print on the premises, on demand.</p>
<p>So Facebook cast its eye upon the world, and Wynn-Williams's long insistence that the company should be paying attention to the political situation abroad suddenly starts landing with her bosses. But those bosses – Zuck, Sandberg, Kaplan and others – are "careless." Zuck screws up opportunity after opportunity because he refuses to be briefed, forgets what little information he's been given, and blows key meetings because he refuses to get out of bed before noon. Sandberg's visits to Davos are undermined by her relentless need to promote herself, her "Lean In" brand, and her petty gamesmanship. Kaplan is the living embodiment of Green Day's "American Idiot" and can barely fathom that foreigners exist.</p>
<p>Wynn-Williams's adventures during this period are very well told, and are, by turns, harrowing and hilarious. Time and again, Facebook's top brass snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, squandering incredible opportunities that Wynn-Williams secures for them because of their pettiness, short-sightedness, and arrogance (that is, their carelessness).</p>
<p>But Wynn-Williams's disillusionment with Facebook isn't rooted in these frustrations. Rather, she is both personally and professionally aghast at the company's disgusting, callous and cruel behavior. She describes how her boss, Joel Kaplan, relentlessly sexually harasses her, and everyone in a position to make this stop tells her to shut up and take it. When Wynn-Williams give birth to her second child, she hemorrhages, almost dies, and ends up in a coma. Afterwards, Kaplan gives her a negative performance review because she was "unresponsive" to his emails and texts while she was dying in an ICU. This is a significant escalation of the earlier behavior she describes, like pestering her with personal questions about breastfeeding, video-calling her from bed, and so on (Kaplan is Sandberg's ex-boyfriend, and Wynn-Williams describes another creepy event where Sandberg pressures her to sleep next to her in the bedroom on one of Facebook's jets, something Wynn-Williams says she routinely does with the young women who report to her).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zuck is relentlessly pursuing Facebook's largest conceivable growth market: China. The only problem: China doesn't want Facebook. Zuck repeatedly tries to engineer meetings with Xi Jinping so he can plead his case in person. Xi is monumentally hostile to this idea. Zuck learns Mandarin. He studies Xi's book, conspicuously displays a copy of it on his desk. Eventually, he manages to sit next to Xi at a dinner where he begs Xi to name his next child. Xi turns him down.</p>
<p>After years of persistent nagging, lobbying, and groveling, Facebook's China execs start to make progress with a state apparatchik who dangles the possibility of Facebook entering China. Facebook promises this factotum the world – all the surveillance and censorship the Chinese state wants and more. Then, Facebook's contact in China is jailed for corruption, and they have to start over.</p>
<p>At this point, Kaplan has punished Wynn-Williams – she blames it on her attempts to get others to force him to stop his sexual harassment – and cut her responsibilities in half. He tries to maneuver her into taking over the China operation, something he knows she absolutely disapproves of and has refused to work on – but she refuses. Instead, she is put in charge of hiring the new chief of China operations, giving her access to a voluminous paper-trail detailing the company's dealings with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>According to Wynn-Williams, Facebook actually built an extensive censorship and surveillance system for the Chinese state – spies, cops and military – to use against Chinese Facebook users, and FB users globally. They promise to set up caches of global FB content in China that the Chinese state can use to monitor all Facebook activity, everywhere, with the implication that they'll be able to spy on private communications, and censor content for non-Chinese users.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, Facebook is never given access to China. However, the Chinese state <em>is</em> able to use the tools Facebook built for it to attack independence movements, the free press and dissident uprisings in Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Myanmar, a genocide is brewing. NGOs and human rights activists keep reaching out to Facebook to get them to pay attention to the widespread use of the platform to whip up hatred against the country's Muslim minority group, the Rohinga. Despite having expended tremendous amounts of energy to roll out "Free Basics" in Myanmar (a program whereby Facebook bribes carriers to exclude its own services from data caps), with the result that in Myanmar, "the internet" is synonymous with "Facebook," the company has not expended <em>any</em> effort to manage its Burmese presence. The entire moderation staff consists of one (later two) Burmese speakers who are based in Dublin and do not work local hours (later, these two are revealed as likely stooges for the Myanmar military junta, who are behind the genocide plans).</p>
<p>The company has also failed to invest in Burmese language support for its systems – posts written in Burmese script are not stored as Unicode, meaning that none of the company's automated moderation systems can parse it. The company is so hostile to pleas to upgrade these systems that Wynn-Williams and some colleagues create secret, private Facebook groups where they can track the failures of the company and the rising tide of lethal violence in the country (this isn't the only secret dissident Facebook group that Wynn-Williams joins – she's also part of a group of women who have been sexually harassed by colleagues and bosses).</p>
<p>The genocide that follows is horrific beyond measure. And, as with the Trump election, the company's initial posture is that they couldn't possibly have played a significant role in a real-world event that shocked and horrified its rank-and-file employees.</p>
<p>The company, in other words, is "careless." Warned of imminent harms to its users, to democracy, to its own employees, the top executives simply do not care. They ignore the warnings and the consequences, or pay lip service to them. They don't care.</p>
<p>Take Kaplan: after figuring out that the company can't curry favor with the world's governments by selling drone-delivered wifi to refugees (the drones don't fly and the refugees are broke), he hits on another strategy. He remakes "government relations" as a <em>sales office</em>, selling political ads to politicians who are seeking to win over voters, or, in the case of autocracies, disenfranchised hostage-citizens. This is hugely successful, both as a system for securing government cooperation and as a way to transform Facebook's global policy shop from a cost-center to a profit-center.</p>
<p>But of course, it has a price. Kaplan's best customers are dictators and would-be dictators, formenters of hatred and genocide, authoritarians seeking opportunities to purge their opponents, through exile and/or murder.</p>
<p>Wynn-Williams makes a very good case that Facebook is run by awful people who are also very careless – in the sense of being <em>reckless</em>, incurious, indifferent.</p>
<p>But there's another meaning to "careless" that lurks just below the surface of this excellent memoir: "careless" in the sense of "arrogant" – in the sense of not caring about the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>To me, this was the most important – but least-developed – lesson of <em>Careless People</em>. When Wynn-Williams lands at Facebook, she finds herself surrounded by oafs and sociopaths, cartoonishly selfish and shitty people, who, <em>nevertheless</em>, have built a service that she <em>loves</em> and values, along with hundreds of millions of other people.</p>
<p>She's not wrong to be excited about Facebook, or its potential. The company may be run by careless people, but they are still <em>prudent</em>, behaving as though the consequences of screwing up matter. They are "careless" in the sense of "being reckless," but they <em>care</em>, in the sense of having a healthy fear (and thus respect) for what might happen if they fully yield to their reckless impulses.</p>
<p>Wynn-Williams's firsthand account of the next decade is not a story of these people becoming more reckless, rather, its a story in which the possibility of consequences for that recklessness recedes, and with it, so does their care over those consequences.</p>
<p>Facebook buys its competitors, freeing it from market consequences for its bad acts. By buying the places where disaffected Facebook users are seeking refuge – Instagram and Whatsapp – Facebook is able to insulate itself from the discipline of competition – the fear that doing things that are adverse to its users will cause them to flee.</p>
<p>Facebook captures its regulators, freeing it from regulatory consequences for its bad acts. By playing a central role in the electoral campaigns of Obama and then other politicians around the world, Facebook transforms its watchdogs into supplicants who are more apt to beg it for favors than hold it to account.</p>
<p>Facebook tames its employees, freeing it from labor consequences for its bad acts. As engineering supply catches up with demand, Facebook's leadership come to realize that they don't have to worry about workforce uprisings, whether incited by impunity for sexually abusive bosses, or by the company's complicity in genocide and autocratic oppression.</p>
<p>First, Facebook becomes too big to fail.</p>
<p>Then, Facebook becomes too big to jail.</p>
<p>Finally, Facebook becomes too big to <em>care</em>.</p>
<p>This is the "carelessness" that ultimately changes Facebook for the worse, that turns it into the hellscape that Wynn-Williams is eventually fired from after she speaks out once too often. Facebook bosses aren't just "careless" because they refuse to read a briefing note that's longer than a tweet. They're "careless" in the sense that they arrive at a juncture where they don't have to care who they harm, whom they enrage, who they ruin.</p>
<p>There's a telling anaecdote near the end of <em>Careless People</em>. Back in 2017, leaks revealed that Facebook's sales-reps were promising advertisers the ability to market to teens who felt depressed and "worthless":</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/</a></p>
<p>Wynn-Williams is – rightly – aghast about this, and even more aghast when she sees the company's official response, in which they disclaim any knowledge that this capability was being developed and fire a random, low-level scapegoat. Wynn-Williams knows they're lying. She knows that this is a routine offering, one that the company routinely boasts about to advertisers.</p>
<p>But she doesn't mention the <em>other</em> lies that Facebook tells in this moment: for one thing, the company offers advertisers the power to target more teens than actually <em>exist</em>. The company proclaims the efficacy of its "sentiment analysis" tool that knows how to tell if teens are feeling depressed or "worthless," even though these tools are notoriously inaccurate, hardly better than a coin-toss, a kind of digital phrenology.</p>
<p>Facebook, in other words, isn't just lying to the public about what it offers to advertisers – it's lying to advertisers, too. Contra those who say, "if you're not paying for the product, you're the product," Facebook treats <em>anyone</em> it can get away with abusing as "the product" (just like every other tech monopolist):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar">https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar</a></p>
<p>Wynn-Williams documents so many instances in which Facebook's top executives lie – to the courts, to Congress, to the UN, to the press. Facebook lies when it is beneficial to do so – but only when they can get away with it. By the time Facebook was lying to advertisers about its depressed teen targeting tools, it was already colluding with Google to rig the ad market with an illegal tool called "Jedi Blue":</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Blue">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Blue</a></p>
<p>Facebook's story is the story of a company that set out to become <em>too big to care</em>, and achieved that goal. The company's abuses track precisely with its market dominance. It enshittified things for users once it had the users locked in. It screwed advertisers once it captured their market. It did the media-industry-destroying "pivot to video" fraud once it captured the media:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_to_video">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_to_video</a></p>
<p>The important thing about Facebook's carelessness is that it wasn't the result of the many grave personality defects in Facebook's top executives – it was the result of policy choices. Government decisions not to enforce antitrust law, to allow privacy law to wither on the vine, to expand IP law to give Facebook a weapon to shut down interoperable rivals – these all created the enshittogenic environment that allowed the careless people who run Facebook to stop caring.</p>
<p>The corollary: if we change the policy environment, we can make these careless people – and their successors, who run other businesses we rely upon – <em>care</em>. They may never care about <em>us</em>, but we can make them care about what we might do to <em>them</em> if they give in to their carelessness.</p>
<p>Meta is in global regulatory crosshairs, facing antitrust action in the USA:</p>

<p>And muscular enforcement pledges in the EU:</p>

<p>As Martin Luther King, Jr put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/korea/index.html">https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/korea/index.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43778105">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 

<p>
We have solved a traveling salesman problem (TSP) to walk to 81,998 bars in South Korea.
The problem was created using the <a href="https://project-osrm.org/">Open Source Routing Machine</a> (OSRM) to build a table of the 3,361,795,003 point-to-point travel times, one for each pair of bar locations.
Our computation produced a tour together with a proof that it is a shortest-possible route to visit all 81,998 stops when measured with the OSRM times.
</p>

<p>
It would be a very long pub crawl.
The total walking time for the round trip is 15,386,177 seconds, or 178 days, 1 hour, 56 minutes, and 17 seconds.
You will need to stop for plenty of drinks along the way (better stick with water, tea, or Diet Coke if you want to finish the route in only a few years), so it's  not likely you would count every second on such a journey.
But the level of precision makes the point that this not just a good route, it is an optimal solution to the 81,998-stop TSP.
It is not possible to rearrange the order of stops to save even a single second of the OSRM-estimated walking time.
</p>


<p>
This is the largest road-map instance of the TSP that has been solved to provable optimality, exceeding the <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/nl/index.html">57,912-stop tour through the Netherlands</a> solved in February 2021.
The computations were carried out between December 2024 and March 2025 at <a href="https://ruc.dk/en">Roskilde University</a> and at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.
Details of the computing work can be found on the <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/korea/computation.html">Computation</a> page.

  <h2>Interactive map</h2>
</p>


<p>       
The figure below is a screen shot of an interactive map of the korea81998 tour.
The menu on the left-hand-side lets you select one of seven regions to view.
At the top right-hand-side you can choose to have either a colored street map or a grayscale map without street labels.
Just below this menu you can select whether or not to display the stop markers, or to display the tour edges, or to display both.
You can view the map by clicking on the image.

<p>
  <h2>Optimality</h2>
</p>

<p>
Newspapers, popular journals, blogs, and scientific press releases regularly report that solving even tiny instances of the TSP is impossible with the current generation of computers.
A typical example is the following quote from the Washington Post.
</p>

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
"It would take a laptop computer 1,000 years to compute the most efficient route between 22 cities, for example."
</p>
</blockquote>
  
</figure>

<p>
Statements such as this assume the only way to solve the TSP is to check each possible tour, one-by-one.
That clearly cannot work for any of the large instances of the TSP we have solved.
The number of tours in the korea81998 case is roughly <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=81997!">2 followed by 367308 zeroes</a>.
</p>

<p>
This huge number of possible solutions is frightening, but it doesn't mean we can't solve this large example of the TSP.
Our approach combines the <a href="http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/">LKH</a> code for computing extremely good TSP solutions and the <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html">Concorde</a> code for applying what is known as the "cutting-plane method" for producing quality guarantees.
You can see a short discussion of how we apply these tools on the <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/korea/computation.html">Computation</a> page.
</p>

<p>
For a quick glimpse of the cutting-plane method, here is how I describe the process in a <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/case-traveling-salesman-unsolvable-limits-computation/">short piece in Scientific American</a>
</p>
<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
"The idea is to follow Yogi Berra's advice `When you come to a fork in the road, take it.' A tool called linear programming allows us to do just this, assigning fractions to roads joining pairs of cities, rather than deciding immediately whether to use a road or not. It is perfectly fine, in this model, to send half a salesman along both branches of the fork."
</p>

<p>
"The process begins with the requirement that, for every city, the fractions assigned to the arriving and departing roads each sum to one. Then, step-by-step, further restrictions are added, each involving sums of fractions assigned to roads. Linear programming eventually points us to the best decision for each road, and thus the shortest possible route."
</p>

  <h2>P vs NP</h2>
</p>

<p>
A great discussion of the P and NP complexity classes, including connections to the TSP, can be found in Lance Fortnow's article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3460351">Fifty Years of P vs. NP and the Possibility of the Impossible</a>.

<p>
  <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
</p>

<p>
We use large examples of the traveling salesman problem as a means for developing and testing general-purpose optimization methods.
The world has limited resources and the aim of the applied mathematics fields of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization">mathematical optimization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research">operations research</a> is to create tools to help us to use these resources as efficiently as possible.
</p>

<p>
For general information on mathematical modeling and its impact on industry, commerce, medicine, and the environment, we point you to a number of societies that support mathematics research and education:
<a href="http://www.ams.org/home/page">American Mathematical Society</a>,

<p dir="auto">My from-scratch OS with it's own kernel written in C and assembly</p>
<p dir="auto">TacOS is a UNIX-like kernel which is able to run DOOM, among various other smaller userspace programs. It has things like a VFS, scheduler, TempFS, devices, context switching, virtual memory management, physical page frame allocation, and a port of Doom. It runs both on real hardware (tested on my laptop) and in the Qemu emulator.</p>

<p dir="auto">With CubeCL, you can program your GPU using Rust, taking advantage of zero-cost abstractions to develop maintainable, flexible, and efficient compute kernels.
CubeCL currently fully supports functions, generics, and structs, with partial support for traits, methods and type inference.
As the project evolves, we anticipate even broader support for Rust language primitives, all while maintaining optimal performance.</p>

<p dir="auto">The goal of CubeCL is to ease the pain of writing highly optimized compute kernels that are portable across hardware.
There is currently no adequate solution when you want optimal performance while still being multi-platform.
You either have to write custom kernels for different hardware, often with different languages such as CUDA, Metal, or ROCm.
To fix this, we created a Just-in-Time compiler with three core features: <strong>automatic vectorization</strong>, <strong>comptime</strong>, and <strong>autotune</strong>!</p>
<p dir="auto">These features are extremely useful for anyone writing high-performance kernels, even when portability is not a concern.
They improve code composability, reusability, testability, and maintainability, all while staying optimal.
CubeCL also ships with a memory management strategy optimized for throughput with heavy buffer reuse to avoid allocations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our goal extends beyond providing an optimized compute language; we aim to develop an ecosystem of high-performance and scientific computing in Rust.
To achieve this, we're developing linear algebra components that you can integrate into your own kernels.
We currently have an highly optimized matrix multiplication module, leveraging Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware where available, while gracefully falling back to basic instructions on other platforms.
While there's room for improvement, particularly in using custom instructions from newer NVIDIA GPUs, our implementation already delivers impressive performance.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is just the beginning.
We plan to include more utilities such as convolutions, random number generation, fast Fourier transforms, and other essential algorithms.
We are a small team also building <a href="https://burn.dev/" rel="nofollow">Burn</a>, so don't hesitate to contribute and port algorithms; it can help more than you would imagine!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">CubeCL leverages Rust's proc macro system in a unique two-step process:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Parsing: The proc macro parses the GPU kernel code using the syn crate.</li>
<li>Expansion: Instead of immediately generating an Intermediate Representation (IR), the macro generates a new Rust function.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The generated function, semantically similar to the original, is responsible for creating the IR when called.
This approach differs from traditional compilers, which typically generate IR directly after parsing.
Our method enables several key features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Comptime</strong>: By not transforming the original code, it becomes remarkably easy to integrate compile-time optimizations.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Vectorization</strong>: By simply vectorizing the inputs of a CubeCL function, we can determine the vectorization factor of each intermediate variable during the expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Rust Integration</strong>: The generated code remains valid Rust code, allowing it to be bundled without any dependency on the specific runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2><a id="user-content-design" aria-label="Permalink: Design" href="#design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">CubeCL is designed around - you guessed it - Cubes! More specifically, it's based on cuboids, because not all axes are the same size.
Since all compute APIs need to map to the hardware, which are tiles that can be accessed using a 3D representation, our topology can easily be mapped to concepts from other APIs.</p>
<div dir="auto">

<p dir="auto"><em>A cube is composed of units, so a 3x3x3 cube has 27 units that can be accessed by their positions along the x, y, and z axes.
Similarly, a hyper-cube is composed of cubes, just as a cube is composed of units.
Each cube in the hyper-cube can be accessed by its position relative to the hyper-cube along the x, y, and z axes.
Hence, a hyper-cube of 3x3x3 will have 27 cubes.
In this example, the total number of working units would be 27 x 27 = 729.</em></p>
<details>
<summary>Topology Equivalence 👇</summary>

<p dir="auto">Since all topology variables are constant within the kernel entry point, we chose to use the Rust constant syntax with capital letters.
Often when creating kernels, we don't always care about the relative position of a unit within a cube along each axis, but often we only care about its position in general.
Therefore, each kind of variable also has its own axis-independent variable, which is often not present in other languages.</p>

<p dir="auto">High-performance kernels should rely on SIMD instructions whenever possible, but doing so can quickly get pretty complicated!
With CubeCL, you can specify the vectorization factor of each input variable when launching a kernel.
Inside the kernel code, you still use only one type, which is dynamically vectorized and supports automatic broadcasting.
The runtimes are able to compile kernels and have all the necessary information to use the best instruction!
However, since the algorithmic behavior may depend on the vectorization factor, CubeCL allows you to access it directly in the kernel when needed, without any performance loss, using the comptime system!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comptime</h3><a id="user-content-comptime" aria-label="Permalink: Comptime" href="#comptime"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">CubeCL isn't just a new compute language: though it feels like you are writing GPU kernels, you are, in fact, writing compiler plugins that you can fully customize!
Comptime is a way to modify the compiler IR at runtime when compiling a kernel for the first time.</p>
<p dir="auto">This enables lots of optimizations and flexibility without having to write many separate variants of the same kernels to ensure maximal performance.</p>

<p dir="auto">Autotuning drastically simplifies kernel selection by running small benchmarks at runtime to figure out the best kernels with the best configurations to run on the current hardware; an essential feature for portability.
This feature combines gracefully with comptime to test the effect of different comptime values on performance; sometimes it can be surprising!</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if the benchmarks may add some overhead when running the application for the first time, the information gets cached on the device and will be reused.
It is usually a no-brainer trade-off for throughput-oriented programs such as deep learning models.
You can even ship the autotune cache with your program, reducing cold start time when you have more control over the deployment target.</p>

<p dir="auto">CubeCL is currently in <strong>alpha</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">While CubeCL is used in <a href="https://burn.dev/" rel="nofollow">Burn</a>, there are still a lot of rough edges; it isn't refined yet.
The project started as a WebGPU-only backend for Burn.
As we optimized it, we realized that we needed an intermediate representation (IR) that could be optimized then compiled to WGSL.
Having an IR made it easy to support another compilation target, so we made a CUDA runtime.
However, writing kernels directly in that IR wasn't easy, so we created a Rust frontend using the <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/syn">syn</a> crate.
Navigating the differences between CUDA and WebGPU, while leveraging both platforms, forced us to come up with general concepts that worked everywhere.
Hence, CubeCL was born!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        
        <p><b>April, 2025</b></p>

        <p>
            YAGNI, or, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">You aren't gonna need it</a>,
            is a standard piece of advice that warns against over engineering
            and building too many features too early. I think its great and saves you from wasting time, which
            can kill a project.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, there's an exception that I call YAGRI, or, "You are gonna read it". It means that you shouldn't just store
            the minimum
            data required to satisfy the current product spec. You should also store data that you'll highly likely use (read),
            such as timestamps and contextual metadata.
        </p>

        <p>
            This problem tends to happen when a UI design shows that you only need to display a few specific bits of data to the
            user,
            so you only store those exact fields in the database. You've satisfied the design and ship it. Then later you realize
            you're missing valuable information to help debug an issue, do internal analytics, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an example, this commonly occurs when implementing a feature to let users delete something. The easy way
            is to just
            delete the row from the database, and maybe that's all that the current UI design call for.
            In this situation, regardless of the requested feature set, as engineers we should maintain good data standards
            and store:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>who deleted it</li>
            <li>how they deleted it (with what permission)</li>
            <li>when</li>
            <li>why (surrounding context, if possible)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In general, these are some useful fields to store on almost any table:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>created_at</li>
            <li>updated_at</li>
            <li>deleted_at (soft deletes)</li>
            <li>created_by etc</li>
            <li>permission used during CRUD</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This practice will pay off with just a single instance of your boss popping into a meeting and going "wait
            do we know why that thing was deleted, the customer is worried...".
            
        </p>
        <p>
            However, not every one of these fields that you store will end up serving a purpose. But maybe just a single
            field on a single table will save you one day, and that makes up for the costs of implementing a dozen others.
            Most of the apps we build, at the end of the day, are about storing data to keep track of facts.            
            It's quite possibly your most important job as an engineer to steward and maintain this data.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course you can go too far in the other direction. You shouldnt just log everything.
            But I've never heard someone complain about a table having too many timestamps.
        </p>

												<p>A whistleblower at the <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong> (NLRB) alleged last week that denizens of Elon Musk’s <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE) siphoned gigabytes of data from the agency’s sensitive case files in early March. The whistleblower said accounts created for DOGE at the NLRB downloaded three code repositories from <strong>GitHub</strong>. Further investigation into one of those code bundles shows it is remarkably similar to a program published in January 2025 by <strong>Marko Elez</strong>, a 25-year-old DOGE employee who has worked at a number of Musk’s companies.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/whistleblower-doge-siphoned-nlrb-case-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a whistleblower complaint</a> filed last week by&nbsp;<strong>Daniel J. Berulis</strong>, a 38-year-old security architect at the NLRB, officials from DOGE met with NLRB leaders on March 3 and demanded the creation of several&nbsp;all-powerful “tenant admin” accounts that were to be exempted from network logging activity that would otherwise keep a detailed record of all actions taken by those accounts.</p>
<p>Berulis said the new DOGE accounts had unrestricted permission to read, copy, and alter information contained in NLRB databases. The new accounts also could restrict log visibility, delay retention, route logs elsewhere, or even remove them entirely — top-tier user privileges that neither Berulis nor his boss possessed.</p>
<p>Berulis said he discovered one of the DOGE accounts had downloaded three external code libraries from <strong>GitHub</strong> that neither NLRB nor its contractors ever used. A “readme” file in one of the code bundles explained it was created to rotate connections through a large pool of cloud Internet addresses that serve “<em>as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing</em>.” Brute force attacks involve automated login attempts that try many credential combinations in rapid sequence.</p>
<p>A search on that description in Google brings up a code repository at GitHub for a user with the account name “<strong>Ge0rg3</strong>” who published a program roughly four years ago called “<a href="https://github.com/Ge0rg3/requests-ip-rotator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requests-ip-rotator</a>,” described as a library that will allow the user “to bypass IP-based rate-limits for sites and services.”</p>

<p>“A Python library to utilize AWS API Gateway’s large IP pool as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing,” the description reads.</p>
<p>Ge0rg3’s code is “open source,” in that anyone can copy it and reuse it non-commercially. As it happens, there is a newer version of this project that was derived or “forked” from Ge0rg3’s code — called “<a href="https://github.com/markoelez/async-ip-rotator/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">async-ip-rotator</a>” — and it was committed to GitHub in January 2025 by DOGE captain <a href="https://github.com/markoelez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marko Elez</a>.</p>

<p>A key DOGE staff member who gained access to the Treasury Department’s central payments system, Elez has worked for a number of Musk companies, including <strong>X</strong>, <strong>SpaceX</strong>, and <strong>xAI</strong>. Elez was among the first DOGE employees to face public scrutiny, after <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked him to social media posts</a> that advocated racism and eugenics.</p>
<p>Elez resigned after that brief scandal, but was rehired after President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance expressed support for him. <strong>Politico</strong> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/29/doge-marco-elez-software-engineer-us-payroll-00259303" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> Elez is now a <strong>Labor Department</strong> aide detailed to multiple agencies, including the <strong>Department of Health and Human Services</strong>.</p>
<p>“During Elez’s initial stint at Treasury, he violated the agency’s information security policies by sending a spreadsheet containing names and payments information to officials at the General Services Administration,” Politico wrote, citing court filings.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from both the NLRB and DOGE, and will update this story if either responds.<span id="more-71075"></span></p>
<p>The NLRB has been effectively hobbled since <strong>President Trump</strong> fired three board members, leaving the agency without the quorum it needs to function. Both&nbsp;<strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;and Musk’s&nbsp;<strong>SpaceX</strong>&nbsp;have&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/amazon-nlrb-unconstitutional-spacex-elon-musk-ab42977117d883e97110a7bf8e8b257f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been suing</a>&nbsp;the NLRB over complaints the agency filed in disputes about workers’ rights and union organizing, arguing that the NLRB’s very existence is unconstitutional. On March 5, a U.S. appeals court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/musks-spacex-loses-early-legal-challenge-us-labor-boards-powers-2025-03-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously rejected</a>&nbsp;Musk’s claim that the NLRB’s structure somehow violates the Constitution.</p>
<p>Berulis’s complaint alleges the DOGE accounts at NLRB downloaded more than 10 gigabytes of data from the agency’s case files, a database that includes reams of sensitive records including information about employees who want to form unions and proprietary business documents. Berulis said he went public after higher-ups at the agency told him not to report the matter to the US-CERT, as they’d previously agreed.</p>
<p>Berulis told KrebsOnSecurity he worried the unauthorized data transfer by DOGE could unfairly advantage defendants in a number of ongoing labor disputes before the agency.</p>
<p>“If any company got the case data that would be an unfair advantage,” Berulis said. “They could identify and fire employees and union organizers without saying why.”</p>
<div id="attachment_71106"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71106" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/markoelez.png" alt="" width="444" height="515"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71106">Marko Elez, in a photo from a social media profile.</p></div>
<p>Berulis said the other two GitHub archives that DOGE employees downloaded to NLRB systems included <strong>Integuru</strong>, a software framework designed to reverse engineer application programming interfaces (APIs) that websites use to fetch data; and a “headless” browser called <strong>Browserless</strong>, which is made for automating web-based tasks that require a pool of browsers, such as web scraping and automated testing.</p>
<p>On February 6, someone <a href="https://github.com/markoelez/async-ip-rotator/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a lengthy and detailed critique</a> of Elez’s code on the GitHub “issues” page for async-ip-rotator, calling it “insecure, unscalable and a fundamental engineering failure.”</p>
<p>“If this were a side project, it would just be bad code,” the reviewer wrote. “But if this is representative of how you build production systems, then there are much larger concerns. This implementation is fundamentally broken, and if anything similar to this is deployed in an environment handling sensitive data, it should be audited immediately.”</p>

<p><span>TOKYO - April 18, 2025 - </span>NTT Corporation (Headquarters: Chiyoda, Tokyo; President and CEO: Akira Shimada; hereinafter "NTT") has become the first in the world to successfully trigger and guide lightning using a drone. This experiment also demonstrated, under natural lightning conditions, the effectiveness of both the drone's lightning protection technology and the electric field-based lightning triggering method. These results are expected to contribute to further research on the still-mysterious mechanisms of lightning and to help reduce lightning-related damage to cities and people.</p>
<!-- [/c-box-1] -->

<h3>Background</h3>
<!-- [/c-ttl-2] -->

<p>Lightning strikes are one of the most destructive natural phenomena affecting human society. While the NTT Group has implemented various lightning protection measures for critical infrastructure—including telecommunications facilities—lightning-related damage remains a persistent issue. In Japan alone, the estimated annual cost of lightning damage ranges from 100 to 200 billion yen<sup>1</sup>. Building on its long-standing expertise in protecting communications equipment from lightning, NTT is now working to advance this technology further, with the aim of eliminating lightning strikes on infrastructure and urban areas altogether.<br>
　Traditionally, lightning protection has relied heavily on lightning rods. However, their protective range is limited, and in some cases—such as wind turbines or outdoor event venues—it may not be feasible to install them. At NTT, we are exploring the use of rapidly advancing drone technology to create a new approach: "drone-triggered lightning"<sup>2</sup>. This method involves flying drones into optimal positions beneath thunderclouds to actively trigger lightning strikes, and then guiding the discharge safely away from vulnerable areas.</p>
<!-- [/c-txt-1] -->

<h3>Overview and Key Findings of the Experiment</h3>
<!-- [/c-ttl-2] -->

<p>From December 2024 to January 2025, a lightning-triggering experiment using drones was conducted at an elevation of 900 meters in a mountainous area of Hamada City, Shimane Prefecture. In this experiment, a device called a field mill<sup>3</sup> was used to monitor the electric field at ground level. When the electric field strength increased due to the approach of a thundercloud, a drone equipped with a custom-designed lightning protection cage was launched to attempt lightning triggering (Figure 1).</p>
<!-- [/c-txt-1] -->

<p>
    <img src="https://group.ntt/en/newsrelease/2025/04/18/img/250418aa.jpg" alt="Figure 1 Lightning Protection Drone">
    <span><span><span>Figure 1 </span><span>Lightning Protection Drone</span></span></span>
</p>
<!-- [/c-img-4] -->

<p>On December 13, 2024, during the approach of a thundercloud, the electric field strength observed by the field mill increased. At that moment, a drone equipped with a conductive wire was flown to an altitude of 300 meters. The drone was then electrically connected to the ground via a switch installed on the ground (Figure 2). As a result, a large current was observed flowing through the wire, accompanied by a significant change in the surrounding electric field strength (Figure 3).<br>
　Just before the lightning strike, it was confirmed that a voltage of over 2000 volts had developed between the wire and the ground. This rapid increase in local electric field strength triggered a lightning strike directed at the drone. This marks the first successful case in the world of triggering lightning using a drone.<br>
　At the moment of the strike, a loud cracking sound was heard, a flash was observed at the winch, and partial melting occurred in the drone's lightning protection cage (Figure 4). However, the drone equipped with the protective cage continued to fly stably even after the lightning strike.</p>

<h3>Technical Highlights</h3>
<!-- [/c-ttl-2] -->

<p>To successfully trigger lightning using a drone, the drone must remain operational even after being struck. Moreover, simply flying a drone under a thundercloud is not sufficient to attract lightning; an active triggering method is required. To address these challenges, we proposed and demonstrated the following two key technologies:</p>
<!-- [/c-txt-1] -->

<h4>(1) Lightning Protection Technology for Drones</h4>
<!-- [/c-ttl-3] -->

<p>We developed a lightning protection cage design that prevents malfunction or damage even if the drone is directly struck by lightning. This cage, which can be mounted on commercially available drones, is made of conductive metal and functions as a shield. It redirects the high current from the lightning strike away from the drone's internal components, preventing it from flowing through the drone itself. Additionally, the cage is designed to distribute the lightning current radially, which cancels out the strong magnetic fields generated by the current and minimizes electromagnetic interference with the drone (Figure 5).<br>
　Furthermore, we conducted artificial lightning tests on drones equipped with the lightning protection cage. The results showed that the system withstood artificial strikes of up to 150 kA—five times greater than the average natural lightning strike—without any malfunction or damage, covering over 98% of naturally occurring lightning conditions.</p>

    <span><span><span>Figure 5 </span><span>Lightning Protection Design for High Current and Strong Magnetic Fields</span></span></span>
</p>
<!-- [/c-img-4] -->

<h4>(2) Electric Field–Based Lightning Triggering Technology</h4>
<!-- [/c-ttl-3] -->

<p>To actively trigger lightning, we devised a method in which a conductive wire connects the drone to the ground, with a high-voltage switch installed on the ground side. By operating this switch at the optimal moment, we can rapidly change the electric field around the drone. This sharp increase in local electric field strength encourages a lightning discharge to occur toward the drone (Figure 6).</p>
<!-- [/c-txt-1] -->

    <span><span><span>Figure 6 </span><span>Principle of Electric Field–Based Lightning Triggering Technology</span></span></span>
</p>
<!-- [/c-img-4] -->

<h3>Outlook</h3>
<!-- [/c-ttl-2] -->

<p>NTT aims to protect cities and people from lightning damage by flying drones—designed to withstand direct lightning strikes—to accurately predict lightning-prone locations, actively trigger strikes, and safely guide them away. To improve the success rate of drone-based lightning triggering, we will continue to advance research and development in two key areas: high-precision lightning location prediction and a deeper understanding of lightning mechanisms. In addition, we aim to not only trigger and control lightning, but also to harness its energy. Future efforts will focus on developing technologies for capturing and storing lightning energy for potential use (Figure 7).</p>

<p><em>“The best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times… The best moments usually occur if a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.”</em> — Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I know I’ve posted some upbeat content about AI before, <a href="https://terriblesoftware.org/2024/12/14/weve-been-here-before/">celebrating its potential</a> and <a href="https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/04/07/making-ai-actually-work-on-your-team/">encouraging teams to embrace these tools</a>. And honestly, I still believe in that future. But today I want to share something more personal, more nuanced — the one thing that currently worries me most about using AI for software development: <strong>lack of joy</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s easy to talk about productivity gains, competitive advantages, and how AI will reshape our industry. <a href="https://terriblesoftware.org/tag/ai/">We’ve had those conversations</a>. What’s harder to discuss is what might be lost along the way – something intangible but vital to many of us who chose this profession not just for the paycheck, but because we genuinely love the craft of programming.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s 8:47 AM, fresh coffee steams on the table, and my headphones cocoon me in the perfect playlist. I go to Asana, where I know <em>exactly</em> what I need to do that day. I open Neovim and code starts <em>flowing</em> through me. I’ve lost the sense of time; I’m completely present in the moment.</p>



<p>That, my friends, is what I used to describe as a happy work day. I’m sure that some of you will resonate.</p>



<p>Those days I’d emerge tired but fulfilled. Something about the direct connection between thought and creation — where my fingers were simply the conduit for translating ideas into working software — felt almost transcendent. The struggle to solve problems, the small victories along the way, and the satisfaction of building something from nothing… these weren’t just aspects of the job; they were the reason I fell in love with programming in the first place.</p>



<p>This experience I’m describing is what psychologists call “flow” — a mental state where you’re fully immersed in an activity, energized by deep focus and complete involvement. First described by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> (the psychologist I quoted at the beginning), flow is that sweet spot where challenge meets skill, where the task at hand is neither too easy (causing boredom) nor too difficult (causing anxiety). It’s a state strongly associated with creativity, productivity, and most importantly — happiness. For software developers, it’s that magical zone where problems become puzzles rather than obstacles, where hours pass like minutes, and where the boundary between you and your code seems to dissolve.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and that joy of coding is decreasing rapidly. Well, I’m a manager these days, so there’s that… But even when I do get technical, I usually just open Cursor and prompt my way out of 90% of it. It’s way more productive, but more passive as well.</p>



<p>Instead of that deep immersion where I’d craft each function, I’m now more like a <em>curator</em>? I describe what I want, evaluate what the AI gives me, tweak the prompts, and iterate. It’s efficient, yes. Revolutionary, even. But something essential feels missing — that state of flow where time vanishes and you’re completely absorbed in creation. If this becomes the dominant workflow across teams, do we risk an industry full of highly productive yet strangely detached developers?</p>



<hr>



<p>So that’s what I’m worried about, and honestly, I have no idea what to think of it. On one hand, it’s clear to me that people using AI tools <em>are</em> more productive. On the other hand, I worry about long-term happiness and joy in their craft when they’re simply hitting tab to generate code rather than writing it themselves.</p>



<p>When we outsource the parts of programming that used to demand our complete focus and creativity, do we also outsource the opportunity for satisfaction? Can we find the same fulfillment in prompt engineering that we once found in problem-solving through code?</p>



<p>Perhaps what we need is a new understanding of where happiness can exist in this AI-augmented world. Maybe the joy doesn’t have to disappear completely — it just shifts. Instead of finding delight in writing the perfect algorithm, perhaps we’ll discover satisfaction in the higher-level thinking about system design, in the creative process of describing exactly what we want to build, or in the human aspects of software development that AI can’t touch.</p>



<p>I don’t have all the answers. But maybe, just maybe, we need to be intentional about preserving (some) spaces in our work where flow can still happen — where we still code by hand sometimes, not because it’s efficient, but because it make us happy.</p>



<p>After all, if we lose the joy in our craft, what exactly are we optimizing for?</p>

    <p>It turns out that LLMs can make CAD models for simple 3D mechanical parts. And, I think they’ll be extremely good at it soon.</p>

<p>Code generation is the first breakthrough application for LLMs. What would an AI agent look like for mechanical engineering?

Mechanical engineers typically design CAD using point-and-click software (e.g. Fusion 360, Solidworks, and Onshape). How could AI generate these solid models instead?</p>

<h2 id="code-generation-meets-cad">Code generation meets CAD</h2>

<p>One promising direction is training a generative model on millions of existing CAD files. This approach is being actively researched by <a href="https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/pdfs/brepgen.pdf">multiple</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09492">teams</a> who are investigating both diffusion and transformer architectures. In particular, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1qQ5DOsUI">Autodesk Research</a>’s approach to encode the parametric primitives (points, curves, shapes, extrusions, etc) into a transformer architecture. However, as far as I understand, the models in these projects cannot yet take an arbitrary input command and generate a desired shape.</p>

<p>Then a few weeks ago, I was inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp">recent use of LLMs to drive Blender</a>, the open source modeling tool widely used for animation. Given that LLMs are incredibly good at generating code, perhaps programmatic interfaces for CAD modeling could be used to generate solid models in a similar way. I immediately thought of <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, an open-source programmatic CAD tool that’s been developed for more than 15 years. Instead of using point-and-click software to create a solid model, the user writes a software script, which is then rendered into the solid CAD model.</p>

<h2 id="llms-rock-at-writing-openscad">LLMs rock at writing OpenSCAD</h2>

<p>To test it out, I created a simple project in Cursor, made a blank OpenSCAD script (Cursor.scad), and added some Cursor rules:</p>

<div><pre><code># Your rule content

- We're creating files to model things in open scad. 
- All the OpenScad files you create will be in Cursor.scad. I've set up this file such that if you edit it, it will automatically be read by OpenScad (it's the open file in the program). 
- If I want to save what you've done, I'll tell you and you should create a new file and put it in the Saved folder. 
- That's it! Overtime, if needed, we could create documentation about how to use OpenScad. 
- If I'm asking you to create a new design, you should delete the current contents of cursor.scad and add the new design into it.
- When I make requests you should always first develop a step by step plan. Then tell me the step by step plan. And then I'll tell you to start modeling. 
- When you're going through the step by step plans, only execute one step at a time. 
- When you've executed a step, ask the user if its right.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, I started using Cursor to create solid models.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:  “Create an iPhone case”.</p>

<p><img src="https://willpatrick.xyz/assets/images/blog/iphone.gif" alt="iPhone GIF"></p>

<p>It didn’t nail it on the first try, but with a couple of iterations (including giving it screenshots) we created a basic case.</p>

<p>You can also leverage OpenSCAD libraries (there are many public ones). Here, I use a library to make a thread for a flange.</p>

<p><img src="https://willpatrick.xyz/assets/images/blog/flange.gif" alt="Flange GIF"></p>

<p>One thing that’s pretty neat is that the LLM can use its general knowledge of mechanical engineering. For example, above, Cursor created holes in the pipe for M6 bolts and it correctly made the diameter slightly bigger than 6 mm, so the bolts could pass through.</p>

<pre><code>bolt_hole_d = 6.5; // Diameter for M6 bolts
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, one of the really nice things about this approach is that the files are editable and Cursor defaults to parameterizing all the key elements of the design. In the above example, I asked it to add holes for mounting bolts, which it did, and then I edited the number of holes manually to 3 from 4.</p>

<pre><code>// Flange parameter
flange_OD = 50; // Outer diameter of the flange in mm 
flange_thickness = 10; // Thickness of the flange in mm
pipe_size = 1/2; // NPT Pipe Size

// Bolt hole parameters
num_bolts = 3;
bolt_hold_d = 6.5; // Diameter for M6 bolts
bold_hole_circle = 35; // Diameter for the bolt circle
</code></pre>

<h2 id="building-an-eval-for-llm---openscad---stl">Building an eval for LLM -&gt; OpenSCAD -&gt; STL</h2>

<p>I was impressed by these initial results but I wanted to learn more. For example, did the model’s reasoning ability help it think through the steps of creating a part? So, I decided to develop an evaluation to test the performance of various LLMs at generating solid models via OpenSCAD.</p>

<p>One of the challenges with creating an eval for CAD design is that most tasks have many correct answers. For example, a task such as “make a m3 screw that’s 10mm long” could have many correct answers because the length, diameter, and style of the head are not defined in the task. To account for this, I decided to write the tasks in my eval such that there was only a single, correct interpretation of the geometry.</p>

<p>For example, here is one of the tasks in the eval:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a 3mm thickness rectangular plate with two holes.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The plate is 18mm x 32mm in dimension.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>When looking down at the plate, it has two holes that are drilled through it. In the bottom left of the plate, there’s a hole with a centerpoint that is 3mm from the short (18mm) side and 3 mm from the long (32mm) side. This hole has a diameter of 2mm.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In roughly the top left corner of plate, there’s a hole of diameter 3mm. Its center point is 8mm from the short side (18mm side) and 6mm away from the long (32mm) side.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The benefit of this approach is that we can score each task as a Pass or Fail and we can do this in an automated way. I wrote 25 total CAD tasks which ranged in difficulty from a single operation (“A 50mm long pipe that has a 10mm outer diameter and 2mm wall thickness”) to 5 sequential operations. For each task, I designed a reference CAD model using Autodesk Fusion 360 and then exported a STL mesh file.</p>

<p>Then, I set about programming the automated eval pipeline (of course, <a href="https://willpatrick.xyz/software/2025/03/17/software-with-a-market-of-one.html">I didn’t actually write much code</a>).</p>

<p>Here is how the eval pipeline works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For each task and model, the eval sends the text prompt (along with a system prompt) to the LLM via API.</li>
  <li>The LLM sends back the openSCAD code.</li>
  <li>The openSCAD code is rendered into a STL</li>
  <li>The generated STL is automatically checked against the reference STL</li>
  <li>The task “passes” if it passes a number of geometric checks.</li>
  <li>The results are then outputted in a dashboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>
graph LR
    A[Start Eval For each Task &amp; Model] --&gt; B{Send System + Task Prompt to LLM};
    B --&gt; C[LLM Returns OpenSCAD];
    C --&gt; D{Render OpenSCAD to STL};
    D --&gt; E{Compare Generated STL to Reference STL};
    E --&gt; I[Output Eval Results to Dashboard];
</p>

<p>[Note: The eval runs multiple replicates per task x model combo. And the eval is executed in parallel, because there can be 1000+ tasks when running the full evaluation.]</p>

<p>Here’s how the geometric check works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The generated STL and reference STL are aligned using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm.</li>
  <li>The aligned meshes are then compared by:
    <ul>
      <li>Their volumes (pass = &lt;2% diff)</li>
      <li>Their bounding boxes (pass = &lt;1 mm)</li>
      <li>The average chamfer distance between the parts (pass = &lt;1 mm)</li>
      <li>The Hausdorff distance (95% percentile) (pass = &lt;1 mm)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To “pass” the eval, all of the geometric checks must be passed.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few areas where the eval pipeline could be improved. In particular, false negatives are common (est: ~5%). I’ve also noticed that occasionally, small features that are incorrect (like a small radius fillet) are not caught by the automated geometry check. Nevertheless, the eval pipeline is still good enough to see interesting results and compare the performance of the various LLMs.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about the eval, use it, or check out the tasks, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/wgpatrick/cadeval">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there are a number of ways to improve the evaluation. Here are a few things that I’d like to do next:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More tasks with greater coverage</li>
  <li>Optimize system prompts, in particular by adding OpenSCAD documentation and code snippets</li>
  <li>Create an eval variation that uses sketches and drawings as input</li>
  <li>Add another variation that tests the ability of the LLM to add operations to existing OpenSCAD script and STL</li>
  <li>Evaluate the ability of the LLM to fix mistakes in an existing STL / OpenSCAD code</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rapid-improvement-of-frontier-models">Rapid improvement of frontier models</h2>

<p>Here are the results from an eval run executed on April 22, 2025. In the eval run, 15 different models were tested on the 25 tasks with 2 replicates were task. All of the results and configuration details from the run are available <a href="https://willpatrick.xyz/cadevalresults_20250422_095709/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The results show that LLMs only became good at OpenSCAD solid modeling recently.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://willpatrick.xyz/assets/images/blog/overall_result2.png" alt="Results from CadEval">
  <figcaption>Results from CadEval. In this run, each model attempted to complete 25 tasks (2 replicates per task). "Success" means they passed a number of geometric checks that compared to a reference geometry.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The top 3 models were all launched while I was working on the project and the top 7 models are all reasoning models. These models offer large performance increases compared to their predecessor, non-reasoning counterparts. Sonnet 3.5 is the best non-reasoning model and Sonnet 3.7 is only slightly better performing in the eval (for Sonnet 3.7, thinking was used with a budget of 2500 tokens).</p>

<p>Digging into the results offers some interesting insights. First, the LLMs are quite good at generating OpenSCAD code that compiles correctly and can be rendered into a STL. In other words, only a small portion of the failures are coming from things like OpenSCAD syntax errors. Anthropic’s Sonnet models are the best at this.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://willpatrick.xyz/assets/images/blog/stl_render_success.png" alt="Rendering Success Rate">
  <figcaption>For the same eval run as above, the % of tasks for each model where a STL was rendered (and the geometry was checked).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Additionally, we can look at the success rate for tasks where a STL was rendered. The o3-mini is quite strong, with nearly the same sucess rate as the full-size o3 model, while Sonnet 3.7 appears to be a step behind the leading Gemini 2.5 Pro and o1, o3, o4-mini, and o3-mini models.</p>

</figure>

<p>Finally, to be expected, Gemini 2.5 and o4-mini are substantially cheaper and slightly faster to run than the full o3 and o1 models.</p>

</figure>

<p>As expected, some tasks were easy and some tasks were hard to complete.</p>

  <img src="https://willpatrick.xyz/assets/images/blog/task_success_rate.png" alt="Pass rate for each of the 25 tasks">
  <figcaption>Overall success rate task by task.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Generally, speaking tasks with more operations we’re more challenging.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://willpatrick.xyz/assets/images/blog/part_complexity.png" alt="Pass rate by part complexity">
  <figcaption>Each task required 1 to 5 operations to complete manually in Fusion360. Within the eval, there were 5 tasks that required a single operation, 5 required two, and so forth. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tasks 2, Task 3, and Task 6 were the easiest tasks with over 80% correct across models. Here’s what these tasks looked like with example successes.</p>



<p>Only 2 tasks had 0% success, task 11 and task 15. Here are the prompts for those two tasks and representative failures.</p>



<p>These failures are both interesting and quite different. Task 11 is a good example of poor spatial reasoning. In the specific failure highlighted in the image, the model extrudes the shank of the eyebolt  orthogonally to the torus (instead of in the same plane). Task 15 is a different failure mode. It’s hard to see in the attached image, but if you zoom in closely, it’s clear that the generated shape is slightly larger than the reference shape (which makes sense, because the generated STL failed the volume check). From looking at the OpenSCAD code for this example, it appears that the failure is due to using OpenSCAD’s <a href="https://www.openscad.info/index.php/2020/10/18/hull/">hull operation</a>, which is not precisely the same as a loft operation. OpenSCAD does not have a loft operation built-in.</p>

<p>Tasks 20-24 all required 5 sequential operations and the average success rate for these tasks ranged from 3.3% to 30%. Here are the prompts for those 5 tasks with representative successes and failures.</p>

<p>The failures can be tricky to spot. The green areas of the failed images should have geometry in the generated STL, but do not (the reference point cloud is plotted in green). Likewise, the red areas have geometry in the generated STL, but they shouldn’t.</p>



<h2 id="start-ups">Start-ups</h2>

<p>In the past few months, two different start-ups launched text-to-CAD products, AdamCad and Zoo.dev. Zoo.dev offers an API to use their text-to-CAD model. Zoo’s demos of their API and text-to-CAD product are very cool and look quite similar to the Cursor -&gt; OpenSCAD demo I have above.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're excited to announce the launch of Zoo.dev, a text-to-CAD API that lets you generate 3D models from text descriptions.</p><p>We've been working on this for the past year, and we're finally ready to share it with the world.</p><p>Here's a thread on what we've built 🧵 <a href="https://t.co/Yd9Yd9Ixqm">pic.twitter.com/Yd9Yd9Ixqm</a></p></div>— Abhishek (@abhi1thakur) <a href="https://twitter.com/abhi1thakur/status/1881766438383337573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2024</a></blockquote>


<p>I added Zoo into the eval pipeline to compare against LLM -&gt; OpenSCAD -&gt; STL. Instead of generating OpenSCAD, the Zoo.dev API shoots back a STL directly. Zoo says they use <a href="https://zoo.dev/machine-learning-api">a proprietary dataset and machine learning model</a>. To my surprise, Zoo’s API didn’t perform particularly well in comparison to LLMs generating STLs by creating OpenSCAD. Despite that, I’m excited to see the development of Zoo.dev and I will be eager to see how future model launches from Zoo.dev compare to LLMs creating OpenSCAD.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>I think these initial results are promising. Cursor (or another coding agent) + OpenSCAD offers a solution for producing solid models in an automated way.</p>

<p>However, I don’t think this approach is about to take off and spread rapidly through the CAD design ecosystem. The current set-up is seriously clunky and I think substantial product improvements are needed to make this work better. Similar to how Cursor, Windsurf, and other tools have developed specific UX and LLM workflows for code generation, I imagine there will be substantial work required to develop workflows and UX that make sense for CAD generation. Here are a few ideas that I think could be worth pursuing in this direction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools that bring in console logs and viewport images to Cursor from OpenSCAD for iterative improvement and debugging.</li>
  <li>A UI to highlight (and measure) certain faces, lines, or aspects of a part, which are fed to the LLM for additional context.</li>
  <li>Drawing or sketch-input, so the user can quickly visually communicate their ideas.</li>
  <li>A UI with sliders to adjust parameters instead of editing the code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I expect that further model advances will continue to unlock this application. In particular, improving spatial reasoning is an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05786">active area of research</a>. I imagine that improved spatial reasoning could greatly improve models’ ability to design parts step by step.</p>

<p>So when does text-to-CAD become a commonly used tool for mechanical engineers? With start-ups actively building products and the rapid improvement of frontier models, my guess would be something like 6-24 months.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-this-go">Where does this go?</h2>

<p>In the medium to long term (2-10 years), I imagine that most parts will be created with a form of GenCAD. Allow me to speculate.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initially, GenCAD will be used to create parts that fit within existing assemblies. For example, you might say: “I need a bracket that fits here.”  And, the GenCAD tool will create a bracket that perfectly joins with the existing assembly components. Want to analyze three variants with FEA? Ask for them. I expect mainstream CAD suites (Autodesk, Solidworks, Onshape) to add these capabilities directly into their product suite.</li>
  <li>Longer term, I imagine GenCAD will reach every aspect of a CAD suite: sketches, mates, assemblies, exploded views, CAM tool-pathing, rendering visualizations, and CAE. Imagine a design review where you highlight a subassembly and say “replace these rivets with M6 countersunk screws and regenerate the BOM.” The model, drawings, and purchasing spreadsheet all update in seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re watching CAD begin to exit the manual-input era. I, for one, am quite excited about that.</p>

<hr>
<p>Some Lisps, like Common Lisp, have a powerful feature that tends to go underappreciated amidst all the talk about macros: the ability to recompile your program while it's running, without restarting it. For the purposes of this post, and because it sounds cool, let's call this ability <em>livecoding</em><sup id="fnref:livecod"><a href="#fn:livecod">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Entering this strange land where the programs never stop, we'll first take a brief tour of Common Lisp and one of its graphics frameworks, Sketch, before walking through a livecoded implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids algorithm</a>.</p>

<h3 id="wait-what-exactly-is-this-livecoding-thing">"Wait, what exactly is this livecoding thing?"</h3>
<p>Consider the typical workflow needed to modify a running application, like a videogame.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the application.</li>
<li>Change the code.</li>
<li>(If a compiled language) Wait N time units for a full recompilation.</li>
<li>Start the application again.</li>
<li>Fiddle with the application to get it back to its previous state.</li>
<li>Carry on.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a livecoding environment, the application is never stopped, which eliminates steps 1, 4 and 5. Instead, small code changes (which can be as granular as recompiling a single function) are immediately reflected in the running program. Step 3 is often instantaneous because only the changed parts of the program must be recompiled. In theory, then, you can develop an entire application while it continuously runs in the background, without ever waiting for code to recompile. This makes the development process more fluid and interactive, with minimal downtime.</p>
<p>In Common Lisp, the workflow might look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a small change to a single function.</li>
<li>Recompile the function (instantaneous).</li>
<li>Carry on.</li>
</ol>
<p>For an example of this workflow in action, check out Common Lisp and Emacs being used as an environment for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkYUU0UoB_0">live musical performance</a>. You can hear about a Lisp program being debugged remotely while running in <a href="https://corecursive.com/lisp-in-space-with-ron-garret/">deep space</a>. Livecoding (or hot reloading, or whatever you like to call it) is also available in other languages, like Smalltalk and Erlang.</p>
<h3 id="a-rough-sketch-of-sketch">A rough sketch of Sketch</h3>
<p>Before jumping into Boids, let's take a brief look at <a href="https://github.com/vydd/sketch">Sketch</a>, our Common Lisp graphics framework of choice. We'll be more concerned with big ideas than with code minutiae, but if you're unfamiliar with Common Lisp and want to understand the code samples, then please take a detour through <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/common-lisp/">Learn Common Lisp in Y Minutes</a>.</p>
<p>So, Sketch. The Sketch API is heavily based on that of <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>. Its primary entry point is the <code>defsketch</code> macro. The code below defines a "sketch" called <code>my-sketch</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>(</span><span>defsketch</span> <span>my-sketch</span>
    <span>((</span><span>width</span> <span>200</span><span>)</span>
     <span>(</span><span>height</span> <span>200</span><span>)</span>
     <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>5</span><span>))</span>
  <span>;; ...drawing code here...</span>
  <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>After the name of the sketch comes a list of bindings that define its state and configuration. Here, the window properties <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are set to <code>200</code>, while <code>n</code> is an attribute we've added for our own use.</p>
<p>Then comes the drawing code. This gets run in a loop while the sketch is running, once per frame. The following snippet draws 5 red circles on a black background, each of radius 10 and in random positions.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>(</span><span>background</span> <span>+black+</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>loop</span> <span>repeat</span> <span>n</span>
      <span>do</span> <span>(</span><span>with-pen</span> <span>(</span><span>make-pen</span> <span>:fill</span> <span>+red+</span><span>)</span>
           <span>(</span><span>circle</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span> <span>width</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span> <span>height</span><span>)</span> <span>10</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>After painting the background black, the all-powerful <code>loop</code> macro is used to draw <code>n</code> circles. The <code>with-pen</code> macro (defined by Sketch) configures drawing properties like fill colour, stroke width and stroke colour. It takes a "pen" object as an argument.</p>
<p>Here's all the code together:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>(</span><span>defsketch</span> <span>my-sketch</span>
    <span>((</span><span>width</span> <span>200</span><span>)</span>
     <span>(</span><span>height</span> <span>200</span><span>)</span>
     <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>5</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>background</span> <span>+black+</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>loop</span> <span>repeat</span> <span>n</span>
        <span>do</span> <span>(</span><span>with-pen</span> <span>(</span><span>make-pen</span> <span>:fill</span> <span>+red+</span><span>)</span>
             <span>(</span><span>circle</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span> <span>width</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span> <span>height</span><span>)</span> <span>10</span><span>))))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, to run the sketch, we compile our code and execute <code>(run-sketch 'my-sketch)</code> from the REPL, resulting in...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a> is an algorithm from 1986 for simulating flocks of birds. In its essence, it consists of applying 3 forces to the simulated birds. Quoting Wikipedia<sup id="fnref:boidsref"><a href="#fn:boidsref">2</a></sup>, these forces are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates</li>
<li>cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates</li>
<li>alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we implement this ourselves? First, we need a canvas to draw on!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>(</span><span>defsketch</span> <span>boids</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The only mysterious thing in this code is the <code>restart-on-change</code> parameter, which is available in my <a href="https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/sketch">fork</a> of Sketch. When its value is <code>nil</code> (false), the sketch's state - like the boid positions - won't be reset when we recompile our code.</p>
<p>Compiling the defsketch form in Emacs (with the Ctrl-C Ctrl-C shortcut) and executing <code>(run-sketch 'boids)</code> at the REPL gives us... 🥁... a gray background. Wonderful.</p>

<p>(Note: all going well, this modest window will run continuously throughout the entire development lifecycle).</p>
<p>Now let's create some boids to populate our world. We add a <code>boid</code> class to store their position and velocity, as well as a convenience function <code>make-boid</code> to create a boid from x &amp; y co-ordinates. These rely on a hopefully self-explanatory implementation of 2d vectors, which are created using the <code>vec2</code> function.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>(</span><span>defclass</span> <span>boid</span> <span>()</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>To the sketch itself, we add 20 boids in random positions, and pass them to the <code>draw-boids</code> function in the drawing loop.</p>

<p>Here's an implementation of <code>draw-boids</code>. We don't need to get into the weeds of how it works. For each boid, it does some unwieldy vector math to figure out which direction the boid is facing and draws a triangle pointing in that direction.</p>

<p>As soon as we compile <code>draw-boids</code>, the error screen disappears and our lovely boids are drawn into place. And we didn't have to restart the program to fix it!</p>

<figcaption>Before: red error screen. After: boids are drawn.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are two Common Lisp features that enable us to fix errors on-the-fly like we've done here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Newly compiled code, and recompiled code, is immediately loaded (sometimes called "hot reloading") into the running program. This opens up possibilities such as optimising a program as it runs, tweaking parameters like gravitational force and background colour, and iteratively developing a GUI.</li>
<li>The condition system! This is somewhat like exception handling in other languages, but more powerful. Not only can we signal exceptional situations ("conditions"), but we can also define "restarts" for recovering from those situations. When a running Common Lisp program encounters an unhandled condition, control passes to the debugger, and the user is presented with a selection of restarts. Perhaps they want to recompile the offending function and continue execution from the previous stack frame. Or perhaps the error was a division by zero, and the offending function provides a restart that swaps in a value of 1 for the divisor. Suddenly, there are a lot more possibilities than just crashing the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, a worthy discussion of the condition system would take up a full blog post of its own. Back to Boids!</p>
<p>Now that our boids are drawn correctly, we want them to move around and do boid things. First, we implement an <code>update-positions</code> function, which basically adds the velocity of each boid to its position (so that the boid moves), and applies the 3 Boidian forces to update the boid's velocity. For now, the functions implementing these forces are stubbed out.</p>

<p>So far, these changes haven't affected the boid behaviour, so let's circle back and implement <code>rule-1</code>, which can be summarised as "stay away from other boids". When a boid is less than 10 pixels from another boid, we push them away from each other to avoid crowding.</p>

<p>...a pair of boids that happen to be too close to each other are sent flying off into the void. There's no counterforce to bring them back, just yet.</p>
<p>Next, we implement <code>rule-2</code>: boids should fly towards the average position of other boids. Our implementation could be more efficient by summing the boid positions just once, rather than doing it for every single boid, but I can't be bothered.</p>

<p>Yes! This is starting to look vaguely like Boids. Let's add the final rule, <code>rule-3</code>: boids should match their velocity to all the other boids.

<p>And with that, we have a complete implementation of Boids! At the risk of beating a dead horse, I'll re-emphasise that we did the whole thing without once restarting our program or waiting a perceivable amount of time for code to compile.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>I hope, in this brief demonstration of livecoding, I've given you a taste of how useful and fun this feature can be, whether you're developing a graphics application or mundane accounting software. Like I've said, it's not unique to Common Lisp, as at least Smalltalk and Erlang have similar capabilities. It's also possible to bridge the gap in less interactive languages by making applications automatically restart themselves when a code change is detected, or by bolting on a scripting language. Just do me a favour and ask yourself, the next time you're waiting the requisite time units for your code to recompile: <em>How can I make this workflow more interactive? How can I make it more... like Common Lisp?</em></p>

If you've been following AI development circles, you've likely heard optimistic claims such as "this will change everything."</span></p><p>Curious about the possibilities, I went deep into MCPs, building two experimental MCP servers myself, and thoroughly exploring their potential and current limitations. Here's what I discovered.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong><span> This post is more technical and detailed than most of my previous posts.</span></em></p><p>Think of MCPs as standardized APIs—connectors between external data sources or applications and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude. They let the model contact a travel site to fetch real-time prices, read and manage your calendar, or even rename files on your computer.</p><p>While tools like Claude, Cursor, and OpenAI already use custom integrations under the hood, MCPs aim to offer a universal, standardized format for all such interactions.</p><p>MCPs have two main parts: clients (like ChatGPT) and servers (external services like a flight scheduling site). When used together, they give LLMs “superpowers”—letting them access real-time data, take action on the web, and act more like agents than static chatbots.</p><p>Today, two main types of MCP Servers are emerging. One set is developer-focused—tools like Cursor or Claude Code that integrate with your laptop to manage files, and/or run scripts. The other is web and action-oriented, built around real-world tasks like searching for products, registering domains, booking events, or sending emails.</p><p>To explore what’s actually possible, I built one of each MCP server. The first was a developer server called GPT Learner - a tool that lets you instruct Cursor to remember what went wrong and avoid repeating mistakes. If Claude or Cursor rewrote your code incorrectly, after you have it fixed you can say “record learnings,” and it will store what to do and not do in its rules for the future.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png" width="1129" height="608" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:1129,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff29e6f6a-2324-4b49-b61f-c0a6e9872fe2_1129x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The second project was more ambitious: a prediction market MCP that connects an LLM to</span><a href="https://betsee.xyz/?ref=iamcharliegraham.com" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"> betsee.xyz</a><span>, a site I built that aggregates live prediction markets.

First, MCPs aren’t ready for broad adoption.</p><p>The user experience is rough. Most chat clients like ChatGPT don’t yet support MCP servers. The few that do require manual JSON editing to install them—not exactly user-friendly. Clients like Cursor and Claude currently prompt users for every request and often return incomplete info or raw JSON outputs. It's clunky and frustrating.</p><p>When I used Claude Desktop to query my prediction market MCP, it often didn’t send links or prices unless I explicitly asked. Sometimes it didn’t call the server at all. And every time it made a call to my MCP, it prompted me to approve - which quickly became annoying. Eventually, MCP installation will be seamless (e.g., “click to add from a catalog”), and responses will be meaningful. But we’re not there yet.</p><p>Security is another glaring issue. Because MCPs enable external actions and access to live systems, they introduce a wide new surface area for abuse. Prompt injection, malicious tool installs, unauthorized access, and Trojan-horse-style exploits are all very real risks today. There's no sandboxing, no validation layer, and no mature security ecosystem to handle these edge cases.</p><p>We’re clearly still in the experimental stage.</p><p>While building these servers, I had one more important learning: while MCP servers provide the data and actions, the clients control the future.</p><p>Whoever controls the LLM interface— Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc...—controls what tools users see, which ones get triggered, and what responses actually get surfaced. You can build the world’s most useful MCP server, but the client may not call it, or only show half of its output. You may not even be allowed to install it</p><p>Given that MCP clients hold all the power, it’s easy to see how MCPs will end up governed by a framework resembling a combination of the two dominant monopolies of the last two decades: search and mobile app stores. Major LLM providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, and others—will emerge as the new monopoly gatekeepers, managing MCP selection and monetizing that control through preferred placements and curated inclusion.</p><p>Since its founding in the late 1990s, Google has controlled which products users see when they have purchase intent—building an incredibly lucrative business. Now, GPT chats (the MCP clients) are entering that space, replacing the "10 blue links" by curating responses to people’s requests: deciding what content is included, what’s excluded, and how it's formatted. MCP servers will become the new SEM/SEO layer—paying fees to reach users via these AI intermediaries.</p><p>Installation, meanwhile, will resemble the mobile app store model. Just as Apple and Google shaped the mobile ecosystem by determining which apps were featured, preinstalled, or approved at all, LLM clients will decide which MCP servers get surfaced, promoted, or even allowed. Companies will compete—and likely pay significant sums—for premium visibility in these ecosystems, turning MCP directories into high-stakes distribution platforms.</p><p>Users will be able to install MCPs—or “chat apps”—from large, curated directories. Tools like Gmail, HubSpot, Uber, and Kayak will add MCP endpoints, integrating directly into chat-based workflows. While installation is technically possible, most users won’t bother to choose their own tools. Instead, they’ll rely on the defaults provided by the client (like ChatGPT). These defaults won’t be arbitrary—they’ll be the result of lucrative partnerships. Large companies will pay to become the preselected option for categories like shopping, travel, domain name search, or services search . Being the default means embedding into the daily flow of millions of users—bringing massive exposure, data, and commercial value.</p><p>Some client-side MCP App Stores (MAS) will offer looser, more open directories, allowing broader experimentation and community-developed MCPs. Others will be tightly gated, favoring quality, security, and monetization with strict approval processes. In either case, the client sets the terms of participation—and the rules for success.</p><p>MCP clients like OpenAI and Claude will become the new iOS and Android. MCP servers will play the role of apps—modular tools delivering rich, structured, interactive responses tailored to the user’s needs. But instead of screens and taps, interaction happens through language. The app is invoked not by icon, but by intent.</p><p>Over time, we’ll also see specialized clients emerge, tailored to specific industries or domains. Imagine a Travel Planner Chat Client that integrates seamlessly with airlines, hotel chains, and tour operators, offering users a complete trip-planning experience inside a single conversational flow. Or an HR-focused MCP client that unifies access to legal data, employee records, and organizational tools—transforming how businesses manage people and policy.</p><p>And while most users will stick with mainstream clients backed by billion-dollar UX budgets, some open-source GPT interfaces will likely emerge as well. These will appeal to power users who want full control over the MCPs they install—without gatekeepers. But just like Linux on the desktop, these open clients will remain niche: influential, dedicated, and small in number compared to the dominant platforms.</p><p>If this world unfolds, here are some of the businesses and tools I expect to emerge—and why they matter:</p><p><strong>MCP Wrapper and Server Packs</strong><span> These will simplify setup by bundling multiple related MCPs into a single installable unit. Imagine installing a “Startup Stack” that includes MCPs for calendar, email, CRM, and file storage—ready to go, no configuration required. These packs will streamline onboarding and become especially useful in vertical clients and may include packaged tooling ("set a calendar and send an email").</span></p><p><strong>MCP Affiliate Shopping Engines</strong><span> Some MCP servers will act like AI-powered comparison engines, returning real-time prices and product listings across vendors. They’ll monetize through affiliate links—earning referral fees from purchases. This echoes the early days of SEO and affiliate marketing, now reimagined for AI agents.</span></p><p><strong>MCP-First Content Apps</strong><span> Instead of designing websites for humans, these services will optimize content delivery for LLMs via MCP servers. Think rich, structured data, semantic labeling, and pricing hooks—all returned via MCP calls. Revenue will come from subscriptions or embedded sponsorships and product placements, not page views.</span></p><p><strong>API-to-MCP Providers</strong><span> Many existing APIs will want to participate in this new ecosystem but won’t have the resources to rebuild everything. Middleware tools will emerge that automatically translate traditional REST APIs into compliant, discoverable MCP servers, making onboarding turnkey for SaaS platforms.</span></p><p><strong>Cloudflare for MCPs</strong><span> Security will become a major issue, and someone will step in to handle it. These tools will sit between clients and servers, sanitizing inputs, logging requests, blocking attacks, and monitoring for anomalies. Just as Cloudflare made the modern web safer, a similar role will exist for MCP ecosystems.</span></p><p><strong>Enterprise “Private” MCP Solutions</strong><span> Large companies will start to wire up their own internal services into private MCP servers—exposing data from HR systems, legal tools, analytics dashboards, and more. Paired with open-source LLM clients, these internal setups will unlock AI workflows behind the firewall, with enterprise-level control.</span></p><p><strong>Verticalized MCP Clients</strong><span> Generic chat interfaces will only get you so far. Some domains—like babysitting marketplaces, industrial procurement, or compliance workflows—require specific UIs and business logic. Vertically focused MCP clients will emerge to serve these needs with tailored actions, language, and layouts.</span></p><p>If you’re working on this space—building MCP clients, servers, or something even better —I’d love to hear from you: charlie@iamcharliegraham.com</p><p>We’re still early. MCPs today are messy, brittle, and mostly in the hands of developers. But the direction is clear.</p><p>These protocols have the potential to transform LLMs from chat-based search engines into powerful, agent-like tools that can take action on your behalf—securely, intelligently, and in real time.</p><p><span>But the real story isn’t just about what MCP servers </span><em>can</em><span> do. It’s about who gets to decide </span><em>what they’re allowed to do</em><span>. And in that story, it’s the clients-the ChatGPTs and Claudes of the world—that will write the rules, set the defaults, and shape the future.</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>i’m breaking up with vibe coding. here’s why.</p>
<p>when i first started learning to code, i built apps/websites that would be considered poor in the traditional sense. it also took me an embarassing amout of time to figure out basic stuff. it was frustratingly difficult. the ‘finished’ product wasn’t even polished.</p>
<p>but atleast i built it. i wasn’t begging an ai agent to fix my bugs. no matter how poor, the code had my blood, sweat and tears in it. no one could take that away from me.</p>
<p>as i was lying in bed on a sleepless night. i realized i hadn’t learnt a new concept in weeks. i had built a few useful apps with ai, but a nagging question kept me awake - what was the point of it all if i didn’t learn a thing?</p>
<p>that’s when it struck me. coding isn’t about the finished product. its a lot like writing. its about the process. its about how you approach a problem. its critical thinking.</p>
<p>and i don’t think i’m ready to let ai take these away from me. i’m going back to writing shitty code, slowly and deliberately.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Computers are precise machines. You can give a computer a precise command using an inhumane language, and it should perfome the command. It's not a human, and there is no point of treating it as one. The goal of humanizing user experience isn't to create an illusion of human interaction - it's to make these mechanical commands more accessible while preserving their precise, deterministic nature. </p>
<p>UX designers and product managers of tech companies did a lot of damange to people's understanding of computers by making the software behave like a human; or to be more precise, behave like an annoying salesman. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/Mam8J5UIOOGzSAR80SsCi.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>(Image from "<a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/not-now-a91c75ad35b6">Not Now. Not later either</a>" by Chris Oliver)</em></p>
<p>We're all familiar with this type. After receiving a clear "no thanks" they deploy increasingly manipulative tactics to meet their "always-be-closing" quotas: "Would this Wednesday work better?" "What would change your mind?" This behavior is frustrating enough from actual salespeople - it's even worse when programmed into our software.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrhSLf0I-HM">Corporate LLM training session circa 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Personally, I can tolerate but deeply dislike software that pretends to have ulterior motives. Take YouTube, for instance. When I explicitly say "Not interested" to their damned shorts feature, I get this response:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/BRKRAYhSqywqHunBgXt0P.png" alt="youtube web page with a message saying 'shelf will be hidden for 30 days'"></p>
<p>I understand that it's not the "YouTube program" having its own agency and making this decision - it's the team behind it, driven by engagement metrics and growth targets. But does the average user understand this distinction?</p>
<p>The population (especially the younger generation, who never seen a different kind of technology at all) is being conditioned by the tech industry to accept that software should behave like an unreliable, manipulative human rather than a precise, predictable machine. They're learning that you can't simply tell a computer "I'm not interested" and expect it to respect that choice. Instead, you must engage in a perpetual dance of "not now, please" - only to face the same prompts again and again.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/SilentPatch/issues/172" target="_blank">SilentPatch GitHub issue tracker</a>,
I received a rather specific bug report:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="skimmer-airplane-doesnt-exist-in-windows-11-24h2">
  
  
    Skimmer airplane doesn’t exist in Windows 11 24H2
  
  
</h3>
    

  <p>When I upgraded my windows to version 24H2, the Skimmer plane disappear completely from the game.
It can’t be spawn using trainer nor it can’t be found anywhere on it’s normal spawn points.
I’m using both my modded copy (which is before the update, is completely fine) and vanilla copy with only silentpatch
(I tried the 2018, 2020 and the most recent version of silentpatch) and the plane still won’t exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this was the first time I had heard about it, I’d likely consider it dubious and suspect there are more things at play,
and it’s not specifically Windows 11 24H2. However, on GTAForums, I’ve been receiving comments about this exact issue since November last year.
Some of them said SilentPatch causes this issue, others however stated the same happens on a completely unmodded game:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apparently the skimmer cant spawn when playing on Windows 11 24h2 update, hope this bug gets fixed.</p>

  <p>EDIT: So I think I confirmed it, I set up a VM with Windows 11 23h2 and the damn plane spawns fine,
and updating that same VM to 24h2 breaks the skimmer, why would a small feature update in 2024 break a random plane in a 2005 game is anyone’s guess.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>After the latest Silent patch update there is no Skimmer in the game and when I try to spawn it with RZL-Trainer or Cheat Menu by Grinch,
the game freezes and I have to close it via Task Manager.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] I was forced to update to 24H2, and now after the update, I have the same problem with the Skimmer in GTA SA as others.
This means that mods or anything else are not causing the issue, the problem appeared after the latest Windows update.</p>
</blockquote><hr>

<p>My home PC is still on Windows 10 22H2, while my work machine is on Windows 11 23H2, and, to no surprise, neither machine reproduced the issue – Skimmer spawned
on the water just fine, creating one via script and putting CJ in a driver’s seat worked too.</p>

<p>That said, I also asked a few people who upgraded to 24H2 to test this on their machines and they <strong>all</strong> hit this bug. Attempts to debug “remotely”
by giving instructions over the chat didn’t go anywhere, so I set up a 24H2 virtual machine on my own. I copied the game over to the machine, set it up for remote
debugging from the host OS, headed to the usual place the Skimmer spawns, and sure enough, it wasn’t there. All other planes and boats still spawned fine,
only this one vehicle did not:</p>

<p>I then used the script to spawn a Skimmer and put CJ inside it, just to be launched
<code>1.0287648030984853e+0031</code> = <strong>10.3 nonillion meters</strong>, or <strong>10.3 octillion kilometers</strong>, or <strong>1.087 quadrillion light-years</strong> up in the sky 😆</p>

<p>With SilentPatch installed, the game freezes shortly after launching the player up, as the game code gets stuck in a loop.
Without SilentPatch, the game doesn’t freeze, but instead, it succumbs to a famous “burn-in effect” known to occur when the camera gets launched into infinity or close to it.
Funny enough, you can still kind of make out the shape of the plane even though the animations give up completely to the inaccuracies of the floating point values:</p>

<p>But, enough messing around; now I knew it was a real bug and I needed to figure out the root cause. At this point it wasn’t possible to say
whether the game was at fault, or if I was really dealing with an API bug introduced in 24H2, as looking at how many games have issues with this OS version,
it could go either way.</p>

<p>I didn’t have much to go with, but the fact the game froze with SilentPatch installed provided me with a good starting point. Upon entering the seaplane,
the game froze in a very small loop in <code>CPlane::PreRender</code>, attempting to normalize the rotor blade angle to the 0-360 degree range:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_fBladeAngle</span> <span>=</span> <span>CTimer</span><span>::</span><span>ms_fTimeStep</span> <span>*</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_fBladeSpeed</span> <span>+</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_fBladeAngle</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>v12</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>6.2831855</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_fBladeAngle</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_fBladeAngle</span> <span>-</span> <span>6.2831855</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the debugged session, <code>this-&gt;m_fBladeSpeed</code> was <code>3.73340132e+29</code>. This value is obviously enormous, big enough to make decrementing the value by <code>6.2831855</code>
entirely ineffective due to the difference in floating point exponents of these two values.<sup id="fnref:fp-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fp-explanation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> But why is the blade speed so ridiculously high?
The blade speed is derived from the following formula:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_fBladeSpeed</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>v34</span> <span>-</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_fBladeSpeed</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>CTimer</span><span>::</span><span>ms_fTimeStep</span> <span>/</span> <span>100.0</span> <span>+</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_fBladeSpeed</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>where <code>v34</code> is <strong>proportional to the plane’s altitude</strong>. This matches the initial findings – as mentioned earlier, the “burn-in effect” traditionally happens
when the camera is very far away from the map center, or at a great height.</p>

<p>What caused the plane to shoot so high up? There are two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The plane spawns high up in the sky already.</li>
  <li>The plane spawns at ground level and then shoots up in the next frame.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for this test, I was spawning the Skimmer myself with a test script, so I could start from the function used in the game’s SCM (script) interpreter,
named <code>CCarCtrl::CreateCarForScript</code>. This function spawns a vehicle with a specified ID at the provided coordinates, and those come from my test script,
so I know they are correct. However, this function transforms the supplied Z coordinate slightly:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>posZ</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>100.0</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>posZ</span> <span>=</span> <span>CWorld</span><span>::</span><span>FindGroundZForCoord</span><span>(</span><span>posX</span><span>,</span> <span>posY</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>posZ</span> <span>+=</span> <span>newVehicle</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>GetDistanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>CEntity::GetDistanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel</code> contains multiple code paths, but the one used in this case simply gets the negated maximum Z value
of the model’s bounding box:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>CModelInfo</span><span>::</span><span>ms_modelInfoPtrs</span><span>[</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_wModelIndex</span><span>]</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pColModel</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bbox</span><span>.</span><span>sup</span><span>.</span><span>z</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>At this point, I expected this value to be incorrect, so I peeked into Skimmer’s bounding box values just to find out that the maximum Z value is indeed corrupted:</p>

<div><pre><code>- *(RwBBox**)0x00B2AC48	RwBBox *
  - sup	RwV3d
      x	-5.39924574	float
      y	-6.77431822	float
      z	-4.30747210e+33	float
  - inf	RwV3d
      x	5.42313004	float
      y	4.02343750	float
      z	1.87021971	float
</code></pre></div>

<p>If all the components of the bounding box were corrupted, I would have suspected some memory corruption, like another code writing past boundaries and overwriting
these values, but it’s specifically <code>sup.z</code> that is corrupted that is neither the first nor the last field in the bounding box. Once again, two possibilities came to my mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The collision file is read incorrectly and some fields remain uninitialized, or read unrelated data instead of the bounding box? Highly unlikely, but not impossible given that
  this issue could potentially have been an OS bug.</li>
  <li>The bounding box is read correctly, but then it’s updated with an outrageously incorrect value.</li>
</ol>

<p>A data breakpoint set up at <code>pColModel</code> reveals that at the time of the initial setup, the bounding box is correct, and the value of the Z coordinate is completely reasonable:</p>
<div><pre><code>- *(RwBBox**)0x00B2AC48	RwBBox *
  - sup	RwV3d
    x	-5.39924574	float
    y	-6.77431822	float
    z	-2.21952772	float
  - inf	RwV3d
    x	5.42313004	float
    y	4.02343750	float
    z	1.87021971	float
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out, the first time a vehicle with a specific model is spawned, the game sets up the suspension in a function <code>SetupSuspensionLines</code>, and updates the Z coordinate
of the bounding box to reflect the car’s natural suspension height:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pSuspensionLines</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>p1</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>colModel</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bbox</span><span>.</span><span>sup</span><span>.</span><span>z</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>colModel</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bbox</span><span>.</span><span>sup</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>pSuspensionLines</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>p1</span><span>.</span><span>z</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is where things went wrong first. The suspension lines are computed using a combination of values from <code>handling.cfg</code> and the wheel scale parameter
coming from <code>vehicles.ide</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>

  <span>modelInfo</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>GetWheelPosn</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>posn</span><span>);</span>

  <span>posn</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>pHandling</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>fSuspensionUpperLimit</span><span>;</span>
  <span>colModel</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>lines</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>p0</span> <span>=</span> <span>posn</span><span>;</span>

  <span>float</span> <span>wheelScale</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>i</span> <span>!=</span> <span>2</span> <span>?</span> <span>modelInfo</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_frontWheelScale</span> <span>:</span> <span>modelInfo</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>m_rearWheelScale</span><span>;</span>

  <span>posn</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>pHandling</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>fSuspensionLowerLimit</span> <span>-</span> <span>pHandling</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>fSuspensionUpperLimit</span><span>;</span>
  <span>posn</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>-=</span> <span>wheelScale</span> <span>/</span> <span>2.0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>colModel</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>lines</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>p1</span> <span>=</span> <span>posn</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since I knew <code>colModel-&gt;lines[0].p1</code> is corrupted, this meant either <code>pHandling-&gt;fSuspensionLowerLimit</code>, <code>pHandling-&gt;fSuspensionUpperLimit</code>, or <code>wheelScale</code> were bogus.
Skimmer’s <code>handling.cfg</code> values didn’t seem any different to any other plane in the game, but then I spotted something interesting in <code>vehicles.ide</code>. Skimmer’s line looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>460, 	skimmer,	skimmer, 	plane,		SEAPLANE,	SKIMMER,	null,	ignore,		5,	0,	0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Compare this line to any other plane in the game, in this example Rustler:</p>
<div><pre><code>476, 	rustler, 	rustler, 	plane, 		RUSTLER, 	RUSTLER,	rustler, ignore,		10,	0,	0,		-1, 0.6, 0.3,		-1
</code></pre></div>

<p>The line is shorter and it’s missing the last four parameters, moreover, <strong>two of the missing parameters are the front and rear wheel scale!</strong>
This is normal for boats, but Skimmer is <strong>the only</strong> plane to omit these parameters.</p>

<p>Does re-adding those parameters fix the seaplane? Unsurprisingly, it does!</p>

<h2 id="but-why-and-how">
  
  
    But why and how? <a href="#but-why-and-how"></a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>I have a likely explanation for why Rockstar made this specific mistake in the data to begin with – in Vice City, Skimmer was defined as a <strong>boat</strong>,
and therefore did not have those values defined by design!
When in San Andreas they changed Skimmer’s vehicle type to a <strong>plane</strong>, someone forgot to add those now-required extra parameters.
Since this game seldom verifies the completeness of its data, this mistake simply slipped under the radar.</p>

<p>Problem solved? Not quite yet, as for SilentPatch, I need to fix it from the code. A peek into the pseudocode of <code>CFileLoader::LoadVehicleObject</code>
reveals the true nature of this bug: the game assumes all parameters are always present in the definition line and it doesn’t default any but two parameters,
nor it checks the return value of <code>sscanf</code>, and so in the case of all boats and Skimmer, those parameters remained uninitialized:</p>

<p>Given the symptoms, those uninitialized values must have evaluated to small, valid floating point values all the way until now,
whereas with Windows 11 24H2 they got out of hand and tripped the bounding box calculations.</p>

<p>In SilentPatch, the fix is easy – I wrap this call to <code>sscanf</code> and provide reasonable defaults for the final four parameters:</p>

Another compatibility win for the patch.</p><hr>

<p>If this was a regular bug, I would’ve ended the post right here. However, in the case of this rabbit hole, the discovery of this fix only
raised more questions – why did this break only now? What made the game work fine despite of this issue for over twenty years,
before a new update to Windows 11 suddenly challenged this status quo?</p>

<p><strong>Finally, is this somehow caused by a problem in Windows 11 24H2, or is this just an unfortunate coincidence, stars aligning just right?</strong></p>

<p>At this point, the working theory was that the uninitialized local variables in <code>CFileLoader::LoadVehicleObject</code>
happened to have reasonable values until <em>something</em> changed in Windows 11 24H2, and those values became “unreasonable”.
What I knew could <strong>not</strong> be the cause was the CRT (and thus, the <code>sscanf</code> call) – San Andreas uses a statically compiled CRT,
and therefore any OS-level hotfixes wouldn’t apply to it.
However, considering the plethora of security enhancements in Windows 11, I couldn’t rule out that one of those enhancements,
for example, <strong>Kernel-mode Hardware-enforced Stack Protection</strong>, ends up scrambling the stack in a way the game’s bugged function doesn’t like.</p>

<p>I set up an experiment where I broke into a debugger before a <code>sscanf</code> call when parsing Skimmer’s line (vehicle ID 460) specifically,
and the observed variable values supported that claim. On my Windows 10 machine, they happened to be both <code>0.7</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>frontWheelSize  0x01779f14 {0.699999988}
rearWheelSize   0x01779f10 {0.699999988}
</code></pre></div>
<p>while on the Win11 24H2 VM, they are huge, similar in order of magnitude to the wrong values observed in the bounding box earlier.
The stack pointer has also shifted by 4 bytes for some reason, but that is unlikely to be related – and it’s likely caused by some changes
to the thread startup boilerplate inside <code>kernel32.dll</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>frontWheelSize  0x01779f18 {7.84421263e+33}
rearWheelSize   0x01779f14 {4.54809690e-38}
</code></pre></div>

<p>This got me curious - <code>0.7</code> is a bit “too good” of a value to be a result of interpreting random garbage from the stack as a floating point;
what’s more likely is that it’s an actual floating point value that was sitting on the stack in exactly the right spot.
I then inspected <code>vehicles.ide</code> for TopFun – the vehicle defined directly before Skimmer. Sure enough, its wheel scale is <code>0.7</code>!</p>
<div><pre><code>459,	topfun,		topfun,		car,		TOPFUN,		TOPFUN,		van,	ignore,		1,	0,	0,		-1, 0.7, 0.7,		-1
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>vehicles.ide</code> is parsed in order, in a function working similarly to this (pseudocode):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>CFileLoader</span><span>::</span><span>LoadObjectTypes</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>filename</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// Open the file...</span>

  <span>while</span> <span>((</span><span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>fgets</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>))</span> <span>!=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>// Parse the section indicators...</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>section</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>// Different sections...</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>SECTION_CARS</span><span>:</span>
      <span>LoadVehicleObject</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Seems like the code somehow persisted the stale wheel scale values, so Skimmer ends up getting the same wheel scales as Topfun.
I set up another experiment to verify this claim:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set up a breakpoint before <code>sscanf</code> again, but this time before Topfun’s line (vehicle ID 459) gets parsed.</li>
  <li>Set up write breakpoints on <code>frontWheelScale</code> and <code>rearWheelScale</code>.</li>
  <li>Resume execution until the game gets to parsing the next vehicle definition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Windows 10 verified my claim – <strong>nothing wrote to these two stack values between the calls to <code>CFileLoader::LoadVehicleObject</code>,
so the function’s effective behavior was to preserve (albeit, unintentionally) the wheel scale values between the consecutive calls!</strong></p>

<p>Repeating the same exercise on Windows 11 24H2 triggered the write breakpoint! However, it wasn’t anywhere close to any security feature:
the stack values were overwritten by… <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code> inside <code>fgets</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>&gt;	ntdll.dll!_RtlpAbFindLockEntry@4()	Unknown
 	ntdll.dll!_RtlAbPostRelease@8()	Unknown
 	ntdll.dll!_RtlLeaveCriticalSection@4()	Unknown
 	gta_sa.exe!fgets()	Unknown
</code></pre></div>

<p>Seems like a change in Windows 11 24H2 modified the way <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sync/critical-section-objects" target="_blank">Critical Section Objects</a>
work internally, and the new code unlocking the critical section uses more stack space than the old one.
I ran one more experiment, comparing the changes to the stack space that happened after <code>sscanf</code> inside <code>LoadVehicleObject</code>, until the next invocation of this function.
Changed values are highlighted in red:</p>

        In fact, you can spot the two values of <code>0x3F449BA6</code> = <code>0.768</code> (highlighted on the screenshot).
        They correspond to Landstalker’s wheel scales.</figcaption></figure>

                The wheel scales are nowhere to be found, as they were overwritten!</figcaption></figure>

</figure>

<p>This is the exact proof I needed – notice that in the Windows 10 run, some of the local variables are even still visible to the human eye (like the <code>normal</code> vehicle class),
while in Windows 11, they are completely gone. It’s also worth pointing out that even in Windows 10, <strong>the very next local variable</strong> after the wheel scales has been overwritten
by <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code>, which means the game was <strong>4 bytes away</strong> from hitting this exact bug years earlier! The luck at display here is insane.</p>
<h2 id="whose-stack-is-it-anyway">
  
  
    Whose Stack Is It Anyway? <a href="#whose-stack-is-it-anyway"></a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>To illustrate why the game got away with this bug for so long, I need to show how the stack changes across calls.
Let’s say the stack looks like this after the call to <code>LoadVehicleObject</code>. <strong>Emphasis</strong> on the local variables we’re interested in:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>return address from <code>LoadObjectTypes</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>local variables of <code>LoadObjectTypes</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>return address from <code>LoadVehicleObject</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>local variables of <code>LoadVehicleObject</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>frontWheelScale</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>rearWheelScale</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>more local variables…</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The call to <code>fgets</code>, and consequently <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code>, that follows the call to <code>LoadVehicleObject</code>, reuses the stack space previously occupied by that function,
as the lifetime of the function stack is limited to the duration of the function itself and once the function is done, this space is up for grabs again.
On Windows 10, the stack looked like this once <code>fgets</code> and <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code> returned:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>return address from <code>LoadObjectTypes</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>local variables of <code>LoadObjectTypes</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>return address from <code>fgets</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>local variables of <code>fgets</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>return address from <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>local variables of <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>frontWheelScale</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>rearWheelScale</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>more local variables…</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><span>Highlighted parts</span> overwrite what used to be the stack space of <code>LoadVehicleObject</code>,
but notice how it doesn’t reach the area of the stack where the wheel scales resided.
In Windows 11 24H2, <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code> uses more stack space, so the stack space instead looks more like this:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>return address from <code>LoadObjectTypes</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>local variables of <code>LoadObjectTypes</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>return address from <code>fgets</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>local variables of <code>fgets</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>return address from <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>local variables of <code>LeaveCriticalSection</code>…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>frontWheelScale is overwritten!</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>rearWheelScale is overwritten!</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>more local variables…</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Parts of the stack <span>highlighted in red</span> are now also scrambled
when in the past they were left intact; those parts include the wheel scales read by the previous call to <code>LoadVehicleObject</code>!
This in turn exposes the bug caused by those variables being uninitialized, and since <code>sscanf</code> can’t read those values from Skimmer’s <code>vehicles.ide</code> definition,
they are kept as-is in garbage form, and propagate further to the vehicle’s data.</p>

    What are the odds this only broke now? Darn Windows 11! <a href="#what-are-the-odds-this-only-broke-now-darn-windows-11"></a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>I want to make it clear: <strong>all these findings prove that the bug is NOT an issue with Windows 11 24H2,
as things like the way the stack is used by internal WinAPI functions are not contractual and they may change at any time, with no prior notice</strong>.
The real issue here is the game relying on undefined behavior (uninitialized local variables), and to be honest,
I’m shocked that the game didn’t hit this bug on so many OS versions, although as I pointed out earlier, it was extremely close.
San Andreas still supported Windows 98, which means it got away with this bug in <strong>at least</strong> a dozen different Windows versions <strong>and</strong> many more releases of Wine!</p>

<p>…or, did it? I found it hard to believe that the game would never hit this issue on any of the many, many platforms it released on,
so I looked into the binary files of some other releases. While this bug was <strong>not</strong> fixed in the official 1.01 PC patch, it <strong>was</strong> fixed in the original Xbox release,
where a “reasonable default” of <code>1.0</code> was added to the code, much like in my fix. This fix was then “inherited” by many future versions of San Andreas, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Steam 3.0, newsteam, and RGL, as they were all based on the Xbox branch of the code.</li>
  <li>Any releases from War Drum Studios, including Android, X360, and PS3.</li>
  <li>The Definitive Edition.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, unlike Rockstar, I decided to use the wheel scale of <code>0.7</code> instead of <code>1.0</code> as a default, for multiple reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>This is the effective wheel scale Skimmer had on PC (and possibly PS2) until now since that’s the wheel scale of Topfun.</li>
  <li>Two other non-boat vehicles that float on water, Sea Sparrow and Vortex, both have a wheel scale of <code>0.7</code>.</li>
  <li>Many cars in the game have a wheel scale of <code>0.7</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="i-want-this-fixed-in-my-game">
  
  
    I want this fixed in my game! <a href="#i-want-this-fixed-in-my-game"></a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>The code fix will be included in <a href="https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/SilentPatch/milestone/3" target="_blank">the next SilentPatch hotfix</a>,
but for now, you may easily fix it yourself by editing <code>vehicles.ide</code>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In your San Andreas directory, open <code>data\vehicles.ide</code> with Notepad.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to Skimmer’s line beginning with <code>460, 	skimmer</code>.</li>
  <li>Replace the original line with:
    <div><pre><code>460, 	skimmer,	skimmer, 	plane,		SEAPLANE,	SKIMMER,	null,	ignore,		5,	0,	0,		-1, 0.7, 0.7,		-1
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>Save the file.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-word">
  
  
    Final word <a href="#final-word"></a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>This was the most interesting bug I’ve encountered for a while. I initially had a hard time believing that a bug like this would directly tie to a specific OS release,
but I was proven completely wrong. At the end of the day, it was a simple bug in San Andreas and this function should have never worked right,
and yet, at least on PC it hid itself for two decades.</p>

<p>This is an interesting lesson in compatibility: even changes to the stack layout of the internal implementations can have compatibility implications if an application
is bugged and unintentionally relies on a specific behavior. This is also not the first time I encountered issues like this: regular visitors might remember
<a href="https://cookieplmonster.github.io/mods/bully/">Bully: Scholarship Edition</a> which famously broke on Windows 10, for very similar reasons. Just like in this case,
Bully should have never worked properly to begin with, but instead, it got away with making incorrect assumptions for years, before changes in Windows 10 finally
made it run out of luck.</p>

<p>Yet again, we are reminded to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Validate your input data</strong> – San Andreas was notoriously bad at this, and ultimately this was the main reason why an incomplete config line remained unnoticed.</li>
  <li><strong>Not ignore the compilation warnings</strong> – this code most likely threw a warning in the original code that was either ignored or disabled!</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, the GTA players are lucky: in many other games, issues like this would’ve remained unfixed and they’d become a folk legend.
Thankfully, GTAs are moddable and well understood, so we can act upon problems like this and ensure the game stays functional for many more years to come.</p><hr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I’ve been using Obsidian for all my writing lately, and it’s been a game changer. The local-first model means everything lives as plain text on my machine, and with the Minimal theme, the interface stays clean and distraction-free.</p>
<p>My vault lives in iCloud (Dropbox or Google Drive work too), so notes sync seamlessly across devices - I often start drafts on my phone and finish them later on my laptop.</p>
<p>For publishing, I use Hugo with the Bear Blog theme (fast, minimal), and deploy via GitHub and Cloudflare Pages. This stack gives me full control: no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, and no risk of platforms disappearing or changing policies.</p>
<p>If you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use (or want to try) Obsidian</li>
<li>Don’t mind a bit of technical setup</li>
<li>Prefer writing in plain text with Git-based version control</li>
<li>Want a fast, cost-free, portable publishing flow</li>
</ul>
<p>Then this setup might be exactly what you’re looking for. Once set up, publishing is as simple as toggling a draft flag and pushing to GitHub.</p>
<p><img src="https://ingau.me/images/obsidian-publish.png" alt="Screenshot of my Obsidian vault"></p>
<h2 id="setting-up-your-system">Setting Up Your System</h2>
<p>This post is a <strong>high-level outline</strong> of how it all fits together. It’s not a tutorial, but if you’re familiar with basic dev tools, it should be easy to follow. And if anything’s unclear, LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude are great for filling in the gaps.</p>
<h3 id="1-install-and-set-up-hugo">1. Install and Set Up Hugo</h3>
<p>First, you’ll need to <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/">install Hugo</a> on your machine. Once installed, create a new site:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo new site myblog
cd myblog
</code></pre><p>Then add the Bear Blog theme (or your preferred theme):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git init
git submodule add https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog.git themes/hugo-bearblog
</code></pre><p>Update your <code>config.toml</code> file to use the theme. See the <a href="https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog">Bear Blog theme documentation</a> for configuration options.</p>
<h3 id="2-connect-obsidian-to-hugo">2. Connect Obsidian to Hugo</h3>
<p>This is the key part. Hugo has a specific folder structure, and you want to write your posts in the <code>content</code> folder. Inside that folder, I created a <code>blog</code> subfolder for all my posts.</p>
<p>So my folder structure looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>myblog/
  ├── content/
  │   ├── blog/   &lt;- This is where I write my posts
  │   └── ...
  └── ...
</code></pre><p>To set up Obsidian:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Obsidian</li>
<li>Click “Open folder as vault”</li>
<li>Navigate to your Hugo site’s blog folder (myblog/content/blog)</li>
<li>Select this folder</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, everything you write in Obsidian goes directly into the right folder for Hugo to process.</p>
<h3 id="3-set-up-front-matter-template">3. Set Up Front Matter Template</h3>
<p>In Obsidian, make sure that your posts includes the necessary Hugo front matter:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>+++
title= "Your Post Title"
date= YYYY-MM-DD
tags= ["post"]
draft= true
+++
</code></pre><p>The <code>draft: true</code> tag is crucial - this is what you’ll toggle to <code>false</code> when you’re ready to publish.</p>
<h3 id="4-preview-posts-locally">4. Preview Posts Locally</h3>
<p>While writing, I use Hugo’s local server with draft visibility:</p>
<p><code>hugo server -D</code></p>
<p>This lets me see how everything looks in-browser before pushing live.</p>
<h3 id="5-connect-to-github">5. Connect to GitHub</h3>
<p>Create a new GitHub repository for your blog, then connect your local Hugo site:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourblog.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
</code></pre><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world">GitHub tutorials</a> if you need help with this step.</p>
<h3 id="6-set-up-cloudflare-pages">6. Set Up Cloudflare Pages</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for a <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up">Cloudflare account</a> if you don’t have one</li>
<li>Go to the Pages section and create a new project</li>
<li>Connect to your GitHub account and select your blog repository</li>
<li>For build settings:
<ul>
<li>Build command: <code>hugo --minify</code></li>
<li>Build output directory: <code>public</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cloudflare’s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/">own documentation</a> covers this process well.</p>
<h2 id="the-publishing-workflow">The Publishing Workflow</h2>
<p>Once everything is set up, publishing is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write your post in Obsidian</li>
<li>When ready to publish, change <code>draft: true</code> to <code>draft: false</code> in the front matter</li>
<li>Commit and push to GitHub:</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git add .
git commit -m "Publish new post"
git push
</code></pre><p>Cloudflare Pages will automatically detect the change and rebuild your site, typically within a minute or two.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This setup takes a bit of initial work, but the payoff is enormous. Once it’s all set up, this workflow fades into the background - I just write, commit, and publish. No friction, no fees, and everything stays in my hands. If you’re looking for a lightweight, sustainable way to blog, this might be worth trying.</p>

We originally launched Scrimba to make video learning more interactive for aspiring frontend developers. So instead of passively watching videos, you can jump in an experiment with the code directly inside the video player. Since launch, almost two million people have used Scrimba to grow their skills.</p><p>However, one limitation is that we've only supported frontend code, as our interactive videos run in the browser, whereas most of our learners want to go fullstack—building APIs, handling auth, working with databases, and so forth.</p><p>To fix this, we spent the last 6 months integrating StackBlitz WebContainers into Scrimba. This enables a full Node.js environment—including a terminal, shell, npm access, and a virtual file system—directly inside our video player. Everything runs in the browser.</p><p>Here is a 2-minute recorded demo: <a href="https://scrimba.com/s08dpq3nom">https://scrimba.com/s08dpq3nom</a></p><p>If you want to see more, feel free to enroll into any of the seven fullstack courses we've launched so far, on subject like Node, Next, Express, SQL, Vite, and more. We've opened them up for Hacker News today so that you don't even need to create an account to watch the content:</p><p><a href="https://scrimba.com/fullstack">https://scrimba.com/fullstack</a></p><p><i>Other notable highlights about our "IDE videos":</i></p><p>- Based on events (code edits, cursor moves, etc) instead of pixels</p><p>- Roughly 100x smaller than traditional videos</p><p>- Recording is simple: just talk while you code</p><p>- Can be embedded in blogs, docs, or courses, like MDN does here: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/css-fundamentals/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/css-fund...</a></p><p>- Entirely built in Imba, a language I created myself: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28207662">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28207662</a></p><p>We think this format could be useful for open-source maintainers and API-focused teams looking to create interactive docs or walkthroughs. Our videos are already embedded by MDN, LangChain, and Coursera.</p><p>If you maintain a library or SDK and want an interactive video about it, let us know—happy to record one for free that you can use however you like.</p><p>Would love to answer any questions or hear people's feedback!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>
