<p><strong>SAN ANTONIO, Sept. 20, 2023</strong> – A new published study led by researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) has found an association between autism diagnosis in boys and daily consumption of either diet soda or a comparable amount of aspartame by their mothers during pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>
<p>In this case-control study, boys who had been diagnosed with autism were more than three times as likely as neurotypically developing boys to have been born to mothers who reported consuming one or more servings per day of diet soda, or comparable amounts of the leading artificial sweetener aspartame, during pregnancy or breastfeeding. No statistically significant association was found in female offspring.</p>
<p>“These associations do not prove causality, but taken in concert with reports from earlier studies of increased prematurity and cardiometabolic health impacts among infants and children exposed daily to diet beverages and/or aspartame during pregnancy, our findings raise new questions about potential neurological impacts that need to be addressed,” said Raymond F. Palmer, PhD, senior author of the paper, and professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at UT Health San Antonio.</p>
<p>The study, “Daily Early-Life Exposures to Diet Soda and Aspartame Are Associated with Autism in Males: A Case-Control Study,” was published in <em>Nutrients</em>, an international journal of human nutrition, on Aug. 29. Palmer and lead author Sharon Parten Fowler, PhD, MPH, adjunct assistant professor of medicine at UT Health San Antonio, were joined by researchers from School of Public Health campuses in San Antonio and Houston of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and the School of Public Health at San Diego State University.</p>

<p>Since its introduction, aspartame consumption has been reported to cause neurological problems in some users. It has also been associated with increased health problems among the offspring of animals fed aspartame during pregnancy, and among children whose mothers had consumed diet sodas, other diet beverages and/or aspartame daily during pregnancy.</p>
<p>For the new study, researchers hypothesized that exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding to at least one can of diet soda per day, or an amount of aspartame equivalent to the dosage in one can of diet cola per day, increases autism risk. The case-control study collected retrospective dietary “recalls,” or written estimates, of diet beverage and aspartame consumption during pregnancy or breastfeeding from mothers of 235 offspring with autism spectrum disorder, and 121 offspring with typical neurological development (the control group).</p>
<p>From these recalls, exposure odds ratios were computed for all offspring diagnosed with autism, and for the subset of offspring with non-regressive – or early-onset – autism. The researchers found that males diagnosed with autism disorder had more than tripled odds of having been exposed daily to these products during pregnancy or breastfeeding, compared with male controls. These exposure odds were greatest among males with non-regressive autism.</p>
<p>“Our findings contribute to the growing literature raising concerns about potential offspring harm from maternal diet beverage and aspartame consumption during pregnancy,” said Fowler, who for the past decade has researched the health impacts of chronic exposure to non-nutritive sweeteners, including the risk of autism, and of cardiometabolic disease in children, adolescents and adults. She is an affiliate member of the International Society for Autism Research.</p>
<p>The researchers conclude that further research – including larger sample sizes of both sexes, and prospective measurement of dietary exposures and additional risk factors – is needed to evaluate these associations in other study populations, and to assess whether they extend to risk of autism spectrum disorder in all offspring.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, the possibility that early-life exposures to these products through maternal diet might increase offspring neurodevelopmental risk, at least among boys, is of particular concern.</p>
<p>“The findings suggest that women should exercise caution when considering the use of these products during pregnancy and breastfeeding until further assessments are available,” Fowler said. “Maternal consumption of these products during periods of heightened offspring vulnerability represents a modifiable potential risk factor, the elimination of which might help to protect susceptible offspring in the next generation.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>Every year between</span> September and December, Lubna Dada makes clouds. Dada, an atmospheric scientist, convenes with dozens of her colleagues to run experiments in a 7,000-gallon stainless steel chamber at CERN in Switzerland. “It's like science camp,” says Dada, who studies how natural emissions react with ozone to create aerosols that affect the climate.</p><p>Clouds are the largest source of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/as-the-world-warms-clouds-could-disappear-catastrophically/#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%20the,stronger%20turbulence%20inside%20the%20clouds.">uncertainty</a> in climate predictions. Depending on location, cloud cover can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/the-mysterious-warming-hole-in-the-middle-of-the-us/">reflect sunlight away</a> from land and ocean that would otherwise absorb its heat—a rare perk in the warming world. But clouds can also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/why-the-arctic-is-warming-4-times-as-fast-as-the-rest-of-earth/"><em>trap</em> heat over Arctic and Antarctic ice</a>. Scientists want to know more about what causes clouds to form, and if that effect is cooling or heating. And most of all, says Dada, “We want to know how we humans have changed clouds.”</p><p>In the sky, aerosol particles attract water vapor or ice. When the tiny wet globs get large enough, they become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/if-clouds-are-made-of-water-how-do-they-stay-in-the-air/">seeds for clouds</a>. Half of Earth’s cloud cover forms around stuff like sand, salt, soot, smoke, and dust. The other half nucleates around vapors released by living things or machines, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/how-do-you-know-a-cargo-ship-is-polluting-it-makes-clouds/">sulfur dioxide that arises from burning fossil fuels</a>.</p><p>At CERN, scientists replicate that process by injecting the steel chamber with vapors that represent specific environments. (It’s called the CLOUD chamber, for Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets.) For example, they can mimic the gases found above cities. But Dada, who normally works at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, went to CERN to peer into the past. Her team of scientists from around the world wanted to recreate the air above forests, because a “pristine” atmosphere hints at what cloud formation was like before industrialization. “We need this comparison to the time when there were no human emissions,” she says, “so we can fix our climate models.”</p><p>In a paper published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi5297">this month</a> in <em>Science Advances</em>, Dada’s team establishes a new heavy hitter in cloud creation: a kind of chemical released by trees. Trees emit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27225125/">natural volatiles</a> like isoprene and monoterpenes, which can spark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17953">cloud-forming</a> <a data-offer-url="https://theconversation.com/trees-are-much-better-at-creating-clouds-and-cooling-the-climate-than-we-thought-66713" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://theconversation.com/trees-are-much-better-at-creating-clouds-and-cooling-the-climate-than-we-thought-66713&quot;}" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://theconversation.com/trees-are-much-better-at-creating-clouds-and-cooling-the-climate-than-we-thought-66713" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chemical reactions</a>. Dada’s new work focuses on an overlooked class of less abundant volatiles called sesquiterpenes, which smell woody, earthy, citrusy, or spicy, depending on the molecule and type of plant or microbe that emits them.</p><p>The team shows that sesquiterpenes are more effective than expected for seeding clouds. A mere 1-to-50 ratio of sesquiterpene to other volatiles <em>doubled</em> cloud formation.</p><p>The role of trees in seeding clouds is important, because it suggests what the sky above some regions might be like if governments manage to tamp down sulfur emissions. In a world with less pollution, plants and trees will become more dominant drivers of cloud formation, an echo of the premodern world.</p><p>This research could help refine estimates of what the atmosphere was like before industrialization. Maybe we’ve been undercounting the world’s aerosol population by overlooking a large portion of those that come from trees. If so, climate models will need retooling.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“New particle formation is a pretty hot topic right now,” says Paquita Zuidema, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami who was not part of the study. “We’re coming to realize more and more that we don't really know exactly what a pristine atmosphere is like.”</p><p><span>While anthropogenic emissions</span> dominate cloud formation in populated areas, plant volatiles dominate over more pristine land elsewhere. Lab tools have only recently become sensitive enough to understand which ones contribute the most.</p><p>Many discoveries about sesquiterpenes are relatively recent. In 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2011JD016243">researchers detected them</a> near the Amazon’s forest floor. Higher up in the canopy, sesquiterpenes were harder to track. This suggested that ozone was turning sesquiterpenes into cloud-seeding aerosols. Dada reported a similar system in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00406-9">Finnish forests and peatlands</a> last year. “We are seeing more and more because our instruments are much better now,” she says. “They are not only in the Amazon.”</p><p>When Dada and her colleagues started the new study, they aimed to test sesquiterpenes’ cloud-making abilities by mimicking the air in a forest that hasn't been corrupted by anthropogenic emissions. They began with a baseline—measuring what happens after ionizing an atmospheric mix of the most common “biogenic” volatiles: isoprene and α-pinene, a monoterpene. This combination seeded clouds, as expected. Then, the team did the same and mixed in a sesquiterpene called β-caryophyllene. It comes from pine and citrus trees and smells like cracked pepper.</p><p>Dada hypothesized that β-caryophyllene should react chemically, forming aerosols and eventually a cloud. She and her team stood in the control room monitoring 15 screens displaying real-time readouts of data like aerosol sizes and concentrations. They would know she was right if a graph of particle sizes on one of the screens changed color. It would grow and turn from blue to banana yellow as cloud seeds become more numerous.</p><p>On the first run, the graph turned yellow. Dada was right. (“We were all screaming ‘Banana! Banana! Banana!’” she recalls.) Adding just 2 percent by volume of β-caryophyllene to the mix doubled cloud formation and caused particles to grow <em>faster</em>. It was the first experiment demonstrating how sesquiterpenes seed clouds. Dada says it showed that even though these are only a fraction of the compounds that trees exhale, “the contribution is huge.”</p><p>“A little bit of sesquiterpene added has a very large effect,” says Jiwen Fan, an atmospheric scientist with Argonne National Lab not involved in the study. Even when sesquiterpenes create “ultrafine” aerosols they can still seed clouds and affect weather. In 2018, Fan showed that when huge rainclouds “ingest” ultrafine aerosols, they form new droplets that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29371462/">invigorate thunderstorms</a>.</p><p>To Fan, the new data suggests that sesquiterpenes may help better account for the global flow of aerosols. Aerosols make clouds deflect more heat away from Earth—an effect known as “radiative forcing.” (That’s the idea behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/the-nightmare-politics-and-sticky-science-of-hacking-the-climate/">plots</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/think-climate-change-is-messy-wait-until-geoengineering/">to geoengineer</a> the atmosphere with aerosols: Artificially seeding clouds that can cool the ground.) More aerosols mean more reflective clouds that look whiter, last longer, and rain less.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But scientists have trouble simulating just how many aerosols should be accounted for in models. “It’s been a long-standing problem,” Fan says. “A lot of climate models overestimate anthropogenic aerosol forcing.” Perhaps that is because they are underestimating the prevalence of natural aerosols—from microbes, plants, and trees—before the industrial revolution. “Maybe what we're using as our reference point may actually not be as low-aerosol as we thought,” agrees Zuidema.</p><p>By quantifying how trees make clouds, scientists could better predict the climate’s future—and past. Industrial emissions reduce some warming through radiative forcing, since sulfur aerosols can create reflective clouds. But if biogenic aerosols were more abundant than expected <em>before</em> industrialization, then the contributions from industry matter less.</p><p>It’s hard to predict what this recalculation will tell us about global warming, because there are so many moving parts in a dynamic climate. For example, heat stress, extreme weather, and droughts cause plants to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28218253/">release more biogenic volatiles</a>—which seed more clouds. Deforestation and heat stress are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/the-very-slow-race-to-move-forests-in-time-to-save-them/">pushing treelines to migrate</a> to higher altitudes and latitudes. That affects <em>where</em> clouds form.</p><p>“It’s a feedback loop,” Dada says. “The climate is affecting the cloud formation, and the clouds are affecting the climate.”</p><p>Better climate models will help scientists predict the best mitigations: “If we need more clouds, if we need less clouds,” Dada says. The catch, though, is that climate models are incredibly computationally demanding. It may not be easy to incorporate the physics of something as tiny as these tree aerosols.</p><p>Dada is back at CERN this autumn for more tests. Her team now wants to see how anthropogenic emissions, like sulfur dioxide, affect the ability of plants to seed clouds. They might slow each other down—or speed each other up. Their goal is to broaden their conclusions to regions that aren’t as pristine as a forest, where there are many kinds of intermingled emissions. “We're trying to add anthropogenic factors, to have a more realistic view about almost everywhere around the world,” she says.</p><p><em>Updated 9-29-2023 at 5:15 ET: This story was updated to correct a reference to Jiwen Fan's 2018 paper.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

The man said outdated and inaccurate information about him in newspaper articles found on the internet was leading to great personal harm, including physical assault, employment discrimination, severe social stigma and persistent fear.</p><p>He wanted the information to be delisted – made unsearchable, unless someone knew the website urls featuring his name. Ultimately, the Privacy Commissioner asked the Federal Court to rule on its jurisdiction to address the complaint under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.</p><p data-sophi-feature="interstitial"><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-supreme-court-rejects-deportation-of-non-citiz">Supreme Court rejects deportation of non-citizens accused – but not convicted – of violent acts</a></p><p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/google/" target="_blank">Google</a> argued that it acted as an intermediary between publishers and their audience, much as libraries or convenience stores do. It said that to exclude intermediaries would make the exemption for journalism ineffective. And media organizations, including The Globe and Mail, the CBC, CTV, Torstar, the Postmedia Network, Rogers Media Inc. and La Presse Inc., intervened to argue that Google plays an important role in disseminating news.</p><p>Justice Wyman Webb, who dissented in the ruling, agreed that Google is no different than a convenience store operator who sells newspapers, or a broadcaster who uses newspapers as a source of information.</p><p>“Google’s stated mission,” he wrote, “is ‘to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible.’ Google’s purpose in collecting the information found in the newspaper articles is to index this information so that it can be easily found by an individual using the Google search engine. Its only purpose in collecting the information is to make it more accessible.”</p><p>Lawyers for the complainant praised the court’s ruling.</p><p>“I think it’s a vindication of privacy regulations,” said Mark Phillips, co-counsel with Michael Fenrick. “Canada’s federal private-sector privacy legislation was put in place to protect individuals against new types of technological privacy threats of exactly the kind we’re seeing here.”</p><p>Valerie Lawton, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, said it is pleased the court agreed with its position that Google’s search engine service is subject to federal privacy law. “This brings welcome clarification to this area of the law.”</p><p>The case appears likely to be headed for the Supreme Court of Canada. A lawyer representing the media coalition said late Friday afternoon he was not yet authorized to comment, as did a lawyer for Google.</p><p data-sophi-feature="interstitial"><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-criminal-cases-on-verge-of-collapse-owing-to-courthouse-chaos/">Criminal cases in Ontario on verge of collapse owing to courthouse chaos</a></p><p>The ruling authorizes the Privacy Commissioner to review the complaint to determine whether it should recommend to Google that the complainant’s name be delisted from the search engine.</p><p>Two years ago, a Federal Court judge ruled on a definition of journalism developed by the Canadian Association of Journalists in ruling that Google’s search engine is not used solely for a journalistic purpose. The definition included informing the community on issues the community values, an element of original production, and discipline intended to provide accuracy and fairness.</p><p>In Friday’s ruling, Justice Laskin wrote that while other definitions are possible, what matters is what Google does: “Google displays responses to a user search query ranked in the order that Google considers of most relevance to the user, as determined by algorithms maintained by Google. That is the purpose of Google Search. In carrying out that purpose, Google is agnostic as to the nature of that content: nothing turns on whether or not it is journalistic, let alone on whether it meets certain aspirational standards of journalism.</p><p>“Even if the search happens to return snippets that contain links to journalistic content, that cannot be said to be its purpose when Google is indifferent to whether or not it does so. At a minimum, that cannot be said to be its sole purpose.”</p><p>He also said the questions before the court were more limited than the right to be forgotten. The constitutional protection of freedom of speech did not figure into the court’s analysis. Justice Laskin said “Charter values” are in play only where a statute has more than one plausible meaning.</p><p>Mr. Fenrick, the complainant’s co-counsel, said laws exist in Europe and in<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/quebec/" target="_blank"> Quebec</a> to allow people to press for their names to be delisted, and require privacy and autonomy to be balanced against the public’s right to know.</p><p>“We’re not arguing and no one has argued in any jurisdiction that people should have an automatic right to this,” he said. “It’s always been interpreted as a case-by-case balancing between the public’s right to know and privacy.”</p></article></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><strong>PruningRadixTrie - 1000x faster Radix trie</strong> for prefix search &amp; auto-complete</p>
<p dir="auto">The PruningRadixTrie is a novel data structure, derived from a radix trie - but 3 orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p dir="auto">A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree" rel="nofollow">Radix Trie</a> or Patricia Trie is a space-optimized trie (prefix tree).<br>
A <strong>Pruning Radix trie</strong> is a novel Radix trie algorithm, that allows pruning of the Radix trie and early termination of the lookup.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>In many cases, we are not interested in a complete set of all children for a given prefix, but only in the top-k most relevant terms.
Especially for short prefixes, this results in a <strong>massive reduction of lookup time</strong> for the top-10 results.
On the other hand, a complete result set of millions of suggestions wouldn't be helpful at all for autocompletion.</p><p>
The lookup acceleration is achieved by storing in each node the maximum rank of all its children. By comparing this maximum child rank with the lowest rank of the results retrieved so far, we can heavily prune the trie and do early termination of the lookup for non-promising branches with low child ranks.</p></div>

The <strong>Pruning Radix Trie</strong> is up to <strong>1000x faster</strong> than an ordinary Radix Trie.</p></div>
<p dir="auto">While 36 ms for an autocomplete might seem fast enough for a single user, it becomes insufficient when we have to serve thousands of users in parallel. Then autocomplete lookups in large dictionaries are only feasible when powered by something much faster than an ordinary radix trie.</p>
<p dir="auto">While a prefix of length=1 is not very useful for the Latin alphabet, it does make sense for CJK languages. Also, there are many more application fields for a fast prefix search algorithm beyond character-wise word completion: Instead of characters, the prefix can be composed of arbitrary items, e.g.
whole words in a query completion, or towns in a long routing sequence.</p>

Authority</p></div></div><div><p>TL;DR</p>
<ul>
<li>Users continue to report various issues with calling 911 emergency services on several Google Pixel smartphones.</li>
<li>These incidents have continued to occur after a possibly related bug was highlighted and fixed in January 2022.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Back in late 2021, reports had emerged of a weird bug on Google Pixel devices that would render them unable to connect to 911 emergency services. The issue was traced to Microsoft Teams, and both Google and Microsoft issued fixes in early 2022. But it seems that 911 calling is still somewhat randomly broken on Google Pixel devices, and some users are finding this out the hard way.</p><p>Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/16fax0w/it_finally_happened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/u/TonyStamp595SO</a> found themselves in an unfortunate situation where they needed to connect to emergency services immediately. They tried dialing 911 from their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-7-specs-price-availability-3220594/">Pixel 7</a>, but the phone failed to connect. The phone would keep dropping the call within a second of pressing the call button, which occurred for three attempts. The Redditor tried dialing from their Pixel 6 Pro next, and it connected immediately, and the emergency was handled.</p><p>This incident by itself is harrowing. But as it turns out, Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/y039zn/i_compiled_all_the_pixel_911emergency_call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/u/10-1-100</a> compiled over 20 such reports last year. The real kicker is that these reports exclude reports older than 2022, as that would include a publicly acknowledged bug that was subsequently “fixed.” The compilation was last updated in January 2023, so there may be other reports that have not yet been highlighted between then and now.</p><p>There are plenty of variables across the reports, ranging from different carriers to Wi-Fi calling. What is common in these reports is that the device is a Google Pixel smartphone.</p><p>To clarify, this bug does not occur on all Pixel devices. Many users report expected behavior when contacting emergency services. However, for these unfortunate reports highlighted above, the phone did not reliably connect to emergency services when it was really needed.</p><p>We’ve contacted Google for a statement and to learn more about the issue. We’ll update this article when we hear back from them.</p><p>In the meantime, you can try to schedule a “test” call to confirm that emergency calling is working on your Pixel smartphone. Remember that you may or may not face issues even after a successful test.</p><div><h2>How to schedule a “test” call to ensure that 911 emergency calling is working on your phone</h2>
<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.911.gov/calling-911/frequently-asked-questions/#:%7E:text=Test%20calls%20can%20be%20scheduled,to%20find%20your%20911%20administrator:~:text=Test%20calls%20confirm,for%20test%20calls." target="_blank">911.gov</a></em> (the official website for the National 911 Program in the US), you can schedule a test call to check whether your Pixel smartphone can successfully place a 911 call. However, a test call is different from directly calling the emergency service!</p>
</div><p>Do NOT directly call 911 for non-emergency "test" calls. Please schedule a call by contacting the non-emergency phone number first.</p><div>
<p>Instead of directly calling 911, you need to schedule a test call with your local 911 call center by contacting its non-emergency phone number.</p>
<ul>
<li>The website advises visiting the <a href="https://www.nasna911.org/contact-911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Association of State 911 Administrators</a> site.</li>
<li>Select the state where you live. This will show you the details of your 911 administrator.</li>
<li>Contact the administrator to find out the non-emergency number of your local 911 call center to schedule a test call.</li>
<li>Call the non-emergency number to schedule a day and time for a test call.</li>
<li>Make the test call during this scheduled slot only.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know or can locate the non-emergency phone number of your local PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point), you can inquire with them to schedule a test call without needing to route through the 911 administrator.</p>

<p>In collaboration with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), new research from Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard chair and co-founder <a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/our-team/karim-r-lakhani/">Karim Lakhani</a> and others explores field experimental evidence of the effects of AI on knowledge worker productivity and quality. It involved evaluating the performance of 758 consultants, which make up 7% of the individual contributor workforce of the company. The tasks spanned a consultant’s daily work, including creativity, analytical thinking, writing proficiency, and persuasiveness.</p>







<h2>Key Findings</h2>



<ul>
<li>For tasks within the AI frontier, ChatGPT-4 significantly increased performance, boosting speed by over 25%, human-rated performance by over 40%, and task completion by over 12%.</li>



<li>The study introduces the concept of a “jagged technological frontier,” where AI excels in some tasks but falls short in others.</li>



<li>Two distinct patterns of AI use emerged: “Centaurs,” who divided and delegated tasks between themselves and the AI, and “Cyborgs,” who integrated their workflow with the AI.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Shifting the Debate</h2>



<p>The paper argues that the focus should move beyond the binary decision of adopting or not adopting AI. Instead, we should evaluate the value of different configurations and combinations of humans and AI for various tasks within the knowledge workflow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/cloudflare-launches-new-ai-tools-to-help-customers-deploy-and-run-models/">https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/cloudflare-launches-new-ai-tools-to-help-customers-deploy-and-run-models/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37713222">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Looking to cash in on the AI craze, Cloudflare, the cloud services provider, is launching a new collection of products and apps aimed at helping customers build, deploy and run AI models at the network edge.</p>
<p>One of the new offerings, Workers AI, lets customers access physically nearby GPUs hosted by Cloudflare partners to run AI models on a pay-as-you-go basis. Another, Vectorize, provides a vector database to store vector embeddings — mathematical representations of data — generated by models from Workers AI. A third, AI Gateway, is designed to provide metrics to enable customers to better manage the costs of running AI apps.</p>
<p>According to Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, the launch of the new AI-focused product suite was motivated by a strong desire from Cloudflare customers for a simpler, easier-to-use AI management solution — one with a focus on cost savings.</p>
<p><span>“The offerings already on the market are still very complicated — they require stitching together lots of new vendors, and it gets expensive fast,” Prince told TechCrunch in an email interview. “There’s also very little insight currently available on how you’re spending money on AI; observability is a big challenge as AI spend skyrockets. We can help simplify all of these aspects for developers.”</span></p>
<p>To this end, Workers AI attempts to ensure AI inference always happens on GPUs close to users (from a geographic standpoint) to deliver a low-latency, AI-powered end-user experience. Leveraging ONNX, the Microsoft-backed intermediary machine learning toolkit used to convert between different AI frameworks, Workers AI allows AI models to run wherever processing makes the most sense in terms of bandwidth, latency, connectivity, processing and localization constraints.</p>
<p>Workers AI users can choose models from a catalog to get started, including large language models (LLMs) like Meta’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/18/meta-releases-llama-2-a-more-helpful-set-of-text-generating-models/">Llama 2</a>, automatic speech recognition models, image classifiers and sentiment analysis models. With Workers AI, data stays in the server region where it originally resided. And any data used for inference — e.g. prompts fed to an LLM or image-generating model — aren’t used to train current or future AI models.</p>
<p>“Ideally, inference should happen near the user for a low-latency user experience. However, devices don’t always have the compute capacity or battery power required to execute large models such as LLMs,” Prince said. “<span>Meanwhile, traditional centralized clouds are often geographically too far from the end user. These centralized clouds are also mostly based in the U.S., making it complicated for businesses around the world that prefer not to (or legally cannot) send data out of its home country. Cloudflare provides the best place to solve both these problems.”</span></p>
<p>Workers AI already has a major vendor partner: AI startup Hugging Face. Hugging Face will optimize generative AI models to run on Workers AI, Cloudflare says, while Cloudflare will become the first serverless GPU partner for deploying Hugging Face models.</p>
<p>Databricks is another. Databricks says that it’ll work to bring AI inference to Workers AI through MLflow, the open source platform for managing machine learning workflows, and Databricks’ marketplace for software. Cloudflare will join the MLflow project as an active contributor, and Databricks will roll out MLflow capabilities to developers actively building on the Workers AI platform.</p>
<p>Vectorize targets a different segment of customers: those needing to store vector embeddings for AI models in a database. Vector embeddings, the building blocks of machine learning algorithms used by applications ranging from search to AI assistants, are representations of training data that are more compact while preserving what’s meaningful about the data.</p>
<p>Models in Workers AI can be used to generate embeddings that can then be stored in Vectorize. Or, customers can keep embeddings generated by third-party models from vendors such as OpenAI and Cohere.</p>
<p>Now, vector databases are hardly new. Startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/27/pinecone-drops-100m-investment-on-750m-valuation-as-vector-database-demand-grows/">Pinecone</a> host them, as do public cloud incumbents like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. But Prince asserts that Vectorize benefits from Cloudflare’s global network, allowing queries of the database to happen closer to users — leading to reduced latency and inference time.</p>
<p>“As a developer, getting started with AI today requires access to — and management of — infrastructure that’s inaccessible to most,” Prince said. “We can help make it a simpler experience from the get-go … We’re able to add this technology to our existing network, allowing us to leverage our existing infrastructure and pass on better performance, as well as better cost.”</p>
<p>The last component of the AI suite, AI Gateway, provides observability features to assist with tracking AI traffic. For example, AI Gateway keeps tabs on the number of model inferencing requests as well as the duration of those requests, the number of users using a model and the overall cost of running an AI app.</p>
<p>In addition, AI Gateway offers capabilities to reduce costs, including caching and rate limiting. With caching, customers can cache responses from LLMs to common questions, minimizing (but presumably not entirely eliminating) the need for an LLM to generate a new response. Rate limiting confers more control over how apps scale by mitigating malicious actors and heavy traffic.</p>
<p>Prince makes the claim that, with AI Gateway, Cloudflare is one of the few providers of its size that lets developers and companies only pay for the compute they use. That’s not completely true — third-party tools like GPTCache can replicate AI Gateway’s caching functionality on other providers, and providers including Vercel deliver rate limiting as a service — but he also argues that Cloudflare’s approach is more streamlined than the competition’s.</p>
<p>We’ll have to see if that’s the case.</p>
<p>“Currently, customers are paying for a lot of idle compute in the form of virtual machines and GPUs that go unused,” Prince said. “We see an opportunity to abstract away a lot of the toil and complexity that’s associated with machine learning operations today, and service developers’ machine learning workflows through a holistic solution.”</p>

It follows the breakdown of settlement talks with the EEOC after Tesla announced that the agency had formally raised its concerns last year.</p><p>Tesla faces several other race discrimination lawsuits that make similar accusations, including a class action by workers at the Fremont plant and a lawsuit by a California civil rights agency. The company in those cases has said it does not tolerate discrimination and takes workers’ complaints seriously.</p><p>Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>“If the federal government gets involved, it certainly adds credibility to the claims,” said Stephen Diamond, a law professor at Santa Clara University, who noted that he has advised investors on social responsibility at Tesla.</p><p>“Major institutional investors like pension funds will be very concerned about this type of behavior,” he said.</p><p>The EEOC in the lawsuit said it began investigating Tesla after the five-member commission’s chair, Charlotte Burrows, filed an internal complaint against the company.</p><p>After finding last year that there was “reasonable cause” to believe Tesla had violated the federal law banning workplace race discrimination, the agency tried and failed to enter into a settlement agreement with the company, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Burrows in a statement said combating widespread workplace harassment is a key priority for the EEOC.</p><p>“Every employee deserves to have their civil rights respected, and no worker should endure the kind of shameful racial bigotry our investigation revealed,” she said.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-13" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The EEOC’s lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for an unspecified number of Black workers, along with an order requiring Tesla to overhaul its policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation.</p><p>Tesla is seeking to fend off similar claims from the California civil rights department, a state-level counterpart of the EEOC. The department alleges that Tesla discriminated against Black workers when making decisions about pay, promotions and work assignments. A California judge last year rejected Tesla’s motion to dismiss that case.</p><p>Tesla has claimed that the California department’s lawsuit was politically motivated and has argued that the agency violated state law by suing without first notifying the company of all of the claims or giving it a chance to settle.</p><p>In addition, a Black former elevator operator at the Fremont plant, Owen Diaz, is seeking a third trial in his 2017 lawsuit claiming he was subjected to severe racial harassment after a jury in April awarded him $3.2m.</p><p>A different jury in 2021 had awarded Diaz $137m, but a federal judge said that was excessive and Diaz opted for a new trial instead of a reduced award of $15m.</p><p>Tesla is also facing a class-action lawsuit in California state court over the alleged mistreatment of Black factory workers. About 240 workers have moved to join that lawsuit.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2><b>Hello,</b></h2>
<p>I’ve been contacted a few times recently about the sharp decline in descriptive images on the <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/calendar/">events listings</a>. A picture really helps to show what an event will be like, and people are asking why there’s been a decline in them — however, a problem has arisen over the past year.</p>
<p>Copyright trolls.</p>
<p>I’ve been walloped recently by a cluster of start-up companies that scan websites looking for photo infringements.</p>
<p>If I’ve made the mistake myself, then I put my hands up, guilty m’lord.</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of my “fines” have been because an event venue has used or supplied an image to me, and they either didn’t have permission themselves, or the license they paid for didn’t allow them to use the photo to promote their event on other websites.</p>
<p>As the publisher, I am held to be liable, even when the photo supplier made the mistake.</p>
<p>Legally, I could go back to the venue and tell them to refund the often circa £400 per incident, but most are charities, so I have been sucking up the cost as it just feels wrong to expect small charities to cover the costs they have unwittingly dumped on me, and can ill afford</p>
<p>However, with bills that have reached the thousands over the past few months alone, the only solution is not to use images on events unless I am convinced the venue has a license to use them. Expecting a small organisation to sign consent forms and the like for every single event listing, often where the marketing is done by a part-time person working a couple of days a week… is just not viable.</p>
<p>So, sorry, but I have to reduce the number of header images on events, even though I know how helpful they are.</p>
<p>The events will keep being listed, so you can keep finding <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/calendar/">wonderful things</a> to do in London, just with fewer photos.</p>
<p>The risks are just too great.</p>
<h2>Help support the ianVisits website</h2>
<p>Also, for a bit over a decade, ianVisits has been providing news and listings about what’s happening in London.</p>
<p>While advertising revenue contributes to funding the website’s costs, online advertising is a rapidly shrinking option for websites to rely on. That is why I have a facility with <a href="https://donorbox.org/support-ianvisits-reporting-and-events-guide">DonorBox</a> where you can support the costs of running the website and the time invested in writing and researching news articles.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a one-off donation or a regular giver, every additional support goes a long way to cover the costs of running the ianVisits website and keeping you regularly topped up with doses of Londony news and facts.</p>
<p>If you like what ianVisits does, then please support the website <a href="https://donorbox.org/support-ianvisits-reporting-and-events-guide"><b>here</b></a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
	  <p>This is the next quarterly update of the esp-rs effort, detailing the progress over Q3 2023.</p>
<h2 id="rust-xtensa-compiler">Rust Xtensa Compiler</h2>
<p>We had one big bugfix around hardware <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/rust/issues/180">floating point unit for ESP32 &amp; ESP32-S3</a>, shout out to <a href="https://github.com/zRedShift">@zRedShift</a> for finding the bug and providing the fix in <a href="https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/76">llvm-project#76</a>. Along with the bugfix, <a href="https://github.com/zRedShift">@zRedShift</a> also contributed two code generation improvement patches, one to improve the performance of <a href="https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/77"><code>cttz</code></a> and another to improve the performance of <a href="https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/78"><code>abs</code>, <code>min</code> and <code>max</code></a>. The Xtensa-related LLVM patches upstream are still in review but are slowly making progress.</p>
<h2 id="esp-hal-no-std">esp-hal - no_std</h2>
<p>Q3 saw the <code>v0.11</code> and <code>v0.12</code> release of esp-hal. Highlights include updating the <code>embedded-hal-*</code> packages to <code>1.0.0-rc.1</code>, ready for the long awaited <code>1.0</code> release of <code>embedded-hal</code>; The addition of deep-sleep support for the <code>ESP32-S3</code>, and new cryptographic accelerator support for ECC, HMAC and RSA. We've made a start on adding support for the low-power core of the ESP32-C6, with some basic GPIO drivers and support for loading the LP code from the main core. Check out the full <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for all the details.</p>
<h2 id="esp-wifi-no-std">esp-wifi - no_std</h2>
<p>We added BLE support for the ESP32-C6 in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/262">esp-wifi#262</a>, improved the esp-now async API in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/232">#232</a> along with a bunch of other smaller fixes and improvements! We're gearing up for our first crates.io release, which is long overdue. We've had all the pieces in place for a release, we just didn't get around to doing it! We're currently in the process of improving the docs, and doing some final testing before the release.</p>
<h2 id="esp-idf-hal-std">esp-idf-hal - std</h2>
<p>Async I2S, SPI, ADC and GPIO were added in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/279">esp-idf-hal#279</a>, with a follow up PR for UART in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/306">esp-idf-hal#306</a>. Huge props to <a href="https://github.com/ivmarkov">@ivmarkov</a> for the tremendous effort here. From the latest <code>v0.42.0</code> release, ESP-IDF version 4.3 is now deprecated for use with Rust. Please see <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/versions.html#support-periods">ESP-IDFs support schedule</a> for upgrade paths. See the full changelog for esp-idf-hal <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="esp-idf-svc-std">esp-idf-svc - std</h2>
<p>Bluetooth classic support (for the esp32 only at the moment) has been added, behind the <code>experimental</code> feature flag; BLE is also planned. We are also discussing how to go about adding generic Bluetooth traits in embedded-svc, <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/embedded-svc/issues/32">here</a>. From the latest release, it will no longer be required to depend on the esp-idf-sys crate or the esp-idf-hal crate directly in your project, instead, this crate will be re-exported by esp-idf-svc as <code>esp_idf_svc::sys</code> and <code>esp_idf_svc::hal</code> respectively.</p>
<h2 id="matter-rs-rs-matter">matter-rs / rs-matter</h2>
<p>rs-matter (previously, matter-rs, but has been renamed due to an existing crate registered on crates.io) has had its first crates.io release! It is now async first (executor agnostic), with support for no_std out of the box, even including QR generation. The rs-matter repo now <a href="https://github.com/project-chip/rs-matter">has some examples</a> which can be run on std platforms, including the espidf std port! For <code>no_std</code> there are two examples of matter usage, <a href="https://github.com/bjoernQ/matter-rs-experiment">one using an esp32c3 (blocking)</a> and another using <a href="https://github.com/ivmarkov/rp-matter">a rp-2040 (async)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="espflash">espflash</h3>
<p>Just a small patch release to report, <code>v2.0.1</code> which added more help text on the CLI commands, and fixed a compilation issue in the <code>cargo</code> dependency.</p>
<h3 id="espsegs">espsegs</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bjoernQ/espsegs">espsegs</a> is a tool to see what memory is being used by which sections and where on an esp. Once installed, you can simply point the tool to an elf file, and you'll get an output like below:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>
  Hello!<br>
  The code refactor of rails presented last week is great, but the motivation for such a task wasn't quite just some shape changes for rails.
</p>

<p>
  As explained last week, we can now define any kind of rail shape, and we had some very specific shapes in mind all along...
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Over or under?</h3>

<p>
  We want multi-level crossings for trains, but how? Bridges or tunnels?
</p>

<p>
  At first it would seem like going underground is the safer bet - we already have experience with belts and pipes doing that. Simple - we draw the entrance and the exit, the middle is magically connected, and that's it?
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The second layer of rails should also be able to use curves and rail signals, otherwise it would be quite limited.
    </li><li>Sometimes you already want to interact with items inside of underground belts, with trains this would be a lot worse as they can run out of fuel, stop at signals etc.
    </li><li>Building curves, signals or interacting with trains inside of a tunnel probably means we need to be able to walk inside.
    </li><li>If we can walk in a tunnel, biters and robots should be able to as well.
    </li><li>If tunnels can have curves, how could you tell which tunnel entrance connects to which exit when looking from the outside?
    </li><li>Tunnels "over" water don't quite feel right.
    </li><li>Drawing tunnels would be surprisingly difficult as we would need to do some expensive masking that Factorio isn't currently capable of.
    </li><li>And more...
  </li></ul>


<p>
  The idea of an elevated rail seems to have much more potential, although drawing in an upper layer certainly won't be easy either.
  <br>
  Also, you just want to boldly see all of your trains in their full glory instead of hiding them somewhere in a cellar!
</p>

<p>
  Such an idea would consist of:
  </p><ul>
    <li><strong>Rail ramp</strong> - The transition between the lower and upper layer.
    </li><li><strong>Elevated rail</strong> - Tracks buildable above most things.
    </li><li><strong>Rail support</strong> - Elevated rails would need supports at some intervals.
  </li></ul>


<p>

  <br><i>Elevated rail system pieces. These were the "greybox" graphics to test the gameplay of the new rail shapes and the ramps, before the final graphics were created.</i>
</p>

<h3>Elevated rails</h3>

<p>
  I know you've already scrolled down to see the ramps instead of reading this but it just felt weird not to put a
  paragraph here.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-ramp.png">
</p>

<p>
  When we thought about the visual design with Albert and Earendel, we wanted the ramp to be heavy and industrial, but
  at the same time not quite perfectly stable and rigid. After multiple iterations we have arrived to this combination
  of a solid concrete base combined with an upper metal structure.
</p>


<p>
  The concrete base helps clearly show where the ramp touches the ground, while in contrast the metal part has a lot of holes so you could see entities placed behind the ramp most of the time. The metal is painted red, as mostly the only other red entities in Factorio are related to trains, it helps the elevated rails belong to the train family, and stand out in the factory - as they should with their height.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-ramp-collision-boxes.png">
</p>

<p>
  The rail ramp is the new longest entity in the game at 16 tiles long and 4 tiles wide, so you will need to consider where and when to place it. It can only rotate in 4 directions.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-support.png">
</p>

<p>
  The rail support follows the style of the ramp, but with the difference that it can be rotated in 8 directions.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-rail-support-collision-boxes.png">
</p>

<p>
  It has a roughly 4x4 collision box, with the rotated ones all having the same shape.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-elevated-rails.png">
</p>

<p>
  The elevated rails can be built between ramps, held by rail supports along the way.
</p>
<p>
  The elevated rail can be constructed above anything except tall entities (rocket silo, roboport, big electric pole, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  They have exactly the same rail shapes as the new ground rails do, and signals can be attached to the elevated rails.
</p>
<p>
  There are fences which help visually distinguish the elevated rails from ground rails, you can also see how they disappear on track crossings.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-junction-simple.png">
  <br><i>In practice replacing a colliding connection inside of a T junction with a ramp going around it can already help a lot.</i>
</p>

    </video>
  </p>
  <p>
    With the ramp being long and since we have "only" two layers, building a fully multilevel junction can get rather large, but the throughput potential is massive.
    <br>It's worth noting that it's not just the level separation that helps. It's also the fact that we don't need chain signals, so we can shorten the distance between normal rail signals a lot as we don't need to guarantee there's enough space for a train "behind the junction".
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically in arrays of train stops, having the exit and entrance on different levels is a game changer.
  </p>


<p><img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-ramps-on-water.png">
    <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-ramps-on-landfill.png">
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a very special patch that draws under terrain which is visible only in places where the ramps or supports touch water.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    In case you decide to route your rails through a lake because why not, islands can become opportunities for multi-level crossings.
  </p>



<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-rail-planner-ramp.png">
<br><i>Building something elevated can be done with the rail planner. Either you can press a keyboard shortcut to switch the destination layer or you can start the rail planner on a ramp, rail support, or an elevated rail.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-rail-planner-snapping.png">
  <br><i>But one day, kovarex said "Why doesn't the rail planner just snap to the rail you're pointing at?"
  <br>And since that day it does, rail planner "just connects" to any rail you pick, including between ground and elevated levels.
  <br>This also massively helps mitigate issues related to the rail planner having more directions.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-rail-planner-obstacles.png">
  <br><i>The rail planner can often find connections you wouldn't even expect to be possible, which can be mesmerizing to play with...</i>

  </p>
  <p>
    ...as a result, this can happen a lot quicker than you'd think.
  </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Allowing trains to cross paths on different levels has been one of the most requested features for a very long time. We had always felt it makes perfect sense, but trains in Factorio would rarely ever get into serious enough throughput issues to justify adding elevated rails.
</p>
<p>
  The expansion changed this landscape quite a bit though. If we expect players to generally build larger factories than in the base game, train throughput could become an issue, and since you are expected to travel away from the home planet, having a train system that doesn't deadlock would be more important than ever before.
</p>
<p>
  It's not hard to guess that implementing this would require a lot of time, and working on the expansion behind closed doors allowed us some breathing room where we could make bigger experiments.
</p>
<p>
  Between boskid with the mechanics and posila with the drawing code, just the programming took a few months. On the graphics side, we could reuse a lot of initial Blender setup from the rework of ground rails, but that didn't get us very far. The ramps were simply large objects, while the rail supports are a hive of optical hacks as they need to fill their collision boxes. Both the ramps and supports were reworked multiple times to finally get the result that would look and function well.
</p>
<p>
  Especially because of the elevated rail fences, the required sprite count grew very rapidly. This made me use all the tricks in our Blender book and even add completely new Blender Python tools that mostly help with organizing and rendering large amounts of outputs. I got the final iteration to about 90% completion but then it just became too much.
</p>
<p>
  Jerzy already had experience with rail graphics, so I had asked him to help me by finishing the last details and texturing, and then he handled all of the signals and remnants again. It's hard to overstate how much bravery and mental fortitude was required to "just" jump into the Blend file of the elevated rails, and I'd like to thank him for that, again.
  <br>You can probably see from the above images that he did excellently. :)
</p>
<p>
  Between Earendel on concept art, me on most of the 3D process, Jerzy on finishing and together with Albert on re-evaluating multiple major iterarions, the graphics took about 9 months to make. Perhaps we could have taken some simplified route trying to make tunnels work, but we believe the elevated rails offer better gameplay beyond comparison.<br>
  Yet again we can confidently say that properly focusing on some features in the expansion rather than trying to shove more things into 1.0 was a very good decision.
</p>
<p>
  All of the elevated rails will be <strong>only available with the expansion executable</strong>. Their technology can be researched using Production science packs without the need to go to space or any planets. Elevated rails be will one of the standalone official mods next to Quality and Space Age, so you can play a vanilla-like game with just the elevated rails for example, or other mods can just depend on Elevated rails.
</p>

<p>
  As always, we are looking forward to all the feedback you are about to elevate.

<p><em><span>“</span>Technology is like a bomb in Myanmar.” —Kyaw Kyaw, frontman of Burmese punk band Rebel Riot <a href="#footnote-1U21" id="ref-1U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>Back in early July, I started working on a quick series of posts about <a href="https://erinkissane.com/the-affordance-loop">online structures of refuge and exposure</a>. In a draft of what I meant to be the second post in the series, I tried to write a tight two or three paragraphs about the role Meta played in the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar, and why it made me dubious about Threads. Over time, those two or three paragraphs turned into a long summary, then a detailed timeline, then an unholy hybrid of blog post and research paper.</p>
<p>What I learned in the process was so starkly awful that I finally set the whole series aside for a while until I could do a lot more reading and write something more substantial. Nearly three months later, I’m ready to share my notes.</p>
<p>Here’s a necessary personal disclosure: I’ve never trusted Facebook, mostly because I’ve been around tech for a long time and everything I’ve ever learned about the company looked like a red flag. Like, I’m <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">on the record</a> swearing about it.</p>
<p>But once I started to really dig in, what I learned was so much gnarlier and grosser and more devastating than what I’d assumed. The harms Meta passively and actively fueled destroyed or ended hundreds of thousands of lives that might have been yours or mine, but for accidents of birth. I say<span></span> <span>“</span>hundreds of thousands” because<span></span> <span>“</span>millions” sounds unbelievable, but by the end of my research I came to believe that the actual number is very, very large.</p>
<p>To make sense of it, I had to try to go back, reset my assumptions, and try build up a detailed, factual understanding of what happened in this one tiny slice of the world’s experience with Meta. The risks and harms in Myanmar—and their connection to Meta’s platform—are meticulously documented. And if you’re willing to spend time in the documents, it’s not that hard to piece together what happened.</p>
<p>I started down this path—in this series, on this site, over this whole year—because I want to help make better technologies and systems in service of a better world. And I think the only way to make better things is to thoroughly understand what’s happened so far. Put another way, I want to base decisions on transparently sourced facts and cautiously reasoned analysis, not on assumptions or vibes—mine or anyone else’s.</p>
<p>What I want to promise you, my imaginary reader, is that I’ve approached this with as much care and precision as I can. I cite a lot of documentation from humanitarian organizations and many well-sourced media reports, and also a bunch of internal Meta documentation. What I’m after is maybe something like a <em>cultural-technical incident report</em>. I hope it helps.</p>
<p>This is the first of four posts in the series. Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>I’ve put notes about terms (Meta vs.&nbsp;Facebook, Myanmar vs.&nbsp;Burma, etc.) and sources and warnings in a <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-meta">separate meta-post</a>. If you’re someone who likes to know about that kind of thing, you might want to pop that post open in a tab. If you spot typos or inaccuracies, I’m reachable at erin at incisive.nu and appreciate all bug reports.</p>
<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> I’m marking some sections and some cited sources with individual warnings, but this is a story with a genocide at its heart, so be aware of that going in. I’ve also included a small selection of hateful messages in this post and throughout the series so that it’s clear what we’re talking about when we talk about<span></span> <span>“</span>hate speech.” Some contain words that, used in specific contexts, constitute slurs. I put some notes about all of that in the <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-meta">meta post</a> as well.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-a-story-about-tech">This is a story about tech</h2>
<p>Even if you never read any further, know this: Facebook played what the lead investigator on the <span>UN</span> Human Rights Council’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (hereafter just<span></span> <span>“</span>the <span>UN</span> Mission”) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUSKCN1GO2PN">called a<span></span> <span>“</span>determining role”</a> in the bloody emergence of what would become the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar.<a href="#footnote-2U21" id="ref-2U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>From far away, I think Meta’s role in the Rohingya crisis can feel blurry and debatable—it was content moderation fuckups, right? In a country they weren’t paying much attention to? Unethical and probably negligent, but come on, what tech company isn’t, at some point?</p>
<p>Plus, Meta has popped up in the press and <a href="https://wapo.st/44kiijx">before Congress</a> to admit that they fucked up and have concrete plans to do better. They lost sleep over it, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/facebooks-alleged-role-in-myanmars-violence-is-deeply-concerning-says-facebooks-news-feed-chief.html">said Adam Mosseri</a>, the person in charge of Facebook’s News Feed, back in March of 2018.</p>
<p>By that point in 2018, Myanmar’s military had murdered thousands of Rohingya people, including babies and children, and beaten, raped, tortured, starved, and imprisoned thousands more. About <em>three-quarters of a million</em> Rohingya had fled Myanmar to live in huge, disease-infested refugee camps in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>And Meta?</p>
<p>By that point, Meta had been receiving detailed and increasingly desperate warnings about Facebook’s role as an accelerant of genocidal propaganda in Myanmar for <em>six years</em>.</p>

<p>My big hope for the internet is that we handle the shit we need to handle to make sturdier, less poisoned/poisonous ways to connect and collaborate in the gnarly-looking decades ahead. I think that’s not just <em>possible</em>, but that it’s our responsibility to work toward it. Also, I’m pretty sure that despite the best intentions and the most transparent processes, we risk doing enormous harm if we don’t learn from the past. (Maybe even if we do.)</p>
<p>This series is for anyone who, like me—and despite everything not good about the tech world—has found themselves periodically heartened and sustained by open technology projects, online communities, and ways of being together even when we’re far apart.</p>
<p>And the thing I want you, and all of us, to remember about the sudden flowering of the internet in Myanmar in the 2010s is that in the beginning, it was incredibly welcome and so filled with hope.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-the-internet">Welcome to the internet</h2>
<p>After decades of crushing state repression, a more democratic regime came into power in Myanmar in 2011 and gradually relaxed restrictions on the internet, and on speech more generally. Journalist and tech researcher Faine Greenwood (they/them) is working in Southeast Asia at the time, and gets <a href="https://faineg.com/facebook-destroys-everything-part-1/">caught up in the spirit of the moment</a>, despite their skepticism about the benefits of the internet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d connected with a Myanmar <span>NGO</span> dedicated to digital inclusion, and through them, I got a chance to meet and interview a number of brilliant and extremely online Burmese people, all of them brimming with long-suppressed, almost giddy, optimism about their country’s technological future.</p>
<p>It was hard for me not to share their enthusiasm, their massive relief at finally getting out from under the jackboot of a military regime that had tried to lock them away from the rest of their world for as long as they could remember. I came away from speaking with them with a warm, happy feeling about how online communication maybe, just maybe, really did have the power to unfuck the world.<a href="#footnote-3U21" id="ref-3U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And online communication was coming in fast, as the price of <span>SIM</span> cards, which had been controlled by the ruling junta, dropped from the equivalent of $2,000 <span>USD</span> in 2009, to $250 in 2012, to $1.50 in 2014.<a href="#footnote-4U21" id="ref-4U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Mobile adoption explodes, from less than one quarter of a percent of the population in 2011 to more than 90% in 2017.<a href="#footnote-5U21" id="ref-5U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> And smartphone use and internet uptake spikes <em>with</em> the mobile revolution instead of dragging along behind—a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-07-10/the-unprecedented-explosion-of-smartphones-in-myanmar">2017 Bloomberg article</a> does some flavor reporting to contextualize those numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thiri Thant Mon, owner of a small investment bank in the city, says she still remembers how magazines from the outside world used to arrive weeks late because censors needed time to comb through them.</p>
<p><span>“</span>Suddenly because we’re on internet,” she said,<span></span> <span>“</span>people realize what the rest of the world looks like. Now it’s like everybody on the street is talking about Trump. A few years ago, nobody knew what was happening in the next town.”<a href="#footnote-6U21" id="ref-6U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2015, writer and photographer Craig Mod is working with a team doing internet ethnography in rural Myanmar on behalf of an organization that designs and builds hardware—including modern farming implements—to improve the lives of farmers, who make up the majority of Myanmar’s populace. (Disclosure: Craig and I have halfass-known each other for going on a couple of decades, and I’m a longtime fan of his work.)</p>
<p><a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/smartphones_in_myanmar/">Mod’s essay about his work</a> is clearly the product of a sensitive eye and a nerd’s delight in the way new technology twines up with the unevenly distributed realities of daily life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The village still lacks electricity although they’ve pooled funds and a dozen newly planted metal-power poles dot the fields, waiting to be wired up. Through our interpreter I ask, Where do you charge? Farmer Number Ten points to a car battery hanging in the corner onto which familiar <span>USB</span> wires are spliced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tech is all over the place,<span></span> <span>“</span>cheap but capable,” and Craig wonders if the one-smartphone-per-human result would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">make Nicholas Negroponte happy</a>. There are no iPhones, no credit cards, no data plans:<span></span> <span>“</span>Everyone buys top-up from top-up shops, scratches off complex serial numbers printed in a small font, types them with special network codes into their phone dialers in a way that feels steampunkish, like they’re divining data. They feel each megabyte.”<a href="#footnote-7U21" id="ref-7U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<hr>
<p>This is the point in the conversation when it becomes impossible not to talk about Facebook. Because in Myanmar, even back in 2012 and 2013, being online meant being on Facebook.</p>
<p>I’d read about Facebook’s superdominance in Amnesty International’s reporting, in long stories from Reuters and <em>Wired</em> and the <em><span>NYT</span></em> and the <em>Guardian</em>, in books, even in <span>UN</span> reports. But Mod’s notes bring to life both Facebook’s pervasiveness and the way Burmese people actually used it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We ask about apps. The farmer uses [chat app] Viber and Facebook. He says he chats with a few friends on Facebook but mainly people he doesn’t know. Most of his Facebook friends are strangers. He tells us his brother installed the app for him, and set up his account. He doesn’t know the email address that was used. He gets most of his news from Facebook. The election looms and he loves the political updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Farmer Number Ten tells us he used to use radio for news but no more. He says he hasn’t turned the radio on in years. Other news apps—like one called TZ—use too much data. He’s data conscious. He uses Facebook mostly at night when the internet is fastest, and cheapest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And speaking with the proprietor of a cellphone shop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is the most popular app, he says. Nine out of ten people who come into the shop want Facebook. Ten months ago <span>SIM</span> prices dropped, data prices dropped, interest in Facebook jumped. I take note. Only half the people who come into the shop already have a Facebook account. The other half don’t know how to make one. I do that for them, he says. I am the account maker.</p>
<p>And what about other apps? He mentions a news app called <span>TZ</span>. Once popular, now less so. He brushes his hand aside and says it’s too data hungry. Everyone is data sensitive he says and reiterates: Facebook. Nobody needs a special app for their interests. Just search for your interest on Facebook. Facebook is the Internet.<a href="#footnote-8U21" id="ref-8U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how did Facebook get to be the internet?</p>
<p>In the early years, there’s a stripped-down version of the app kicking around that used less data than competitors’. But also, when Myanmar’s government opens up to two foreign telecom services, the stronger of the two, Norway’s Telenor,<span></span> <span>“</span>zero-rates” Facebook.<a href="#footnote-9U21" id="ref-9U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Essentially, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/zero-rating-global-threat-open-internet/">zero-rating is a selective subsidy</a>; it means that customers won’t be charged for the data they use for some parts of the internet, but not others. For all of Telenor’s customers, using Facebook is free.</p>
<p>I want to briefly flip ahead to something Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen says in a 2021 interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook bought the privilege of being the internet for the majority of languages in the world. It subsidized people’s use of its own platform, and said<span></span> <span>“</span>Hey, you can use anything you want, but you’ll have to pay for that—or you can use our platform for free.” As a result, for the majority of languages in the world, 80 or 90% of all the content in that exists in those languages is on Facebook.<a href="#footnote-10U21" id="ref-10U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this explosion of connectivity presented dangers as well as freedoms is immediately clear to civil society orgs in Myanmar, for two main reasons: The first is the state of comparative innocence with which the vast majority of Burmese people approach the internet. The second is that the political situation in Myanmar is a powderkeg at best.</p>
<p>There’s a third thing, though most people don’t know it yet, which is that Meta’s decision-making about Myanmar reflects no willingness to adjust for the first two. To get to that, we need to start at the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="the-blogger-and-the-monk">The blogger and the monk</h2>
<p>A tiny canned history of modern Myanmar might go like this: In a series of East-India-Company–entangled conflicts, the British Empire took control of Myanmar, then called Burma. From the beginning of the wars in 1824 to 1948, Britain ruled Burma, with a big rupture during <span>WWII</span> when Japan invaded Burma.</p>

<p>After the war, the Burmese government the British left behind was too weak to withstand the combination of vigorous civil conflict with ethnic minorities on the frontiers and a 1962 coup by military leaders.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1962, Burma—renamed Myanmar in English by the ruling junta, but the two names come from the same root—is under incredibly tight military rule. Beginning in 2011, the junta relaxes their grip, and Myanmar begins a precarious transition to a more democratic form of government. Note: All through this entire period, Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, is also waging a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Myanmar">70-year civil war</a> with armed insurgencies associated with several different ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Starting the year after Myanmar’s first quasi-democratic general election in 2010, the Burmese government begins granting mass amnesties to the country’s many political prisoners. Hundreds of people—journalists, activists, artists, religious leaders, and many more—are released over the next few years.</p>
<p>In the mass amnesty granted in January of 2012, two of the many prisoners released will go on to found organizations that play major and opposing roles in escalating crises of communal and military violence that Myanmar’s entry to the internet will fuel.</p>
<p>One is Nay Phone Latt, an early blogger and digital rights activist, who was jailed in 2008, <a href="https://ifex.org/imprisoned-burmese-blogger-nay-phone-latt-to-receive-top-pen-honor/">basically for blogging</a> about the 2007 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_Revolution">Saffron Revolution</a> demonstrations. <a href="https://www.burmalink.org/really-worried-countrys-future/">Nay Phone Latt will go on to co-found <span>MIDO</span></a>, an organization dedicated to helping Myanmar’s ordinary citizens reap the benefits of the newly available internet. Over the next several years, <span>MIDO</span> will come up repeatedly in the intense struggle against online hate campaigns, especially on Facebook.<a href="#footnote-11U21" id="ref-11U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The second is Ashin Wirathu, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/12/only-takes-one-terrorist-buddhist-monk-reviles-myanmar-muslims-rohingya-refugees-ashin-wirathu">Buddhist monk jailed in 2003</a> for sermons inciting violence against Myanmar’s Muslim communities.<a href="#footnote-12U21" id="ref-12U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Wirathu will go on to digitize Myanmar’s hardline extremist Buddhist movement, which will play a major role in the coming waves of anti-Muslim violence—also especially on Facebook.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2013, Faine Greenwood goes back to Myanmar to write about the country’s first Internet Freedom Forum,<span></span> <span>“</span>a gathering dedicated to helping Myanmar’s people take advantage of the new, liberated Internet.” Faine writes about the heady vibes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay Phone Latt spoke at the conference, and so did a number of the other brilliant young Burmese tech enthusiasts I’d met before. The mood was still buoyantly optimistic as we circulated from one Post-It note-filled brainstorming session to the next, as we drank tea, discussed Internet freedom regulations and online privacy.</p>
<p>And yet, I could detect a slight edge in the air, a certain trepidation that had grown, mutated into new forms, in the few months since I’d been away […] During the conference, we talked about how hateful talk about the Rohingya was starting to pop up on Facebook, about how it was casting an ominous shadow over the good things about helping more people get online.<a href="#footnote-13U21" id="ref-13U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The edge in the air and the ominous shadow aren’t just vague feelings—they’re connected to a surge in communal violence the same year of that critical mass amnesty, and to a parallel rise in online hate speech.</p>
<p><span>MIDO</span> co-founder and program director Htaike Htaike Aung spoke on the online dynamics she and her colleagues encountered in the early days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike in countries where people gradually got used to the Internet and learnt how to find good content, thus learning what is bad content, for Myanmar this hype went straight up and people did not have the time to reflect on what the Internet is actually about. This perception can be summarized in the phrase:<span></span> <span>“</span>Okay, if it’s on the Internet it must be right”. This really is dangerous, particularly if there are people who are using the Internet for the wrong agenda and propaganda.<a href="#footnote-14U21" id="ref-14U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, Nay Phone Latt explains <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/in-person/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html">what he’s seeing and why he’s worried about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we advocate for free speech, reducing hate speech is included.… Speech calling for hitting or killing someone is hate speech, and can spread hate among people and is a risk for society… It is the wrong use of freedom of speech. I am worried about that because it is not only spreading on social media but also by some writers and [Buddhist] monks who are spreading hate speech publicly. […]</p>
<p>If people hate each other, a place will not be safe to live. I worry about that most for our society. In some places, although they are not fighting, hate exists within their heart because they have poured poison into their heart for a long time [through hate speech]. It can explode in anytime.<a href="#footnote-15U21" id="ref-15U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what were Htaike Htaike Aung and Nay Phone Latt and their colleagues seeing that made them so worried? Here are some Facebook comments from all the way back in 2011, sparked by the <span>BBC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s audacity in…<a href="https://www.newmandala.org/bbc-under-fire-on-rohingyas/">referring to Rohingya people as a ethnic group that exists in Myanmar</a> <em>at all</em>. The <span>BBC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s offending infographic had been up for a year before the <span>BBC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s Burmese Facebook page was flooded with comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kick out all Muslim Kalar [Rohingyas, South Asians/Indians] from Burma. If this doesn’t work, then kill them to death. It’s time for Arakan to unite with each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t assume that I won’t sharpen my knife. I am ready to make it sharp for the sake of protecting our nation, religion and races against those Bengali cheaters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>F@#$-ing Kalar, we will slap your face with shoes and cut your heads. Don’t criticize the god with little of what you know. We will set you on fire to death and turn the mosques into wholesales/retail pork markets…<a href="#footnote-16U21" id="ref-16U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.newmandala.org/bbc-under-fire-on-rohingyas/">New Mandala article</a> about the controversy includes memes mocking <span>BBC</span> journalist Anna Jones using vintage 4chan trollface visuals, if that helps situate things for you.</p>
<p>So this is the landscape already in place <em>before</em> Nay Phone Latt was released from prison in 2012. And things don’t get any better as Facebook/internet adoption spikes.</p>
<p>We know now that behind the scenes, Burmese activists and organizations—and concerned westerners—spent this period desperately trying to get Facebook to act on the rapidly rising surge of anti-Rohingya hate speech. But neither those efforts nor public educational/digital literacy campaigns can keep up with what’s happening online.</p>
<h2 id="the-rohingya">The Rohingya</h2>
<p>I need to make a brief detour, about the Rohingya. Here’s Médicins Sans Frontières, from their <a href="https://www.msf.org/rohingya-refugee-crisis-depth">reference page about the Rohingya refugee crisis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rohingya are a stateless ethnic group, the majority of whom are Muslim, who have lived for centuries in the majority Buddhist&nbsp;Myanmar, mostly in the country’s north, in Rakhine state. However, Myanmar authorities contest this; they claim the Rohingya are Bengali immigrants who came to Myanmar in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Described by the United Nations in 2013 as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world, the Rohingya are denied citizenship under Myanmar law. <a href="#footnote-17U21" id="ref-17U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to overstate how contested those basic facts are within Myanmar itself, where successive governments have rejected any recognition of Rohingya <em>existence</em>, let along legitimacy, referring to them instead as illegal<span></span> <span>“</span>Bengali” immigrants.<a href="#footnote-18U21" id="ref-18U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> (The Rohingya Culture Center in Chicago has published a <a href="https://rccchicago.org/history-of-the-rohingya/">concise timeline of Rohingya history</a>, and it makes a good, quick orientation.<a href="#footnote-19U21" id="ref-19U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Going deeper, things get immediately, bogglingly complicated. My background is inadequate to the task of explaining the entangled ethnic, religious, and political histories of Myanmar in even just Rakhine (formerly Arakan) State, where the Rohingya crisis takes place. What you need to know to understand this series is mostly just that Rohingya people do in fact exist and have long lived under <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/10/08/open-prison-without-end/myanmars-mass-detention-rohingya-rakhine-state">crushing restrictions</a>. Also that Myanmar’s Buddhist political mainstream has long been concerned with racial purity and security. And openly so: the official motto of the Ministry of Immigration and Population is:<span></span> <span>“</span>The&nbsp;earth will not swallow&nbsp;a&nbsp;race&nbsp;to&nbsp;extinction but another race will.”<a href="#footnote-20U21" id="ref-20U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-rumors-and-the-killings-2012">The rumors and the killings (2012)</h2>

<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> Violence against men, women, and children.</p>
<p>On the 28th of May, 2012, a Buddhist Rakhine woman called Ma Thida Htwe is killed in a village in Rakhine State. The next day, a newspaper reports that she was raped and murdered by<span></span> <span>“</span>kalars” and calls the killing<span></span> <span>“</span>the worst homicide case in Myanmar.” Almost immediately, graphic photos of her body begin circulating online. <a href="#footnote-21U21" id="ref-21U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The findings of <span>UN</span> Mission note that although Ma Thida Htwe was clearly murdered, both the rape allegation and ethnic origin of the suspected culprits remain in doubt, and that,<span></span> <span>“</span>In the following days and weeks, it was mainly the rape allegation, more than the murder, which was used to incite violence and hatred against the Rohingya.”<a href="#footnote-22U21" id="ref-22U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>For the people who’ve been working to whip up anti-Rohingya hatred and violence, the crime against Ma Thida Htwe is a perfect opportunity—and they use it, immediately, to suggest that it’s merely the leading edge of a coming wave of attacks by Rohingya terrorists. Four days after Ma Thida Htwe’s death, on June 1st, Zaw Htay, the spokesman of the President of Myanmar, posts a statement on Facebook warning that<span></span> <span>“</span>Rohingya terrorists” are<span></span> <span>“</span>crossing the border into Myanmar with weapons.” He goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t want to hear any humanitarian or human rights excuses. We don’t want to hear your moral superiority, or so-called peace and loving kindness.… Our ethnic people are in constant fear in their own land. I feel very bitter about this. This is our country. This is our land.<a href="#footnote-23U21" id="ref-23U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On June 3rd, five days after the Rakhine woman’s murder, a nationalist Buddhist group hands out leaflets in a village in southern Rakhine State stating that Muslims are assaulting Buddhist women. A bus carrying ten Rohingya men attempts to pass through the village that same day, and the villagers haul the men out, beat them to death, and destroy the bus. A few days later, Rohingya people in a nearby town riot, killing Buddhist villagers and burning homes. <a href="#footnote-24U21" id="ref-24U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.newmandala.org/intolerance-islam-and-the-internet-in-burma-today/">an article published on the academic regional analysis site New Mandala</a> only seven days after the Rohingya men are killed in Rakhine State, Burmese PhD candidate Sai Latt writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What actually triggered public anger? It may have been racial profiling by the ethnic Arakan news agency, Narinjara… When the rape incident took place, the agency published news identifying the accused with their Islamic faith. In its Burmese language news, the incident was presented as if Muslims [read aliens] were threatening local people, and now they have raped and brutally killed a woman. The words—Muslims, Kalar, Islam—were repeatedly used in its news reports. The news spread and people started talking about it in terms of Kalar and<span></span> <span>“</span>Lu Myo Char [i.e.&nbsp;different race/people or alien] insulting our woman”.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Naranjara and Facebook users started talking about the accused rapists as Kalars even when the backgrounds of the accused were still unclear.<a href="#footnote-25U21" id="ref-25U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the wave of military and communal violence that follows, members of both Rakhine (the dominant Buddhist ethnicity in Rakhine State) and Rohingya communities commit murder and arson, but the brunt of the attacks falls on the Rohingya. The <span>UN</span> Mission’s findings describe house-burning, looting,<span></span> <span>“</span>extrajudicial and indiscriminate killings, including of women, children and elderly people,” and the<span></span> <span>“</span>mass arbitrary arrests” and torture of Rohingya people by soldiers and police. More than 100,000 people, most of them Rohinyga, are forced from their homes. <a href="#footnote-26U21" id="ref-26U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The next wave of violence comes in October and shows evidence of coordinated planning. According to Human Rights Watch, the fall attacks were<span></span> <span>“</span>organized, incited, and committed by local Arakanese political party operatives, the Buddhist monkhood, and ordinary Arakanese, at times directly supported by state security forces.” The attacks included mass killings of Rohingya men, women, and children, whose villages and homes were burned to the ground, sometimes in simultaneous attacks across geographically distant communities.</p>
<p>In the worst attack that October, police and soldiers in Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, preemptively confiscate sticks and other rudimentary weapons from Rohingya villagers, then stand by and watch while a Rakhine mob murders at least 70 Rohingya people over the course of a single day.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch reports that 28 children are hacked to death in the attack, including 13 children under the age of 5.<a href="#footnote-27U21" id="ref-27U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="every-spark-is-more-likely-to-turn-into-a-fire">Every spark is more likely to turn into a fire</h2>
<p>According to many of Amnesty International’s interviews with Rohingya refugees, the 2012 episodes of communal violence mark the turning point of Myanmar’s slide into intense anti-Rohingya rhetoric, persecution, and, ultimately, genocide. Mohamed Ayas, a Rohingya schoolteacher and refugee, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We used to live together peacefully alongside the other ethnic groups in Myanmar. Their intentions were good to the Rohingya, but the government was against us. The public used to follow their religious leaders, so when the religious leaders and government started spreading hate speech on Facebook, the minds of the people changed.<a href="#footnote-28U21" id="ref-28U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoDPsIOSM8c">short 2013 documentary</a>, journalist and filmmaker Aela Callan interviews Richard Horsey, a Myanmar-based political analyst with decades of experience in the country and (now, at least) advisor to The International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>Horsey’s take on the situation in Myanmar accords with the Amnesty interviews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen violence in previous decades by Buddhist populations against Muslim populations, but what’s new is that this information is readily available and transmissible. People are using Facebook and mobile phones, and so you get a much greater resonation every time there’s an issue. Every time there’s a spark, it’s much more likely to turn into a fire.<a href="#footnote-29U21" id="ref-29U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>In the months between the June and October waves of violence in Myanmar, dehumanizing and violence-inciting anti-Rohingya messages continue to circulate on Burmese-language Facebook. Western observers who fly in to conduct investigations emphasize town-hall meetings and pamphlets spreading hateful and violent rhetoric, but—while noting that it was also surging online—write off the internet as a major influence on the events because internet access remains unusual in rural Rakhine State.<a href="#footnote-30U21" id="ref-30U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The very early and very strong concerns of Burmese observers and activists I’ve cited above—Htaike Htaike Aung, Nay Phone Latt, and Sai Latt—about hate speech on <em>Facebook specifically</em> suggest to me that it’s possible that western observers may have underestimated the role of secondhand transmission of internet-circulated ideas, including <em>printed copies</em> of internet propaganda, which are cited as a vector in an interview with another <span>MIDO</span> co-founder, Phyu Phyu Thi. (This exact dynamic—the printed internet—shows up in Sheera Frenkel’s <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sheerafrenkel/fake-news-spreads-trump-around-the-world">2016 BuzzFeed News article</a>, which cites<span></span> <span>“</span>print magazines called Facebook and The Internet.”)<a href="#footnote-31U21" id="ref-31U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In any case, online and off, hardline Buddhist monks, members of the government, and what <em>appear</em> to be ordinary people are all echoing a few distinct ideas: They claim that the Rohingya are not a real ethnic group, but illegal<span></span> <span>“</span>Bengali” immigrants; subhuman animals who<span></span> <span>“</span>outbreed” Buddhists; indistinguishable from terrorists; an immediate danger to the sexual purity and safety of Buddhist women and to Buddhist Myanmar as a whole. <a href="#footnote-32U21" id="ref-32U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Sai Latt writes in June 2012 that the anti-Rohingya hate campaign is<span></span> <span>“</span>a public and transnational movement orchestrated openly on social media websites,” which includes thousands of people from the Burmese diaspora:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The campaign is so severe that such comments and postings have been littered on thousands of Facebook walls and pages. Thousands of Burmese-speaking Facebook users are exposed to them every single day. Many Facebook groups such as<span></span> <span>“</span>Kalar Beheading Gang” appeared one after another. While it is possible to report abuse to Facebook, there were few Burmese Muslim Facebook users who would report to Facebook. Even when they did successfully, new groups keep appearing frequently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Facebook Page,<span></span> <span>“</span>Kalar Beheading Gang,” shows up in the international press as well. It features<span></span> <span>“</span>an illustration of a grim reaper with an Islamic symbol on its robe on a blood-spattered background,” and a stream of graphic photos presented as evidence of Rohingya atrocities. By the time the <em>Hindustan Times</em> article goes to press on June 14, 2012, the Page already has more than 500 likes.<a href="#footnote-33U21" id="ref-33U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>When Sai Latt says that what he’s seeing on Facebook is an orchestrated movement, he’s right. Remember Wirathu, the Buddhist monk released in the same amnesty as <span>MIDO</span><span></span><span>’</span>s Nay Phone Latt? Soon after his release from prison, he’s one of the people doing the orchestrating.</p>
<h2 id="a-faster-way-to-spread-the-messages"><span>“</span>A faster way to spread the messages”</h2>
<p><em><span>“</span>We are being raped in every town, being sexually harassed in every town, being ganged up on and bullied in every town.… In every town, there is a crude and savage Muslim majority.” —Wirathu, 2013</em> <em><a href="#footnote-34U21" id="ref-34U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> </em></p>
<p>Ashin Wirathu is very, very good at Facebook. He spoke with BuzzFeed News about his history on the platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Wirathu’s] first account was small, he said, and almost immediately deleted by Facebook moderators who wrote that it violated their community standards. The second had 5,000 friends and grew so quickly he could no longer accept new requests. So he started a new page and hired two full-time employees who now update the site hourly.</p>
<p><span>“</span>I have a Facebook account with 190,000 followers and a news Facebook page. The internet and Facebook are very useful and important to spread my messages,” he said.</p>
<p>On the dozens of Facebook pages he runs out of a dedicated office, Wirathu has called for the boycott of Muslim businesses, and for Muslims to be expelled from Myanmar.<a href="#footnote-35U21" id="ref-35U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvEBaAiy5b4">2013 video interview with the Global Post</a>, Wirathu speaks placidly about the possibility of interfaith problem-solving and multi-ethnic peace—and then, with no transition or change of tone, about Muslims<span></span> <span>“</span>devouring the Burmese people, destroying Buddhist and Buddhist order, forcefully taking action to establish Myanmar as an Islamic country, and forcefully implementing them.” To these absolute fantasies—Muslims make up maybe five percent of Myanmar’s population at this time—Wirathu adds that,<span></span> <span>“</span>Muslims are like the African carp. They breed quickly and they are very violent and they eat their own kind.”<a href="#footnote-36U21" id="ref-36U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2013, <em>Time</em> puts Wirathu on the cover of its international editions as<span></span> <span>“</span><a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2146000,00.html">The Face of Buddhist Terror</a>.” <em>Time</em> reporter Hannah Beech quotes him in the cover story explaining that 90% of Muslims in Myanmar are<span></span> <span>“</span>radical bad people,” and that Barack Obama is<span></span> <span>“</span>tainted by black Muslim blood.“ <a href="#footnote-37U21" id="ref-37U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/time_cover.jpg" alt="Cover of Time's international editions for July 1, 2013. The photo shows Ashin Wirathu, a Burmese man wearing the crimson robe of a Buddhist monk. His head is shaved and his expression is thoughtful. The cover text reads The Face of Buddhist Terror, in progressively large type, and underneath, How militant monks are fueling anti-Muslim violence in Asia, by Hannah Beech."></p>
<p><em>Photo by Adam Dean/Panos</em></p>
<p>It would be hard to overstate Wirathu’s influence in Myanmar during the years leading up to the beginning of the Rohingya genocide. One <span>NGO</span> writes that,<span></span> <span>“</span>It is noteworthy that almost every major outbreak of communal violence since October 2012 in Rakhine state has been preceded by a 969-sponsored preaching tour in the area, usually by [Wirathu] himself.”<a href="#footnote-38U21" id="ref-38U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> In fact, the same thing is true of the 2012 violence, though from a little further away: Wirathu led a rally in Mandalay in September of 2012 in support of a proposal by then-President Thein Sein to deport the Rohingya en masse. The worst of the violence in Rakhine State took place the very next month.<a href="#footnote-39U21" id="ref-39U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>I think it’s useful to note that the 969/Ma Bha Tha movement Wirathu is associated with is also a force for practical and immediate good among Myanmar’s Buddhist majority—they run or support lots of Buddhist religious education for children, legal aid, donation drives, and relief campaigns. And these things, along with the high esteem in which monks are generally held in Myanmar, makes them seem exceptionally credible.<a href="#footnote-40U21" id="ref-40U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Wirathu himself is beloved not only for his incendiary sermons that<span></span> <span>“</span>defend” Buddhism by demonizing Muslims, but also for his direct involvement in community support. If the project of supporting and defending Buddhism is extended to eliminating the Rohingya, maybe those two kinds of action blur. In Callan’s documentary, Wirathu holds office hours to help ordinary community members solve problems and disputes. His attention flicks constantly between the petitioners kneeling in front of him and the smartphone cradled in his hand.</p>
<p>A few years later, Wirathu—by then running a Facebook empire with nearly 200,000 followers, dozens of Pages, and a full-time staff—sums up the situation:<span></span> <span>“</span>If the internet had not come to [Myanmar], not many people would know my opinion and messages like now,” Wirathu told BuzzFeed News, adding that he had always written books and delivered sermons but that the<span></span> <span>“</span>internet is a faster way to spread the messages.” <a href="#footnote-41U21" id="ref-41U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="a-quick-aside">A quick aside</h2>
<p>I don’t want to spend much time on my process, but I do want to make a note about the provenance of a document that would otherwise have unclear sourcing.</p>
<p>Several accounts of Meta’s role in Myanmar’s persecution of the Rohingya include partial lists of the <em>many</em> warnings people on the ground in Burma—and concerned international human-rights watchers—delivered to Meta executives between 2012 and 2018. Taking on the implications of that litany of warnings and missed chances is what first gave me the first taste of the sinking dread that has characterized my experience of this project.</p>
<p>Because of citations in Amnesty International’s big Meta/Myanmar report, I knew there was a<span></span> <span>“</span>briefing deck” floating around somewhere that had more details, but the closest reference I could find led to a dead <span>URL</span> that Archive.org didn’t have, and emailing around didn’t turn anything up.</p>
<p>Eventually, I found a version of it on a French timeline-making site in the form of a <a href="https://time.graphics/fr/line/701589">heavily annotated timeline</a>, and cross-referenced that version with tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/barnyar/status/1575356987529134080">Htaike Htaike Aung</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/riovictoire/status/1575339725333975040">Victoire Rio</a>, the women credited in the Amnesty report with making the deck. The <span>URL</span> they link to in the tweets is the dead one, but the preview image in their tweets is an exact match for the timeline I found. I cite this timeline a lot below.</p>
<h2 id="the-warnings">The warnings</h2>
<p><a href="https://time.graphics/fr/line/701589"><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/rohingya_and_facebook.png" alt="The timeline showing Burmese civil-society and digital-rights leaders' attempts to warn Meta about what it was enabling in Myanmar."></a></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of the timeline discussed above.</em></p>
<p>All the way back in <strong>November of 2012</strong>, <strong>Htaike Htaike Aung</strong>, <span>MIDO</span><span></span><span>’</span>s program director, speaks with Meta’s Director of Global Public Policy and Policy Director for Europe about the proliferation of hate speech on Facebook at a roundtable in Azerbaijan. Eleven months later, in <strong>October 2013</strong>, <strong>Htaike Htaike Aung</strong> brings up her concerns again in the context of<span></span> <span>“</span>rising inter-communal tensions” at a roundtable discussion in Indonesia attended by three Meta policy executives including the Director of Global Public Policy.<a href="#footnote-42U21" id="ref-42U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, activists and researchers from <span>MIDO</span> and Yangon-based tech-accelerator Phandeeyar<span></span> <span>“</span>followed up over email to ask for ways to get Facebook to review problematic content and address emergency escalations.” Facebook didn’t respond. <span>MIDO</span> and Phandeeyar staff start doing<span></span> <span>“</span>targeted research on hate speech.”<a href="#footnote-43U21" id="ref-43U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In <strong>November of 2013</strong>, <strong>Aela Callan</strong> (whose documentary work I’ve cited) meets with Facebook’s <span>VP</span> of Communications and Public Policy, Eliot Schrage, to warn about anti-Rohingya hate speech—and the fake accounts promoting it—on Facebook.<a href="#footnote-44U21" id="ref-44U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> After her visit, Meta puts Callan in touch with <a href="http://internet.org/">Internet.org</a>—the global initiative that would eventually cement Facebook’s hegemony in Myanmar, among other places—and with Facebook’s bullying-focused<span></span> <span>“</span>Compassion Team,” but not with anyone inside Facebook who could actually help.<a href="#footnote-45U21" id="ref-45U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 2014, four months before deadly, Facebook-juiced riots break out in Mandalay, <strong>Htaike Htaike Aung</strong> travels to Menlo Park <em>with</em> <strong>Aela Callan</strong> after <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/past-events/silicon-valley-2014/#:~:text=RightsCon%20Silicon%20Valley%202014%20was,to%20check%20out%20the%20Outcomes.">RightsCon Silicon Valley</a>. The two women met with members of Meta’s Compassion Team to try once again to get Facebook to pay attention to the threat its service poses in Myanmar. <a href="#footnote-46U21" id="ref-46U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In the same month, <strong>Susan Benesch</strong>, head of the <a href="https://dangerousspeech.org/">Dangerous Speech Project</a>, coordinates a briefing call for Meta, attended by half a dozen Meta employees, including Arturo Bejar, head of engineering at Facebook.</p>
<p>On the call, <strong>Matt Schissler</strong>, a Myanmar-based human-rights specialist, delivers a grim assessment describing dehumanizing messages, faked photos, and misinformation spreading on Facebook. In <em>An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination</em>, their 2021 book about Facebook’s dysfunction, reporters Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang describe Schissler’s presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of the meeting, Schissler gave a stark recounting of how Facebook was hosting dangerous Islamophobia. He detailed the dehumanizing and disturbing language people were using in posts and the doctored photos and misinformation being spread widely.<a href="#footnote-47U21" id="ref-47U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reuters notes that one of the examples Schissler gives Meta was a Burmese Facebook Page called,<span></span> <span>“</span>We will genocide all of the Muslims and feed them to the dogs.” <a href="#footnote-48U21" id="ref-48U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>None of this seems to get through to the Meta employees on the line, who are interested in…cyberbullying. Frenkel and Kang write that the Meta employees on the call<span></span> <span>“</span>believed that the same set of tools they used to stop a high school senior from intimidating an incoming freshman could be used to stop Buddhist monks in Myanmar.”<a href="#footnote-49U21" id="ref-49U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Aela Callan later tells <em>Wired</em> that hate speech seemed to be a<span></span> <span>“</span>low priority” for Facebook, and that the situation in Myanmar,<span></span> <span>“</span>was seen as a connectivity opportunity rather than a big pressing problem.”<a href="#footnote-50U21" id="ref-50U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Then comes Mandalay.</p>
<h2 id="facebook-said-nothing"><span>“</span>Facebook said nothing”</h2>
<p>I don’t have space to tell the whole story of the 2014 Mandalay violence here—<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-facebooks-rise-fueled-chaos-and-confusion-in-myanmar/">Timothy McLaughlin’s <em>Wired</em> article</a> is good on it—but it has all the elements civil society watchdogs have been worried about: Two innocent Muslim men are falsely accused of raping a Buddhist woman, sensationalist news coverage explodes, and Ashin Wirathu exploits the story to further his cause. Riots break out, and all kinds of wild shit starts circulating on Facebook.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of situation Htaike Htaike Aung, Callan, Schissler, and others had been warning Meta could happen—but when it actually arrives, no one at Meta picks up the phone.</p>
<p>As the violence in Mandalay worsens, the head of Deloitte in Myanmar gets an urgent call. Zaw Htay, the official spokesman of Myanmar’s president, needs help reaching Meta. The Deloitte executive works into the night trying to get someone to respond, but never gets through. On the third day of rioting, the government gets tired of waiting and blocks access to Facebook in Mandalay. The block works—the riots died down. And the Deloitte guy’s inbox suddenly fills with emails from Meta staffers wanting to know why Facebook has been blocked.<a href="#footnote-51U21" id="ref-51U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The government wasn’t the only group trying to get through. A few months before, a handful of Facebook employees—including members of policy, legal, and comms teams—had formed a private Facebook group, to allow some of the civil-society experts from Myanmar to flag problems to Facebook staff directly.</p>
<p>With false reports and calls to violence beginning to spread on Facebook in Mandalay, Burmese activists and westerners in the private group try to alert Facebook. They get no response, even after the violence turns deadly. A member of the group later tells Frenkel and Kang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it came to answering our messages about the riots, Facebook said nothing. When it came to the internet being shut down, and people losing Facebook, suddenly, they are returning messages right away. It showed where their priorities are.<a href="#footnote-52U21" id="ref-52U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of weeks after the violence in Mandalay in 2014, Facebook’s Director of Policy for the Asia-Pacific region, Mia Garlick, travels to Myanmar for the first time. In a panel discussion, Garlick discusses Meta’s policies and promises to…speed up the translation of Facebook’s Community Standards (its basic content rules) into Burmese. That single piece of translation work—Facebook’s main offering in response to internationally significant ethnic violence about which the company has been warned for two years—takes Meta fourteen months to accomplish and relies, in the end, on the Phandeeyar folks in the private Facebook group.<a href="#footnote-53U21" id="ref-53U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Also in 2014, Meta agrees to localize their reporting tool for hate speech and other objectionable content. Meta employees work with <span>MIDO</span> and other Burmese civil-society people to translate and fine-tune the tool, and they launch it by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>There’s just one problem: As the Burmese civil society people in the private Facebook group finally learn, Facebook has <em>a single Burmese-speaking moderator</em>—a contractor based in Dublin—to review everything that comes in. The Burmese-language reporting tool is, as Htaike Htaike Aung and Victoire Rio put it in their timeline,<span></span> <span>“</span>a road to nowhere.”<a href="#footnote-54U21" id="ref-54U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="yet-more-warnings">Yet more warnings</h2>
<p>Heading into 2015, the warnings keep coming:</p>
<p><strong>February 2015:</strong> <strong>Susan Benesch</strong>, founder and director of the <a href="https://dangerousspeech.org/">Dangerous Speech Project</a> at the Berkman Klein Center (that’s the Berkman Center as was, for my fellow olds) gives a presentation called<span></span> <span>“</span>The Dangerous Side of Language” during <em>Compassion Day</em> at Facebook. According to <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3596&amp;context=historical">this legal filing</a> for a class-action suit against Meta on behalf of the Rohingya, the presentation explains<span></span> <span>“</span>how anti-Rohingya speech is being disseminated by Facebook.”<a href="#footnote-55U21" id="ref-55U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>March 2015:</strong> <strong>Matt Schissler</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate/">travels to Menlo Park</a> to meet with Facebook employees in person. Reuters reports that he<span></span> <span>“</span>gave a talk at Facebook’s California headquarters about new media, particularly Facebook, and anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. More than a dozen Facebook employees attended, he said.” Frenkel and Kang describe his presentation as documenting<span></span> <span>“</span>the seriousness of what was happening in Myanmar: hate speech on Facebook was leading to real-world violence in the country, and it was getting people killed.”<a href="#footnote-56U21" id="ref-56U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>After his meeting at Meta, Schissler has lunch with a few Meta employees, and one of them asked Schissler if he thought Facebook could contribute to a genocide in Myanmar, to which Schissler responded,<span></span> <span>“</span>Absolutely.” Afterwards, Schissler tells Frenkel and Kang, one Facebook employee loudly remarks,<span></span> <span>“</span>He can’t be serious. That’s just not possible.”<a href="#footnote-57U21" id="ref-57U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>May 2015:</strong> Another expert comes to Menlo Park to warn Facebook about the dangerous dynamics it was feeding in Myanmar: <strong>David Madden</strong>, founder of Phandeeyar, the technology accelerator in Myanmar. In an interview with Amnesty International, Madden reported that<span></span> <span>“</span>those of us who were working on these issues in Myanmar had a sense that people in Facebook didn’t appreciate the nature of the political situation in the country.”<a href="#footnote-58U21" id="ref-58U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>In his meeting with Meta, Madden discusses specific examples of dangerous content and drew a direct analogy between radio news in Rwanda and Meta’s role in Myanmar,<span></span> <span>“</span>meaning it would be the platform through which hate speech was spread and incitements to violence were made.”<a href="#footnote-59U21" id="ref-59U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>September 2015:</strong> Mia Garlick, Facebook’s Director of Public Policy, Asia-Pacific, comes to Myanmar to <em>finally</em> launch Facebook’s Burmese-language Community Standards. Phandeeyar puts together a group of<span></span> <span>“</span>15+ civil-society leaders from across Myanmar” to brief Garlick<span></span> <span>“</span>on specific incidents and actors.”<a href="#footnote-60U21" id="ref-60U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with Amnesty International, <strong>Victoire Rio</strong> reports that several of these leaders specifically tell Garlick that Facebook’s Community Standards aren’t being enforced in Myanmar.<a href="#footnote-61U21" id="ref-61U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Which, of course they aren’t: Reuters reports that in 2015, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate/">Facebook employed a total of two (2) Burmese-speaking moderators</a>, expanding to four (4) by the year’s end.<a href="#footnote-62U21" id="ref-62U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<hr>
<p>To sum up a little bit, by the end of 2015, Meta knew—as much as any organization can be said to <em>know</em>—that both international civil society experts <em>and the government of Myanmar</em> believe Facebook had a significant role in the 2014 Mandalay riots.</p>
<p>And they’d been warned, over and over, that multiple dedicated civil-society and human-rights organizations believed that Facebook was worsening ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>They’d been shown example after example of dehumanizing posts and comments calling for mass murder, even explicitly calling for genocide. And David Madden had told Meta staff to their faces that <em>Facebook might well play the role in Myanmar that radio played in Rwanda</em>. Nothing was subtle.</p>
<p>After all that, Meta decided not to dramatically scale up moderation capacity, to permanently ban the known worst actors, or to make fundamental product-design changes to reliably deviralize posts inciting hatred and violence.</p>
<p>Instead, in 2016, it was time to <em>get way more people in Myanmar onto Facebook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That’s next, in Part <span>II</span>: The Crisis.</strong></p>

<p dir="auto">Insomnium is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnia">Kong/Insomnia at 2023.5.8</a>, the last commit before compulsory account login was introduced. In a sense, Insomnium is a community response to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37680522" rel="nofollow">the latest product update that forces account creation w/o warning</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">I was among the users who were deeply affected by the recent change. I still think Insomnia is a nice product in general, but I have to disagree with the direction it is going. So I have decided to fork it and make it 100% local and privacy-focus.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-roadmap" dir="auto"><a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">I have removed user login, tracking, analytics, etc, from Insomnia so it is now a 100% local app. I will be cleaning up the code to make the UI faster, and refactor the local database and config to keep everything lean. If you have any feature request or encountered any bug, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium/issues">open an issue</a>. Thanks!</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm also working on a Code Llama plugin for Insomnium to make it more easily customizable and extensible, while keeping the core product fast and 100% local.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Recent advances in generative imagery have brought forth outpainting 
            and inpainting models that can produce high-quality, plausible image 
            content in unknown regions, but the content these models hallucinate is 
            necessarily inauthentic, since the models lack sufficient context about 
            the true scene. In this work, we propose <strong><em>RealFill</em></strong>, a novel 
            generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions 
            of an image with the content that <u><em>should have been there</em></u>. 
            RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using 
            only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not 
            have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically 
            varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. 
            Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually 
            compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. 
            We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set 
            of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing 
            approaches by a large margin. 
          </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
  </p>
  <div>
          <p> 
            <strong>Authentic Image Completion</strong>: 
            Given a few reference images (up to five) and one target image that 
            captures roughly the same scene (but in a different arrangement or appearance), 
            we aim to fill missing regions of the target image with high-quality image 
            content that is faithful to the originally captured scene. Note that 
            for the sake of practical benefit, we focus particularly on the 
            more challenging, unconstrained setting in which the target 
            and reference images may have very different viewpoints, 
            environmental conditions, camera apertures, image styles, or even moving objects.
          </p>
          <p>  
            <strong>RealFill</strong>:
            For a given scene, we first create a personalized generative model by fine-tuning 
            a pre-trained inpainting diffusion model on the reference and target images. 
            This fine-tuning process is designed such that the adapted model not only 
            maintains a good image prior, but also learns the contents, lighting, 
            and style of the scene in the input images. We then use this fine-tuned model to 
            fill the missing regions in the target image through a standard diffusion sampling process.
          </p>
      </div>

    <h2>Results</h2>
  </p>
  <div>
        <p> 
            Given the reference images on the left, RealFill is able to either uncrop or inpaint 
            the target image on the right, resulting in high-quality images that are 
            both visually compelling and also faithful to the references, 
            even when there are large differences between references and targets including 
            viewpoint, aperture, lighting, image style, and object motion.

    <h2>Comparison with Baselines</h2>

            A comparison of RealFill and baseline methods. 
            Transparent white masks are overlayed on the 
            unaltered known regions of the target images.
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                Paint-by-Example does not achieve high scene fidelity because it 
                relies on CLIP embeddings, which only capture high-level semantic information.
              </li> 
              <li>
                Stable Diffusion Inpainting produces plausible results, 
                they are inconsistent with the reference images because 
                prompts have limited expressiveness.
              </li> 
            </ul><p>
            In contrast, RealFill generates high-quality results that have high 
            fidelity with respect to the reference images.

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
        
        <div>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              RealFill needs to go through a gradient-based fine-tuning process 
              on input images, rendering it relatively slow.
            </li>

            <li>
              When viewpoint change between reference and target images is very large, 
              RealFill tends to fail at recovering the 3D scene, especially when 
              there is only a single reference image.
            </li>

            <li>
              Because RealFill mainly relies on the image prior inherited from the 
              base pre-trained model, it also fails to handle cases where that are 
              challenging for the base model, such as text for Stable Diffusion.
            </li>
          </ul>
